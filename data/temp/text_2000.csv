Well, it’s not looking good. Mr. Monti’s party appears likely to come in fourth; not only is he running well behind the essentially comical Silvio Berlusconi, he’s running behind an actual comedian, Beppe Grillo, whose lack of a coherent platform hasn’t stopped him from becoming a powerful political force.

It’s an extraordinary prospect, and one that has sparked much commentary about Italian political culture. But without trying to defend the politics of bunga bunga, let me ask the obvious question: What good, exactly, has what currently passes for mature realism done in Italy or for that matter Europe as a whole?

For Mr. Monti was, in effect, the proconsul installed by Germany to enforce fiscal austerity on an already ailing economy; willingness to pursue austerity without limit is what defines respectability in European policy circles. This would be fine if austerity policies actually worked — but they don’t. And far from seeming either mature or realistic, the advocates of austerity are sounding increasingly petulant and delusional."
http://news.yahoo.com/crowd-mccain-town-hall-opposes-syria-action-005233144.html,,[],Crowd at McCain town hall opposes Syria action,"PHOENIX (AP) — U.S. Sen. John McCain faced a tough crowd largely opposed to military action in Syria during a town hall meeting Thursday in Phoenix.

The Republican senator repeatedly told about 150 constituents at the morning meeting that there would be no plans to send U.S. troops to retaliate for the chemical weapons attack last month near Damascus.

""I want to begin by saying to you I am unalterably opposed to having a single American boot on the ground in Syria,"" McCain said. ""The American people wouldn't stand for it.

""Second of all, it would not be anything but counterproductive to do that. American blood and treasure is too precious to do that.""

McCain had planned to talk about immigration and other issues at the gathering at a public library, but Syria dominated the conversation. He was interrupted from the start by someone shouting that his response on the topic wasn't good enough.

A few people held up signs from their seats with messages such as ""Don't bomb Syria"" and ""Security thru peace.""

McCain told the audience the American public soon would see irrefutable evidence that Syrian President Bashar Assad was behind the deadly Aug. 21 attack.

""If we open the door to the use of chemical weapons and let it go unresponded to, then I think that sends a signal to other people that want to use them, that they can do so with impunity,"" McCain said.

The town hall meeting was one of two planned for Thursday, with the other taking place in Tucson. McCain also is holding a town hall Friday in Prescott.

The gatherings come as President Barack Obama is requesting speedy congressional backing of a military strike in Syria.

The Obama administration blames Assad for the sarin-gas attack in a rebel-held suburb of Damascus. Obama says more than 1,400 civilians died, including at least 400 children. Other casualty estimates are lower, however, and the Syrian government denies responsibility, contending rebels fighting to topple the government are to blame.

Despite widespread condemnation of the attack from allies, few countries are likely to join the U.S. in undertaking military action if Obama moves forward with a strike."

It comes as China aggressively engages the continent

U.S. President Barack Obama pledged $7 billion Sunday to help combat frequent power blackouts in sub-Saharan Africa.

Funds from the initiative, dubbed Power Africa, will be distributed over the next five years. Obama made the announcement during his trip to South Africa , the continent's biggest economy.

""Access to electricity is fundamental to opportunity in this age. It's the light that children study by, the energy that allows an idea to be transformed into a real business. It's the lifeline for families to meet their most basic needs, and it's the connection that's needed to plug Africa into the grid of the global economy,"" he said.

Two-thirds of the population of sub-Saharan Africa lacks access to electricity, including more than 85% of those living in rural areas, the White House said.

""A light where currently there is darkness -- the energy to lift people out of poverty -- that's what opportunity looks like,"" Obama told students at Cape Town University. ""So this is America's vision: a partnership with Africa for growth, and the potential for every citizen, not just a few at the top.""

The program includes $1.5 billion from the U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation and $5 billion from the Export-Import Bank, the White House said. Sub-Saharan Africa will need more than $300 billion to achieve universal electricity access by 2030, it said.

The preliminary setup will include Ethiopia, Kenya, Liberia, Nigeria, Tanzania, Uganda and Mozambique.

""These countries have set ambitious goals in electric power generation, and are making the utility and energy sector reforms to pave the way for investment and growth,"" a White House statement said.

Obama's three-nation African trip started in Senegal and will end in Tanzania this week. The visit aims to bolster U.S. investment opportunities, address development issues such as food security and health, and promote democracy.

It comes as China aggressively engages the continent, pouring billions of dollars into it and replacing the United States as Africa's largest trading partner.

Obama applauded China's investment in Africa, saying he is ""not threatened by it.""

Africa's greater integration into the global economy will benefit everyone with the potential creation of new jobs and opportunities, he said.

""I'm here because I think the United States needs to engage with a continent full of promise and possibility,"" Obama said. ""It's good for the United States. I welcome the attention that Africa is receiving from China, Brazil, India and Turkey.""

However, he urged African officials to ensure that those who invest in the continent and its natural resources benefit Africans in terms of jobs and other assets.

Obama also visited Robben Island , where anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela spent a majority of his 27-year imprisonment, on Sunday. And he spoke at Cape Town University, the site of a famous speech by Robert F. Kennedy at the height of apartheid in 1966.

Obama heads next to Tanzania, where he is scheduled to attend events until Tuesday."

Editor’s Note: David Frum, a CNN contributor, is a contributing editor at Newsweek and The Daily Beast. He is the author of eight books, including a new novel, “Patriots,” and a post-election e-book, “Why Romney Lost.” Frum was a special assistant to President George W. Bush from 2001 to 2002.

(CNN) —

A decade ago, Britain’s Labor government was badly divided over whether to join the Euro. The prime minister strongly supported the idea, as did much of the British business community and many leading media voices. One of the proponents’ most effective tactics was to ridicule opponents as cranky and xenophobic – even borderline racist.

Here for example is a correspondent for the Guardian deriding some of them, members of the U.K. Independence Party (Ukip), back, in 2004.

“In the pub I encounter Reg Mahrra, an Indian Ukipper . ‘I want out of Europe,’ he says. ‘Europe is a disease.’ “

Chuck Kennedy David Frum

That’s hardly an argument to take seriously.

Only … the Euro opponents were totally right. Right for the wrong reasons, but still right.

It’s human nature to assess difficult questions, not on the merits, but on our feelings about the different “teams” that form around different answers. To cite a painful personal experience: During the decision-making about the Iraq war, I was powerfully swayed by the fact that the proposed invasion of Iraq was supported by those who had been most right about the Cold War – and was most bitterly opposed by those who had been wrongest about the Cold War.

Yet in the end, it is not teams that matter. It is results. As Queen Victoria’s first prime minister bitterly quipped after a policy fiasco: “What wise men had promised has not happened. What the damned fools predicted has actually come to pass.”

Which brings us to the uproar over the Heritage Foundation’s study of the fiscal effects of immigration – and the revelation that one of the study’s coauthors wrote a Ph.D. dissertation asserting large and enduring differences in intelligence between different ethnic and racial groups.

Heritage is a powerful conservative think tank in Washington, very influential on Capitol Hill. On May 6, Heritage released a study of the likely budget effects of the Senate plan to open a “pathway to citizenship” for the 10+ million people who live in the United States in violation of the nation’s immigration laws.

The study found that the plan would add $6.3 trillion to the nation’s budget deficits over the next 50 years.

That conclusion ignited a huge controversy. Still, even the fiercest critics had to concede the basic validity of Heritage’s claim. In the words of Keith Hennessey, formerly director of the National Economic Council under President George W. Bush and an ardent supporter of the “pathway to citizenship”: “I expect making 8-9 million people here illegally into U.S. citizens would increase future deficits once these people are eligible for benefits.”

The pathway to citizenship will add to deficits because of these basic demographic facts about the illegal population: It is very large and it is very low-skilled. As is, the immigrant population in the United States earns less and depends more on government benefits than the native-born population. As formerly illegal residents gain access to more benefits, that dependency can only rise.

Perhaps the ultimate cost of legalization will be less than Heritage estimated: $4 trillion, say. Conceivably, the cost could be even higher. But it will be a cost, and it will be large – nobody can gainsay that.

Instead, critics respond with a non-sequitur: never mind the effects on government budgets, look instead at immigration’s impact on the overall economy. The trouble for them, however, is that every reputable study – headed by the most exhaustive of them all, the 1997 National Academy of Science study – finds that the economic benefits of immigration are very small, fractions of a penny for each dollar of national income, with the largest share of those benefits captured by the immigrants themselves.

But it’s a basic rule of politics: If you can’t disprove the message, you try to discredit the messenger.

And one of Heritage’s messengers sure enough proved discreditable. While work on the Heritage study was led by that think tank’s welfare expert, Bob Rector, the heavy number-crunching was done by a recent Harvard Ph.D., Jason Richwine. Richwine believes in a racial hierarchy of intelligence, with Jews and East Asians at the top and blacks at the bottom.

Richwine has expressed that opinion in a number of places, including at a 2008 panel discussion at the American Enterprise Institute. I happened to be the moderator of that panel. I hadn’t met Richwine before, and this discussion was my first introduction to his work. Afterward, I asked him to come to my office for a talk. I told him then that he faced a choice: He could be a serious scholar of immigration – or he could play in the fever swamps, but not both. Obviously, he did not heed my advice. Shortly after, he left AEI to find employment at Heritage.

U.S. immigration policy has long been sullied by racial prejudice: the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, the 1907 deal with Japan to stop migration from that country, the immigration acts of 1921 and 1924 that sought to halt migration of all groups except Northwest Europeans. It’s a shameful story, and the Richwine episode scratches at those painful national wounds.

But it’s also true that math is math. We know how much low-skilled legal immigrants earn. We know how much government assistance legal immigrant households use. We can make projections about the likely budget costs of enrolling 10+ million formerly illegal residents as legal ones.

Maybe Richwine did his math wrong. If he did it wrong, it would remain wrong even if he spent his leisure hours rescuing orphans from burning buildings. Maybe he did his math right. Then it would remain right even if he moonlighted as Grand Imperial Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan.

Yet what is especially strange about the Richwine incident is this:

The people who will lose most by the Senate’s immigration plan are precisely American citizens of minority origin. Blacks and Hispanics are more likely to be unemployed than whites. More ominously, they are more likely to be numbered among the long-term unemployed – people who have been out of work six months or more. The long-term unemployed face an especially difficult path back to the labor market. The New York Times reports:

“Though businesses are reluctant to acknowledge bias in their hiring practices, some human-resource managers and consultants say privately that unemployment can be a red flag on a résumé, signaling that a worker may have outdated skills, or may be a short-timer who is desperate enough to take any work now but will leave when something better comes along. The National Employment Law Project, a nonprofit advocacy group, reported that companies across the country often posted job notices explicitly excluding applicants who are unemployed.

“Such discrimination against the unemployed is becoming more widespread as jobs are in short supply and employers can have their pick of applicants, according to labor and community leaders. They say it has created a blacklist of the unemployed, many of whom were laid off in recession-driven downsizing rather than because of performance issues.

“In New York City, on average, 372,000 people were unemployed in 2012, 38 percent for a year or longer, according to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics. Blacks and Hispanics accounted for disproportionately large shares of the long-term unemployed.”

There’s only one way to prod employers to hire the long-term unemployed: super-tight labor markets. In the late 1990s, when the unemployment rate tumbled to the lowest levels since the mid-1960s, employers became interested in categories of workers they usually rejected: former welfare recipients, the disabled, and so on. In the late 1990s, the black-white wage differential closed at the fastest rate since the civil rights era.

The Great Recession has hit almost all Americans hard. But – no surprise – mass unemployment has had its worst effect on the poorest and most marginal. A 2013 study by the Urban Institute found that before the recession, the typical white family had four times the wealth of the typical black family. Since the recession, the gap has widened to six-to-one.

The only thing that can close this gap is to tighten the labor market. And yet the Senate plan is a plan to slacken labor markets, and keep them slack for decades. That’s not a bug. That’s a feature. Not only will the plan legalize the formerly illegal, but it will hugely increase future immigration flows of both permanent and temporary workers: agriculture workers, technology workers, even ski instructors.

The labor market is subject to the same laws of supply and demand as any other market. If supply is dramatically increased at a time when demand is already low, expect wages to steeply fall. That’s not an unintended effect of the immigration bill. It’s the intended effect.

America’s legacy of racial oppression casts a long shadow. That legacy is not yet anywhere close to overcome. Yet it’s more than a little astonishing that the proponents of the Senate immigration bill would claim the banner of anti-racism to justify a measure that will deepen and prolong the subordination of those American ethnic groups already most deeply subordinated.

Interim mayor took over from ex-mayor who resigned amid corruption allegations

Charges against interim Mayor Michael Appelbaum stem from real estate projects

Applebaum has repeatedly denied that he did anything wrong

MONTREAL (AP) — Montreal's interim mayor, who vowed to clean up the corruption scandals rocking the city, now faces fraud charges himself.

Michael Applebaum faces 14 charges, including defrauding the government and corruption in municipal affairs. He was arrested at his home early Monday.

Applebaum took over as interim mayor of Canada's second-largest city last November, after former mayor Gerald Tremblay resigned amid corruption allegations.

""The corruption and collusion will no longer be tolerated,"" Robert Lafreniere, the head of Quebec's anti-corruption unit, told a news conference Monday.

""No one is above the law and you cannot hide from the law.""

Applebaum, 50, is the latest in a long list of Quebec politicians and businesses to come under scrutiny in recent months.

The province is enduring a high-profile public inquiry that has uncovered links between the construction industry and organized crime.

The charges against Applebaum stem from alleged acts that occurred before he became mayor. While officials offered few details, they said the charges relate to real estate projects between 2006 and 2011, when he served as borough mayor.

Now, local politicians and Quebec's provincial government are calling on Applebaum to step down.

Jean-François Lisee, the provincial cabinet minister responsible for the city, told reporters Monday Applebaum should do ""the responsible thing"" for the good of the city.

Denis Coderre, a longtime federal politician and a mayoral candidate in the fall election, said Montrealers shouldn't get too discouraged.

""The rotten apples, they'll be taken out,"" he told reporters. ""But we can't put everyone in the same basket.""

Applebaum had promised not to run in the upcoming election, slated for this November. But his appointment was enough to make history: he became the first Anglophone mayor of the city in exactly 100 years.

Signs of trouble arrived soon afterward.

Anti-corruption officials raided City Hall last February. They also targeted offices in various boroughs, including the one Applebaum represented for many years.

Applebaum has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.

His arrest comes just a month after Gilles Vaillancourt, the former longtime mayor of neighboring Laval, was arrested on corruption charges.

The provincial police allege that Vaillancourt's city government was essentially a criminal organization, with officials there allegedly enriching themselves off local construction deals.

The situation was so bad that the Quebec government placed Laval under trusteeship.

Quebec Premier Pauline Marois said that step won't be required in Montreal.

Responding to a reporter's question about whether Applebaum should step down, Marois said ""I don't think he really has a choice.""

Danielle Pilette, a political scientist at the Universite de Quebec a Montreal, said Applebaum's arrest is further evidence of how deep the city's corruption problem goes.

""It shows that these corruption allegations are not only in the outer suburbs, as we've seen before, but also in the heart of the city,"" Pilette said, referring to Applebaum's central borough of Cote-des-Neiges-NDG.

In the neighboring province of Ontario, Toronto Mayor Rob Ford is embroiled is his own scandal, amid allegations that the leader of Canada's largest city appeared in a video smoking crack cocaine. The video has not been released publicly."

Not clear what Schmidt hopes to accomplish in North Korea

Visit not seen as 'helpful' by State Department

LONDON -- Google chairman Eric Schmidt arrived in North Korea on Monday for what his delegation called a private visit aimed at gaining a first-hand look at the communist nation's economy and social media.

Schmidt is visiting the East Asia nation with former New Mexico governor Bill Richardson, who is a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.

Speaking in Beijing ahead of the flight to Pyongyang, Richardson described the visit as ""a private humanitarian mission."" The former governor, who has visited North Korea several times over the past 20 years, is expected to try to discuss the case of a U.S. citizen jailed in the country.

But Schmidt's participation in the trip is seen as more controversial and he has drawn criticism from some quarters, including the U.S. State Department, because the visit comes only weeks after North Korea launched a long-range rocket. The visit has also prompted speculation about what the businessman hopes to accomplish in the reclusive nation.

""We don't think the timing of the visit is helpful, and they are well aware of our views,"" State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said.

When Richardson and Schmidt return, State Department officials may be interested in talking to them about the visit, Nuland said. ""We are always open to hear from Americans who've been to North Korea,"" she said.

Schmidt, a staunch proponent of Internet connectivity and openness, is expected to make a donation during the visit, while Richardson will try to discuss the detainment of a U.S. citizen jailed in Pyongyang, the Associated Press reported, citing members of the delegation who asked not to be named because the trip was a private visit.

In Beijing, Richardson said, ""This is not a Google trip, but I'm sure he's [Schmidt] interested in some of the economic issues there, the social media aspect. So this is why we are teamed up on this.""

Jared Cohen, director of Google Ideas, is also on the trip.

That’s what President Obama thinks the criticism of his zigzag Syria policy amounts to?

As presidential spin, this is insulting. As presidential conviction — if this is what he really believes — it’s scary.

Obama’s dismissive remarks came in response to a question from ABC’s George Stephanopoulos, who asked the president about criticisms of his approach as ad hoc, improvised and unsteady.

“Folks here in Washington like to grade on style,” Obama sniffed. “And so had we rolled out something that was very smooth and disciplined and linear, they would have graded it well, even if it was a disastrous policy. We know that, ’cause that’s exactly how they graded the Iraq war until it ended up blowing [up] in our face.”

Indeed, Obama portrayed capital insiders’ scorn as a badge of honor. “What it says is that I’m less concerned about style points; I’m much more concerned about getting the policy right,” he continued, taking credit for Syria having acknowledged its possession of chemical weapons and agreeing to put them under international control. “That’s my goal,” he said. “And if that goal is achieved, then it sounds to me like we did something right.”

See? All’s well that ends well. Let the judges carp about whether the administration stuck the landing.

Except that this self-serving account omits two important facts. First, we’re a long way from knowing that this episode has ended well. No one can rely on Russian promises and Syrian good will. This may well be a bullet only temporarily dodged, a pause in the crisis rather than a signpost of its solution. Even a successful outcome of a chemical-weapons deal risks the perverse impact of further entrenching a regime that has murdered tens of thousands of its own people.

Second, presidential actions have ripples beyond ripples. Obama may have lucked — or his secretary of state accidentally may have stumbled — into an approach that averted “The Perils of Pauline” moment. But the indecision, the mind-changing, the lurching — and, note, Obama did not dispute such characterizations so much as dismiss them — have consequences.

“Style,” as the president would have it, matters. Adversaries and allies, foreign and domestic, take a measure of the president’s steel. They judge whether he can be trusted, whether he will back down, whether he has what it takes to lead his country and the world. In the past few weeks, I have encountered not a single person outside the White House, Republican or Democrat, who has kind words for Obama’s performance. Scornful may not be too strong a word for the consensus view, though it is scorn leavened, at least among the more thoughtful critics, with appreciation for the no-good-options reality of Syria.

This attitude is especially important because it arrives at such a dangerous moment for the country, with looming deadlines on government funding and the debt ceiling, and because it is amplified by presidential mishandling of other matters.

Obama’s dawdling and eventual capitulation on Larry Summers, his reported first choice for chairman of the Federal Reserve, further reinforce the perception of the president as weak and indecisive. Given the other matters on the presidential agenda, it may not have made sense to launch a fight, this one with his supposed allies, over Summers. But once again, Obama made the situation worse by allowing it to fester for so long, and for the opposition to Summers to build.

So Obama enters yet another treacherous period in a weakened state, with his political allies distrustful and his political opponents caught up in their own dysfunction. Machiavelli advised that it is better to be feared than loved; at the moment, in Congress, Obama is neither.

The fast-approaching deadlines — the government runs out of money Oct. 1, out of borrowing authority Oct. 18 — arrive at a time when would-be responsible Republicans, chief among them House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio, cannot control the lunatics in their caucus. This group is so consumed with distrust of government and hatred of Obamacare that it is willing to risk the full faith and credit of the United States.

“The anarchists have taken over,” Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada said last week. “They’ve taken over the House; now they’re here in the Senate.”

Boehner’s angling to avoid a shutdown and instead use the debt ceiling for maximum leverage. Obama, having previously blinked, says he’s done with that: No more negotiating on the debt ceiling. Is it any wonder that there are doubters?

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/18/immigration-bill-opposition_n_3109770.html,2013-04-18 00:00:00,"['Senior Political Correspondent', 'Yahoo']",Immigration Bill Opposition Building Among Conservatives,"WASHINGTON -- The limits of Marco Rubio's persuasive powers and charm, and the depth of conservative reservations about immigration reform, are beginning to show themselves.

Rubio, the Republican Florida senator who is spearheading outreach to the Republican base and to conservative talk radio hosts, was unable to persuade one of the top radio figures on the right to support the Senate's immigration reform effort when he appeared on The Mark Levin Show Wednesday night.

Levin, a former Reagan administration official, was pleasant and polite with Rubio during his 17-minute interview with the senator. But his skepticism was clear, and he referred to undocumented immigrants as ""illegal aliens."" On Thursday morning, he made his opposition to the Senate effort official. Levin posted a note on his Facebook page that said, ""Count me out: the border is NOT secured and Obama cannot be trusted, period.""

Levin linked to a site that referred to Rubio as a ""slick used car salesman."" Levin said later Thursday morning that he wished he had not linked to the site criticizing Rubio.

""While I oppose the immigration bill, given the border-security issue and Obama's record of non-enforcement, among other things, I regret linking to a post that refers to Senator Rubio as a slick used car salesman,"" Levin wrote. ""He is earnest and thoughtful and deserves much better. He loves his country and means well, unlike too many politicians. There are slick used car salesmen on Capitol Hill, many come to mind, but Rubio is certainly not one of them.""

But he's not the only one. Heritage Foundation President Jim DeMint, a former South Carolina senator who is a friend of Rubio's and was instrumental in helping Rubio get elected in 2010, posted an op-ed Thursday explaining why he thinks the Senate bill that Rubio is pushing is ""flawed.""

DeMint foisted the term ""amnesty"" -- the one-word wrecking ball that killed the 2007 immigration reform effort -- on the immigration reform legislation introduced by the Senate's ""gang of eight"" this week.

""After decades of empty promises on immigration enforcement, Congress simply lacks credibility to keep its promises,"" DeMint said, describing the Senate bill as ""immediate amnesty in the form of provisional status within months and lofty promises of 'strategies' and 'plans' for enforcement years later.""

DeMint decried the creation of a comprehensive bill, and said Congress should ""debate and develop understandable reforms in a transparent step-by-step process that addresses all of the immigration issues."" With that language, DeMint appears to have given himself some wiggle room to support a bill in Congress this year, but not a lot.

Many Republicans see passing an immigration reform bill as crucial to the party's electoral future, given the horrid state of their relationship with Latino voters. But conservatives like DeMint and Levin are not persuaded by that argument.

An unruly line of shoving and jostling shoppers was waiting to enter the store in a Caracas shopping district, where prices had been cut in half — by government decree — on refrigerators, washers, stoves and TVs. Fights broke out as customers tried to force their way to the head of the line.

“I’m afraid they are going to attack the store. There’s a lot of aggression, because they think we are hiding products in the warehouse,” said the salesman, Rafael Garcia. “People are desperate because they have been in line for five hours, but we’re only letting five people in at a time.”

Desperation shopping has been common in Venezuela in recent days, since President Nicolas Maduro’s move to force shop owners to cut prices on appliances and electronics. Maduro, the handpicked heir to the late leftist leader Hugo Chavez, has become increasingly aggressive — heavy-handed, say many economists — as he struggles to shore up a sinking economy.

Since his election as president in April, the month after Chavez died, Maduro has been forced to confront the fact that his predecessor — popular for socialist initiatives that eased the burdens of the poor — left the Venezuelan economy in shambles.

Things have been worsening rapidly since then. The inflation rate hovers at 54%, and nearly 1 in 4 food items on the government’s list of basic goods i considered scarce.

Venezuela may have reaped $750 billion in oil revenue since 1999, but its government is low on cash and has been forced to take on an increasing amount of debt, including more than $35 billion in advances from China secured by oil sales. An official of the International Monetary Fund said recently that Venezuela’s current economic path was unsustainable.

Maduro, a former bus driver with little formal education, lacks Chavez’s political skills and charisma. He and his supporters blame outside pressures, even sabotage, for the problems. The United States is high on their list of culprits. More-conservative economists and politicians say Chavez and Maduro created the mess themselves.

Meanwhile, the Venezuelan people are left to cope.

Outside Garcia’s establishment, butcher and Maduro supporter Ramiro Canizares was loading a freezer onto his truck. He had bought it at a neighboring store, but the discount was disappointingly low, only 5% off the previously listed price. At 17,000 bolivars, the Venezuelan currency, it would have been about $2,800 at the official exchange rate — but was only $290 at the more commonly used black market rate.

“I thought I better buy it now because after this chaos it will be difficult to buy anything at all,” Canizares said. Despite his support for the president, he is, like many Venezuelans, angry about the country’s economic disarray.

Three miles to the east, salesman Miguel Higuera at the Pablo Electronic store faced a crowd of frenzied buyers by himself. The owner had decided not to come in for fear of being arrested for price gouging.

Just a few days before, Higuera explained, the shop owner had jacked up prices by 150% to reflect the devaluation of the bolivar. Since January, the Venezuelan currency has lost 90% of its value on the unofficial market, the benchmark used by most retailers. “Even though he has since lowered prices, he’s afraid the government will now seize all our inventory,” the salesman said.

That fear is a reflection of Maduro’s increasingly hands-on management of the economy. In a Nov. 8 speech, he said his government would set legal limits on business’ profit margins in a bid to, in one observer’s phrase, “prohibit inflation.” On Thursday, the Chavista-controlled National Assembly voted to give him expanded powers to do that.

He also ordered the military to take over the Daka electronics chain and slash prices by as much as 25%.

“Nothing should be left at Daka,” Maduro said.

In addition to appliance stores, Maduro announced that government auditors would soon fan out across the country to examine the books of car dealers and shops selling auto parts, hardware and apparel. The Aldo shoe store chain cut its prices in half, anticipating government intervention.

Spared from the new controls are prices of basic foods, which have been set by the government since shortly after Chavez took office in 1999.

Those price controls, on chicken, rice, cooking oil and other items, won favor with the poor but drove many food companies out of business. As a result, the government now must import 70% of all basic foods, said Alejandro Arreaza, an economist with Barclays in New York. Even so, scarcities persist because of inefficiency and corruption.

The controls, combined with the chilling effect of government takeovers of hundreds of companies, farms and ranches, have made Venezuela’s economy among the least productive in the hemisphere, said economist Jose Manuel Puente, now a visiting fellow at Oxford University.

Puente and others are warning that more government intervention will only further weaken Venezuela’s private sector, discourage investment and accelerate unofficial devaluation.

The bolivar traded this week at 68 to the dollar on the black market, compared with the official rate of 6.3. In April, it had traded for 22 to the dollar.

Dan Hellinger, a political science professor at Webster University in St . Louis, is more sympathetic to Maduro. He said Venezuela’s problems were not all the current government’s doing and that analysts “ought not to simply dismiss Maduro’s claims of sabotage.”

Maduro has charged, among other things, that unspecified “right-wingers” were behind widespread power outages over the summer.

“Venezuela’s economy is being buffeted by both political and macroeconomic sources, and not enough attention is being paid to the former,” Hellinger said. “The opposition and the [business] owners feel that the government is on the ropes, and they would like to make the situation worse, and there is little doubt in my mind that the U.S. has the same intention.”

In the face of growing economic disorder this week, Maduro stepped up his accusations against opposition politicians, describing three opposition leaders as the “trilogy of evil” and threatening to jail opposition lawmaker Miguel Cocchiola, owner of a lumber business, whom Maduro labeled a thief.

“The government is facing a triple crisis,” said Javier Corrales, a professor at Amherst College. “The economy continues to deteriorate, there is rising social unrest, and Maduro’s popularity, never high, has dropped almost 7 points since the summer to 40%.... There is a strategic calculus behind the government’s decision to turn more repressive.”

On Thursday morning, a recurring scene played out at the Unicasa supermarket in the Montalban section of Caracas, where shoppers had waited two hours for chicken to appear on the shelves.

“People turned into savages, grabbing what they could,” one shopper said, adding that she thought Maduro’s latest measures were a means of distracting the public from the true severity of food shortages.

Outside the market, schoolteacher Deisy Quintero said she came away empty-handed.

“I got here early because I needed many things, but I still couldn’t get inside,” she said, adding ruefully, “Everything has been taken by now.”

Charting the course for a war’s end, President Obama and Afghan President Hamid Karzai met Friday at the White House to discuss the future role of the United States in Afghanistan.

Charting the course for a war’s end, President Obama and Afghan President Hamid Karzai meet Friday at the White House to discuss the future role of the United States in Afghanistan.

Charting the course for a war’s end, President Obama and Afghan President Hamid Karzai meet Friday at the White House to discuss the future role of the United States in Afghanistan.

President Obama moved Friday toward a faster reduction of U.S. forces in Afghanistan and laid the groundwork with Afghan President Hamid Karzai for a small troop presence in the country after the American mission formally ends there in 2014.

Obama and Karzai, leaders who have often been at odds in recent years, brought into sharper focus the American endgame for its longest war. Appearing after a series of morning meetings, the two outlined steps to wind down the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan over the next two years, a show of unity that excluded any talk of new ambitions.

Speaking at the White House, Obama said Afghan forces would take the lead in securing the country this spring, several months ahead of what had been planned at a NATO summit last year.

Karzai also clarified his intention to eliminate a key obstacle to preserving some U.S. forces in Afghanistan beyond 2014, pledging to “go to the Afghan people and argue for immunity for U.S. troops in Afghanistan.” Obama’s inability to reach an immunity agreement, which protects U.S. forces from foreign prosecution, prevented him from keeping any troops in Iraq.

Although Obama did not say explicitly that the accelerated transition would allow him to more quickly pull the remaining 66,000 U.S. troops from Afghanistan, he made clear that the “nature of our work” in the country after nearly a dozen years of war would soon change.

“We achieved our central goal, or have come very close to achieving our central goal, which is to de-capacitate al-Qaeda, to dismantle them, to make sure that they can’t attack us again,” Obama said. “At the end of this conflict, we are going to be able to say that the sacrifices that were made by those men and women in uniform has brought about the goal that we sought.”

The faster shift to a mostly advisory and training role will likely energize those within the White House, particularly among Obama’s civilian advisers, who have argued for a faster drawdown than some generals have recommended.

Obama will soon receive from Gen. John Allen, the commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, a recommended schedule for troop reductions over the next two years. The U.S. president’s meetings with Karzai came as he prepares to set the final withdrawal timeline in the coming weeks and to discuss with the Afghan leader how he intends to do so.

Obama has ranked ending the war in Iraq and winding down the even-longer conflict in Afghanistan as key foreign policy achievements during his first term. Senior administration officials say bringing the war to a “responsible end,” as Obama said several times on Friday, is a top priority as he begins his second term.

His recent selection of former Sen. Chuck Hagel, a Nebraska Republican and Vietnam veteran, as defense secretary underscores Obama’s intention to focus less on fighting new battles in Afghanistan than on bringing home and caring for U.S. troops, many of whom have served several tours.

Asked Friday whether the human and financial cost of the Afghanistan war had been worth it, Obama recalled the 3,000 Americans who were “viciously murdered” by al-Qaeda, as well as the Afghans who were “brutalized” by the Taliban that controlled the country at the time.

“Have we achieved everything that some might have imagined us achieving in the best of scenarios? Probably not,” Obama said. “ This is a human enterprise, and, you know, you fall short of the ideal.”

But, he continued, “Have we been able, I think, to shape a strong relationship with a responsible Afghan government that is willing to cooperate with us to make sure that it is not a launching pad for future attacks against the United States? We have achieved that goal.”

Obama said any U.S. mission in Afghanistan beyond 2014 would focus solely on counterterrorism operations and training Afghan security forces, whose progress he described optimistically on Friday.

Obama would not specify how many troops he may leave in Afghanistan to accomplish those tasks, but he said it will be “a very limited mission, and it is not one that would require the same kind of footprint, obviously, that we’ve had over the last 10 years in Afghanistan.”

Within the White House, some officials are pushing to keep a force as small as 2,500 past 2014, far lower than the 10,000 to 30,000 that some U.S. officials and NATO allies were discussing as recently as a year ago. And Obama’s positive public assessment Friday will likely make it far more difficult for military officials to make the case for a more gradual drawdown than the White House wants.

Afghan forces have taken the lead in security operations in most of the country already, but Obama’s emphasis on the faster transition Friday suggested that he intends to use the shift to withdraw forces on an accelerated timeline. He called the spring transfer of responsibilities “a historic moment and another step toward full Afghan sovereignty.”

Karzai has complained frequently that the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan threatens his country's independence, often drawing the anger of Obama and his senior advisers in doing so.

But unlike Iraq, Afghanistan has few natural resources and little national wealth, giving Karzai a greater incentive to push for an immunity agreement that would help keep U.S. troops and assistance in his country after 2014. On Friday, Karzai cited Turkey and Germany — two NATO countries that host large U.S. military bases — as possible post-war models for the U.S.-Afghan relationship.

Obama and Karzai hope to have the security agreement, including the immunity guarantee, finalized by November. That would help formalize the U.S. presence in Afghanistan before that country’s next presidential election, expected in the spring of 2014. The issue of American troops could become a feature of that campaign and complicate security negotiations if they have not concluded by then.

Asked on Friday how many U.S. forces should remain after 2014, Karzai said that is “an issue for the United States,” suggesting he would not negotiate vigorously over the number Obama settles on.

“Numbers are not going to make a difference to the situation in Afghanistan,” Karzai said. “The broader relationship will make a difference in Afghanistan and the region.”

Karzai and Obama said they had discussed the Afghan president’s efforts to negotiate a peace agreement with the Taliban, a process the White House refers to as “reconciliation.” The leaders agreed on allowing the Taliban to open an office in Qatar, where Karzai said direct peace talks with Afghan government negotiators will be held.

But Obama noted several times that the war is incomplete — both on the battlefield and in building a stable country.

As U.S. forces leave, Obama emphasized that he expects Afghan leaders to protect the rights of women to participate in public life in a Muslim nation where many are still forced to wear restrictive burqas and have limited avenues to education and jobs.

“The single-best indicator, or one of the single-best indicators, of a country’s prosperity around the world is how does it treat its women,” he said. “Does it educate that half of the population? Does it give them opportunity? When it does, you unleash the power of everyone, not just some.”"

At the center of Mickelson's tax complaint was his claim that he pays a tax rate of 62 to 63 percent.

""If you add up all the federal and you look at the disability and the unemployment and the Social Security and the state, my tax rate's 62, 63 percent,"" Mickelson said. ""So I've got to make some decisions on what I'm going to do.""

Related: Did California's Rich Tax Really Shrink Its Deficit?

There is no doubt that Mickelson's taxes are high. And they just went up by an additional 7.9 percent over the past three months due to the ""fiscal cliff"" deal and California's Proposition 30.

But several accountants interviewed said it's unlikely that Mickelson is actually paying a rate above 60 percent. With even the most basic tax planning, they said, his real rate is most likely closer to 50 percent.

After his comments turned into a rare off-course controversy for Mickelson, he apologized but didn't back away from his numbers. ""Finances and taxes are a personal matter and I should not have made my opinions on them public,"" he said today in a statement. ""I apologize to those I have upset or insulted and assure you I intend to not let it happen again.""

But let's consider those numbers.

Under current tax rates, Mickelson would pay 13.3 percent in state income tax and 39.6 percent in federal income tax. That's 52.9 percent combined. Medicare and Medicaid is an additional 2 percent. The new health-care levy is .9 percent on earned income and 3.8 percent on investment income.

Self-employment taxes could total an additional 15.3 percent -- but that's only on income up to $113,000, accountants say. After that the rate is 2.9 percent.

Mickelson would also pay local taxes where he plays tournaments. That could add another one percent or two percent.

So the maximum Mickelson could pay in state and income taxes, payroll and other income-related taxes would be around 60 percent.

But that rate is only if he did absolutely no tax planning or basic deductions. He would, for instance, get a deduction on his state income taxes from his federal. He would also deduct any golf-related expenses as a business expense. He probably puts money in a retirement plan, which is tax-favorable.

I would guess that Mickelson has some investments, which would be taxed at the lower capital gains rate of 20 percent (or 23.8 percent with the new health-care tax). And I would guess he might have a mortgage deduction, or other deductions related to kids and education.

And we know that Mickelson gives money to charity. So that would be deducted as well. If he has trusts (which he likely does) that also reduces his tax rate.

Steven Piascik, president of Piascik – the accounting firm that works with dozens of professional athletes – said that he easily could bring Mickelson's rate to around 50 to 52 percent with some ""basic tax planning.""

""I couldn't guarantee it, but 8 to 10 percent off that 62 percent rate seems normal,"" he said. ""I would guess he's doing a lot of these things already.""

Either Mickelson misspoke – or he needs to hire a new accountant."

By Ellen Tordesillas

Many, including high-ranking Philippine officials, like to think that increased presence of American military in the Philippines, which is a subject of talks between the two countries starting today, is a commitment by the Americans to defend the Philippines in case of an armed conflict in the West Philippine Sea, where a number of islands are being claimed wholly or partly by the Philippines, Brunei, China,Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam.

Those who have taken these view will be disappointed because the U.S has taken a neutral position in the conflicting claims in the South China Sea (part of it is referred to as West Philippine Sea) and has always been consistent in urging for a peaceful resolution of the conflicting claims.

The Obama administration has decided to rebalance its military forces from Middle East to Asia, in what is seen by analysts as a move to contain China’s hegemony in the region.

But as former UN Representative Lauro Baja, Jr. observed, the Americans do not want to ‘vulgarize’ this objective.

In increasing its presence in Asia, the United States does not want to play referee to countries fighting over islands, rocks and shoals. “They want a stable region. They don’t want to prejudice their strategic relations with China, which is more important than claims over rocks and shoals,” Baja said.

Primarily, the U.S. wants to ensure that the sealanes are open and unhampered for international navigation.

In preparation for the implementation of their Pivot to Asia policy, senior American officials have been coming here the past months and assessing the situation. One thing that they were concerned about is the tension between the Philippines and China over the disputed islands especially Bajo de Masinloc otherwise known as Scarborough Shoal or Panatag shoal and lately the Ayungin shoal.

The Philippines has filed a suit with the UN Arbitral Court questioning China’s nine dash-line, which encompasses the whole South China Sea including several countries’ territories.

Story continues

A source said some of the analysts interviewed by American officials said that the “Shame China” strategy of the Department of Foreign Affairs under Foreign Secretary Albert del Rosario has contributed largely to the deteriorating relations between the Philippines and China.

Del Rosario has, several times accused China of “duplicity and intimidation.” Malacañang spokesperson Edwin Lacierda has also made sure that he is not behind in China-bashing.

In the 2010 and 2011 State-of-the Nation address by President Aquino, he had strong words against China.

In his 2011 SONA, Aquino, declared: “ There was a time when we couldn’t appropriately respond to threats in our own backyard. Now, our message to the world is clear: What is ours is ours; setting foot on Recto Bank is no different from setting foot on Recto Avenue.”

He was referring to the disputed Recto or Reed Bank near Palawan.

In his 2012 SONA, he talked lengthily about the situation in Bajo de Masinloc. He said, “We demonstrated utmost forbearance in dealing with this issue. As a sign of our goodwill, we replaced our navy cutter with a civilian boat as soon as we could. We chose not to respond to their media’s harangues. I do not think it excessive to ask that our rights be respected, just as we respect their rights as a fellow nation in a world we need to share.

“There are those who say that we should let Bajo de Masinloc go; we should avoid the trouble. But if someone entered your yard and told you he owned it, would you agree? Would it be right to give away that which is rightfully ours?”

Aquino can be stubborn. But he listens to America. Last year, a month after he withdrew all the ships from Bajo de Masinloc, he, supported by the majority of the members of his cabinet, decided to send back the ships to the area which was by then already controlled by the Chinese. Upon learning of Malacañang's decision, the U.S. relayed the advice through defense officials that it would not be wise to send back the ships to Bajo de Masinloc . The ships were not sent back.

Our source said, two weeks before the President's State of the Nation address, U.S. officials advised the DFA and Malacanang to tone down their anti-China rhetorics to reduce tension in the region. That explains why in last month’s SONA there was no mention, not a word, about conflict with China.

Last Aug. 2, Del Rosario, who never let any media opportunity to censure China pass, told members of the foreign correspondents association in the country, that he was not keen on guesting in their forum on the South China Sea because he was “looking for a modus vivendi with China.”

China should thank Uncle Sam."

Pages 43 and 44 of the bill detail what one conservative blogger, Javier Manjarres of Shark Tank, has already described as the “ObamaPhone” from Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL). That section reads:

SEC. 1107. ACCESS TO EMERGENCY PERSONNEL.

(a) SOUTHWEST BORDER REGION EMERGENCY COM- MUNICATIONS GRANTS.–

(1) IN GENERAL.–The Secretary, in consultation with the governors of the States in the South- west Border region, shall establish a 2-year grant program, to be administered by the Secretary, to im- prove emergency communications in the Southwest Border region.

(2) ELIGIBILITY FOR GRANTS.–An individual is eligible to receive a grant under this subsection if the individual demonstrates that he or she–

(A) regularly resides or works in the Southwest Border region; (B) is at greater risk of border violence due to the lack of cellular service at his or her residence or business and his or her proximity to the Southern border. (3) USE OF GRANTS.–Grants awarded under

this subsection may be used to purchase satellite telephone communications systems and service that–

(A) can provide access to 9-1-1 service;

and

(B) are equipped with global positioning systems.

(4) AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.– There is authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out the grant program established under this subsection.

Manjarres first found the immigration bill’s free cell phone goodies and dubbed the handout the “MarcoPhone.”

“Move over ‘Obama phone,’ we present the new ‘Hola, Como Estas?!’ MarcoPhone,” Manjarres wrote on Wednesday morning.

Rubio spokesman Alex Conant did not return a request for comment from Breitbart News.

Interestingly, TracFone, a company that will likely benefit from this type of government program, is based in Rubio’s Miami, Florida.

The order was given by Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, five days after roughly 800,000 federal workers were sent home after Congress failed to reach a deal to fund the government.

Hagel said the decision to recall the workers is based on a Pentagon legal interpretation of a law called the Pay Our Military Act.

The measure was passed by Congress and signed by President Obama shortly before the slimdown began.

“Attorneys concluded that the law does allow the Department of Defense to eliminate furloughs for employees whose responsibilities contribute to the morale, well-being, capabilities and readiness of service members,” Hagel said in a written statement. “This has been a very disruptive year for our people … .Many important activities remain curtailed while the shutdown goes on.”

Hagel signaled earlier in the past week that Pentagon lawyers were trying to determine ways for some of the department's furloughed civilians to get back to work.

In a memorandum from Hagel to other high-ranking military officials and obtained by Fox News, the Defense secretary states member of the military reserves and full-time National Guardsman are among those being asked to return.

Hagel told reporters traveling with him Tuesday in South Korea: ""It does have an effect on our relationships around the world and it cuts straight to the obvious question, ‘Can you rely on the United States as a reliable partner to fulfill its commitments to its allies?’ ""

The Pentagon did not immediately say on Saturday exactly how many workers will return to work. The Defense Department said ""most"" were being brought back.

Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Ed Markey praised the move and blamed the slimdown-related furloughs on the “Tea Party Republicans.”

""This is the right decision for the hundreds of thousands of patriots who support our soldiers, and now it's time to end this harmful government shutdown that has left hundreds of thousands of other federal workers sitting at home,"" Markey said.

Washington Republicans did not return requests for comment.

The law ensured that members of the military, who have remained at work throughout the shutdown, would be paid on time. It also left room for the Pentagon to keep on the job those civilians who provide support to the military.

Hagel also said Saturday that he strongly supports efforts in Congress to enact legislation to retroactively compensate all furloughed employees. ""And I will continue to urge Congress to fulfill its basic responsibilities to pass a budget and restore full funding for the Department of Defense and the rest of the government,"" Hagel said.

(Sarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post)

When Ronald Reagan signed a comprehensive immigration overhaul in 1986, he confidently predicted: “Future generations of Americans will be thankful for our efforts to humanely regain control of our borders and thereby preserve the value of one of the most sacred possessions of our people — American citizenship.”

More than a quarter-century later, however, that law has not turned out to be the triumph that Reagan envisioned. Instead, those on both sides of the immigration debate see it as a cautionary lesson.

As President Obama and lawmakers from both parties begin to take their first tentative steps toward again rewriting the nation’s immigration laws, opponents warn that they are repeating the mistakes of the 1986 act, which failed to solve the problems that it set out to address. Critics contend that the law actually contributed to making the situation worse.

An estimated 3 million to 5 million illegal immigrants were living in the United States when the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) was passed. Now there are upwards of 11 million. And the question of who gets to be an American, far from being settled, has been inflamed.

The latest proposals contain the same three components as the 1986 law: a legalization program — and a possible path to citizenship — for those who are in the country illegally, stepped-up enforcement along the border, and measures to discourage employers from hiring workers who lack proof of legal residency.

View Graphic Immigrants living in and leaving the United States

“This is the same old formula we’ve dealt with before, including when it passed in 1986, and that is a promise of enforcement and immediate amnesty,” Sen. David Vitter (R-La.) said last week on the Laura Ingraham radio show. “And of course, the promises of enforcement never materialize. The amnesty happens immediately, the millisecond the bill is signed into law.”

But immigration experts note that the country has undergone big changes since then. And the experience of what went wrong after 1986 might help policymakers get it right this time.

“There’s just an entirely different mentality,” said Doris Meissner, who was commissioner of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service during the Bill Clinton administration and who now directs immigration policy studies at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute.

Technology affords new means of enforcing sanctions against hiring illegal immigrants, for instance, and Americans in the post-9/11 world may have lost some of their squeamishness about carrying tamper-proof government identification or submitting personal information to a national database. Meanwhile, businesses are eager to come up with a legal system of immigration that can more quickly adapt to their constantly changing labor needs.

Still, “the problem is always in the details, and that was certainly true in 1986. Once the debate got into the details, the compromises proved to be counterproductive,” said Susan F. Martin, director of Georgetown University’s Institute for the Study of International Migration, who in the 1990s served as executive director of the bipartisan U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform.

New national circumstances

The most obvious difference between now and a quarter-century ago is demographic. In those days, the Latino vote was not much of a political factor outside a handful of states. Only 3 percent of those who cast ballots in the 1984 presidential election were Hispanic; last year, they made up 10 percent of the electorate. Their growing numbers and increasingly Democratic tilt were considered a crucial factor in Obama’s victory, as well as a serious problem for Republicans in the future.

What also expanded was the national sense of crisis surrounding the issue. At the time the law was passed, Meissner said, illegal immigration had a significant impact in only half a dozen states — New York, New Jersey, Florida, Texas, Illinois and California.

Now, thanks largely to the demand for labor during the economic boom of the 1990s, illegal immigration has become a high-priority issue in virtually every state, including places such as Alabama, Iowa, Georgia and Nebraska.

The most contentious part of the 1986 law was the provision that, for the first time, made it illegal for an employer to knowingly hire a worker who was not in the country legally.

Until then, it had been a felony to harbor an illegal immigrant, but the 1952 “Texas Proviso” stipulated that hiring one did not violate the law. Under the 1986 law, employers who hire undocumented workers are subject to civil penalties of $250 to $10,000 for each of those employees.

What the 1986 act did not provide, however, was any realistic means of enforcing the new requirements for employers, which is why they were and are rarely punished.

In fiscal 2006, for instance, not a single employer was fined, according to statistics compiled by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The Obama administration has cracked down more vigorously, but the chances of getting caught and punished for hiring an illegal immigrant are still relatively low. In fiscal 2011, ICE issued 385 notifications of intent to fine employers, collecting a total of $10,463,988.

Why so little enforcement, when the practice of hiring illegal immigrants is so widespread? Wouldn’t it be enough to just follow the law that is already on the books?

Those questions come up every time there is talk of immigration reform, most recently seven years ago.

“One answer is that there are never enough federal budget resources,” the law’s authors, former congressman Romano L. Mazzoli (D-Ky.) and former senator Alan K. Simpson (R-Wyo.), wrote in The Washington Post in 2006.

“Another is that administrations of both stripes are loath to disrupt economic activities — i.e., labor supply in factories, farms and businesses,” they added. “And we know that disruptions in the labor supply are the natural, unavoidable and even desirable consequence of strong border and workplace enforcement.”

One of the law’s most glaring deficiencies was that it did not stipulate or provide a secure means by which businesses could verify the legal status of those they hired. Instead, it listed dozens of documents that could be used — most of them easily falsified.

“You had a wink-and-a-nod system, where the employer was in compliance and the [illegal immigrant] could find a job,” Meissner said.

“The only real beneficiaries of some of the IRCA reforms was the counterfeiting industry,” Martin added.

Simpson and Mazzoli had advocated a new “identifier,” using biometrics or tamper-proof cards. But something so close to a national ID card drew opposition from civil libertarians on the left and the right, as well as concerns about the practicality of issuing new identification to 250 million Americans.

That issue, however, is certain to be revisited.

The set of principles drawn up by a bipartisan group of senators, which is expected to serve as a starting point for comprehensive immigration overhaul, promises: “Our proposal will create an effective employment verification system which prevents identity theft and ends the hiring of future unauthorized workers.”

That would include coming up with what the senators described as “non-forgeable electronic means” to determine an employee’s legal status before he or she is hired.

Questions about legal entry

Another area where past reform efforts — including the 1986 law — have fallen short is on the question of legal immigration.

Unlike many politicians of both parties today, Reagan was unafraid to use the most loaded word in the immigration debate.

“I believe in the idea of amnesty for those who have put down roots and who have lived here, even though some time back, they may have entered illegally,” Reagan said during a 1984 presidential debate.

The law offered legalization to those who had been in the country for at least five years but excluded those who had resided here more briefly — leaving what Meissner called “a nucleus of today’s illegal population.”

If a new legalization measure is passed, experts say, it is likely to give amnesty to those who entered the country illegally much closer to the moment that a bill is enacted.

More important, the 1986 law did nothing to address the future flow of immigrants, which increased dramatically during the next decade’s economic boom.

A 1990 law did increase the limits on legal immigration. But those quotas did not keep pace with the drastic changes in the labor market or the desire of many immigrants to reunite with family members they had left behind.

Revamping the legal immigration system is an area that has had little debate. The key, experts said, will be coming up with a system that can accurately gauge the demands of the labor market, sorting out actual labor shortages from cases in which businesses are simply unwilling to pay enough to attract legal residents.

“We have no mechanisms to make rapid changes in the legal immigration system, to meet family demands and to meet employer demands,” Martin said. “If it continues to fail, people will find a way around it.”"

(AKHTER GULFAM/EPA)

An escalating dispute between the Afghan government and the United States over customs procedures has halted the flow of U.S. military equipment across Afghanistan’s borders, forcing commanders to rely more heavily on air transport, which has dramatically increased the cost of the drawdown, according to military officials.

The Afghan government is demanding that the U.S. military pay $1,000 for each shipping container leaving the country that does not have a corresponding, validated customs form. The country’s customs agency says the American military has racked up $70 million in fines.

If left unresolved, the disagreement could inflate the price tag of the U.S. military drawdown by hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars because of the higher cost of shipping by air — an unwelcome expenditure at a time when the Pentagon is scrambling to cope with steep congressionally mandated budget cuts and the White House is attempting to jump-start negotiations over a long-term security cooperation deal with Kabul.

The Afghan government’s demand for payment is part of a broader dispute over Kabul’s authority to tax entities from the United States, its chief benefactor. As the war economy that for years bankrolled Afghanistan’s political elite starts to deflate, the government is increasingly insisting that U.S. defense contractors pay business taxes and fines for a range of alleged violations.

The latest fight has added a new irritant to negotiations over a bilateral security agreement that will address the possibility of a residual U.S. military force in Afghanistan after 2014, when the NATO combat mission formally concludes. Washington and Kabul remain at odds over several details of the security deal, including the types of taxes and customs fees that would be imposed on the force and its contractors.

The Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction warned in a letter to Congress last month that Afghan ministries were seeking to collect nearly $1 billion in business taxes and fines from U.S. contractors — an effort that some American officials see as a massive shakedown in one of the world’s most corrupt countries. U.S. funds intended to rebuild Afghanistan, inspector general John. F. Sopko said in his June 28 letter to lawmakers, are increasingly being used to “pay the cost of doing business in Afghanistan.”

Afghan officials dispute the charge. They say that U.S. contractors and government officials have flouted Afghan tax and customs regulations, citing operating agreements drafted shortly after the 2001 invasion. Those agreements gave the U.S. government vast leverage and protections.

A familiar dispute

Eager to boost the country’s aid-

dependent economy, Afghan officials have spent years trying to collect more tax and customs revenue from the international community, particularly the U.S. government. They have closed the border to U.S. cargo in the past during similar spats that neither government acknowledged publicly.

For the most part, the Americans have managed to resolve those impasses without paying large fines — a position they have taken because they fear that paying up would open the door to even bigger fines.

But this week the Kabul government took the unprecedented move of blocking inbound shipments of fuel and equipment for Afghan security forces.

With trucks loaded with U.S. military cargo piling up along the southern border, the top commander of U.S. troops in Afghanistan, Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., has asked for a meeting with Afghan President Hamid Karzai this week to find a resolution. But neither side appears willing to budge.

Afghan officials allege that U.S. contractors hired to transport equipment failed to turn in documentation for billions of dollars in equipment shipped into the country since the 2010 troop “surge.” This month, Karzai’s cabinet came up with the $70 million fine, citing at least 70,000 cases in which the United States failed to process the necessary customs paperwork.

“How do we collect the fines for these violations?” Najibullah Wardak, the director general of the Afghan Customs Department, said in an interview Wednesday. “The only way is to stop all trucks from crossing the border. What else can we do?”

Wardak said the Afghan government has long suspected that vast amounts of gear shipped in U.S. military containers find their way to the black market. “We worry that we are losing a lot of revenue,” he said.

Cost-effective route

U.S. commanders see Pakistani land routes as the best and most cost-effective channel to ship materiel out of the landlocked war zone. Bilateral tensions have prompted the Pakistani government to shut down the border in the past, but the Pakistanis have been largely cooperative as the U.S. drawdown has accelerated, American officials have said.

Early this year, the U.S. military was flying out about 70 percent of its gear as it tentatively explored the ease of shipping cargo out by land. Maj. Gen. Kurt J. Stein, the architect of the withdrawal effort, had expressed cautious optimism about getting equipment out through Pakistan, even as he acknowledged “corruption, taxes, tariffs, all kinds of delays.”

“The tide has changed, and now we’re flying out 30 percent,” he said in an interview in Kabul last month. “Obviously, there’s a tremendous cost saving there.”

In recent weeks, however, the tide has shifted yet again. A Pentagon spokesman said that during the most recent 30-day period, only 36 percent of equipment was leaving by land.

The Pentagon estimates that the Afghan drawdown will cost $5 billion to $7 billion, depending on what percentage of the equipment slated for shipment can leave by land.

In recent months, as U.S. military cargo began to flow at an unprecedented rate down the roads that lead to Pakistan, Afghan officials decided to take a tough stance, imposing the $1,000-per-container fine. The United States did not pay it, Afghan Finance Minister Omar Zakhilwal said.

“The goods they bring in and take out were stopped temporarily because the deadline that was given to them expired on July 11,” he said in an e-mail.

The borders remained closed for six days. Zakhilwal extended the transit exemption Wednesday for one month but denied a U.S. request for a three-month exemption, Afghan officials said.

Officials at the Pentagon did not answer detailed questions about the tax dispute. In a statement, Cmdr. Bill Speaks, a spokesman, said U.S. officials “are confident that the situation will be resolved shortly.” He would not say how.

“We are experiencing challenges with our equipment retrograde at the southern Afghan border crossing points,” the statement said. “These issues are recurring, and typically center around the interpretation of Afghan customs processes.”

The Afghan customs chief conveyed less optimism that a resolution is imminent.

“The U.S. is still not taking it seriously,” Wardak said. “It’s a compliance issue, and they’re not complying with our laws.”

A source with direct knowledge of these matters told Breitbart News that Boehner has decided to abide by the Hastert Rule in regards to immigration reform. “No immigration bill will be brought to the floor for a vote without a majority of the Republican conference in support,” the source told Breitbart News on Monday.

Around Washington, conservatives have worried that Boehner may back down from conservative principles on immigration and support the Gang of Eight bill. They fear he may rush the bill to the floor if the Senate passes it and try to move it through the House with a majority of Democratic votes.

Even though those rumors continue to fly, signs now indicate that Boehner will not break the Hastert Rule and will only bring a bill to the floor with the support of the majority of Republicans.

Reports from Ryan Lizza at The New Yorker and David Drucker at the Washington Examiner appear to support the idea that Boehner will not break with Republicans. It did take Rep. Steve King (R-IA) banding together more than 50 of his colleagues to call for a special GOP conference meeting on the topic, at which they expressed their dissatisfaction with the Senate bill and their hope that Boehner will stick to the Hastert Rule.

In addition to King’s efforts, conservative groups have circulated letters around Washington calling on the conference to formally codify the Hastert Rule into the House GOP conference rules so that it must be followed, instead of just being a guideline."

The $46 billion dent to the Pentagon’s fiscal 2013 budget, long considered by the brass as nothing more than a political pawn, has taken on an air of inevitability, forcing commanders across the military to plan for painful reductions and argue that American lives and livelihoods are hanging in the balance.

Injecting ominous warnings about national security into policy debates has in the past snapped elected leaders into action, but there is no sign that Republicans and the White House are close to compromising on a more measured approach to reducing the deficit. Some lawmakers and analysts have dismissed the caution as posturing by a force reluctant to shrink too much in a postwar era.

In response, the military’s service chiefs are amplifying the months-long warnings of Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta and others and providing what they have described as the specific and serious consequences of the across-the-board cuts.

Gen. Ray Odierno, the Army’s chief of staff, recently warned that the cuts may curtail training for 80 percent of ground forces, including some in the deployment pipeline, forcing him to extend the deployments of troops already in Afghanistan.

One is to avoid the $1.2 trillion in spending cuts included in sequestration and another is raising the country’s debt ceiling. Here is a look at some of the issues involved in these two fiscal challenges. Sequester If Congress and Obama can’t reach a deal to avoid sequestration, then the country would see budget cuts of $1.2 trillion through 2021. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has said that the defense cuts would be a “disaster.” But if you look at this graph, the blow isn't as bad as the military has faced in the past. Even if the sequestration was implemented, the drop in spending would be less than the military experienced after the Korean, Vietnam or Cold wars. The Center for Strategic and International Studies Wait 1 second to continue.

Facing a $8.6 billion shortfall, the Navy has delayed the deployment of the USS Harry Truman, leaving just one aircraft carrier instead of two in the Persian Gulf, where tensions continue with Iran. The budget crunch also will mean delays for repairs of a carrier and the construction of another.

The Air Force has warned that slashing $12.4 billion from its budget for the remainder of the fiscal year would require cutting 200,000 flying hours. That means that by May, two-thirds of the force’s pilots would “drop below acceptable level of readiness,” Air Force chief Mark Welsh told lawmakers recently.

After holding out hope for a compromise, Pentagon civilians were startled Wednesday when Panetta notified 800,000 employees that they might face a 20 percent pay cut if furloughs are implemented starting in April. Although the payroll for uniformed personnel is spared, the threat of extended deployments has confounded troops in Afghanistan.

“It’s like I’m just waiting for the other shoe to drop,” said one service member there, Maj. Dustin Navarro, 31. “I’d rather have higher taxes and fewer base resources at home than have this kind of uncertainty while deployed.”

With cuts set to begin March 1, Odierno said in a speech last Friday that the Army is scrambling to find up to $24 billion in reductions for the last seven months of the fiscal year. The shortfall will affect training, he said, presenting a thankless choice between sending untrained troops to Afghanistan and keeping certain units there months beyond their exit dates. American lives are at stake, he warned.

“It is our responsibility to ensure that we never send soldiers into harm’s way that are not trained, equipped, well-led and ready for any contingency, to include war,” Odierno told lawmakers last week. “If we have to reduce the amount of training we give our pilots, they will go in with a hell of a lot less capability. That means mistakes will be made. That means we’ll have accidents. That means we’ll be more likely to be shot down by enemy fire.”

Some lawmakers have reacted apologetically to the predictions of a dangerous drop in readiness. But other lawmakers and analysts say the Pentagon’s doomsday predictions have a measure of hyperbole and might be, at least in part, an attempt to protect budgets and programs as the war in Afghanistan draws to an end.

“Across-the-board cuts are bad policy,” said Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), one of 22 Congress members from both parties who wrote to President Obama and congressional leaders arguing that defense spending should be part of any debt-reduction deal. “At the end of the day, if cuts are going to be made, the military cannot be spared.”

Anthony Shaffer, a senior fellow at the Center for Advanced Defense Studies, said he was skeptical of the dire predictions about readiness.

“A lot of us who look at this hard say it’s disingenuous to say, ‘We can’t deploy the Truman because the money’s not there,’ ” said Shaffer, a former Defense Intelligence Agency official. “This is all political theater. It’s being prompted by those in the Pentagon who do not want to make hard choices and cut back.”

Among the most striking examples in a country where most people pledge steadfast support for the troops, Odierno warned that some might have to do without air conditioning later in the year at bases nationwide. But the cuts also probably would have consequences for U.S. forces overseas — Panetta planned to warn NATO defense chiefs during a two-day meeting that began Thursday in Brussels that the belt-tightening could impair the United States’ ability to pay its bills to the alliance and to participate in alliance programs.

Few members meet NATO’s defense spending target of 2 percent of gross domestic product. In recent weeks, the Obama administration has warned allies with their own economic problems, including NATO stalwarts such as Britain and France, that significant cuts would undermine its arguments to Congress on the need to support defense spending.

“What is particularly tragic to me is that sequestration is not the result of an economic recession or emergency,” Deputy Defense Secretary Ashton Carter told the House Armed Services Committee last week, using the term for the automatic cuts. “It’s not in reaction to a more peaceful world. All this is purely the collateral damage of political gridlock.”

Pentagon contractors are making preemptive moves that could affect thousands of employees. BAE Systems Ship Repair, a major defense contractor, issued layoff warnings this week to 3,500 shipyard workers — including 1,600 in Virginia’s Hampton Roads area — who could lose their jobs if the Navy puts ship maintenance on hold. The Navy told BAE that it plans to cancel or defer maintenance and upgrades on 13 destroyers and cruisers the company is contracted to work on.

“We regret the anxiety [this] causes our employees and their families,” BAE Systems President Bill Clifford said in the letter that warned of layoffs.

The potential cuts are creating anxiety in Hampton Roads, where 40,000 people work in shipbuilding and repair.

“Once these availabilities are missed, they can’t be made up,” said Tom Taylor, the owner of MF&B Marine in Chesapeake, a small ship-repair company in Hampton Roads, referring to contracts.

Taylor said he fears he might have to lay off some of his 46 employees as he waits to see whether the Navy will lock in plans to cancel or delay billions of dollars more in ship maintenance and repairs.

“There’s no HR department I can send them to,” he said. “I’ve got to look them in the face and tell them they’re out of a job. If we’re going to have a smaller defense, fine, but this is nothing but politics. How can a ship go to sea without its capability?”

But if you had to reduce them to one sentence, it might go like this: “Congress responds to the short-term demands of particular groups, not the long-term needs of the nation as a whole.”

Case in point: the seemingly unstoppable growth of medical benefits for former military personnel under Tricare, the Defense Department’s health program. This mushrooming expense is a major reason that Pentagon health-care spending rose from $19 billion in fiscal 2001 to $52.8 billion in fiscal 2012.

The latter figure represented nearly 10 percent of that year’s defense budget.

President Obama has tried repeatedly to rein in this category of spending, on the very sound theory that resources are finite and that dollars spent on retiree health care cannot be spent equipping and training the active-duty armed forces for war — the Pentagon’s primary mission.

Military health care’s traditional role was to serve active-duty troops and their families, at no out-of-pocket cost. Tricare still does this, except for small prescription co-payments. This makes sense as an incentive to sign up for service and its attendant sacrifices.

Since 2000, however, Congress has repeatedly expanded the access of former military personnel to Tricare. By 2010, the eligible population had increased from 6.8 million a decade earlier to 9.7 million — nearly 85 percent of whom were not active-duty service personnel, according to an excellent May 2012 Armed Forces Journal article by Brittany Gregerson of the Institute for Defense Analyses.

Obama’s reforms have been rebuffed every time, by Democrats and by supposedly fiscally conservative, pro-defense Republicans.

The expansion of Tricare dates to the post-Cold War base closings in the 1990s. Some military hospitals were shut in the process, and retirees who had been allowed to use them on a space-available basis protested that Congress owed them a substitute.

Some even claimed that recruiters had offered them free health care for life when they enlisted and that Congress was welshing on this purported contract.

The courts correctly rejected this legally, and factually, spurious claim — but it fared better in the political sphere.

In 1996, Congress allowed military retirees ages 37 to 64 and their family members to join Tricare for an annual contribution that averaged 27 percent of total health-care costs for a family of three.

That contribution, however, did not increase with inflation. As a result, Tricare’s real cost to working-age beneficiaries dropped 41 percent between 1997 and 2010, Gregerson found. Not surprisingly, working-age retirees and their families began leaving employer-paid plans and signing up for Tricare.

Congress did allow a modest increase in costs for working-age retirees to take effect last year and indexed that cost increase to inflation. But those costs are still far less than what an average civilian would pay for comparable employer-provided health insurance.

Once former military personnel turn 65, they are eligible for Medicare, like everyone else. But in 2002, Congress gave them “Tricare for Life” — essentially, a free Medigap plan. Roughly 2 million people take advantage of this perk, at a projected cost to taxpayers of $9.7 billion in the current fiscal year, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

On a per capita basis, Tricare for Life is the most expensive Tricare program of the Defense Department, Gregerson writes. Beneficiaries’ utilization rate far exceeds that of the other Tricare programs’ participants — no surprise, since Tricare for Life beneficiaries have zero incentive to conserve.

Obama’s 2013 budget plan would have saved $12.8 billion over five years by gradually increasing the annual enrollment fees of Tricare’s working-age retirees, with discounts for lower-income participants, and then indexing the fees to the rate of national growth in health spending.

The maximum fee would have quadrupled to $2,000 — still far cheaper than most civilian plans. The president also proposed adding an enrollment charge to Tricare for Life.

Congress would have none of it — then or, apparently, now. Neither the recently adopted Senate budget plan for fiscal 2014, drafted by Democrats, nor the supposedly “austere” Ryan budget passed by the Republican House, touched Tricare. Hell hath no fury like a veterans’ lobby scorned, as senators and representatives of both parties know.

So do I! In anticipation of a lot of hate mail, I would note that I respect and honor America’s veterans. They should be well provided for, including reasonable health benefits. But no one — not even a veteran — is entitled to taxpayer support regardless of competing public needs.

In the case of Tricare, this is what the veterans’ lobbies have demanded of Congress, and what Congress has given them.

Well-placed Israeli sources told Fox News they ""get it"" as to why the president felt the need to cloak his planned military strikes in congressional legitimacy. But they regard the way he went about his decision-making in this instance as erratic, unnerving to them, and a bad omen for what the Israelis regard as the sine qua non of their foreign policy: the looming showdown with Iran over its nuclear program.

""The feeling is that something was wrong here, that this was not the way this should have gone down, that this is not the way a superpower should act,"" said one former Israeli diplomat who has spent considerable time in the United States and enjoys close ties to the Netanyahu government. ""We look at Syria, and we think Iran. ... What conclusions should be drawn about how America will act in other circumstances? Here was a clear red line. It was breached a few times. This looks like a clever move; but America's willingness to 'walk the walk' now is very questionable.""

Another senior official, presently in the Israeli government, told Fox News the president was right, in terms of domestic U.S. politics, to ""look for cover,"" and thereby force American lawmakers who would have criticized him for undertaking unauthorized action to ""own it, too."" But this official said the Israelis, from their vantage point, see the Obama administration as detached from the Mideast and the president, in particular, as ill-equipped to shape events there.

""I can only compliment Obama for dragging everyone to his boat,"" the Israeli official said. ""'You want war? Own it, too.' Still, however, he's a disastrous weak leader. ... The Middle East is far less important for this administration and to real American national interests today than in the past. ... The U.S.-Saudi alliance insures a continued supply of oil, and other than that, the U.S. doesn't really care.""

When President Obama visited Israel in March, the first foreign trip of his second term, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thanked him for showing unprecedented support of Israel's position on Iran. ""I appreciate the fact that the president has reaffirmed -- more than any other president -- Israel's right and duty to defend itself, by itself, against any threat,"" Netanyahu said at the time.

Now, sources said, Netanyahu has instructed his cabinet ministers to refrain from public statements that will unduly affect the pending congressional vote in the United States. Only the prime minister himself and Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon are said to be permitted to comment on the Syrian crisis. However, Israeli President Shimon Peres -- who enjoys unique stature as one of the last of the country's founders still active in public life, and whose office is largely ceremonial in nature -- spoke in praise of the president during a session with foreign ambassadors in Jerusalem on Tuesday.

""I express my admiration for the attempt of President Obama to check every possible angle how to bring an end to this horrible situation in Syria,"" Peres said, adding that the situation is viewed that way ""in the eyes of the Arabs, not only in our eyes. And I'm sure that none of us can overlook it.""

In urging Congress to approve his planned strikes, the president on Tuesday cited the security of the Jewish state, among that of other regional allies, as a factor for lawmakers to consider. ""There are certain weapons,"" Obama said, ""that when used can not only end up resulting in grotesque deaths, but also can end up being transmitted to non-state actors -- can pose a risk to allies and friends of ours, like Israel, like Jordan, like Turkey."""

President Obama first told his advisers that he would seek congressional approval

Obama was advised last week by aides not to seek congressional authorization

In making his decision%2C Obama stressed to aides the desire to take America off permanent war footing

WASHINGTON — The president's decision to seek congressional approval for a military strike against Syria came out of the blue — none of his national security team saw it coming, according to three senior administration officials.

Obama told some of his senior advisers during a National Security Council meeting last weekend that he was leaning toward taking action against Syria, but had not made a final decision, said the officials, who spoke on the condition they not to be identified discussing internal deliberations. As Obama mulled his next steps, the aides advised him not to seek congressional authorization for a military strike, they said.

But when Obama convened his senior advisers Friday night to tell them he had settled on launching a narrowly focused strike against the Bashar Assad regime, he also told them something stunning: He would ask Congress to authorize it first.

The president raised this idea to his national security team for the first time Friday night after a one-on-one chat with White House chief of staff Denis McDonough. In discussions Friday night and again Saturday morning in the Situation Room, Obama laid out his reasoning to his aides, some of whom were opposed to seeking congressional approval, according to the officials who declined to name the skeptics.

""Many people have advised against taking this decision to Congress, and undoubtedly, they were impacted by what we saw happen in the United Kingdom this week when the Parliament of our closest ally failed to pass a resolution with a similar goal, even as the prime minister supported taking action,"" Obama told the nation Saturday. ""Yet, while I believe I have the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization, I know that the country will be stronger if we take this course, and our actions will be even more effective.""

In the months leading up to Saturday's announcement, Obama made clear his desire to have broad support for any potential action against Syria — crystallizing his long-held view that the credibility of military action comes with numbers. But Russia, Syria's most powerful patron, would block any United Nations Security Council resolution against Syria. After the British Parliament rejected Prime Minister David Cameron's call for military action last week, it became clear to Obama that a groundswell of international was not coming.

Notably, Obama called President Francois Hollande of France — the one major U.S. ally that has endorsed a military strike — before he publicly announced his decision to seek backing from Congress.

Still, as Obama edged toward calling for a limited military strike against the Assad regime following Syrian forces' alleged killing of more than 1,400 in a chemical attack in rebel stronghold outside of Damascus Aug. 21, White House officials maintained their view that the president did not need to seek congressional approval.

But aides said Obama, who as a candidate for the White House criticized President George W. Bush's for rushing to war in Iraq, saw formal consultation with Congress as a central part of his desired legacy to take the United States off a permanent war footing.The president was further convinced that this was the best course of action after the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin Dempsey, told him a Syria operation was not time-sensitive, and there was no negative impact for waiting, the officials said.

Congress is set to return from its summer recess Sept. 9 and is expected to debate and vote on an authorization that week. Obama would not rule out taking action immediately if Assad deploys chemical weapons before Congress is set to vote, the officials said.

The officials also stressed that the president changed his own mind, and no congressional leaders directly asked him to seek authorization, even though about a third of rank-and-file House members have called for it. They won't speculate what Obama would do if Congress does not approve use of force, while maintaining that Obama retains the authority to go it alone.

Obama made clear in his remarks on Saturday that a ""no"" vote would send the wrong message to Assad and America's enemies. ""Here's my question for every member of Congress and every member of the global community: What message will we send if a dictator can gas hundreds of children to death in plain sight and pay no price?"" Obama said.

""What's the purpose of the international system that we've built if a prohibition on the use of chemical weapons that has been agreed to by the governments of 98% of the world's people and approved overwhelmingly by the Congress of the United States is not enforced?"""

In his press release announcing passage, the Governor “likened Senate Sub. for House Bill 2117 to a shot of adrenaline into the heart of the Kansas economy.” This “shot of adrenaline” included a Kansas Legislative Research Department estimated $2.4 billion budget deficit by the beginning of fiscal year 2015. It was not clear how a deficit of almost 20% of a $13 billion state budget (PDF) is fiscally conservative, financially responsible or in any other way aligned with Republican principles of prudent management. The narrow passage prompted the Governor and his conservative allies to successfully purge moderate Republicans in favor of a more conservative class of legislators willing to be less thoughtful about the lawmaking entrusted to them.

So now that fiscal matters are in order, in what type of business-friendly environment do Kansans now live, work and play?

The legislature is now in the midst of a fight with the Kansas Supreme Court over what the Court has deemed unconstitutionally underfunded public schools.

For those businesses interested in moving to Kansas, the owners can look forward to sending their children to poorly funded schools. These schools may not yet be able to teach creationism or intelligent design, but the state school board is well versed in de-emphasizing the teaching of evolutionary biology, the cornerstone of scientific understanding. Which means that the employees needed by these new Kansas businesses will be at best undereducated if not completely unprepared to work in the 21st century.

This is probably why Education Week ranks Kansas 37th in its 2013 Quality Counts survey, including a D in K-12 achievement and a D+ in teaching performance. These are exactly the qualities any smart business owner seeks for both his or her own kids as well as for the training of his or her employees.

The social environment for new Kansas business owners is not much better. Kansas is home to the well-known Westboro Baptist Church. New business owners, their families and employees can enjoy the sight of the church’s hateful protests at local high school graduation ceremonies in neighboring Lawrence and Eudora.

Lawrence may be familiar to many Americans as the home to the University of Kansas. It is certainly not a place for new business owners to locate. The Kansas “Capitol Commission” recently prayedto restore this “dark spiritual area” of Kansas:



In a one-page list of Capitol Prayers being passed around the Statehouse recently, prayer is urged for a number of Kansas leaders, including Gov. Sam Brownback and his staff, and for those who are ill or facing adversity within the Legislature and state government.

The list also states under the heading Intercessor's Challenge: ""Target prayer for dark spiritual areas of SE Kansas, Lawrence, KCKS, North Johnson County — ask God to restore the land.""

Dave DePue, the Kansas pastor for Capitol Commission, said the prayer was to improve the economies in those areas.

""We just seem to be stalled in getting this economy turned around,"" DePue said, although he added that Lawrence seems to be doing well economically.

Asked about the term ""dark spiritual area,"" he said, ""I don't know whether that is worded right, because Lawrence isn't losing population.""

The list also included a prayer for the judicial system and asking God ""to provide wisdom for restructuring the Kansas selection process.""

Of course there are many other churches besides Westboro Baptist. Proud Kansas gun owners will keep you safe in church, unless they disagree with your politics. Dr. George Tiller was assassinated in his own church in 2009 during Sunday morning services.

For those interested in more peaceful protests of women’s reproductive rights, members of the Wichita community are currently constructing the “National Pro-Life Memorial and National Life Center” in the form of a replica of the Western Wall in Jerusalem. The activists view the Western Wall as the embodiment of remembering Jewish suffering during the Holocaust and now want the wall to memorialize some 60 million aborted fetuses.

Speaking of gun politics, state Representative John Rubin just introduced a bill proclaiming “any personal firearm, accessory or ammunition that is owned or manufactured in Kansas and stays in the state would not be subject to federal law.



Any federal authorities trying to enforce any kind of rule on such a firearm would face possible prison time. It also would prohibit doctors, but not psychiatrists, from asking whether a patient owns a gun…Rubin said the measure would prevent any gun owned or produced in Kansas and remaining in the state from being controlled by ""any past, present or future federal law, rule or regulation of any kind.""

The state Assistant Attorney General kindly pointed out that federal law always supersedes state law and that states do not have the ability to waive federal laws.

The saddest part of this story is that Kansas as it exists outside of conservative politics and social orthodoxy is an incredibly attractive place to live, work and play. The state hosts the intersection of three bi-coastal interstate highways. State electric rates are among the lowest in the country and the electric generation mix is well-diversified (and therefore protected against volatile swings in the price of a single fuel source). The state is a leader in wind energy development.

So, my hope is that a group of business owners take a good look at relocating to Kansas. Then I hope they decide not to come and I hope they announce the reason behind their decision not to come. I hope they stand up and say “there are a lot of reason Kansas was an attractive home for our business. We decided not to come because we don’t think citizens are well cared for. We don’t think they are educated properly to work for our business. We think public safety is seriously threatened by loose gun laws promoted by zealots willing to shoot first and ask no questions later. We are concerned about an adherence to a specific form of religion that dominates public life to the exclusion of any contradictory worldviews. Our business requires open dialogue and disagreement to be successful. This is apparently not encouraged in Kansas. And more than anything, we are concerned that fiscal irresponsibility forces us to locate in a state that provides important protection and quality services to citizens so that our employees show up ready to work. These requirements are not met by the state and we will avoid doing business there until the state is more business friendly.""

That is my hope for the state of Kansas."

The U.S. military has yet to finalize where it will base the next fighter jet, the F-35

The Air National Guard has flown planes out of Burlington for more than 60 years

But some Vermont resident are vocally opposed to housing the new jets in their state

SOUTH BURLINGTON, Vt. (AP) — Plans on where to base the U.S. military's next-generation fighter jet, the F-35, concern people in communities from California to Florida to Maine who worry the aircraft are too loud.

In Vermont, where the Air National Guard has flown planes from Burlington International Airport for more than 60 years, opponents are especially vocal. But in other communities, even some long accustomed to the roar of military aircraft, the noise of the F-35 has been an issue.

South Burlington City Council President Rosanne Greco, a retired Air Force officer, said she favored bringing the F-35 to her community until she read the draft environmental impact statement released last spring.

The F-35s ""will have incredibly significant negative impact on up to 10,000 people who will be unfortunate enough to be in the noise contour zone that the federal government deems unsuitable for residential use,"" Greco said. ""For me it's become a clear-cut analytical choice. The facts say this is harmful to our environment.""

The report, she said, considers exposure to average aircraft noise greater than 65 decibels (about the sound of a vacuum cleaner about three feet away) ""not considered suitable for residential use."" Another section discusses the potential long-term health impacts of exposure to aircraft noise.

The plane's supporters say Greco is exaggerating the number of people who would be affected by the noise contour zone. And they believe she and others are cherry-picking information from the report without providing its full context. There is a section of the report that discusses long-term health effects, for example, but it concludes there aren't any significant health impacts.

The Air Force already has chosen where it will base the F-35s, also known as the Joint Strike Fighter, for training. The next step is to decide where to base the first operational planes, those that would be ready for war.

""Vermont is the most vocal, but Vermont is the preferred alternative for the Guard unit,"" Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek said. ""But it's the not the only alternative.""

Plans are to base 18 to 24 of the new aircraft in South Burlington by 2020. The military's final decision on the first round of operational bases is expected next spring.

How much louder the planes are than other aircraft is debatable. Opponents cite Air Force charts indicating the F-35 can be at least twice as loud as the F-16 now flown out of Vermont. Others say that's an unfair comparison because measuring sound involves everything from how the planes are flown to weather conditions, the time of day and how long people are exposed.

F-35 supporters in Vermont say the opponents — who have a Facebook page and a separate website — are a small group of activists who number maybe 300. The city of South Burlington, home to the airport, opposes the planes, mostly because of the noise.

Gov. Peter Shumlin and the state's congressional delegation favor bringing the F-35 to Vermont. There are three pro-F-35 Facebook pages and one business group has collected almost 11,000 signatures in support.

If the 18-plane option for Vermont is chosen, considered most likely, the F-35 isn't expected to bring new jobs to the area but it would guarantee about 1,100 well-paying jobs already here. Six additional planes would add about 250 more jobs.

If the Vermont Guard isn't chosen, Col. David Baczewski, commander of the Vermont Guard's 158th fighter wing and a veteran F-16 pilot, said there would be no immediate impact on the current F-16 operations in Burlington.

He said he worries that if the Department of Defense orders another round of base closings, Vermont could be forced to compete against other guard units to keep its role as a front-line fighter base.

""I'd rather separate myself from the pack, be the leading-edge, top fighter wing that we are (and) get named (to fly) the F-35 right off the bat and secure the future,"" Baczewski said.

Noise concerns have followed the F-35 since it first began flying. Pegged at about $130 million each for the Air Force version, it is the military's most expensive procurement program ever. The F-35 is designed to be the nation's supersonic and most advanced fighter through mid-century, with different models for the Air Force, Navy and Marines.

Despite its cost and noise concerns, there is no other alternative as the plane, nicknamed the Lightning II, is intended to replace fighter planes mostly designed in the 1970s.

In California, the Marine Corps Air Station Miramar is slated to get F-35s in several years, but environmental groups have already questioned the potential impact on endangered species. Neighbors have said they don't want the plane rattling their windows.

Noise concerns also have been raised in Arizona, where the Marines and Air Force are basing F-35s in Yuma and Phoenix, about 185 apart.

In Florida's Panhandle, an area long-accustomed to the sounds of military aircraft, a lawsuit by the city of Valparaiso in part over noise concerns prompted the Air Force to change the Eglin Air Force Base runways the F-35s would use, in most instances, to avoid flying over the city.

Air Force and Marine pilots at Eglin began F-35 training missions last March. Since then F-35 pilots have flown about 600 sorties, with about 2 percent generating noise complaints, a number the base considers small.

Some of the complaints come on days the F-35s are not flying, said base spokesman Mike Spaits.

""We empathize with their plight, but the reality is there does seem to be some level of hysteria involved with the noise complaints on the F-35,"" he said.

Maine is home to one of the Northeast's largest aerial training areas, the 4,000-square-mile Military Operation Area Condor, which extends into northern New Hampshire. Concerns about the noise of the F-35 play into long-running mistrust among some in Maine about low-level military training flights.

Current plans call for the F-35 to be operated above 7,000 feet over Maine, but there are special low-level corridors.

Some Maine residents seem resigned to the prospect that the louder F-35s will be operating over Maine, said Tom Mauzaka, a retired Air Force colonel, who lives in the western Maine town of Strong.

""This plane is loud,"" said Mauzaka. ""It would be loud at 7,000 feet.""

Little, if any, opposition has come from the other two Air Guard bases seen as suitable for operating the F-35s, Jacksonville, Fla., Air National Guard base and McEntire Joint National Guard Base in Eastover, S.C. But in another area of South Carolina, plans to base the F-35 at the Marine Corps Air Station in Beaufort have brought complaints about potential noise.

Back in Vermont, Winooski Mayor Michael O'Brien, whose city is about a mile from the north end of the runway, traveled to Eglin Air Force Base last month with Shumlin and other officials to listen to the F-16 and F-35 fly over, one after another.

Winooski opposes basing the F-35 at the South Burlington airport if the planes are significantly louder than the F-16s. O'Brien said he was at one end of an Eglin runway while the different planes went over in a number of different configurations.

""They are both loud, but it was hard to really get a handle on just how much louder,"" O'Brien said. ""It didn't blow my socks off, the difference."""

Bush will make a rare post-presidential foray into politics on Wednesday when he delivers a speech about immigration, thrusting himself into a contentious internal policy debate which has split the Republican Party he once led.

GOP lawmakers are already sending signals that his thoughts won't sway them but immigration reform is one of the great unfinished items of Bush’s presidency. His words on the matter are all the more noteworthy considering how hesitant he has been to delve into politics since leaving office, preferring instead to pursue other activities, such as charity work and his new painting hobby.

But his absence from the public stage has been more than self-imposed. Republicans have often turned their backs on his two-term presidency since he left office highly unpopular in most polls. The former president has not been a staple on the campaign trail as many former presidents have been, and he was kept so far away from the 2012 campaign that his brother, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, was left to defend his record and legacy at last year’s Republican convention.

Largely because of that history, Bush’s sentiments don’t appear to matter much to many House Republicans, who now control the fate of comprehensive immigration reform and will huddle behind closed doors to plot their path forward on the issue the same day Bush speaks at a naturalization ceremony at his presidential library in Texas. They’ve already signaled that Bush won’t have much impact on their deliberations of a bipartisan bill passed by the Senate last month.

It’s unclear precisely what Bush will say in his remarks but in a recent interview he reiterated his view that it is “very important to fix a broken system, to treat people with respect and have confidence in our capacity to assimilate people.”

Rep. Tim Griffin, an Arkansas Republican who served as a political aide in the Bush White House, flatly said “no” when asked whether his former boss’s words would weigh on his or other Republicans’ thinking on immigration.

“We represent our constituents. I think he's a great man, and I respect him greatly,” Griffin said. “But I've got 85 to 95 percent of constituents’ calls to my office against the Senate bill every week.”

The battle over comprehensive immigration reform into which Bush is wading is just the latest and broadest example of the internal battle over the trajectory of the GOP. It’s a fight pitting dogged, grassroots conservatives against establishment Republicans who worry that itinerant conservatism will irreparably harm the party – in this case, with the increasingly influential bloc of Hispanic voters.

Bush’s remarks during a naturalization ceremony at his presidential library could ostensibly break through that rift.

A number of Republicans in Congress have come to Washington in the elections since Bush left office, and the party’s identity is more tied into opposing President Barack Obama than celebrating the legacy of Obama’s predecessor. But the fight over comprehensive immigration reform during the Bush administration in many ways presaged the GOP’s struggles with Hispanic voters since conservatives drove the Republican president’s immigration proposals into the ground in 2007.

Republican proponents of comprehensive immigration reform argue that conservatives would be well-served to tune into Bush’s remarks on Wednesday.

“I think it's a reminder that he, a Republican president, tried so hard to get immigration done and it is unfinished business for him,” Ana Navarro, a prominent Republican advocate of immigration reform, said of Bush’s speech. “And I suspect that it won't be lost on some of the bigger thinkers in the GOP that the guy giving the speech was the last Republican to win the presidency and did it with 44 percent of the Hispanic vote.” (An NBC News analysis determined that Bush won 40 percent of the Latino vote in the 2004 election, still up considerably from John McCain’s 31 percent in 2008 and Mitt Romney’s 27 percent in 2012.)

“No, he's not going to sway Steve King,” she added, referring to the hardline Iowa conservative congressman. “But yes, his voice will make a difference to some and it's the right thing for him to do.”

Bush’s counsel for Republicans in his ABC interview was understated. “Good policy yields good politics, as far as I’m concerned,” the former president said.

Not that Bush’s endorsement of the Senate immigration reform law, which passed last month with bipartisan support, would necessarily make a difference.

“I'll take the hypothetical. If he were to come out for the Senate bill, in all due respect, I would say he's wrong,” said Griffin.

It doesn’t help that Bush’s cachet among conservatives had steadily eroded over the course of his second term. Mike Needham, the head of the conservative Heritage Action for America (which opposes the Senate-passed immigration reform proposal), said that after mounting government spending and Bush’s failed Supreme Court nomination of Harriet Miers, “the immigration bill did nothing to enamor the base to President Bush.”

“I think there's a strong sense among the conservative base that fundamentally the deck is stacked against people across the country and in favor of special interests,” he said.

And to the extent that Bush’s arguments threaten to fall largely upon deaf ears, it reflects the drastic shifts in the GOP over the course of just a few years. The balance of power now favors groups like Heritage Action rather than one of the two surviving former Republican presidents.

“Fundamentally, where the Republican establishment misses the boat is that people just don't trust Washington,” Needham said.

Combat aircraft from multiple commands are flying again after the service obligated $208 million for flight hours from a $1.8 billion shift in budget allocations authorized by Congress, the Air Force said Monday in a statement.

Although the Thunderbirds will resume training flights, the squadron won’t be restoring its canceled schedule of air shows for this year. It is acting “with the anticipation that it may be able to resume a limited number of aerial demonstrations next calendar year,” Maj. Darrick Lee, a spokesman for the Thunderbirds, said in a separate statement on its Web site.

The cancellation of pilot flying hours for training began soon after the automatic budget cuts, called sequestration, were triggered in March. The Pentagon is absorbing about $37 billion in cuts through Sept. 30, the end of this fiscal year.

More than 650,000 civilian Defense Department workers have also been forced to take 11 unpaid days off under sequestration.

“Since April we’ve been in a precipitous decline with regard to combat readiness,” Gen. Mike Hostage, commander of the Air Combat Command at Joint Base Langley-Eustis in Virginia, said in the statement. “Returning to flying is an important first step, but what we have ahead of us is a measured climb to recovery.”

About 300 combat and training aircraft from multiple combat units will have flying hours restored, Lt. Col. Edward Sholtis, an Air Combat Command spokesman, said by e-mail.

Planes may be grounded again after Oct. 1, when the beginning of a new fiscal year will require an additional $52 billion in Defense, unless Congress and President Obama agree on a deficit-reduction alternative.

Hostage said the shift in funds to finance flight hours means less money for investments to modernize the force.

“We are using investment dollars to pay current operational bills, and that approach is not without risk to our long-term effectiveness,” he said in the statement. “We can’t mortgage our future.”

Sen. John McCain of Arizona, a senior Republican on the Armed Services Committee, issued a statement praising the Air Force for “working creatively to keep our pilots in the skies, if only temporarily, but this decision is a Band-Aid solution that cannot be sustained.”"

(CNN) —

In the past few weeks, we’ve seen a British soldier hacked to death with a meat cleaver on the streets of London and bombers blowing up spectators at the Boston Marathon.

On the surface, terrorism is alive and well.

So how should the United States react to these continuing threats?

Tim Hetherington for CNN Peter Bergen

For the first time on Thursday, President Obama laid out the full scope of his proposed counterterrorism strategy, and it boiled down to this: George W. Bush’s endless war on terror is over.

And that’s appropriate, since the enemy Bush went to war with after September 11 has largely been defeated.

Obama’s speech at the National Defense University in Washington was designed to lay the political groundwork to wind down America’s longest war, the war that began when al Qaeda destroyed the World Trade Center and a wing of the Pentagon 12 years ago.

Thursday’s speech was the first time Obama had delivered an overarching framework for how to conceptualize the conflict that has defined U.S. national security policy since 9/11.

Other speeches by Obama have focused on aspects of that conflict, such as Guantanamo and the Afghan war. But no speech has made such an expansive examination of the war against al Qaeda and its allies in all its manifestations, from drone strikes to detention policies to a clear-eyed assessment of the scope of the threats posed by al Qaeda and its affiliates, as well as by those “homegrown” extremists who attacked the Boston Marathon in April.

Much of the coverage of the speech has centered on the measures the president outlined to impose greater constraints on CIA drone strikes and to try to hasten the eventual closing of Guantanamo.

But the most significant aspect of the speech was the president’s case that the “perpetual wartime footing” and “boundless war on terror” that has permeated so much of American life since 9/11 should come to an end.

Obama argued that the time has come to redefine the kind of conflict that the United States is engaged in: “We must define the nature and scope of this struggle, or else it will define us.”

This is why the president focused part of his speech on a discussion of the seemingly arcane Authorization for the Use of Military Force that Congress passed days after 9/11 and that gave Bush the authority to go to war in Afghanistan against al Qaeda and its Taliban allies.

Few, if any, in Congress who voted for the authorization understood at the time that they were voting for a virtual blank check that has provided the legal basis for more than a decade of war. It is a war that has expanded in recent years to other countries in the Middle East and Africa, such as Yemen and Somalia, where the U.S. has engaged in covert military operations against al Qaeda-affiliated groups.

Theoretically, when U.S. combat troops finally withdraw from Afghanistan in December 2014, the authorization should simply expire, and the nation will no longer be at war. After all, once combat operations are over in Afghanistan, why would you want to keep in place an authorization for a permanent war?

However, there are now some in Congress who would like to expand the scope of the Authorization for the Use of Military Force beyond its present parameters to include military operations against terrorist groups that were not involved in the 9/11 attacks, which could prolong America’s wars indefinitely and add additional terrorist groups to the United States’ list of enemies it is at war with.

U.S. Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tennessee, ranking member of the influential Senate Foreign Relations Committee, for instance, last month called for an expansion of the scope of the authorization.

Obama made it quite clear in his Thursday speech that he would oppose such an expansion, saying he hopes instead to “ultimately repeal the AUMF’s mandate. And I will not sign laws designed to expand this mandate further.”

In short, Obama intends to end a seemingly endless war.

That’s because, according to Obama, “the core of al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan is on the path to defeat. Their remaining operatives spend more time thinking about their own safety than plotting against us.”

On Thursday, Obama asserted (in my view, correctly) that what remains of the terrorist threat, while significant and persistent, is nothing on the scale of the al Qaeda organization that launched the 9/11 operation and instead consists of “less capable al Qaeda affiliates, threats to diplomatic facilities and businesses abroad, homegrown extremists.”

These threats, the president further asserted, can be managed by carefully targeted drone strikes overseas and efforts to counter extremist ideology at home and do not require some kind of broader war.

Obama is also looking to his legacy and the presidents who will follow him and is trying to begin to create the public consensus and legal framework that will help to ensure that the United States isn’t “drawn into more wars we don’t need to fight, or continue to grant presidents unbound powers more suited for traditional armed conflicts between nation states.”

Obama clearly hopes to leave office in 2016 as the commander in chief who finally ended America’s longest war.

He writes a monthly column for The Post.

The United States has generally been a great force for the promotion of democracy around the world. But no one should be surprised that President Obama winked at last week’s military coup in Egypt. American support for democracy has never been consistent. The United States backed many “friendly” dictators throughout the 20th century and even toppled democratically elected governments or winked at coups against them — as Eisenhower did in the case of Mossadegh in Iran and Arbenz in Guatemala, and as Nixon did in the case of Allende in Chile.

Obama, however, probably did not see himself as an upholder of this particular tradition when he entered the White House (though his advisers like to compare him to Eisenhower). At the start of his presidency, Obama apologized to the Iranian people for the overthrow of Mossa­degh. In “The Audacity of Hope,” he criticized previous administrations for viewing “nationalist movements, ethnic struggles, reform efforts” as threatening and for letting such fears outweigh “our professed commitment to freedom and democracy.” He noted, too, how “the removal of democratically elected leaders in countries like Iran” had produced “seismic repercussions that haunt us to this day.”

American embarrassment about past acquiescence to dictatorships and military coups is widespread. It is a major theme of high school history textbooks and college courses on foreign policy. In recent decades, leaders of both parties have tried to push U.S. policy in a different direction. Under Ronald Reagan, the United States lent support to democratic movements that toppled “friendly” dictatorships in the Philippines, Korea, Haiti and elsewhere (though not in the Middle East). The Clinton administration worked to hold the new democracies in Eastern and Central Europe to high democratic standards. The George W. Bush administration tried, albeit unevenly, to reshape American relations with the dictatorships of the Arab world, particularly Egypt. Across the ideological spectrum, one of the big lessons of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks was that dictatorships helped breed terrorism and that the best cure would be an Arab political opening. Obama embraced that opening when it came and thus cautiously embraced the broad post-Cold War consensus. 1 of 86 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Tom Toles goes global View Photos A collection of cartoons about international news. Caption A collection of Tom Toles cartoons about international news. Wait 1 second to continue.

Yet how quickly that consensus has crumbled in the face of its first difficult test — the election of the Muslim Brotherhood and Mohamed Morsi in Egypt. And yes, that was a very difficult test. Morsi was not only an incompetent ruler but also in many ways an undemocratic one. He imposed restrictions on the media and excluded the opposition from important constitutional decisions. He ruled not so much as a dictator but as a majoritarian, which often amounted to the same thing. With a majority in parliament and a large national following, and with no experience whatsoever in the give-and-take of democratic governance, Morsi failed in the elementary task of creating a system of compromise, inclusiveness, and checks and balances. He was the opposite of a Mandela. He also failed as a manager of the national economy, unwilling to make an agreement with the International Monetary Fund and to carry out difficult but necessary economic reforms.

For his incompetence, he deserved to be voted out of office at the next election. For his majoritarian and undemocratic practices, he deserved to be placed under sustained domestic and international pressure, especially by the United States, the leading provider of aid to Egypt. He deserved to have the United States not only suspend its bilateral aid to Egypt but also block any IMF agreement until he entered into a meaningful, substantive dialogue with his political opponents, including on amending the flawed constitution he rammed through in December as well as electoral law. He ought to have been ostracized and isolated by the international democratic community. Morsi is certainly not the only democratically elected leader to have acted undemocratically in recent years, and these are the kinds of actions the United States and other democracies have generally taken in response. And all this would have been a great deal more pressure than Hosni Mubarak ever faced except in the final two weeks of his 30-year rule.

But was a military coup the best answer? The good news is that a bad leader is gone. Yet that is where the good news ends. People talk cheerfully about starting over in building an Egyptian democracy. But the slate is hardly clean, and the obstacles to Egyptian democracy are greater than they were before the coup.

The military, having effectively deposed two Egyptian leaders in 2½ years, has firmly established itself as the only real power in the country. Mohamed ElBaradei and other secular leaders are happy to have been vaulted into positions of apparent power, but one wonders how real or long-lasting their influence will be. Live by the sword, die by the sword: If the military can depose one democratically elected government, it can depose another. What happens when Egyptian “people power” returns to confront the next government, as it surely will? Once again the military will have the choice of intervening or not. Its decision is likely to have a lot to do with how the military feels about that government. So who will wield the real power when the next crisis comes?

And the next crises are entirely predictable. The economic problems that Morsi inherited and failed to solve require significant sacrifices by average Egyptians, who have already sacrificed much. Such reforms would be difficult to implement even in a calm political climate, and the post-coup climate will be anything but calm. At least some portion of the millions who voted for Morsi have probably come to two conclusions: first, that democracy is a sham; and, second, that what matters in Egypt is who has the guns. Some followers of the Muslim Brotherhood may well decide that violence is their best and only recourse. And the military will in turn impose more-severe limitations on civil liberties to combat the violence, employing — along with the police — their traditional brutal methods. They may even attempt to prevent the Brotherhood from fielding candidates in the next election. After all, having deposed one Muslim Brotherhood government, the military may not think it wise to let another, possibly angrier Brotherhood government get elected six months from now. What will the secular liberal civilians now allied with the military do as these threats to personal liberties and democratic processes metastasize? On Thursday, as the military was arresting dozens of Muslim Brotherhood leaders, ElBaradei said he would be the first “to shout loud and clearly if I see any sign of regression in terms of democracy.” One wonders when he will choose to see it, and what will happen to him if he ever does start shouting.

Egypt is not starting over. It has taken a large step backward. And the Obama administration bears much blame. It put little or no meaningful pressure on Mubarak to make even minor political reforms that might have been enough to prevent the anti-regime outburst that exploded at the end of 2010. Then it put little or no tangible pressure on Morsi to end his undemocratic practices, which might have forestalled the most recent crisis.

It has become fashionable in today’s “post-American world” milieu to argue that the United States had no ability to shape events in Egypt. This is absurd. The United States is far from being all-powerful, but neither is it powerless. Americans provide $1.5 billion a year in assistance to Egypt, $1.3 billion of which goes to the Egyptian military. It has leverage over the decisions of the IMF and influence with other international donors on whom Egypt’s economy depends. The U.S. ambassador to Egypt wields so much potential influence that Egyptians obsess daily over whom she is meeting, and they concoct wild conspiracies based on trivial events. The assumption in Egypt, as in much of the Arab world, is that nothing happens unless the United States wills it. The problem is not that the United States has no power but that the Obama administration has been either insufficiently interested or too cautious and afraid to use what power the United States has.

It has also become fashionable once again to argue that Muslim Arabs are incapable of democracy — this after so many millions of them came out to vote in Egypt, only to see Western democracies do little or nothing when the product of their votes was overthrown. Had the United States showed similar indifference in the Philippines and South Korea, I suppose wise heads would still be telling us that Asians, too, have no vocation for democracy.

So now that the military coup has occurred, how do we avoid the “seismic repercussions”? Any answer must begin with a complete suspension of all aid to Egypt, especially military aid, until there is a new democratic government, freely elected with the full participation of all parties and groups in Egypt, including the Muslim Brotherhood. The Obama administration then needs to work closely with other nations and the IMF to ensure that no loans or other forms of economic aid are provided to Egypt until democratic governance is restored. This approach runs contrary to the Obama administration’s instincts, which until now have been to work cooperatively with whoever holds power in Egypt and to avoid overt forms of pressure.

It is past time to get out of this rut of failure. Better to learn from our history than to repeat it. It will be sad if some future American president has to apologize to Egyptians for what Barack Obama did, and did not do, in 2013."

Tech lobbyists want to nearly double annual visas for skilled foreign workers to 110%2C000

Yet CEOs of some start-ups are going overseas to find workers with the technical skills

Microsoft%2C IBM%2C Cisco Systems have hired thousands of Indian engineers%2C consultants over past decade

SAN FRANCISCO — While the path to U.S. citizenship sketched out in an immigration-reform bill passed by the Senate is a long one, a key part of one industry isn't waiting to see whether Congress delivers what it wants.

Even while technology-industry lobbyists fight hard in Washington to nearly double the number of annual visas for skilled foreign workers — to 110,000, as the Senate bill calls for — the CEOs of some fast-growing start-ups are already going overseas to find workers with the technical skills they need.

That includes Lew Cirne, CEO of New Relic, a San Francisco-based maker of software that boosts the efficiency of applications that run on corporate computer networks.

Of the 225 engineers working at its headquarters and Portland, Ore., office, just eight are foreign nationals in the U.S. on H-1B visas, Cirne says.

Yet two years ago, when he began to plan another product line — ""one that can help take us from a $100 million company (in annual revenue) to a billion-dollar-company in a few years,"" he says — he turned to a programmer who lives and works in Brisbane, Australia, to help develop New Relic's next-generation software code.

""We have a bias to hiring here. We're not looking to reduce costs by moving jobs overseas,"" says Cirne, whose previous start-up, Wily Technology, had more than 400 employees when it was acquired by CA Technologies, a larger rival, for $375 million in 2006.

""We're competing for the top talent, no matter where it is,"" says Cirne, a native of Canada and naturalized U.S. citizen.

He is far from alone.

A growing number of small, private U.S. technology companies — who, like, New Relic are late-stage start-ups with more than $100 million in annual sales — now have engineering offices overseas.

A decade ago, such offices were de rigueur for start-ups backed by marquee venture-capital firms, who pushed their portfolio companies to move some engineering work overseas — mostly to India — to cut costs.

But that labor arbitrage never provided all the savings that companies had hoped for, once the rupee had risen to where the cost of office space in Mumbai equaled or even exceeded that of similar space in Silicon Valley, as it does today.

And the logistical headaches caused by trying to manage workers located many time zones away caused even some large companies to question the value of offshoring engineering work.

While the motivation for large U.S. technology companies to hire foreign workers back then was based primarily on a desire for cost savings — and Microsoft, IBM, Cisco Systems and others all hired thousands of Indian engineers and consultants over the past decade for that reason — the start-ups of today are hiring foreign workers in different places, and for different reasons.

Perhaps the most important reason — along with trying to hire the very best engineers, mathematicians and computer scientists — is that doing so is so much easier than it used to be.

When San Francisco-based Zendesk was looking to open a development office in Europe in 2011, CEO Mikkel Svane and his two co-founders were able to begin their search using contacts they'd made in the software developer community of their hometown of Copenhagen.

The three Danes all moved to San Francisco in 2009, when the help-desk software start-up they'd founded two years earlier outgrew the apartment in which they'd launched it. Yet they'd been able to follow online the work of others who — like them — wrote code in a new programming language called Ruby on Rails.

While two-thirds of its 120 engineers and technical workers are located in San Francisco or Madison, Wis. — home to the Badger State's largest university — three dozen or so work either in London, Dublin, Tokyo, Berlin, Copenhagen or Melbourne, Svane says.

The company now employs almost 400 workers — up from 90 just 24 months ago — and has tripled its number of customers to 30,000 during that time, according to Svane.

TECH'S ANSWER TO 'MONEYBALL'

A start-up's need to produce innovation on a tight budget against entrenched, better-funded rivals forces them to search high and low for workers who can deliver great new products — and who will accept a lower wage than they'd get at a large company.

In exchange, those employees get the chance to work 70- to 80-hour weeks in hopes of building something that could be big.

People willing to take those kinds of risks are similar to the immigrants who — like Cirne and Svane — have come to this country for more than 200 years to pursue their own version of the American dream. About 40% of the current Fortune 500 companies are founded by immigrants or their children.

Other research has shown that, on average, every 100 foreign students who remain in this country after receiving an advanced degree in science, technology, engineering or math (a so-called STEM degree) create 262 additional jobs.

Before the days of online forums for computer-programming languages, small U.S. companies that wanted to compete for the best technical talent had to rely either on their own personal networks — as Cirne did — or try to compete with larger rivals for the graduates of advanced-degree programs at U.S. universities.

The percentage of foreign nationals enrolled in advanced STEM degree programs has remained fairly constant over the last two decades, 33% in 2009 from 31% in 1990, according to a report compiled for Congress in May 2012 by the Congressional Research Service.

During that same time, however, the total number of such students surged 64% to 149,000 from 91,000, as university programs sought to keep pace with a fast-growing industry.

The problem for U.S. tech companies is that, as the need to hire more skilled workers has increased, the number of visas for skilled workers hasn't.

Although Congress temporarily raised the number of annual H-1B visas to 115,000 in 1998, the limit reverted to 65,000 in 2004.

That means a growing number of workers with advanced STEM degrees from U.S. universities have been forced to go back to their home countries to look for work — even while U.S. companies want to hire them.

""I get calls every day from hiring managers and (human resource) execs looking to bring in foreign STEM workers into the U.S. to help them grow their businesses here,"" says Charles Small, an immigration attorney in San Francisco for more than a decade.

But given a six-month minimum wait time, and the fact that the 65,000 cap on H-1Bs for this year was reached on the very first day that the government began accepting visa applications, any skilled foreign worker that a company found today couldn't start work until Oct. 1, 2014, at the earliest, Small says.

With the Senate moving on a tech-friendly bill, those working on raising the number of H-1B visas now turn their attention to the House, which in past years has voted out of committee several bills that would establish a new type of visa for workers in STEM fields.

There is a new sense of urgency after several other countries — including Canada, Australia and Chile — have loosened their own immigration laws to make it easier for their own companies to hire skilled foreign workers.

""The tech industry will do everything it can to get a bill passed … that makes sure the U.S. remains the center of innovation,"" says Dean Garfield, CEO of the Information Technology Industry Council, an industry trade group.

As things slowly move forward in Washington, start-ups are going wherever they can to find more skilled workers.

King.com, a maker of some of the most popular social games on Facebook, has 100 engineers in Stockholm.

Its website lists dozens of open tech jobs in London, Hamburg, Barcelona, Bucharest and several other overseas offices.

Optimizely, a start-up here, hired its first H-1B worker this year, says CEO Dan Siroker, a former Google product manager. Under current visa rules, the employee can't start until Oct. 1.

Zendesk now lists all new engineering positions in each of its multiple locations around the globe. That approach has helped the company overcome ""the huge challenge of trying to hire technical talent in San Francisco, where the competition is so fierce,"" says CEO Svane.

So rather than debate whether more skilled foreign workers will take jobs away from Americans, perhaps Congress should pass a bill that prevents more high-skilled jobs from heading overseas.

Diocese’s Archbishop Gomez pushes immigration overhaul bill,"As a child, L.A. Archbishop Jose Horacio Gomez traveled back and forth across the border from his home in Monterrey, Mexico, to his uncle’s in San Antonio, Texas. He made the trip so often that he hardly distinguished between Mexico and the United States.

“It was easy to cross in those times,” says Gomez, now 61, who became a citizen in his mid-40s. “I guess my first impression was that people could live in both countries at the same time.”

When he talks about the border, he slips into the Spanish slang of his childhood. He uses migra for U.S. immigration officials and mica for the old-style border-crossing cards he needed to visit his American cousins in Texas.

“I’m an immigrant myself,” he says, squinting behind his rimless glasses as he smiles.

Gomez’s two-year tenure as the leader of the nation’s largest archdiocese has been marked by a decidedly quieter and more cautious style than that of his predecessor, Cardinal Roger Mahony, who was quick to chime in on hot-button issues such as illegal immigration and workers’ rights.

But in recent weeks, as debate over the most comprehensive immigration reform bill in a generation reaches a head, Gomez is taking a firm and public stand.

He has released a book that touches on his experiences as an immigrant and in an impassioned sermon he affirmed his support for the immigration reform bill, which would create a 13-year path to citizenship for the 11 million immigrants living in the country without legal status.

From inside and outside the Catholic Church, Gomez’s new public persona is drawing attention. Some who saw Gomez as unwilling to take on issues in the same way Mahony did are now praising Gomez for campaigning on behalf of immigrants. And many church observers see Gomez as trying to use his position as the highest-ranking Latino in the U.S Catholic Church to effect change on a deeply personal issue.

“I’m glad that he has added his voice to this dialogue,” said Jorge-Mario Cabrera of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles. “When he speaks, people will listen.”

But with a topic as nuanced as immigration, Gomez’s stance has also opened him up to criticism. Frank DeMartini, a practicing Catholic who runs a blog called “A Hollywood Republican,” said he interpreted the book as something of a scolding for members of the church who don’t support a path to citizenship for people who are in the country illegally.

“Instead of taking a political stance on it, he made it seem anti-Catholic,” he said.

But Gomez seems undeterred.

Two Sundays ago, he celebrated a special Mass in recognition of immigrants at the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels in downtown. Busloads of people from the dioceses in San Bernardino and Orange attended, as did Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti and U.S. Reps. Xavier Becerra (D-Los Angeles) and Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-East Los Angeles).

In his homily — delivered seamlessly in poetic Spanish and slightly slower English — Gomez reminded the congregants to think of immigration in terms of souls, not statistics.

“We are talking about fathers who, without warning, won’t be coming home for dinner tonight,” he said.

Then, a student visiting from a parish in the Valley stood before the standing-room-only crowd and shared her story.

Her parents brought her to the U.S. from Guatemala when she was 6. She worked hard in school but always knew that without the right immigration documents she probably couldn’t attend her dream college. But, in what her mom would later describe as a miracle, she applied for President Obama’s “deferred action” and got it. Now, she told the congregation, she has a full-ride scholarship to Harvard for this fall.

Toward the end of the Mass, Gomez made a spirited plea. He asked everyone to, please, contact their congressmen and push them to pass comprehensive immigration reform.

“Soon,” he said, his voice billowing. “Now. As soon as possible.”

In Gomez’s new book, “Immigration and the Next America: Renewing the Soul of Our Nation” — 116 pages of historical context, personal anecdotes and calls for grace dedicated to the new pope — the archbishop asks pointed questions.

“Do we really believe that America is one nation under God, made up from every other people?” he writes. “Or is America instead a nation that is essentially white, Anglo-Saxon, and Protestant, but permits the presence of peoples of other races, colors, and religions?”

Father Allan Figueroa Deck, who teaches theological studies at Loyola Marymount University, said he liked the tone and message of Gomez’s book and was happy to hear him speaking up on the topic. As the most powerful Latino in the U.S. Catholic Church, Deck said, anything Gomez says carries an extra weight.

“We’re delighted,” Deck said. “Much is at stake and the archbishop is being very proactive in trying to get the message out.”

Gomez has also taken steps to minister in his native tongue. Once a month, he records “Diálogo de Fe,” a Spanish-language radio and TV show aimed at engaging and growing the Latino Catholic community. And he often visits the parish in Santa Monica where many of the city’s Oaxacan immigrants worship.

“I think the big difference is Mahony could speak out of compassion and teaching, and Gomez can speak from being Hispanic himself,” said John Allen, senior correspondent for the National Catholic Reporter.

That rings true for Roberto Magaña, an immigrant from El Salvador who attends Mass at the cathedral downtown almost every day. It’s not uncommon, he said, for the congregation to break into applause on days when Gomez broaches the topic of immigration.

“He’s very influential in the way that he’s a Spanish-speaking person and a Mexican,” Magaña said.

As Gomez sits at a long table in the cathedral’s conference room, a red crucifix and a photo of fellow clergymen in black robes frame his round face. He sighs, puts his hands together and reflects on a realization he had after moving to the U.S. in the 1980s.

The views of the come-and-go-as-you-please border he knew growing up looked different from this side — a tone shift punctuated by the amnesty law of 1986.

Mexican Americans told him they often felt rejected and mistreated. During his ministry in San Antonio, he met desperate immigrants who explained that waiting even one week for permission to come to the U.S. meant that their kids would skip meals. And while he worked in the Houston diocese in the early 1990s, a fellow priest told him about how la migra pulled over a van full of people on their way to Mass and deported most of them to Mexico.

Having had all of those experiences — and knowing that many people in the U.S. will never get them — inspired him to write the book, he said.

“I’m trying to … explain to people so they can understand why they came here without papers and broke the law,” he said. “There is a reason for that, and we have to be understanding and compassionate and find a solution.”

(CNN) —

Last November, Hispanic voters planted the seeds for serious immigration reform when they backed President Barack Obama by a record margin.

This April, we’ll see if those seeds can grow in Capitol Hill’s toxic partisan soil.

Congress returns from spring break Monday, and immigration reform tops the agenda. The Senate’s bipartisan “Gang of Eight” is preparing to release its long-awaited plan for resolving the status of 11 million undocumented men, women, and children now living in America’s shadows.

Can a unique confluence of factors – a Democratic president trying to build his legacy, a Republican Party grappling with new demographic realities – overcome the usual strong bias for inaction in a sharply divided Congress? The answer remains unclear.

“What we have now is not a 21st century legal immigration system,” GOP Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, a key conservative at the heart of the talks, said back in January. “We have an obligation and the need to address the reality of the situation that we face.”

Who’s in the Gang of Eight? The list includes Rubio; Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina; Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona; Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Arizona; Sen. Robert Menendez, D-New Jersey; Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois; Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colorado; and Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York.

Farm worker dispute holding up immigration bill

Details of the Senate plan

A source familiar with negotiations recently told CNN that the eight senators have tentatively reached agreement on some of the thorniest issues, including the establishment of a path to citizenship and the creation of a system to assess the state of border security.

The Senate proposal could come “in the next couple of weeks,” Graham said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” But McCain told reporters later Sunday morning that he still thinks “it’s very likely” and “very possible” to have it done by the end of the week.

“I’m guardedly optimistic. I can’t guarantee it. But we have literally almost all of the issues resolved,” he said.

Specifically, the senators have agreed to a 13-year path to citizenship, the source said. It would take 10 years for undocumented workers to get a green card, and then another three years to gain citizenship.

Along the way, undocumented workers would have to pay a fine and back taxes, and pass a background check. The size of the fine remains unclear.

No undocumented worker would be eligible for citizenship until the border is considered secure. To measure border security, a commission would be created with the task of establishing and assessing a set of quantifiable criteria. The commission would be made up of officials named by state and federal leaders.

Sides reach broad agreement on immigrant guest workers

Disagreement over agricultural workers

A sharp disagreement over the future treatment of undocumented workers on America’s farms, however, is currently holding up progress on the bill.

The two key sticking points are wages and the number of visas to be granted to undocumented farm workers, two other sources close to the talks confirmed Friday. Four senators – Rubio, Bennet, Utah Republican Orrin Hatch, and California Democrat Dianne Feinstein – are trying to deal with the matter.

“It’s the one major unresolved issue,” one of the sources told CNN.

The sources were unable to provide specifics in terms of the number of visas or wage levels under consideration. But generally speaking, agricultural businesses have an interest in more visas and lower wages. Labor leaders, in contrast, typically support fewer visas and higher wages.

Saying there are a “few little kerfuffles” to work out in the drafting of the legislation – referring to the disagreement over agricultural workers – Schumer told CNN on Sunday the senators have written “most of the bill” and feel hopeful that they can announce a full agreement at the end of the week.

“We’ve solved most of the issues, there are a few more to go, there are a few more today and tomorrow. I’m very optimistic we’ll be able to solve those last few problems,” he said, declining to get into specifics.

Language like ‘illegal immigrant’ seen as a challenge

Agreement on nonagricultural workers

Business and labor leaders appear to have settled on a deal establishing a new immigrant guest worker program for nonagricultural workers.

The compromise, according to another source, is the creation of a new “W” visa for lesser-skilled workers not working in agriculture. Those workers would be allowed to enter the country based on labor market shortages, and could enter with the possibility of eventually applying for citizenship.

The W visa would affect housekeepers, landscapers, retail workers and some construction workers, the source noted. The agreement does not address visas for high-skilled workers or family members.

According to the AFL-CIO’s understanding of the agreement, the visa program would launch in April 2015. The number of visas issued would never go below 20,000 per year and could rise as high as 200,000 annually, depending on employment levels.

One third of the visas would be reserved for businesses that employ fewer than 25 people, while no more than 15,000 visas per year would go to construction workers, the AFL-CIO said.

A new government department, the Bureau of Immigration and Labor Market Research, would determine specific industries with labor shortages and make recommendations to Congress. The agency would also play a role in setting an annual cap for W visas. The bureau would fall under the existing U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, and its director would be appointed by the president and confirmed by Congress.

“The beauty of this program is that it rises and falls with the economy,” the AFL-CIO’s Ana Avendano recently told CNN. “When the economy is booming, there will be more visas available for foreign workers. When it’s not, there won’t be, and that’s something we’ve never seen in the United States before.”

Randy Johnson, senior vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, released a statement declaring the proposed new visa program “a sound and workable program for the business community.”

Immigration tops agenda as senators tour border

Senate resistance

The Gang of Eight may be ideologically diverse, but that doesn’t mean there won’t be significant resistance to the plan once it’s released – especially among wary conservatives. GOP base voters remain vehemently opposed to any plan which could be construed as amnesty for those who entered the country illegally.

Liberal Democrats, meanwhile, remain concerned that conservatives will never agree the country’s southern border is secure, and will try to use that issue to continually deny citizenship to undocumented residents.

In the Senate, Alabama Republican Jeff Sessions and others have repeatedly expressed the fear that Democratic leaders will try to ram the Gang of Eight’s plan through before other members have a chance to properly consider the bill.

Top Democrats “want Congress to pass a far-reaching bill before the American people know what’s in it,” Sessions said in a statement released April 2. “Now that the special interests have what they want, the deal has been made: Force it through and set the public interest aside.”

Rubio has also said he’s worried the legislation may be rushed through Congress – a concern some observers say reflects political necessities as the Florida freshman balances his role in immigration reform with possible presidential ambitions.

Responding to GOP pressure to release details of the secretive Gang of Eight deliberations, Rubio promised Friday to brief his fellow Republican senators on Tuesday.

“This proposal will be a starting point,” Rubio wrote to four GOP colleagues. “I expect you will have ample opportunity to review, comment, and amend as you see fit.”

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, who will oversee the committee-level markup of the bill once it’s released, has repeatedly dismissed Sessions’ and Rubio’s concerns.

The Judiciary Committee “has already held several widely-attended hearings to examine the urgent need for comprehensive immigration reform,” Leahy said in an April 2 statement. “If we do not act quickly and decisively we will lose the opportunity we now have.”

Leahy said he hopes for a final Senate vote by this summer.

Immigration debate: High-stakes political poker

A House alternative

While most eyes are focused on the Senate, a bipartisan group of House members is working on its own version of immigration reform. Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, told reporters last month that the members are “essentially in agreement” on a plan to deal with the issue.

The House members involved in the talks are Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Florida; Rep. Sam Johnson, R-Texas; Rep. John Carter, R-Texas; Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho; Rep. Xavier Becerra, D-California; Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Illinois; Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-California; and Rep. John Yarmuth, D-Kentucky.

The members of the House group have been reluctant to talk publicly about their bipartisan negotiations. Some of them have been working on the issue since Congress failed to get a deal done in 2007.

However, two members of the House “Gang of Eight” sounded confident Sunday that their upcoming proposal will ultimately mesh well with the Senate’s proposal, despite expected battles over the issue in both chambers in the months ahead.

“I am very, very optimistic that the House of Representatives is going to have a plan that is going to be able to go to a conference with the Senate in which we’re going to be able to resolve differences,” Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Illinois, said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”

He was joined by his Republican colleague Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart of Florida.

Asked if the House version would have a similar border security prerequisite, the two House members seemed less certain.

“You can’t have a bill without border security. You just can’t,” Diaz-Balart said.

Pressed further on whether that provision would be a priority, Gutierrez said, “I think we can do this simultaneously.”

“I think first thing we’re going to do is, we’re going to put people in a safe place. That is 11 million people, you can give them a work permit, Social Security card, driver’s license,” he added. “And then the second part is the path to the green card, that permanent residency that leads to citizenship.”

What if Bush had paid attention to those warnings (as Clinton did)? 9-11 might well have been averted.

WHAT IF...Bush had valued what he inherited -- a balanced budget -- and DONE NOTHING. No massive tax cuts benefiting the top 1/10th of 1 percent. No massive deficits. 8 years -- budget still balanced, instead of trillions in new debt and a tax code designed to make the government untenable without savaging the social safety net.

WHAT IF...Bush had treated FEMA as a serious agency with a vital role to play in national emergencies? What if he'd appointed a serious administrator, instead of an incompetent crony bent on looting the agency and wrecking its ability to function properly? Katrina might have turned out quite differently.

WHAT IF...Bush had hadn't worked overtime to destroy the regulation of financial markets? What if he'd DONE NOTHING, and let regulatory agencies do their proper work? The financial crash of 2007-8 might never have happened.

WHAT IF...most importantly...Bush/Cheney/Rumsfeld hadn't conjured stove-piped ""intel"" to stampede us into war after 9-11? No trillion dollar wars, shoveled onto the spiraling national debt...no thousands of American soldiers killed...no hundreds of thousands of Iraqis killed...no Abu Ghraib...no disillusionment of the American public in our ability to fight and win wars...

What always struck me about Bush and his incompetent cronies is the activist nature of their ""wreck everything quickly"" administration. All Bush had to do was NOTHING to have a successful presidency. Everything he touched turned (immediately) to shit...and yet he couldn't wait to destroy more. Thank goodness the American people turned on him during the post 2004 ""Wind At My Back"" ""Hand Social Security Over To Wall Street"" debacle.

I'm convinced that someday, 50 years from now when historians are analyzing the moment that ""broke the back"" of the American dream, they'll focus on the Bush Administration -- specifically the catastrophic response to 9/11. Karl Rove's goal was always to repeal the New Deal, monkey-wrench the government to make it untenable, and hand the burning wreckage over to his billionaire pals who are greatly inconvenienced by all those middle class ""entitlements"", environmental protections and Union rights.

All he had to do was nothing. Instead, he almost wrecked everything

http://news.yahoo.com/tech-ceos-to-obama--%E2%80%98move-aggressively--on-spying-reform-193556986.html,,[],Tech CEOs to Obama: ‘Move aggressively’ on spying reform,"Top Silicon Valley CEOs pressed President Barack Obama behind closed doors Tuesday to “move aggressively” on reforming electronic surveillance practices by the National Security Agency.

The executives — including top executives from Apple, Twitter, Netflix, Google, Facebook and Yahoo — met with Obama in the Roosevelt Room of the White House.

""We appreciated the opportunity to share directly with the President our principles on government surveillance that we released last week and we urge him to move aggressively on reform,” they said in a brief group statement.

Notably, that release did not include much of what the White House had said would be on the agenda — including efforts to get the federal Obamacare website working smoothly, federal information-technology improvements, boosting the economy and fighting income inequality.

Instead, they zeroed in on their biggest source of frustration with the White House: the unprecedented electronic spying on Americans and people overseas who are not suspected of criminal or terrorist acts or connections.

The White House, which is in the middle of reviewing the National Security Agency’s policies and has vowed to make some changes to American surveillance, said it would take the CEOs’ concerns into account.

But the White House summary of the meeting, unlike the version from the CEOs, insists that the group “discussed a number of issues of shared importance to the federal government and the tech sector, including the progress being made to improve performance and capacity issues with HeathCare.Gov.”

Obama also announced that former Microsoft executive Kurt DelBene will take over from Jeff Zients as the top troubleshooter for the botched federal health insurance website.

And “the group discussed the challenges (surrounding) federal IT procurement,” according to the White House.

Here is how Obama’s press office summarized the NSA component of the meeting — the only part the CEOs described in their summary:

“Finally, the group discussed the national security and economic impacts of unauthorized intelligence disclosures. This was an opportunity for the President to hear from CEOs directly as we near completion of our review of signals intelligence programs, building on the feedback we’ve received from the private sector in recent weeks and months. The President made clear his belief in an open, free, and innovative internet and listened to the group’s concerns and recommendations, and made clear that we will consider their input as well as the input of other outside stakeholders as we finalize our review of signals intelligence programs.”"

Led by conservative Republicans and whipped into a froth by right-wing radio talk-show hosts, opponents of reform are banking on derailing the measure with a strategy of delay and dismemberment.

The focus of these efforts is the House, where many Republican backbenchers remain unsold on immigration reform despite the party’s disastrous loss of the Latino vote in 2012.

On Thursday, Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and an opponent of a pathway to citizenship, served notice that the delay-and-dismemberment plan was under way. Rather than wait for a comprehensive immigration bill to wend its way through the Senate, or for a roughly similar plan to emerge from a bipartisan group in the House, Mr. Goodlatte said his committee would consider a series of smaller bills.

That strategy gives conservatives a chance to say they were for immigration reform before they were against it. They may vote for bills that would tighten border security, provide a steady source of migrant farm workers and expand a program that companies may use to verify the immigration status of employees. Then, decrying “amnesty,” they can shoot down measures that would extend legal status and eventual citizenship to most of the undocumented.

In poll after poll, large majorities of Americans say they favor granting legal status to illegal immigrants, most of whom have been in the country for more than a decade and are vital to the U.S. economy. Even if some conservatives cling to the idea of “self-deportation,” most Americans acknowledge that 11 million people cannot be bullied into leaving the country and should not be left in legal limbo.

Recognizing that, a number of Republican leaders have taken the lead in pushing for a comprehensive bill, courageously urging their party to drop the myth of mass deportation. In effect, these lawmakers are pleading with their colleagues not to commit long-term electoral suicide by continuing to alienate the nation’s fastest-growing minority voting bloc. Still, they face a struggle.

The most prominent among these leaders is Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), a putative contender for the party’s presidential nomination in 2016, who is taking abuse on conservative talk radio for having helped draft the Senate bill. Mr. Rubio has been joined by Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), who appeared last week at a series of events in Chicago, plugging a comprehensive approach alongside a pro-reform Democrat, Rep. Luis V. Gutierrez (Ill.).

“We need it for national security reasons. We need it for the economy,” Mr. Ryan said. “We do not want to have a society where we have different classes of people who cannot reach their American dream by not being a full citizen.”

This is common sense, but it is also the kind of talk that has been unwelcome in many Republican circles. The question is whether the GOP, after so many years of denial, is capable of weaning itself from its delusions."

(CNN) – United States Marines are being told to preserve ammunition and gasoline as a deal softening the impact of automatic spending cuts continues to elude leaders in Washington.

Marine Corps Commandant James Amos urged personnel in a video posted online Friday to ""save every round, every gallon of gas,"" and to ""take every single aspect or opportunity in training to get the most bang for the buck,"" a reminder of the cuts' immediate effect on the U.S. military.



The Marine Corps and other branches are being forced to cut billions from their budgets as the result of the spending cuts, which were triggered March 1 when Congress and the White House failed to strike a deal reducing the federal debt. In a letter to all Marines dated March 2, Amos said his branch would cut $1.4 billion in 2013 and $2 billion in every ensuing year for nearly a decade.

State-by-state reports produced by the White House indicated the military slashes would be seen in delayed maintenance for military equipment and canceled air shows, along with furloughs for civilian defense personnel. Salaries for enlisted personnel are exempt from the budget cuts.

""This is no time to do business as usual,"" Amos said in the video. ""Things have changed. The landscape's changed. We need you to be conservative in the way you do business, I need you to think about conserving our assets, and I need you to become part of the solution as it relates to sacrifice.""

The primary goal of the Marines going forward will be to preserve the corps' readiness, Amos said, including initiatives to ""recapitalize"" and ""modernize"" the institution. But for now, Amos indicated Marine leaders will be focused on ""moving money around"" and looking at more ways to reduce spending.

""This is going to require all of us to take a different perspective on your piece of the Marine Corps, and it's going to require all of us to take a look at how we sacrifice for the good of the institution,"" he said.

And despite the cuts originating from a stalemate between the White House and lawmakers, Amos described Congress as ""our best friends.""

""The Marine Corps exists today because of Congress,"" he said, saying in discussions with congressmen and senators it's clear that lawmakers want to help counteract the automatic spending cuts.

""Everybody's on this, everybody's pulling together,"" he said.

http://news.yahoo.com/-syria-envy---activists-divided-on-usefulness-of-an-obama-p-r--blitz-222644109.html,,[],'Syria envy'? Activists divided on usefulness of an Obama PR blitz,"Do liberal activists have “Syria envy” yet?

President Barack Obama just waged an unprecedented three-week PR campaign to sell Americans and Congress on the need to go to war — six television interviews in one night, a prime-time speech to the nation, and White House outreach to 93 senators and 375 representatives.

It’s enough to make those on the left looking for his help on issues such as gun violence, climate change, racial profiling, immigration and jobs wonder whether their causes rate this kind of White House commitment. Is there an intensity gap?

“I raised this issue to the president the other day,” Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., told Yahoo News in a telephone interview.

Sanders, who for years has been calling for Washington to get its act together and take steps to boost job creation, said he prodded Obama when the president made a rare trip to Capitol Hill on Tuesday to make his Syria case to senators.

“It’s one thing to give a speech which most people know really is not going to translate into terribly strong action,” Sanders said. “Intensity is the key issue. Is he prepared to fight?”

Sanders declined to describe the president’s response.

But a Democratic aide who does not work for Sanders said the exchange was a bit combative, with the senator asking, in effect, “Why the hell aren’t we talking about jobs?”

The director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Washington Legislative Office, Laura Murphy, said that if she “could wave a magic wand,” she would conjure up a Syria-style presidential blitz to curb racial profiling in federal law enforcement.

“Of course it would create controversy — but Syria creates controversy,” she said.

“On racial profiling, he has intensity, even though it’s sporadic, but he doesn’t have the action to back it up,” Murphy said. “On Syria, he’s proposing arming the rebels, he’s getting the CIA involved. He’s doing things: He’s going to the United Nations Security Council, he’s laying out the case.”

Story continues

What about overhauling America’s immigration policy? Should Obama go “full Syria”? Not so much, according to some activists, because it might only stiffen Republican opposition.

“I think these things have to be calibrated. I think if he went all-out Syria it would most likely backfire,” said Frank Sharry, executive director of the America’s Voice advocacy that favors an overhaul. “Could he ratchet up the pressure in a strategic way? Yes. Should he? Yes.”

But “if he went on a barnstorming campaign across the country, it arguably would make it harder for Republicans to get to yes,” Sharry said.

“They've dug themselves into an anti-Obama position, and if he were to say the sky is blue, they would disagree,” agreed Eliseo Medina, secretary-treasury of the potent SEIU union and head of its immigration reform campaign.

So would activists turn down a six-television-interview campaign? “Of course not, all of that helps,” said Medina. “But I’m not sure that there is a lot of convincing that he can do.""

For Natural Resources Defense Council communications director Ed Chen, Obama “has been great in terms of talking about climate issues” and “put a lot of time, public time, in promoting this issue.” So, would a Syria-style campaign help?

“No, because frankly on Syria the message has been mixed,” Chen said. “Every news cycle he’s had a different position. On climate he’s been straight and true.”

Obama, who faces a tough decision on the Keystone pipeline, has set new automobile fuel-efficiency standards, and new emissions rules for power plants.

“We just need him to press on and keep his foot on the gas pedal — so to speak. A hybrid of course,” Chen said.

The White House countered that Obama has been pushing these issues just as much as Syria — just over a longer time frame, stretching back years in some cases.

“What’s unique about the Syria situation, at least until a few days ago, is that we were operating under an unusually compressed time frame,” a senior Obama aide told Yahoo News on condition of anonymity to speak more candidly.

Obama campaigned for re-election on the need for jobs creation and gave an address to the nation on the issue in September 2011 — to a joint session of Congress, the aide underlined.

“Short of the national address, we have basically done all of that stuff on immigration reform,” the aide added. “Television interviews? We’ve done far more than six. We’ve had at least as many meetings — they’ve just been stretched over a longer period of time.”

On gun violence, the official observed wryly, “I’m not sure that another meeting at the White House is going to change the vote of someone in Congress who voted against 80 percent of the American people and against closing background-check loopholes.”

Still, the official said, Obama is “ready for all of these groups to make their case to the public.”"

WASHINGTON — The Pentagon budget proposed by President Obama on Wednesday will assume that the automatic spending cuts that started March 1 will end and will contain no long-term reductions in troop levels beyond those already in motion, according to congressional sources.

Three aides on Capitol Hill who are not authorized to speak on the record about the budget, which will be released Wednesday, said the Army and Marine Corps plan to continue to thin their ranks over the next five years to reach targets of 490,000 soldiers and 182,100 Marines.

The Army has about 560,000 active-duty personnel now, while the Marines have about 197,000. The reduction was set in motion last year to accommodate the $487 billion reduction in Pentagon spending over the next decade.

Military leaders, starting with Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and his predecessor, Leon Panetta, said the sequestration cuts could hollow out the military and leave the nation unable to meet its defense needs. Hagel said last week that the Pentagon will have to make serious cuts in personnel and other programs if the sequester stays in effect.

Sequestration will require about $500 billion in cuts from the Pentagon, including about $40 billion this year.

""The president's budget will replace the sequester, which was designed to be bad policy for everyone,"" White House press secretary Jay Carney said Tuesday.

Republicans, who control the House, have criticized Obama's budget before its release. House Republicans have passed their own budget, which includes sequestration cuts for non-defense items and higher defense spending, while the Senate passed a Democratic plan last month that included $240 billion in spending cuts over 10 years but did not specify troop levels.

The budgets produced by the Republicans and Democrats are ""not to be believed,"" said Thomas Donnelly, a defense analyst at the American Enterprise Institute. There is little reason to believe sequestration will be solved soon, making it likely that steep cuts in troop levels will occur. Moreover, about 50,000 troops are funded by supplemental war-spending budgets that will diminish with the withdrawal from Afghanistan, he said.

""There was no other way to do this budget. What alternative to the previous plan could they come up with, in the time allotted, with ongoing White House-congressional negotiations and the possibility of continued GOP unwillingness to give on taxes?"" says Michael O'Hanlon, defense expert at the Brookings Institution.

Last year, Gen. Raymond Odierno, the Army chief of staff, said his service could remain ready to fight with 490,000 soldiers if it had several years to implement the change.

The Army dropped to a low of 479,000 soldiers in 1999, Pentagon records show, but increases caused by the demands of fighting simultaneous wars in Iraq and Afghanistan led Congress and the Bush administration to call for an increase that peaked at 566,000 soldiers in 2010.

The Marines bottomed out in 1950, the first year of the Korean War, 74,000 Marines. That number jumped to 193,000 the following year and has never dipped below 173,000 since then.

Since the end of World War II in 1945, the military has seen significant fluctuations in troop levels, Pentagon records show. The Army reached 1,596,000 soldiers in 1952 and 1,570,000 in 1968, the peak years for the wars in Korea and Vietnam. Between those wars, the Army bottomed out at 859,000 soldiers in 1961. The Army's post-Vietnam peak came last in 1987, when it had 781,000 soldiers, records show."

Nearly 10,000 Rhode Islanders are set to get an automatic raise beginning Wednesday as the state raises its minimum wage to $8 an hour. The hike goes into effect New Year's Day, and will put Rhode Island on par with Massachusetts. Twelve other states will also start the new year with a higher minimum, including Connecticut, which is going from $8.25 to $8.70 an hour. New York is also set to increase its minimum wage to $8 effective Tuesday.

A CNN poll taken last week showed that many Americans are exaggerating the effect of Obamacare on their own lives. As I wrote on Tuesday, this suggests the law will get a bump in public support over the next few months, as the widely anticipated negative consequences don't materialize for most people outside the health-care insurance exchanges. The poll is interesting for another reason: It suggests that the public's divergent views on Obamacare don't reflect different opinions about the proper role of government, so much as wildly different understandings about what the law will mean for the average American. Here's the thing: They can't both be right.

Flavelle is correct. When conservatives argue that ACA will simply collapse and go away, they're wrong. All ACA does is build on the existing system. Sure, it's flawed. But it's also not going away any time soon. Why do conservatives argue that? Because they'd otherwise have to deal with the reality of 6 million more people getting insurance Jan 1, and they apparently can't. They've predicted no one will want it. And the cognitive dissonance is making them claim very stupid things.

""I can assure you that I certainly did not know anything about the (inspector general) report"" beforehand, Obama said Thursday.

The president, though, did not say whether he was previously aware of the IRS' actions, which allegedly started as early as 2010, well before the inspector general's office began to investigate. Republican lawmakers were inquiring about the alleged targeting of Tea Party groups by the IRS more than a year ago.

Obama, who spoke during a press conference alongside the Turkish prime minister, focused his remarks specifically on the IG report, noting that he wouldn't have caught wind of that report since those investigations are typically kept under wraps. He reiterated that he found the agency's actions ""unacceptable"" and sought to fix the problem ""the minute"" he found out about it. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney has previously said no one in the White House knew about the practice.

The comments were the latest effort by the White House to tamp down the controversy.

More On This...

After his press conference, Obama announced the appointment of White House budget official Daniel Werfel as the next acting IRS commissioner. This comes after Obama announced Wednesday that acting IRS Commissioner Steven Miller would resign -- though Miller was apparently set to step down anyway.

An official close to Miller told Fox News, shortly after Obama's brief announcement, that the IRS chief was ""set to resign the position of acting commission as of early June."" He was planning to leave the IRS entirely a ""couple of months later, regardless of the current controversy,"" the source said.

These details were not mentioned by the president as he announced Wednesday evening Miller was resigning. Obama spoke following a meeting with Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew and other top department officials in which they reviewed a highly critical inspector general’s report on the practice. The report concluded poor management allowed agents to improperly target Tea Party and other groups for more than 18 months, starting in 2010.

Obama said Lew asked for the resignation and Miller agreed, after being on the job since November 2012.

“Americans have a right to be angry about it, and I’m angry about it,” Obama said from the White House.

Republicans, who along with Democrats have slammed the IRS for the practice, welcomed the resignation Wednesday but made clear they would continue to investigate and press for accountability.

Rep. Vern Buchanan, R-Fla., said the resignation ""is a necessary first step but more heads need to roll.""

Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., reacting to the claim that Miller was leaving anyway, said it seemed like he was a ""perfect scapegoat"" for the administration.

Miller’s resignation was part of three-step plan Obama outlined to fix the problem.

The other steps are to put in place the safeguards recommended in the IG report and to work with Congress as it investigates.

“The good news is we can fix this,” Obama said.

Miller became acting commissioner after Commissioner Douglas Shulman completed his five-year term. Shulman had been appointed by President George W. Bush.

The president has proceeded cautiously since the IRS controversy was made public Friday. While he initially said the accusations were ""outrageous,"" he also said he wanted to wait until the report was released before addressing what should be done to hold accountable those responsible.

The report lays much of the blame on IRS supervisors in Washington who oversaw a group of specialists in Cincinnati who screened applications for tax-exempt status. It does not indicate that Washington initiated the targeting of conservative groups, but it does say a top supervisor in Washington did not adequately supervise agents in the field even after she learned the agents were acting improperly.

The Justice Department is also investigating the IRS targeting, as are three congressional committees.

Sources told Fox News that Miller will remain on the job ""for a couple of weeks.""

The House Ways and Means Committee said after the announcement of Miller's resignation that he still will attend a hearing Friday.

And the House Committee on Oversight and Government Affairs sent a letter Wednesday afternoon to the IRS requesting five employees named in the IG audit be made available for transcribed interviews by committee staff.

The Republican-led committee wants to start the interviews Monday.

The names and titles of the IRS employees requested are Holly Paz, a director; John Shafer, a manager; Gary Muthert, a screener; Liz Hofacre, a case coordinator; and Joseph Herr, a manager.

""The resignation of Steven Miller is a positive and important step as this agency struggles to try to regain the public’s trust,"" said Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, the top Republican on the Senate Finance Committee. ""A clean slate at the IRS with new leadership is imperative to fix this egregious encroachment on the lives of honest, hard-working Americans whose only sin was that they want to express their beliefs.""

Earlier in the day, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney sidestepped a question about whether Obama still had confidence in Miller, saying he wouldn't discuss personnel matters. He said Obama has expressed his overall view that IRS personnel had acted inappropriately.

""He wants to see that the actions taken, as revealed by the Treasury report, that are inappropriate, are met with consequences,"" Carney said. ""He will make clear to Treasury Department leaders that he expects action.""

Carney said Obama wants the public to ""understand and believe that the IRS applies our tax laws in a neutral and fair way to everyone.""

Carney got a “case of the Mondays” a few days early as the Obama administration's lies about Benghazi and potentially criminal acts at the IRS all caught up with them at once.

ABC Senior White House correspondent Jonathan Karl started the day off revealing that the famous Benghazi talking points were “dramatically edited by the administration” a total of 12 different times. Those changes included the removal of all references to Al Qaeda initially approved by the CIA.

That public relations disaster was followed by another later in the day. The IRS admitted that conservatives had been right all along and that right-wing groups had indeed been targeted by the IRS. In true Nixonian language, the IRS admitted “mistakes were made,” but denied they were political, convincing absolutely no one.

Fridays, famously called “take out the trash day” in the lefty TV show “West Wing,” are supposed to be days when the administration hides news. On May 10, the trash bin was overflowing and even the press noticed. Carney couldn’t dump garbage fast enough. He fielded at least 38 questions on Benghazi and another eight on the possible crimes at the IRS.

Throughout, he dodged, weaved and blamed – especially blamed. He blamed former President George W. Bush, the CIA, the IRS, Congress, Mitt Romney and, of course, Republicans. “Congress” got blamed 28 times and Republicans got mentioned 20 times by Carney as he tried to spin his way out of trouble.

He began by reminding the press that the White House did “have a background briefing” earlier for 14 news organizations. That meeting, held following these types of PR disasters, had to be spinning like a carnival ride. And the spinning had just gotten started.

The IRS questions were easier since even Carney admitted he wasn’t in the know. He stressed “two things” to pass the buck – that the IRS was an “independent enforcement agency” and “the individual who was running the IRS at the time was actually an appointee from the previous administration.” In other words, blame Bush. I think he learned that one from his boss.

When it came to Benghazi, Carney claimed the White House made a “non-substantive factual correction” to the talking points. He continued: “I must say that all of this information was provided months ago to members of Congress,” adding sarcastically, “which they have leaked now to reporters.” This, after the White House just had a background meeting with 14 different news organizations so they could leak, er, give background information

At several points, Carney embraced his inner Candy Crowley and claimed, inaccurately, that Obama had called the attack “an act of terror” during his Rose Garden speech. (Kudos to Tim Carney for that catch.) However, that’s completely untrue. Even CBS News admitted in 2012 that the transcript “shows that the president did refer to ‘acts of terror’ – but not specifically in reference to the Libya attack. Instead, he made a broader statement about American defiance.” The Team Obama shorthand has created a fictional narrative that is largely accepted by the media.

During the briefing, question after question pounded Carney on his previous comments that only “stylistic” changes had been made to the Benghazi talking points, when that obviously was not true.

The questioning grew heated and it appeared to show on Carney, as first his ears and then his face reddened to the point where people on Twitter were mocking it. Twitchy captured some of the more fun comments including one saying he was trying to “defend the indefensible.” That was an understatement.

Hilariously, Carney made multiple positive references to the famous interview of UN Ambassador Susan Rice where she made the bogus comments about the “heinous and offensive” video about Islam.

It took 37 minutes into the press conference for one of the reporters to ask a question that didn’t involve one of the day’s two big scandals. Carney seemed to breathe a sigh of relief when it happened.

But it wasn’t over. One of the later questions was telling. “Don’t this series of e-mails now I suggest that your discussion of the video was speculative. You were cherry picking,” asked one reporter. Others pointed out a key flaw in Carney’s defense, calling him out for saying the talking points were what we were sure we knew, but reminding him that the initial talking points said the CIA wrote “we do know that Islamic extremists with ties to al-Qa’ida participated in the attack.” Carney’s response was to direct that inquiry to the “intelligence community.”

If the questioning was a true sign of media interest, Carney can look for many more red-faced press briefings. Perhaps he needs more make-up next time. He should try cover-up. It’s perfect.

Spendthrifts Preserve Government Expansion,"Lawrence Jackson/Associated Press

The small-government, fiscally prudent Republicans in the House have voted to preserve a significant expansion of government power — and to keep spending nearly $1.6 million per prisoner per year at the Guantánamo Bay detention camp. They did all that in just a few hours.

Recently, Rep. Adam Smith of Washington, senior Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, along with Rep. Chris Gibson, Republican of New York, sponsored an amendment to repeal a dangerous provision in the 2013 military budget. That provision authorized military detention for anyone captured in the United States on suspicion of terrorism, and did not explicitly exclude American citizens.

Senator Mark Udall, Democrat of Colorado, said President Obama has pledged not to use the detention power for Americans, but “this is only binding on his administration, but that won’t tie the hands of future administrations.”

House Republicans killed the amendment last night.



Mr. Smith, who’s been very busy, also proposed an amendment to the 2014 National Defense Authorization Act, which would have required the closure of Guantánamo by the end of 2014.

It would have enhanced the authority of a presidential appointee charged with finding places to send the almost 90 prisoners who have been cleared for release — many of them because they didn’t actually do anything in the first place.

The bill also would have ordered the transfer of the rest of the prisoners to the United States from their current cells on land leased from the Communist Party of Cuba, either for trial in federal courts or for detention under the laws of war until the “end of hostilities.” (That, of course, is going to be hard to define, but a logical point would be the end of the current war in Afghanistan.)

The first, eligible-for-trial group includes men like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the so-called mastermind of the 9/11 attacks who is slated to go before one of the military tribunals that President Obama has improved from President Bush’s kangaroo courts, but which remain deeply flawed. The second, “end of hostilities” group includes prisoners who are believed to be threats but cannot be tried because there is no evidence against them, or because they were tortured (Mr. Bush’s legacy) and the evidence is not admissible in court.

Mr. Smith pointed out in a press release that the federal courts have convicted “more than 400 defendants charged with crimes related to international terrorism” since Sept. 11, 2001. They have done so without a single security issue or release of sensitive information. These defendants do not receive any greater measure of constitutional rights in the federal courts, including the rights of habeas corpus and the right of appeal, than in military tribunals.

No convicted terrorist has even tried to escape from a federal prison since 9/11. We spend about $34,000 per inmate each year at one of those prisons, Mr. Smith said, compared to $1.6 million per inmate at Guantanamo, where the Pentagon also wants to spend $260 million on new construction.

Republicans were deaf to these solid arguments, and voted down the amendment this morning.

The House did manage to pass one amendment from a Democrat, Jim McGovern, today. It requires an “accelerated” withdrawal from Afghanistan, which sounds good, but the date is the end of 2014, which happens to be when President Obama said he would do it anyway. Now that must have taken courage."

The planned removal of more than 40,000 troops and the closure of dozens of bases over the next year will shrink the protective umbrella for U.S. officials to keep tabs on construction work, training programs and other initiatives in the corruption-plagued nation. Only about 20 percent of the country will be accessible to U.S. civilian oversight personnel in 2014, according to an analysis conducted by the special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction and obtained by The Washington Post.

Instead of curtailing those projects, the Pentagon, the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development plan to rely on teams of private contractors to monitor the work of other private contractors on the taxpayer-funded projects. In a document soliciting firms to help with inspections, USAID said it also intends to use satellite photos and “crowdsourcing” experiments that will solicit feedback on progress from Afghans who are supposed to benefit from U.S.-financed work.

The inability of U.S. government personnel to inspect development projects is prompting worry among lawmakers and government inspectors that millions more dollars could be squandered in what has become the costliest reconstruction of a single country in American history.

“I would be shocked if this doesn’t have an unhappy ending,” said Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), who has been critical of reconstruction programs in Afghanistan and Iraq. “They are kissing oversight goodbye.”

View Graphic U.S. government overseers will lose much of their access to large, government-funded projects in Afghanistan.

By plotting some of the largest civilian and military projects on a map generated by the inspector general’s office, The Post found that at least 15 major reconstruction initiatives, projected to cost more than $1 billion, are expected to be beyond the reach of U.S. government personnel next year. Among them are two of the U.S. government’s signature development endeavors: the $75 million installation of a new turbine at a dam in the southwest and part of the area where a $230 million highway is being built in the east.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is building three garrisons for the Afghan army — each costing between $60 million and $80 million — in parts of the country that are outside the sectors identified by the inspector general as accessible.

“Many of these projects will never be seen by an American government employee, and that’s a concern,” said John F. Sopko, the special inspector general. “We need to ensure that tax dollars for these programs are properly spent.”

On-site monitoring by State, USAID and the Pentagon, as well as audits by inspectors general, led to dozens of projects being redesigned or scaled back over the past few years.

The ability of civilian government officials and military personnel to visit projects depends on the proximity of troops to respond to an attack — and on the ability of medical personnel to transport the wounded to coalition hospitals within an hour. As U.S. troops pull back to a handful of bases next year, travel will be circumscribed to areas within the radius of a 30-minute helicopter flight from those facilities.

Those areas almost certainly will shrink further by the end of next year. President Obama has not yet decided how many troops, if any, he will keep in Afghanistan in 2015 and beyond — he is waiting for the Afghan government to approve a security agreement with the United States — but even under the Pentagon’s most optimistic scenarios, the remaining U.S. forces would be clustered in just four or five bases.

The largest part of the reconstruction effort involves training and equipping Afghan security forces, a task that is expected to cost about $4 billion next year — the exact figure is awaiting congressional approval — and almost as much in following years. Over the past several years, U.S. military officers have been able to assess whether funds provided in Kabul, the capital, for salaries, fuel and equipment filtered down to troops on the front lines because American battalions often operated in partnership with Afghan ones.

With fewer troops in the field, the Pentagon is planning to increase the number of civilian advisers assigned to the defense and interior ministries. Those advisers will work with the Afghans to create new systems to track military property and other items paid for by the United States, a senior U.S. defense official said.

“The goal is to install a method of accountability,” said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the Pentagon has not yet provided a formal response to queries on the subject posed by Sopko.

The official also said the Pentagon would seek to place more responsibility on the Afghan government to track the use of U.S. funds. “We’ve told them that it’s incumbent on them to be good stewards of the resources given to them,” the official said.

A senior USAID official said the agency is confident that it can adequately monitor its work without U.S. military protection. “This isn’t anything new for USAID,” said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak on the record. “Most of AID’s work is done in the absence of a military presence.”

The agency is seeking to hire firms to design and implement a program to inspect reconstruction projects across the country. It anticipates spending $200 million on the effort.

“As the military draws down and our field presence diminishes, USAID will lose most, if not all, of its field staff . . . and experience drastically reduced mobility around Afghanistan,” the agency wrote in a contracting solicitation. “This constraint limits USAID officials from adequately monitoring program activities as they are occurring in the field.”

USAID is looking to hire contractors who can send Afghans with engineering and program-monitoring skills into areas beyond the reach of U.S. medical evacuation flights to collect information on development projects, including photographs with time stamps and precise geographic coordinates. The agency also is seeking to have the contractors create “monitoring tasks that the general public can objectively perform — commonly referred to as ‘crowd-sourcing.’ ”

The USAID official said the agency intends to use other methods, including video-conferences with construction teams and satellite photographs, to corroborate the work performed by the contractors. “We intend to rely on a multiplicity of layered approaches,” the official said.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers also said it plans to use contractors to monitor inaccessible projects.

But others involved in Afghan reconstruction voiced skepticism that satellite imagery and field reports from Afghans hired by a private contractor would be sufficient. “It’s difficult even for Afghans to inspect some of these projects,” said a U.S. reconstruction specialist. “If they’re walking around with a camera and a notebook, they’ll draw attention to themselves as someone connected with Western money.”

In a July report to Congress, Sopko, the inspector general, said his office is concerned that third-party monitors “may raise new issues such as vetting, accuracy, effectiveness, and accountability.”

Among those most affected by the travel restrictions will be Sopko and his auditors, who may not be able to conduct field inspections that can be used to sanction contractors or pursue criminal prosecutions. In a letter he sent this month to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and Secretary of State John F. Kerry, Sopko noted that earlier this year, his inspectors were unable to visit infrastructure projects in northern Afghanistan valued at $72 million “because they are located in areas that could not be reached by U.S. civilian employees.”

“Sopko is in a very difficult position,” McCaskill said. His auditors “can’t do their job adequately if they can’t be on the ground.”

Like all mysteries, this one has a cast of characters. They aren’t actors, but many of them are acting. That makes this such a morass.

The department’s Web site shows 40 percent of positions on the DHS’s leadership list are filled by “acting” officials or are vacant — including the top four slots.

“This means nearly half of the top positions at the third-largest department in the U.S. government are not filled,” House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul (R-Texas) told a hearing. “[P]ut more simply, who is in charge?”

“While DHS has thousands of dedicated career employees, it is suffering from a void of leadership,” he added.

That should begin to change now that the Senate confirmed Jeh Johnson as DHS secretary Monday. The deputy secretary job probably will be filled soon, too. Johnson knows the mess he’s getting into. At his confirmation hearing, he said the DHS leadership vacancies are “of alarming proportions.”

“Acting” officials, some talented, can get the basic job done. But their temporary status puts them at an inherent disadvantage. If they are caretakers who don’t want or don’t expect to get the job they are temporarily filling, they are unlikely to provide the imaginative leadership agencies need. If they want the gig, they have to be careful about appearing too presumptuous, again leading to uninspired leadership. Either way, employee morale can suffer.

“And while Acting Secretary (Rand) Beers and other acting executives have worked diligently in recent months,” Tom Ridge, the first DHS secretary told the committee, “you simply cannot build nor can you sustain a mission-focused culture with a high number vacancies and leaders in non-permanent status.”

DHS lacks a “sense of urgency,” he said, and that “undermines mission and morale.”

The complex history of the department often is cited as a reason for its poor showing. When DHS, now with 240,000 employees, was organized in 2003 “we were working to create a unique and unified department culture out of 22 agencies . . . a daunting challenge,” Ridge said. “This has remained a challenge in the department’s first decade.”

Curiously, the acting DHS leaders were not invited to testify at the hearing. In a statement to The Washington Post, DHS said: “The Department’s employees are our greatest resource and we are committed to providing them with the resources and support they need to carry out our mission to protect the homeland. . . . We are focused on continuing to improve employee engagement through enhanced communication and training, employee recognition and strengthening the skills of employees at every level.”

Colleen M. Kelley, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, agrees DHS morale has been undermined, but she thinks leadership vacancies are not the main reason. In testimony to the committee, she said “a significant cause of low morale” at DHS’s Customs and Border Protection is “ongoing staffing shortages.”

While “management deficiencies . . . do contribute to low morale among federal workers,” Kelley said she “believes that government-wide morale problems can be traced directly to the three-year pay freeze, the continuing impact of sequestration and the furloughs it spawned, and the 16-day government shutdown.”

But those things hit feds across the board. They don’t explain the department’s repeated residency near or at the bottom in federal employee surveys. It ranked at the bottom of 19 large agencies in the Partnership for Public Service’s 2012 Best Places to Work in the Federal Government.

In the Office of Personnel Management Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey, DHS was 36 of 37 agencies in the leadership/knowledge management and job satisfaction categories, according to the Government Accountability Office (GAO).

Last year, GAO recommended that DHS “take action to better determine the root cause of low employee morale.” In a report to the committee, GAO said: “DHS has actions underway . . . but DHS has not fully implemented them.”

One such action, “directing component human capital officials to reevaluate their action plans to ensure that metrics of success are clear and measurable,” itself sounds like a bureaucratic morale buster.

There is at least one good sign — the vacancy rate for DHS senior executives has declined significantly since 2006, when it was 25 percent. It had dropped to 10 percent by the end of fiscal year 2011.

Yet, why DHS continues to be a bottom-feeder remains a mystery.

Said GAO: “We concluded that the gap between DHS and government-wide scores may be explained by factors unique to DHS, such as management practices and the nature of the agency’s work, or by differences among employees we could not analyze.”

Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs, recently delivered a grim warning: “If you want [the military] to be doing what it’s doing today, then we can’t give you another dollar.”

His worries reflect reductions that started in 2009 and have reached crippling levels, even in President Obama’s proposals to avert sequestration. I take the general at his word, but I am concerned that the president does not.

Sequester hurts national security, not just because 50% of the cuts fall on the military’s 18% share of the overall budget but because the Pentagon has been the only place the president is willing to cut. For four years he has mismanaged our nation’s most vital resource, our uniformed military, fomenting the sequester-inspired readiness crisis it faces today. His actions, his under-resourced strategies, accelerated withdrawal plans and lead-from-behind policies have left the Pentagon far less able to shoulder the burden of another 10% cut.

The wide swath of missions Dempsey referred to benefit Americans in varied ways. Some are obvious, like fighting terrorism; some are subtler, like patrolling our airspace and shoring up our economic security by keeping vital avenues of commerce free — on the seas and in space and cyberspace.

Those are missions the military should be able to perform without putting undue stress on the armed services as a whole. Actually, I want them to be fully prepared if they are called on to do much more. While there is no question the Pentagon was long overdue for a housecleaning, we have cut down so rapidly and so blindly that we’re in danger of breaking the back of the force.

And, perhaps more important, the sequester will cripple our military’s ability to fulfill its primary role: to keep this nation out of war.

Already, Pentagon planners are going through the laundry list of missions that could be cut. The Navy has been forced to keep a carrier in port rather than send it on a scheduled deployment to the Middle East. That message is not lost on the Iranians.

Sequestration manifests itself in less prominent but no less potent ways. For example, tons of illegal narcotics are intercepted annually by military patrols in the Caribbean. The Navy is now shuttering operations that will leave the door open for those drugs to find their way to America’s suburbs. The Navy may also have to curtail its ballistic missile defense patrols — even as North Korea successfully launched a missile into space in December and conducted a nuclear test in recent weeks.

The Air Force will be hit so hard, its leadership is being forced to cut flight hours for air crews. If they cannot train adequately enough to deploy, our pilots may well be grounded during the next national crisis.

The Marine Corps faces an equally dire outlook, where cuts are so deep we risk losing the Marines as a deployable force. Adm. Jonathan Greenert, chief of naval operations, warned in congressional testimony that because there will be no amphibious ready group around Africa, the Marines can no longer provide quick-reaction support to our embassies there. The next time America needs to call 911, we may not be able to call in the Marines.

The Army faces similar challenges, as do the industries that support the Defense Department.

In California alone, it is estimated that we could lose 126,000 private sector jobs, 20,000 active-duty military jobs and more than 15,000 civilian Defense Department jobs. I have spent the last year and a half talking with my constituents who will be directly affected by these cuts. It is unbelievable that the president would support a plan that would dissolve a highly skilled and dedicated workforce at installations such as the Antelope Valley’s Plant 42. Remember, many workers in California and across the nation have lost their jobs because of previous dramatic defense cuts. Sequester only adds to this pain.

Advertisement

That brings us to a choice. If there were a proposal on the table that spared the troops and heeded Dempsey’s warning of not a dollar more from the armed forces, I would ask House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) to consider it. But after cutting defense three times, the president’s solution to replacing sequester means another $250 billion out of the armed forces and more taxes. The choice the American people are being given is “break the military” or “break the military and new taxes.”

Let’s be clear: Even if the president were given every dollar in new taxes he has requested, it wouldn’t make a difference in our national debt. Entitlement programs will continue to grow out of control, and the amount we spend on interest to service the debt soon will start to outpace even what we spend on the military. The cuts he continues to insist on, while below the level of sequestration, are still severe enough to hollow out our force. This approach forces me to conclude that the president, for all his stump speeches and props, wants the sequester to happen.

The president is forcing America to indulge him in this dangerous experiment with national security. It is unworthy of the sacrifice of the hundreds of thousands in uniform whom he has directed into harm’s way over the last four years. It is a reckless experiment when one takes stock of the growing threats and commitments that occupy our forces around the world.

At a cost of $35,000 per flying hour, the Global Hawk Block 30 aircraft had “priced itself out of the niche, in terms of taking pictures in the air,” Deputy Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter said at the time.

The Air Force planned to stop buying the Global Hawk and mothball 18 of those it already owned to save about $2.5 billion over five years. The high-tech drones, the military said, were not as capable as the battle-tested U-2 spy planes.

Northrop responded sharply, saying the U-2 “places pilots in danger, has limited flight duration and provides limited sensor capacity.”

In the end, the Air Force didn’t win that skirmish. House Armed Services Committee Chairman Howard “Buck” McKeon (R-Santa Clarita), whose congressional district includes Palmdale, jumped in to rescue the project. Congress restored the funding, and last month Northrop received a $114-million contract to build three more drones, saving thousands of jobs.

The Pentagon faces budget cuts of $487 billion over the next 10 years — and the threat of $500 billion more under sequestration. But paring down the budget by killing weapons programs is no easy task on Capitol Hill, where politicians, backed by the defense industry lobby, fight to protect jobs in their home districts.

For instance, Congress has spent about $400 million in the last two years to churn out improved versions of the M1 Abrams tank that the Army doesn’t want. The Navy cruiser Anzio out of Norfolk, Va., was supposed to be retired this year but lawmakers kept it afloat. Just last month, 33 lawmakers wrote Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel to express “deep concern” about the Air Force’s consideration of cutting the A-10 attack jet fleet.

In the case of the Global Hawk, McKeon said he worked to keep the program alive because the drone is a valuable tool for spying, and he wanted to protect the billions of dollars the government has already spent on the technology.

“I think these planes have proven their capabilities,” McKeon said, “and will continue to show their worth over time.”

Critics say the allocation of funding for the Global Hawk reflects cozy ties between Congress and defense companies. Northrop has been one of McKeon’s largest campaign donors and spent more than $17.5 million on total lobbying last year, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics, a watchdog group. The defense firm has spent $13.2 million this year.

“The mantra in the defense industry is: Give early and give often,” said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. “Clearly, McKeon is in a good position to protect this investment, and it has the added benefit of providing jobs to his constituents back home.”

Northrop has more than 3,480 employees — 2,500 of them in Southern California — working on the Global Hawk program in 22 states. It has contracts with 303 suppliers in 36 states.

The Air Force has been flying the Global Hawk since 2001, including missions in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya. The drone can fly for 30 hours without refueling.

Even from more than 11 miles overhead, the drone is able to capture images of enemy hide-outs that are so clear that U.S. intelligence officials can determine the make, model and license plates of pickup trucks parked nearby — and tell how long they’ve been there.

Military planners had wanted Global Hawks to replace the fleet of 33 U-2 spy planes, which have been in service since the 1950s. But repeated problems with the drones’ equipment and flight reliability, and their high price tag, caused the Air Force to put the program on hold last year.

The drone costs $222.7 million each, according to the Government Accountability Office.

In addition, mission personnel costs for the Global Hawk “are substantially higher than those of the manned U-2, despite the fact that the number of flight hours for the Global Hawk and the number of aircraft are substantially below those of the U-2,” the Air Force said.

The U-2 costs $4,000 less per flight hour and has more capability, the Air Force said.

Critics of the Pentagon’s plan have said that the Air Force harbors a bias against the Global Hawk because it doesn’t have a pilot in the cockpit. Air Force brass has strongly refuted that criticism.

The Air Force wanted to put all 18 of the third version of Global Hawk, called Block 30, in storage at the bone yard at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona. This would leave the Air Force with 14 Global Hawks in operation.

Not long after the Pentagon’s announcement last year that it was going to shut down the Global Hawk program, McKeon made a rousing speech at Northrop’s manufacturing plant in Palmdale. He asked the crowd to call members of Congress to stop the cuts.

“I implore you, no, I beg you, to stop this from happening,” he said at the time. His committee later passed an amendment that would prevent the Air Force from retiring the planes.

In May, McKeon and Rep. James P. Moran (D-Va.), whose district includes where Northrop’s headquarters is based, wrote a letter to Hagel that the Air Force was trying to “ignore clear congressional intent.”

Last month, Northrop announced it had received a $114-million contract for the first phase of a contract to build the last three Block 30 Global Hawks.

“The budget situation is a nightmare,” said Todd Harrison, a defense analyst for the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments in Washington. “It’s well-known that there isn’t enough money. Programs need to be cut, but Congress continues to micromanage the military budget.”

http://news.yahoo.com/marco-rubio-takes-heat-from-conservatives-over-immigration-push--200115263.html,,[],Marco Rubio heckled by conservatives over immigration push,"ORLANDO, Fla. – A small but loud group booed and heckled Florida Sen. Marco Rubio while he tried to give a speech at a conservative conference here Friday, a sign that his support for a bipartisan immigration bill has hurt him within some elements of the Republican Party.

“No Amnesty!” several people shouted when Rubio walked to the lectern at the Defending the American Dream Summit, an annual gathering of Republicans and conservatives organized by the advocacy group Americans for Prosperity.

Rubio was elected to the Senate in 2010 with support from the tea party, but he has been the target of fury on the right since he joined Democrats in championing an immigration bill that includes a pathway to citizenship for immigrants living in the country illegally. Rubio is considered a possible Republican presidential contender, but his work on the immigration bill has hurt his image with some conservative voters within the party.

The heckling at the conference subsided after he began to speak, but some in the audience continued to shout throughout the address and booed him when he finished. Despite the rough reception from some, Rubio did receive applause from most of the audience of about 1,500, who offered him several standing ovations.

Since the Senate passed the immigration bill in June, Rubio has largely avoided discussing the immigration issue, choosing instead to emphasize issues that resonate with that conservative base.

Rubio did not mention immigration in his Friday speech, but he re-upped his vow not to support a government spending bill if it includes funds for the 2010 federal health care law, and said he would vote against a measure to raise the debt limit unless it came with a balanced budget amendment.

“I will not vote for a short-term budget that spends one single cent on Obamacare,"" Rubio said to loud applause.

His efforts to defund Obamacare at all costs and others could help put him back in conservative good graces, but based on the attitude of activists here, the former tea party darling has much work to do."

He Sketches The Foolish', 'The Fallacious', 'The Felonious In Politics.']",Dana Milbank: Tea party is losing a few of its revelers,"Is it last call for the tea party?

Consider these recent developments:

Late Thursday: Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, a possible presidential candidate in 2016, ridicules fellow Republicans as the “stupid party” and urges Washington Republicans to get over their obsession with cutting budgets.

Friday afternoon: The office of Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell, another would-be Republican presidential candidate, declares that he will not go along with a plan, hatched by conservative legislators, to rewrite the state’s election laws in a way that would stack Virginia’s electoral votes against Democrats.

Late Friday: Fox News says it has parted ways with Sarah Palin, the former vice presidential candidate and tea-party darling whose following had shriveled.

1 of 171 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Tom Toles draws Republicans View Photos A collection of cartoons about the GOP. Caption A collection of cartoons about the GOP. Tom Toles Wait 1 second to continue.

Saturday: Reports emerge that House Speaker John Boehner had given a speech in which he referred to “hard heads” in his Republican caucus.

Monday: Sen. John McCain, who during his 2008 presidential run backed an enforcement-only approach to immigration, declares his support for a plan for undocumented immigrants to become legal. Joining him on the stage is Sen. Marco Rubio, one of the party’s brightest stars for 2016.

This last offense was too much for Rush Limbaugh, who denounced the “amnesty” plan. “Why are we doing this?” he asked Rubio on-air Tuesday.

Rubio was solicitous but firm. “We do have this existing problem that has to be dealt with,” he replied.

It is too early to call a requiem for the tea party. The informal movement still dominates the House Republicans. And the GOP’s puritanical primary process, encouraged by the redrawing of districts to protect Republican seats, guarantees that the far right will remain entrenched in the party for some time. Fresh evidence of the phenomenon can be seen in the decision by Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) to retire rather than face a primary challenge from the right.

But if the tea party isn’t over, some of the more sensible partygoers are heading for the exits, realizing that things are getting rowdy and the neighbors may soon be calling the cops. Republicans with national ambitions — Jindal, McDonnell, New Jersey’s Chris Christie — are moderating their images and views in ways that keep pace with the electorate.

That electorate punished some of the party’s more incendiary elements in November — Missouri’s Todd Akin, Indiana’s Richard Mourdock, Florida’s Allen West — and now many of those same people are voting with their remotes. Fox News apparently decided that it was no longer worth paying Palin to give televised warnings of the catastrophic effects of President Obama’s “socialist” policies.

Demagoguery works well in bad times, but it’s harder to stoke fear and anger when the stock market is at a five-year high and the private sector has been adding jobs for nearly three years.

If anything, anger has turned against tea-party lawmakers. Christie, one of the most popular Republicans in the land, decried GOP leaders’ “disgusting” behavior after they forced a delay in funds for Hurricane Sandy recovery. The leaders relented, allowing the spending bill, like Obama’s tax hike on the wealthy, to pass despite no votes from most House Republicans.

On immigration, likewise, fear of the tea party’s demagoguery has subsided. McCain, for example, fought off a primary challenge in 2010 from an opponent who called him soft on illegal immigration. But on Monday, McCain stood up to those who would call his new plan amnesty. A “de facto amnesty” already exists, he said. “We have been too content for too long to allow individuals to mow our lawn, serve our food, clean our homes and even watch our children, while not affording them any of the benefits that make our country so great.”

The return of the old McCain (in 2010, he endorsed Arizona’s harsh immigration law) is an encouraging sign, as was the retirement of Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.), a reflexive critic of anything he could label “amnesty.”

More good news comes from the House, where most declined to join Limbaugh in his “amnesty” rant. And Rubio, though he owes his job to the tea party, wasn’t going to be bullied.

“I know why people are uncomfortable about it,” he told Limbaugh on Tuesday. But he defended compromise. “Anytime I see anything that’s harmful to America, as a policymaker I try to make it better,” he said. “I’m just trying to do the best I can with what’s already a tough situation.”

Palin probably would disagree. But who cares?

D’Amato, a New York Republican, and Benjamin Abrams, a former top aide to Representative Steny H. Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat and House minority whip, have already been pressing Homeland Security officials and lawmakers on behalf of their clients, efforts that have been backed up with millions of dollars of industry campaign contributions.

Homeland Security would have to decide, in consultation with Congress, how to divide the money — on long-range cameras, radar systems, mobile surveillance equipment, aircraft or lower-tech solutions like more border agents or physical fences — decisions that would determine how various contractors might fare.

“It has been a tough time for the industry: people have been laid off or furloughed,” said James P. Creaghan, a lobbyist who represents a small Texas company, Personal Defense, which is trying to sell more night-vision goggles to Homeland Security. “This could help out.”

Northrop has won some important allies on Capitol Hill, including Senator Thomas R. Carper, Democrat of Delaware, the chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, who is urging the department to invest more in Northrop’s drone-mounted surveillance system, called Vader. General Atomics, which Mr. D’Amato represents, has so much support in Congress that it has pressed Homeland Security in recent years to buy more Predator drones than the department has the personnel to operate, so they often sit unused, according to an agency audit.

The specific requirement in the legislation now before the Senate is that Homeland Security must install surveillance equipment or other measures that would allow it to apprehend or turn back 9 out of 10 people trying to illegally enter across all sectors of the southern land border. The department would be prohibited from moving ahead with the “pathway to citizenship” for immigrants already in the United States until this new security strategy is “substantially operational.”

The bill is scheduled to be taken up for debate on the Senate floor next week, and certain Republicans have already drafted amendments that would make the requirement even more demanding, explicitly mandating that the 90 percent standard be achieved before the pathway to citizenship can proceed."

Zuckerberg announced the formation of Fwd.us (pronounced ""forward us"") in an op-ed article in The Washington Post late Wednesday. In it, he said the U.S. needs a new approach to these issues if it is to get ahead economically. This, he wrote, includes offering talented, skilled immigrants a path to citizenship.

[pullquote]

""We have a strange immigration policy for a nation of immigrants,"" Zuckerberg wrote. ""And it's a policy unfit for today's world.""

The move comes as a bipartisan Senate group is expected to roll out a comprehensive immigration bill in the coming days. Zuckerberg's goal echoes the proposed legislation. Zuckerberg, whose great-grandparents were immigrants, said he wants ""comprehensive immigration reform that begins with effective border security, allows a path to citizenship and lets us attract the most talented and hardest-working people, no matter where they were born.""

Zuckerberg also calls for higher standards and accountability in schools and increased focus on learning about science, technology, engineering and math. Today's knowledge and ideas-based economy, the 28-year-old Harvard dropout wrote, is very different from the economy of the 20th century that was based on natural resources, industrial machines and labor.

Fwd.us, he said, was created to ""to build the knowledge economy the United States needs to ensure more jobs, innovation and investment.""

Also backing the group are tech leaders such as LinkedIn Corp. CEO Reid Hoffman, venture capitalists John Doerr and Jim Breyer, as well as Ruchi Sanghvi of Dropbox, who was Facebook's first female engineer. Joe Green, founder of Causes.com, a social network for community organizing, serves as the group's president and founder.

Major financial contributors include Google Chairman Eric Schmidt, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer, SpaceX and Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk, Zynga CEO Mark Pincus and former Groupon CEO Andrew Mason.

Zuckerberg is not the only high-ranking Facebook executive to use his role to advance social causes. Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg launched LeanIn.org, a nonprofit aimed at arming women with the tools and guidance they need to keep moving forward in the workforce.

The formation of Zuckerberg's group was reported by The Associated Press and other outlets last month.

Sen. Marco Rubio calls plan %22a starting point%22

Bill allows those in country without documentation to apply for citizenship

Plan faces long struggle to get through Congress

WASHINGTON -- After more than two months of pain-staking negotiations behind closed doors, a bipartisan group of senators are ready to unveil their sweeping proposal Tuesday that would fundamentally alter the nation's immigration laws for the first time in a generation.

Members of the Senate's so-called Gang of Eight that have been crafting the bill took to the airwaves Sunday to begin selling the plan, and are scheduled to publicly unveil the 1,000-plus page bill this week.

""What we're working on is a starting point,"" Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said on Meet the Press in one of seven appearances he made to begin explaining the bill. ""I think it's a very good piece of legislation, but obviously there are 92 other senators who have ideas of their own.""

The bill allows unauthorized immigrants who arrived in the U.S. on or before Dec. 31, 2011, to almost immediately apply for temporary legal status that would allow them to live and work in the country.

The focus would then shift to immigration enforcement, as the Department of Homeland Security would be required to monitor 100% of the nation's southwest border with Mexico, and intercept 90% of people trying to cross illegally. Business owners would be required to use the E-Verify system, which lets them check the immigration status of new employees, and the federal government would have to establish a program to identify each time a foreigner enters and exits the country.

If those benchmarks are reached, and after 10 years have passed, unauthorized immigrants could then apply for a green card. If approved, they could then apply for U.S. citizenship three years afterward.

The bill will be scrutinized almost immediately during a hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee scheduled for Wednesday. And with a group of bipartisan members of the House developing their own bill, and the White House developing yet another version of the bill in case Congress moves too slowly, the Senate bill represents just the first step in a long, difficult path that should play out over several months.

Some of those senators wasted no time raising their concerns with the bill. Several GOP senators expressed dismay that the bill would grant the temporary legal status and work visas to unauthorized immigrants before the borders have been deemed secure. That is one of the biggest concerns for Republicans who fear a repeat of the 1986 immigration law, which allowed up to 3 million unauthorized immigrants to become citizens but did not fulfill promises of a secured border.

""So much of it is regaining the public's confidence that the federal government is actually doing its job (on border security),"" Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said on Fox News Sunday. ""So until that confidence is restored, on the basis of what the legislation provides, I would have difficulty supporting it."""

Here’s the key part:

PK: John Boehner and [Eric] Cantor aren’t worried about losing the majority at this point, and that’s why they are constantly tending to their base inside the Republican Study Committee. They don’t believe the majority is at stake, so they worry more about their internal standing in HC5. That’s where you see the impact of gerrymandering, in the way leadership caters to its fringe elements.

Both Charlie and Stu – Cook and Rothenberg, respectively – have fewer than 30 House Republican seats as even in play, total, for 2014. Most of those are not even toss-ups, they’re just those remotely in play. That’s a fundamentally different orbit than what the Gingrich-Hastert-DeLay conference floated in from 1995-2007. Back then, when they regularly had about 230 seats, they pushed hard to the right but always feared losing their swing district seats and, therefore, their majority.

Even if redistricting only creates a buffer of 15 to 20 fewer seats in play for R’s, that’s a buffer that, for now, leaves GOP leaders not in fear of losing the majority. The result of that lack of political fear is, leaders suffer from what I call “HC5 Syndrome” – decisions are increasingly based on how they will play out inside the basement room where Republicans regularly meet, not on how they play out on the national political landscape.

AB: Fair points, again. I agree that Boehner likely isn’t as concerned about losing the House as he would have been two years ago. But I don’t think it’s as big a difference as people think.

Fair Vote did a good study on this. They showed that, before this round of redistricting, the GOP had 189 safe seats and there were 89 “balanced” seats. So Republicans needed to win 29 of 89 balanced seats (32.5 percent) to hold the majority. Today, after redistricting, there are 195 safe GOP seats and 74 balanced seats. So the GOP needs to win 23 of the 74 balanced seats (31.1 percent). The fact is that 31.1 percent and 32.5 percent aren’t that far apart.

I think the fact that the GOP majority is safer than it was before has as much or more to do with the fact that they were finally able to pick off all those conservative Democratic districts that should have been theirs to begin with. Even under the old map, GOP would have been heavily favored to keep the majority going forward. All they have to do is win one-third of the competitive seats."

University of Illinois-Chicago has begun exploring bidding for the future Obama presidential library

Presidential libraries draw hundreds of thousands of visitors each year

Obama hasn%27t offered any clues on where he might like the library to end up

The University of Illinois at Chicago wants President Obama to bring his future presidential library to the city campus, USA TODAY has learned.

Bill Burton, a spokesman for UIC, confirmed to USA TODAY on Friday that Chancellor Paula Allen-Meares decided in May to form a university exploratory committee to look into bidding for the library and museum that will be built after Obama leaves office. Burton said he had no details about who is on the exploratory committee or what, if any, actions they have taken thus far in their pursuit.

Allen-Meares declined to comment.

So far Obama hasn't offered any clues as to where he'd like to locate his library. Typically, sitting presidents don't signal to supporters to begin fundraising for the libraries — which are administered by National Archives and Records Administration but whose construction is privately funded — until the latter part of their time in office.

But because the libraries, which serve as repositories for the president's records as well as museums chronicling their time in office, have become such huge undertakings, universities need to show their interest early.

The libraries, which potentially can draw hundreds of thousands of visitors each year, can also provide an economic boom for the community that hosts them. The William J. Clinton Library and Museum, which opened in 2004, spurred $1 billion in real estate investment in downtown Little Rock, Ark. The George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum, which opened in April, is projected to drive $50 million into the local economy annually, according to Phillip Jones, chief executive officer of the Dallas Visitors and Convention Bureau.

UIC, the state's second largest school, is the latest in a growing list of universities in the president's adopted hometown and in his birthplace of Hawaii that have shown interest in hosting his presidential center and museum.

In May, Chicago State University — a historically black university in the heart of the neighborhood where Obama worked as community organizers in the 1980s before attending law school — announced the formation of a presidential library exploratory committee.

Wayne Watson, Chicago State's president, said he has dispatched senior university officials to discuss the process with National Archives and Records Administration Officials as well as pick the brains of operators at some of the 13 libraries administered by the National Archives.

""His political roots are right here on the South Side, pretty much in a 2-mile radius of where we are,"" Watson said in an interview earlier this week. ""Secondly, President Obama represents hope … If there is one community in Chicago that needs to have hope reinforced, it's the community where the president got his start.""

The University of Chicago, where Obama taught law, said in a statement that it is premature to talk about any bid for the library. But in December, top officials traveled to Dallas and met with archivists at The George W. Bush Presidential Library at Southern Methodist University. Among the University of Chicago representatives at the Dallas meeting was Susan Sher, a former chief of staff to first lady Michelle Obama, according to the Associated Press. Sher is now a senior adviser to the University of Chicago's president.

The University of Hawaii launched the Hawaii Presidential Center Initiative last year in hopes of luring Obama to bring his library to his birthplace.

Robert Perkinson, who is directing the initiative, said in a May interview that the state has set aside oceanfront property in Honolulu that could be used for the library."

Officials said the releases, which began last week and continued on Tuesday, were a response to the possibility of automatic governmentwide budget cuts, known as sequestration, which are scheduled to take effect on Friday.

“As fiscal uncertainty remains over the continuing resolution and possible sequestration, ICE has reviewed its detained population to ensure detention levels stay within ICE’s current budget,” the agency’s spokeswoman, Gillian M. Christensen, said in a statement. The agency’s budget for custody operations in the current fiscal year is $2.05 billion, officials said, and as of Saturday, ICE was holding 30,773 people in its detention system.

Immigration officials said Tuesday that they had no plans to release substantially more detainees this week, though they warned that more releases were still possible depending on the outcome of budget negotiations.

They refused to specify exactly how many detainees were released, or where the releases took place. But immigrants’ advocates around the country have reported that detainees were freed in several places, including Hudson County, N.J.; Polk County, Tex.; Broward County, Fla.; New Orleans; and from centers in Alabama, Arizona, Georgia and New York."

And the second demand is that Congress stop bleeding the Postal Service dry.

Led by Citizens to Save the Berkeley Post Office, community members will assemble at 11:30 a.m. for a rally at 909 Montgomery in front of the offices of Blum Capital Partners. Blum Capital is a private equity firm founded in 1976 by Richard Blum, a current regent of the University of California. Commercial real estate giant Coldwell Banker Richard Ellis (CBRE) is among the many investments of Blum Capital. In fact the Chairman of CBRE is Richard Blum.

The Postal Service is eager to sell properties in their control to raise quick cash. CBRE advises the USPS on what properties to sell. The properties are advertised on a joint CBRE/ USPS website and as a general rule CBRE profits again as the listing agent.

After the rally in front of Blum Capital, the marchers intend to proceed down Montgomery Street to One Post Street, the office of California Senator Dianne Feinstein. Senator Feinstein's husband is Richard Blum.

Newspaper headlines read ""The Post Office is Going Broke"". Truth: The Postal Service is being bled dry by a law passed in the 2006 lame duck session of Congress.

Senator Feinstein must take a lead in changing the 2006 law.

The USPS is managed by an independent Board of Governors of 11 members. Nine are appointed by the President, no more than five from one political party. There are three vacancies on the Board. Of the six presidential appointments, only one was appointed by President Barack Obama. The term of office of Dennis Toner, Obama's sole appointee, expires December 8, 2012.

Elections must have consequences. Surely the President should be able to make appointments to the USPS Board of Governors and just as surely Senator Dianne Feinstein must reconsider her qualms on filibuster reform. We are entitled in this democracy to have judges, agency administrators and Postal Service governors appointed by the President that we elected in 2008 and re-elected this November.

Partial transcript via Fox News:

ED HENRY: Can you give us an update on the sequester because yesterday, the Customs and Border Protection (INAUDIBLE) said that they’re actually postponing furloughs and overtime cuts for border patrol agents. I thought in February, when Secretary Napolitano came out here with you, she told us it was dire, these border patrol agents were going to be furloughed and that we were going to be less safe because of that.

JAY CARNEY: Well, I think both are true. What is — what is a fact is that when you’re dealing with these kinds of across-the-board forced budget cuts in the middle of the fiscal year and you’re having to make all sorts of adjustments to account for them and to reduce your expenditures accordingly, you know, it’s a moving picture. And you know, what — and that can be on the plus side where furloughs may take place a little later or on the minus side, where things may be more immediate.

Watch the video to see how heated it got. More proof Henry is a great reporter.

Though they are more than capable of going overboard at times, the media-at-large does a very good job of vetting and holding Republicans accountable. What Ed Henry just did used to happen practically every day to the White House press secretary between the years of 2001 and 2009. Moreover, there were frequent gang tackles where members of the White House press corps would coordinate to ensure a question got answered.

I didn’t hear anyone jumping in to help Henry, did you?

And these lapdogs wonder why Obama treats them like one-night stands.

http://news.yahoo.com/food-stamps-again-vivid-symbol-poverty-debate-190719247.html,,[],Food stamps again a vivid symbol in poverty debate,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Food stamps have figured in Americans' ideas about the poor for decades, from President Lyndon Johnson's vision of a Great Society to President Ronald Reagan's scorn for crooked ""welfare queens"" and President Bill Clinton's pledge to ""end welfare as we know it.""

Partisans tend to see what they want to see in the food stamp program: barely enough bread and milk to sustain hungry children, or chips and soda — maybe even steak and illicit beer — for cheaters and layabouts gaming the system.

Those differences were on display Thursday when the House voted to cut almost $4 billion a year, or 5 percent, from the roughly $80 billion-a-year program.

The House bill would tighten eligibility standards, allow states to impose new work requirements and permit drug testing for recipients, among other cuts to spending. A Senate bill would cut around one-tenth of the amount of the House bill, or $400 million a year.

Republicans argued that work requirements target the aid to the neediest people. Democrats said the swelling rolls — more than 47 million people are now using the food stamps, or 1 in 7 Americans — show that the program is working at a time of high unemployment and great need.

A look at the history and future of food stamps:

___

NO MORE STAMPS

These days, people in the nation's largest food aid program pay with plastic.

These special debit cards are swiped at convenience store or supermarket checkouts to pay for groceries. The cards can't be used for alcohol or cigarettes or nonfood items such as toothpaste, paper towels or dog chow. Junk food or high-priced treats are OK.

The first food stamps were a temporary plan to help feed the hungry toward the end of the Great Depression of the 1930s. The government subsidized the cost of blue stamps that poor people used to buy food from farm surpluses.

The idea was revived in the 1960s and expanded under Johnson into a permanent program that sold food coupons to low-income people at a discount. Beginning in the 1970s, food stamps were given to the poor for free. Benefit cards began replacing paper in the 1980s, a move designed to reduce fraud and ease the embarrassment food stamp users felt at the cash register.

Story continues

Food stamps aren't the government's only way to feed those in need. There are more than a dozen smaller programs, including the one for Women, Infants and Children, and free and reduced-price school lunches.

In 2008, food stamps were officially renamed the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. Most people still know the name that's been familiar since 1939.

___

ONE IN EVERY 7 AMERICANS

In a nation of 314 million people, more than 47 million are eating with food stamps each month.

Who are they? Children and teenagers make up almost half, according to the Agriculture Department. About 10 percent are seniors.

The vast majority don't receive any cash welfare. Many households that shop with SNAP cards have someone who's employed but qualify for help because of low earnings.

The average food stamp allotment is $133 a person per month. The monthly amount a family gets depends on the household's size, earnings and expenses, as well as changing food prices and other factors.

Households can qualify for help with earnings up to 30 percent higher than the federal poverty level, making the limit about $30,000 for a family of four this year. These households are limited to no more than $2,000 in savings, or $3,250 if there are elderly or disabled residents.

In addition, most states allow people to qualify automatically for food stamps if they are eligible for certain other welfare programs, even if they don't meet the strict SNAP standards. Although food stamps are paid for with federal tax dollars, states administer the program and have some choices in setting requirements.

Language in Clinton's 1996 welfare overhaul required able-bodied adults who aren't raising children to work or attend job training or similar programs to qualify for food stamps after three months. But those work requirements across most of the nation have been waived for several years because of the high unemployment rate.

People who are living in the United States illegally aren't eligible for food stamps. Most adults who immigrate legally aren't eligible during their first five years in the country.

___

RISING LIKE YEAST

The cost to taxpayers more than doubled over just four years, from $38 billion in 2008 to $78 billion last year.

Liberals see a program responding to rising need at a time of economic turmoil. Conservatives see out-of-control spending, and many Republicans blame President Barack Obama. While seeking the GOP presidential nomination in 2012, Newt Gingrich labeled Obama the ""food stamp president.""

Some of the growth can be attributed to Obama's food stamp policies, but Congress' budget analysts blame most of it on the economy.

The big factors:

—The SNAP program is an entitlement, meaning everyone who is eligible can get aid, no matter the cost to taxpayers.

—Millions of jobs were lost in the recession that hit in 2007. Unemployment is still high, and many people who have jobs are working fewer hours or for lower pay than before, meaning more people are eligible.

—Obama's 2009 economic stimulus temporarily increased benefit amounts; that boost is set to expire on Nov. 1. Time limits for jobless adults without dependents are still being waived in most of the country.

—Food stamp eligibility requirements were loosened by Congress in 2002 and 2008, before Obama became president.

—Fluctuating food prices have driven up monthly benefit amounts, which are based on a low-cost diet.

___

FEWER TO FEED?

The number of people using food stamps appears to be leveling off this year, and long-term budget projections suggest the number will begin to fall as the economy improves.

Why is it taking so long? Although the jobless rate has dropped from its 2009 peak, it remains high, leaving a historically large number of people eligible for food stamps. Since the recession began, a bigger portion of people who are eligible have signed up for food stamps than in the past.

Many people who enrolled during the worst days of the recession still qualify for SNAP cards, even if they are doing a little better now. For example, they may have gone from being laid off to working a low-paying or part-time job.

The Congressional Budget Office predicts in about a decade the number of people using food stamps will drop to 34 million, or about 1 in every 10 people.

___

FOOD AND FRAUD

Abuse was a worry from the start. The 1939 food stamp program was launched in May and by that October a retailer had been caught violating the rules.

There's been progress along the way, especially after the nationwide adoption of SNAP cards, which are harder to sell for cash than paper coupons were. The government says such ""trafficking"" in food stamps has fallen significantly over the past two decades, from about 4 cents on the dollar in 1993 to a penny per dollar in 2008.

But many lawmakers say fraud is still costing taxpayers too much. Some people lie about their income, apply for benefits in multiple states or fail to quit the program when their earnings go up. Recipients must tell their state agency within 10 days if their income goes over the limit.

Some stores illegally accept food stamps to pay for other merchandise, even beer or electronics, or give out cash at a cut rate in exchange for phony food purchases, which are then reimbursed by the government.

___

FOOD AND FARMS

In Congress, it's a marriage of convenience.

Food stamp policy has been packaged in the same bill with farm subsidies and other agricultural programs since the 1970s. It was a canny way of assuring that urban lawmakers who wanted the poverty program would vote for farm spending. That worked until this year, when conservatives balked at the skyrocketing cost of food stamps.

In June, a farm bill that included food stamps was defeated in the Republican-led House because fiscal conservatives felt it didn't cut the program deeply enough.

In response, GOP leaders split the food and farm programs in two. The House passed the farm version in July and the food stamp version on Thursday. Both passed with narrow votes.

The House and Senate versions must be reconciled before the five-year farm bill can become law, and that won't be an easy task.

Food stamps remain in the farm bill passed by the Senate. That bill made only a half-percent cut to food stamps and the Democratic-led Senate will be reluctant to cut more deeply or to evict the poverty program from its home in the farm bill. Obama supported the cuts in the Senate bill, but has opposed any changes beyond that. The White House threatened to veto the House food stamp bill.

___

WHAT NOW?

The current farm and food law expires at the end of the month.

If the two sides can't agree by then, a likely scenario, Congress could vote to extend the law as it is, at the expense of many planned updates to agricultural policy. There won't be much urgency to do that until the end of the year, when some dairy supports expire and milk prices could rise.

Other farm supports won't expire until next year, but farmers have been frustrated with the drawn-out debate that has now lasted two years, saying they need more government certainty as they manage their farm operations.

SNAP benefits would still be available for now. While farm bills set food stamp policy, the money is paid out through annual appropriations bills that so far have left benefits intact.

(CNN) —

The U.S. Senate gave final approval Thursday to a roughly 1,200-page bill that promises to overhaul immigration laws for the first time since 1986, creating a path to citizenship for millions of undocumented residents while ratcheting up security along the Mexican border.

Senators passed the sweeping legislation – initially drafted by the four Democrats and four Republicans in the chamber’s so-called “Gang of Eight” – by a 68-32 vote.

Fourteen Republicans joined a united Democratic caucus in supporting the bill, which is backed by the White House and has the potential to become the crowning legislative achievement of President Barack Obama’s second term.

In a White House statement, Obama hailed the Senate vote as “a critical step” toward fixing what he called a broken immigration system. He labeled the measure that now goes to the Republican-controlled House a compromise, adding that “we just need Congress to finish the job.”

The Senate vote included a rare adherence to old-fashioned protocol. Vice President Joe Biden presided in his constitutional capacity as head of the Senate, and senators voted one-by-one from their desks, calling out “aye” or “no.”

Republican Sen. Jerry Moran of Kansas broke the drama of the moment when he mistakenly voted “aye,” then quickly asked the clerk to make it “no” as the chamber erupted in laughter. Biden tapped his gavel and called for order.

Before announcing the result, Biden warned against outbursts from the public gallery, but chants of “Yes we can” and “Si se puede” broke out after he read the tally. Biden called for the sergeant at arms to restore order.

“Today is another historic day in the Senate,” said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont. “This legislation will reunite families. It will bring millions of people out of the shadows and into our legal system. It will spur job growth and reduce our deficit. And it will make us safer.”

“The time has come to act in the interest of all Americans,” declared Sen. Bob Menendez, D-New Jersey, a member of the Gang of Eight. “I hope that message will be heard loud and clear in the House (of Representatives).”

Historic ruling opens door for immigration for same-sex spouses

Most congressional conservatives, however, remain staunchly opposed to the measure, and have declared it dead on arrival in the House.

Obama warned in his statement that opponents of immigration reform will try even harder to derail it. Noting the broad support for the Senate bill from the business community, organized labor and others, he urged people to contact their House representatives and “tell them to do the right thing.”

Republicans are sharply divided over the politically sensitive issue. In the wake of the GOP’s crushing loss among Hispanics in the 2012 election, many top voices in the party have pushed for an endorsement of some form of a path to citizenship for the country’s roughly 11 million undocumented residents.

“No one should dispute (that) like every sovereign nation on this planet, we have a right to control who comes in. But unlike other countries, we are not afraid of people coming in here from other places,” said Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, the most prominent Republican in the Gang of Eight and a potential 2016 presidential candidate. “I support this reform. Not just because I believe in immigrants, but because I believe in America even more.”

For many of the GOP’s strongest supporters, any path to citizenship for those who entered the country illegally is a form of unforgivable amnesty. They also don’t trust the Obama administration to fully enact the bill’s new border security measures, which are generally opposed by progressives.

“There’s just no way I can look my constituents in the eye and tell them that today’s assurances won’t become tomorrow’s disappointments,” said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky. “We’ll never resolve the immigration problem on a bipartisan basis either now or in the future until we can prove that the border is secure as a condition of legalization.”

Senate takes another step toward passing immigration reform

Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, called the vote on the measure “largely symbolic” and predicted the bill would ultimately be relegated to the “ash heap of history.”

If enacted, the measure would create a 13-year path to citizenship for most undocumented immigrants, while raising the cap on visas for high skilled workers and establishing a new visa program for low skilled workers on America’s farms.

A recently added border security amendment – introduced by GOP Sens. John Hoeven of North Dakota and Bob Corker of Tennessee – would require 20,000 more border agents, complete 700 miles of fence along the boundary with Mexico, and deploy $3.2 billion in technology upgrades similar to equipment used by U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan.

The amendment also strengthens eligibility verification and border entry-exit controls.

Most undocumented immigrants would be eligible for permanent residency only after the five conditions have been met and verified by the Department of Homeland Security.

While Corker’s and Hoeven’s change appeared to sway some reticent Republicans in the Senate, top House Republicans remained opposed the overall blueprint.

“Apparently some haven’t gotten the message: the House is not going to take up and vote on whatever the Senate passes,” said Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. “We’re going to do our own bill … and move the legislation that reflects the will of our majority and the will of the American people.”

House Republicans have indicated their intention to tackle the issue with several smaller proposals instead of one larger bill.

Boehner repeated his pledge to block a vote on any immigration measure that doesn’t have the support of a majority of House Republicans. Democrats contend the Senate version would pass the House if brought to a vote, with a united Democratic caucus joined by some Republicans.

The speaker also refused to take a position on whether or not there should be some kind of path to citizenship for those who entered the country illegally.

Democrats have repeatedly warned they will not agree to a plan that lacks such a path.

Regardless, Boehner said he hopes the House will deal with immigration reform this year.

“I have made it clear since the day after the election that this political football should stop, and that the Congress should deal with this issue,” he said.

The Employment Development Department upgraded its 30-year-old system over Labor Day weekend with the aim of streamlining benefits processing. But the new system malfunctioned, forcing state workers to approve payments manually. That has created a massive backlog snaring 15% of claims filed since Sept. 1.

State officials say they’re working around the clock, but can’t say when they’ll catch up. The EDD has apologized on social media and is notifying affected Californians by mail.

But that’s little consolation to those whose benefits have been delayed. Many are falling behind on rent, car payments, and other bills and fault the EDD for its lack of action.

“They say they’re very sorry, but sorry doesn’t pay all the late fees we’re being charged due to their negligence,” said Tanya Cain, 43, who was laid off from a construction firm in late July. “A landlord doesn’t understand why you can’t pay the rent. They just understand you’re not paying it.”

Cain is owed about $1,500 in back payments. She has borrowed money to stay afloat but is down to her last $50. An automatic car insurance payment is about to hit her bank account, which would leave her overdrawn.

The computer snafu is the latest problem to plague the EDD, which has been forced to reduce services in recent months because of federal budget cuts. The agency no longer answers its unemployment hotline in the afternoons, and its regional jobs centers have lost some funding.

Loree Levy, a spokeswoman for the EDD, said officials expected some hiccups with the system upgrade “but we didn’t know it’d be to this magnitude.”

“We are well aware of the hardship this has created for people,” Levy said. “It’s requiring our utmost attention.”

Out-of-work Californians file their benefits claims by phone, mail or online. The new computer system was aimed at shortening the time needed for approval by automating much of the backroom administrative work.

The new system inadvertently flagged thousands of claims for additional review, Levy said, creating a logjam in the already taxed system. She said hundreds of EDD employees have been working overtime to process the outstanding claims by hand.

From Friday to Sunday, state workers approved $31.7 million in unemployment benefits, the agency said. Offices are normally closed Sunday, but the agency typically processes an average of $17.5 million in benefits Fridays to Saturdays.

“We think we’re finally through the worst of it,” Levy said.

Still, it’s a black eye for the agency tasked with providing employer-funded benefits to the state’s jobless. Legislators around the state, who are currently on recess, said their offices have been fielding calls and emails from residents who are not getting unemployment payments.

A spokesman for Gov. Jerry Brown referred inquiries to the EDD.

“Some are angry and upset. Some simply need the checks so they can pay the bills,” said state Sen. Ted Lieu (D-Torrance). “If this is prolonged, then it will cause ripple effects for people who can’t pay their living expenses.”

Lieu said his office was doing what it could to help constituents by calling the EDD about individual cases. He blamed part of the problem on the federal budget cuts known as sequestration.

“The EDD lost an enormous number of positions,” he said.

In 2010, at the height of California’s unemployment when 1.5 million people were receiving unemployment payouts, the agency had 3,210 workers processing claims, according to the EDD’s Levy. There are now 2,182 workers processing 770,000 unemployment claims.

The EDD has been criticized in the past for being slow and unresponsive to unemployed Californians.

A state audit last year found that in the fiscal year ended June 2012, more than 17 million calls to the EDD — 24% of all calls made — went unanswered. And of the nearly 30 million calls in which individuals asked to speak with an EDD agent, 84% were unsuccessful.

The agency says it was hampered by the sharp rise in claims caused by the lingering effects of the recession and has since instituted changes recommended by auditors.

One economist said the state government has an obligation to send checks on time so people dependent on those payments can buy food and pay for necessities.

“It’s a serious and critical situation,” said Sung Won Sohn, an economist at Cal State Channel Islands. “Many people receiving benefits, they live check to check. If it’s delayed even a day, it could mean that they can’t eat.”

The EDD’s recent troubles come as the state’s labor market has cooled and the jobless rate has ticked up. The agency reported last week that the state unemployment rate in August rose to 8.9%, the second straight monthly increase.

Despite an improvement in employment levels in recent years, 4.7 million people in the U.S. have been unemployed for 27 weeks or more, according to the Labor Department. The long-term unemployed account for 38% of all those still looking for work.

Californians waiting for unemployment checks are expressing outrage on social media, posting complaints on the EDD’s Facebook page.

One woman wrote: “You guys are horrible, been waiting too long... Sold my wedding band Friday just to get through the weekend, and it’s now Monday, still [nothing].”

Others are sharing tips on how to get an agent on the phone, listing various phone numbers to get patched through. Some posts have included information on how to get emergency food and aid from nonprofit groups.

Cutting through the red tape has been frustrating for former insurance agent Bonnie Schultz, 61.

The Banning resident said she depends on the $450 she gets each week to pay her $988 monthly mortgage. She has already missed a payment on her homeowner insurance and can barely fill her gas tank.

Getting an answer to when her claim will be processed has been a chore. Schultz said she called EDD numerous times without reaching anyone.

“Why have they not sent us something in the mail at least saying there’s a problem?” she said. “This is insane.”

As a deeply respected economist, she will bring two vital attributes to that role as a steward of the economy.

First, she represents continuity with the Fed’s current low-interest-rate policies to foster employment while controlling inflation. Those policies, which she has helped to create and sustain, have undeniably boosted the flagging economy.

Just as undeniably, they have generated controversy and consternation. Ms. Yellen has expertly addressed those concerns, including the risks inherent in a prolonged low-interest-rate policy, though the most feared effect, inflation, is as yet nowhere in sight.

She also has been realistic about the limits of the Fed’s efforts. Her grasp of the issues in all their complexity has given her the credibility to lead the Fed in deciding how long to continue monetary stimulus policies and how eventually to ease up and end them."

""The policies have been arbitrary, inconsistent, and ever-changing,"" Rep. Doc Hastings, R-Wash., chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, said.

He alleged the National Park Service is trying to make the partial shutdown ""as painful and as visible as possible.""

GOP lawmakers sharply questioned a string of recent NPS moves, as Director Jonathan Jarvis claimed his agency was trying to comply with the law and make do with limited resources. They questioned why the park service tried to shutter some private businesses on federal land, closed off open-air memorials in D.C. to most public viewing, and even blocked off parking lots.

Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said ""punitive measures were taken at no savings to the American people.""

Reacting to a reported internal claim that the park service directed workers to make the cuts as difficult as possible, Issa said, if true, ""it is indeed disgusting and despicable that the Park Service would do this.""

Jarvis later called that claim ""hearsay.""

Jarvis was compelled with a subpoena to testify on Wednesday. He said he was willing to appear, but wanted to wait until his staff returned from furlough.

In a series of feisty exchanges, Jarvis defended his agency's actions.

""Turning away visitors is not our culture or our DNA,"" he said.

He said that in Washington, D.C., the agency typically has 300 employees on duty to manage and patrol the District's famed monuments and sites. All but a dozen were furloughed, he said.

Explaining the decisions to close off memorials, including open-air sites like the World War II Memorial, he said the agency took ""prudent and practical steps."" He said the agency has worked ""diligently"" to ensure ""honor flights"" of WWII veterans were not turned away from the memorials despite the restrictions -- allowing them access on the basis of their First Amendment rights.

""With very few employees available, we are endeavoring to fulfill our mission the best we can,"" Jarvis said.

He denied politics were involved, and said all monuments have to be staffed to protect them from vandalism and other harm.

Democrats, meanwhile, took turns lambasting the GOP majority for holding the hearing in the first place, claiming their party was responsible for the partial government shutdown which triggered the parks cuts.

""You can't create something and then pretend you're outraged by the result,"" Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., said.

Rep. Raul Grijalva, D-Ariz., said Republicans are living in an ""alternative universe"" and ""can't cope with reality."""
"http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-business-immigration-20130223,0,676130.story",2013-02-22 08:00:00,['Alana Semuels Is A Former Staff Writer For The Los Angeles Times.'],Business owners emerge as vocal force in pro-immigration debate,"AVON PARK, Fla. — Spend a few minutes talking to Joe Wright near the vast open fields of his dairy farm, and it quickly becomes clear that he’s a staunch Republican.

The list of federal and state programs he would end, given a chance, is considerable: food stamps, subsidized housing, free school lunches, unemployment insurance.

But Wright, who owns the 1,300-acre V&W; Farms here and is president of the 300-farm Southeast Milk Cooperative, says he’s about ready to leave the Republican Party if it doesn’t push hard for immigration reform this year.

“This is an issue where the conservative Republicans are just plain wrong,” he said recently as a steady trail of 1,500-pound Jersey-Holstein crossbreeds plodded toward the milking parlor, bellowing on their way. “We cannot milk cows without Hispanic labor, period.”

Business owners like Wright have emerged as a significant force in negotiations over immigration reform this year, reaching an important agreement with labor groups this week about how to ensure workers continue coming into the U.S. This issue was one of many stumbling blocks in the 2007 debate over immigration reform, and may indicate that business is ready to support reform more vocally.

“There’s no question that businesses are going to be more out there — everyone from the big guys to the little guys,” said Tamar Jacoby, president and chief executive of ImmigrationWorks USA, a federation of state-based pro-immigration coalitions. “Business has learned over these past five, six, seven years more and more that it needs to engage.”

To be sure, more outspoken businesses doesn’t necessarily mean reform will come more easily. Businesses still have to find a way to agree with labor on the details, and different types of businesses want different bills. Many in agriculture favor a guest worker program that allows farmers to hire migrant workers with minimal red tape, while technology companies want a way for high-skilled foreign workers to stay in the United States. Hotels and restaurants, as well as dairy farmers such as Wright, want a year-round labor supply to fill undesirable jobs.

Wright says it will be much harder to operate his farm if Congress doesn’t pass an immigration overhaul. The work is dirty: herding cows at dawn, milking 144 an hour with the help of machines, giving them shots, sticking a hand into a cow to check whether she is pregnant, while she defecates on you. And though the job comes with housing, it calls upon employees to be available at all hours should a cow get sick or go into labor.

Americans don’t apply for the jobs, he said, even though they can earn $10 or more an hour. One year he was so short of labor that he got foreign veterinary students from Croatia, Uruguay and Zimbabwe to help him run the farm.

“I hired an Anglo once,” Wright said, watching as two Latino workers moved quickly down an aisle of cows, hooking milking devices to their udders. “He made it 30 days, but he didn’t make it 60.”

For many businesses, the stakes are higher this time around, as they see states adopt stricter immigration policies and vow to make mandatory e-Verify, a government program that allows employers to check a worker’s status.

In Georgia, where the Legislature passed a measure in 2011 requiring police to check the immigration status of criminal suspects, growers lost 40% of crops because farmers didn’t have the labor to harvest them, said Charles Hall, executive director of the state’s Fruit and Vegetable Growers Assn.

Advertisement

In Arizona, where the passage of a similar measure, SB 1070, drew national attention in 2010, some construction companies can no longer find enough workers because so many Latinos have left the state, said Todd Landfried, executive director of Arizona Employers for Immigration Reform.

Many businesses have formed advocacy groups in response to these laws, but having them as such active players in the pro-reform coalition also gives rise to friction.

“Business can play an important function and likely will, but their inclusion in the coalition creates a lot of tension,” said Steve Camarota, director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports tighter controls on immigration. “Will the coalition hold together and be large enough to overcome opposition? I don’t know.”

Labor wants both undocumented immigrants and legal guest workers to eventually have a path to citizenship. But business owners say that if migrant workers become U.S. citizens right away, they’ll leave the low-paying and grueling jobs at farms and restaurants.

“One of the areas of most concern in immigration reform is whether business and labor can both get on board on a proposal for future flow,” said Madeleine Sumption, senior policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. “The fact that they’re still at the table and able to come up with these proposals is very encouraging.”

Having business owners involved in negotiations might also help quiet some of the opposition that contributed to the derailment of immigration reform in 2007, when anti-immigration callers overwhelmed and shut down the Senate switchboard.

“In order to get the votes we need, we have to think about who can move House Republicans — and business is a big part of that,” said Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, which brings together different factions on immigration, including business and labor.

Business owners are also often influential community leaders who, from firsthand experience with immigrants, can help explain to neighbors the benefits of immigration reform.

“On a local level, who is a voter going to believe?” Noorani said. “Their local business owner, their pastor, and their police chief.”

In 2006, the mayor of Wright’s hometown of Avon Park made headlines when he proposed strict measures to root out undocumented immigrants from the small Florida city. He wanted to fine landlords $1,000 for renting to them, deny business permits to companies that knowingly hired them, and remove Spanish from all city documents and phone messages.

Advertisement

The proposal enraged Wright, who has been hiring immigrants for two decades. He began to speak up against the bill, as did other local business owners. The City Council, which originally voted 3 to 2 in support of the bill, reversed itself after business owners became more vocal.

“We had people screaming over illegal immigration, but they didn’t have a clue over how their own lifestyle was dependent on these immigrants for food and hospitality,” said Wright, who remembers trying to patiently explain the issues to his neighbors. “The people complaining seemed to be totally out of touch with how our Florida economy works.”

Illinois Secretary of State Jesse White's office announced Tuesday that it will begin accepting applications Dec. 3 on a limited basis. The expected high demand means applicants must schedule an appointment to visit one of four designated offices to complete the tests and paperwork.

Appointments may be scheduled by calling 855-236-1155 or visiting cyberdriveillinois.com. Walk-ins will not be served, officials said. In addition to English, services will provided in Spanish, Polish, Mandarin Chinese and Korean. An additional 21 offices will begin scheduling appointments in January.

The launch of the program comes almost a year after Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn signed a law creating the specialized license, officially known as the temporary visitor driver's license. Unlike standard driver's licenses, they cannot be used as a form of identification for purposes such as boarding a plane, voting or buying a gun.

Supporters say the change will make Illinois roads safer because immigrants will undergo driver's tests and be required to have insurance for the license to be valid.

Critics fear fraud and abuse, with some lawmakers saying immigrants living here illegally should be fingerprinted to qualify. Immigrant rights organizations fought back on that idea, arguing that it would deter participation among a population that often is distrustful of law enforcement and other government agencies.

To qualify, applicants must prove they have lived in Illinois for a least a year and show they are ineligible for a Social Security card. Documents that will be accepted include a copy of a lease, utility bills and a valid passport or consular identification card.

Drivers also must pass vision, written and road tests and pay a $30 fee. Licenses will not be issued on the spot, officials said, but only after the state can verify application information and perform a facial recognition search against other databases. That process could take 15 to 20 business days.

The licenses will be valid for three years, one less than standard licenses. After that, a person would have to reapply.

Officials estimate that they will be able to process about 100,000 applications a year, which would generate about $3 million annually to run the program. White said his office has spent about $1 million to get the program off the ground, including hiring translators. White said that will lead to ""sacrifices"" in other areas but contended the expense is worth it.

""Before the implementation of this law, individuals would have an automobile crash and they would leave the car and they would run,"" White said. ""Now they don't have to run because now they can stand and say to the officer, tell their story of how the accident occurred, show their driver's license, show their registration card.""

White said the information collected during the application process will not be shared with federal immigration officials but that some data may be given to police during the course of an investigation or if documents are subpoenaed.

For those who got a license using fraudulent information but want to apply under the new system, officials warn that the best course of action is for drivers to report themselves to the secretary of state's office. People who self-report wrongdoing would have their license suspended for one year but could regain driving privileges. If a driver does not come forward and fraud is detected, he or she will be denied a license under the program, officials said.

Program manger Lisa Grau said such cases will be handled internally by fraud investigators unless other criminal activity such as identify theft or credit card fraud is discovered, at which point the case would be forwarded to the proper law enforcement agency.

""This program is not meant to be a 'gotcha,'"" Grau said. ""We're doing this to try to improve road safety and give people the chance to go to work and to school.""

Meanwhile, officials are warning potential new drivers to be smart consumers when it comes to buying the required insurance. They acknowledged that immigrant drivers will likely face higher insurance premiums because of a lack of official driving history.

So why does Mr. Obama keep talking to them about a deal? Because Republicans still have powerful incentives to strike one.

Delaying steps to rein in Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, the subjects of Republican doomsday warnings for years, means delaying significant attempts to curb the size of the government. The longer the delay, the sharper and more immediate the changes Washington must eventually make to ease the long-term fiscal squeeze.

Even if Republicans take control of Congress and the White House in the next two elections — allowing them to put in place a budget plan without major compromises — they would then shoulder the political responsibility for the inevitable pain that comes from curbing those huge and popular programs. Much as Republicans may dislike Mr. Obama and his policies, a Democratic president can provide them a measure of political cover."
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/12/10/florida-democratic-congressman-loses-18-millon-in-scheme/,2013-12-10 00:00:00,[],Florida Democratic congressman loses $18 million in scheme,"Florida Democratic Rep. Alan Grayson lost $18 million in a scheme by a Virginia man that involved over a 100 victims, the congressman’s office confirmed Monday.

The man who ran the scheme, William Dean Chapman, was sentenced Friday in federal court to 12 years in prison. Prosecutors say Chapman used the money to fund a lavish lifestyle including a Lamborghini, a Ferrari and a $3 million home.

In most of the court papers, Grayson's identity is protected -- prosecutors say only that an elected official with the initials A.G. was the primary victim -- but documents twice mention Grayson by name.

Nothing in the court papers suggests Grayson was anything but a victim of the scheme. Grayson, a former trial attorney, said he has had a long record for picking winning stocks, which formed the basis for his personal fortune.

The scheme worked like this: clients would turn over their stocks to Chapman as collateral for a loan, and Chapman would let customers borrow about 90 percent of the stocks' value.

If the stocks did badly, borrowers could walk away and keep the money they were loaned. But if the borrowers' stocks did well, they would repay the loan with interest, and Chapman was supposed to return the stocks to the investor at their increased value.

But, according to court papers, Chapman sold the stocks and had no way to fulfill his obligations if a client's stock portfolio did well.

""That's why (Chapman) is going to prison for a long, long time,"" Grayson told The Associated Press. ""At least in the end, some kind of justice was served.""

In Grayson's case, his stocks performed astronomically well while they were entrusted to Chapman and his company, Alexander Capital Markets.

Grayson’s office said Chapman’s lawyers tried to claim the spectacular performance of Grayson's stocks caused Chapman to be unable to uphold his financial obligations to his clients, but prosecutors found that he was actually using the money to fund his own expenses.

In 2007, Grayson had $9.35 million in a stock portfolio that Chapman was supposed to be holding as collateral. In that year alone, the portfolio's value increased by 147 percent, to $23 million, according to a chart in the court documents.

Chapman, of Sterling, Va., pleaded guilty in May but tried at Friday's sentencing hearing to withdraw the plea, saying he felt pressured to plead and that he never intended to defraud.

It is not the first time Grayson, who represents parts of the Orlando area, has lost tens of millions of dollars in a fraud scheme. In 2009, he won a $34 million judgment after filing a lawsuit in South Carolina under federal racketeering laws against a company called Derivium Capital. Derivium's business plan for hedging an investor's stock profile was nearly identical to the plan outline by Chapman.

Grayson said he first entered into deals with Chapman in 2003, well before the deal with Derivium went south, so he had no reason to be suspicious the arrangement.

And he said the loans themselves were a perfectly reasonable way to manage his portfolio, but relied on Chapman and Derivium to hold up their end of the bargain. He disputed that the astronomical returns to which he was entitled caused Chapman's downfall.

""If they had not sold the collateral, it all would have worked,"" said Grayson, who is generally listed as one of the 20 wealthiest members of Congress with assets of more than $20 million. His financial disclosure forms list holdings in dozens of stocks. His dealings with Chapman preceded his time in Congress, which began in 2009.

Court records indicate Chapman's firm was drawing regulatory scrutiny as early as 2007.

Grayson also expressed concern that his identity as a victim was not protected by the court file, and that a defense motion and an attachment to a prosecution motion both identified him by name despite procedures that are supposed to be in place to protect victims' privacy.

""I think that's unfortunate,"" Grayson said. ""They should have been more careful, should have used my initials throughout rather than using my name.""

Before he was elected to Congress, Grayson practiced law and was best known for winning a major whistleblower lawsuit exposing fraud on a government contract in Iraq.

In the House, he is known as one the most sharp-tongued critics of Republicans, once famously summarizing Republican's health care plans as little more than wanting sick people to ""die quickly.""

Lew, if confirmed, would replace outgoing Secretary Tim Geithner.

The president said Thursday that he ""cannot think of a better person"" to continue Geithner's work. The announcement marked the president's fourth major nomination to date of officials for his second-term administration.

""I trust his judgment, I value his friendship. I know very few people with greater integrity,"" Obama said. The president stressed Lew's experience in both Washington and the private sector, and particularly his role presiding over ""three budget surpluses in a row"" while in the Clinton-era budget office.

But as with the prior nominations, Lew was drawing early criticism from the Republican side of the aisle.

""Jack Lew must never be secretary of Treasury,"" Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee said, calling Lew's comments nearly two years ago ""so outrageous and false"" as to disqualify him.

Sessions was referring to a bitter Senate hearing from February 2011, when Lew attempted to defend statements he and Obama had made claiming their budget blueprint would get the country to a point where ""we're not adding to the debt anymore.""

Those statements, at best, stretched the truth. The White House budget plan at the time showed the public debt (which isn't the entire debt) soaring from $11 trillion that year to nearly $19 trillion by 2021, driven by year-after-year deficits.

Yet Lew, appearing at a Senate hearing, tried to justify the claim that the government was not adding to the debt. He said the administration was merely referring to ""primary balance"" -- or federal spending that does not count interest payments.

He repeated the claim before the Senate. ""Our spending will not add to the debt,"" Lew said. ""It's an accurate statement.""

But since interest payments are in fact a gigantic part of federal spending every year, Republican senators slammed Lew as ""dishonest"" for the claim. The website PolitiFact also rated the statement ""false"" at the time.

The White House later clarified that the debt would not increase as a share of the economy.

Sessions, though, said Lew's comments stand as ""the most direct and important false assertion during my entire time in Washington.""

He said the next Treasury secretary must be able to ""look the American people in the eye and lay out an economic plan for America that will end our debt."" Sessions continued: ""Jack Lew is not that man.""

Other Republican senators said they would reserve judgment on Lew.

""It's imperative that Mr. Lew outline the administration's plans on tackling our unsustainable debt, what areas of federal spending should be cut, and what kind of reforms -- from our tax code to our entitlement programs -- are needed to get our fiscal house in order,"" Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, top Republican on the finance committee, said. He said he wants to hear more before deciding whether to support Lew.

Lew would not come into the job with the same type of financial experience as Geithner, who previously headed the New York branch of the Federal Reserve and in that role played a major role in addressing the 2008 financial crisis.

Before becoming Obama's chief of staff, Lew was director of the Office of Management and Budget, a post he also held in the Clinton administration, serving from 1998 to early 2001. While running OMB during the Clinton administration, Lew helped negotiate a balanced budget agreement with Congress, something that has eluded Washington ever since.

On Wall Street, Lew also was managing director and chief operating officer of Citi Global Wealth Management and then Citi Alternative Investments. At the start of the Obama administration, he oversaw international economic issues at the State Department.

A White House official said Lew would bring an ""impressive record of service in both the public and private sectors for over three decades and economic expertise"" to the job.

""His deep knowledge of domestic and international economic issues will enable him to take on the challenges facing our economy at home and abroad on day one,"" the official said.

Lew could be seen by some Republicans as a political figure. He clashed repeatedly with the other side of the aisle during the debt-ceiling fight of 2011.

Lew has often been described as a ""pragmatic liberal"" who understands what it takes to make a deal even as he stands by his ideological views.

""He's a political guy. He didn't get where he is today by being a shrinking violet,"" said Paul Light, a public policy professor at New York University and an acquaintance. ""But he's really a doer. He's the kind of guy you want at the table if you want to get something done.""

If confirmed, Lew would assume the post in time for the administration to battle anew with Republicans over three looming fiscal deadlines -- raising the $16.4 trillion federal borrowing limit, averting automatic spending cuts to defense and domestic programs and the expiration of a congressional resolution that has been keeping the government operating. Those events, if unresolved, would have a far greater negative effect on the economy than the ""fiscal cliff"" that Obama and Congress avoided a week ago.

Internationally, the 57-year-old Lew also will be the administration's point man on issues related to China's integration into the global economy and Europe's sovereign debt and financial struggles. The issues aren't foreign to Lew. While a deputy secretary of state early in the Obama administration, Lew managed the State Department's international economic policy portfolio.

On Thursday, Obama also gave Geithner a send-off at the White House. ""When the history books are written, Tim Geithner's going to go down as one of our finest secretaries of Treasury,"" he said.

Sen. Ted Cruz%2C R-Texas%2C wants to defund President Obama%27s health care law

Tea Party favorite controlled Senate floor for 21 hours%2C 19 minutes

Cruz%27s talkathon technically was not a filibuster

WASHINGTON — By midday Wednesday, Sen. Ted Cruz's marathon protest of President Obama's health care law was one for the record books.

The Texas Republican had control of the Senate floor for 21 hours and 19 minutes to urge his fellow senators to defund Obama's signature domestic achievement. Cruz and other conservatives say the health care law is a costly intrusion into people's lives.

That put Cruz in fourth place on the list of longest Senate speeches, about three hours short of the Senate filibuster record set in 1957 by Strom Thurmond. The South Carolina lawmaker, then a Democrat, railed against a civil rights bill for 24 hours, 18 minutes.

Cruz passed his fellow Tea Party favorite, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who protested the Obama administration's drones policy for 12 hours, 52 minutes in March.

""This is not a close call. Obamacare isn't working, and millions of Americans are hurting,"" Cruz said on Rush Limbaugh's radio show after ending his talkathon. ""If the Senate listens to the American people ... we'll do the right thing and vote to defund it.""

Cruz's goal is unlikely, given the Democratic control of the U.S. Senate and Obama's threat to veto a stopgap spending bill if it comes to his desk without any health care funding.

Cruz, a potential 2016 presidential candidate, was elected last year — the latest conservative with strong ties to the anti-tax, small-government Tea Party movement. Like his colleagues Paul and Marco Rubio, Cruz has made a splash in a short time.

The Texan has drawn fire for some of his tactics, including from veteran Republicans such as Arizona Sen. John McCain. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., dismissed Cruz's talkathon as ""a big waste of time.""

""We all admire the senator from Texas for his wanting to talk,"" Reid said shortly after Cruz simply sat down at his desk to end his protest. ""With all due respect, I'm not sure we learned anything new.""

As expected, the Senate took the first of a series of procedural votes aimed at adopting a spending bill to temporarily fund the government. Reid intends to take out House-passed language to defund the law known as Obamacare.

If Congress does not pass a spending bill before the end of the month, the government could face a shutdown Oct. 1.

Technically, under Senate rules, Cruz's talkathon was not a filibuster because he did not prevent the Senate from having its scheduled vote. As Cruz came to a close, he thanked his aides, Senate staff and Capitol police for being on duty throughout the night, likening the time spent by all to the Bataan Death March.

He implored the American people to hold their lawmakers accountable and push them to dismantle Obama's health care law.

""I simply want to note to the American people that this debate is in your hands,"" Cruz said. ""Ultimately, all 100 senators ... work for you. The pleas from the American people, particularly in Texas, are deafening. The frustration that the United States Senate doesn't listen to the people is deafening.""

Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said the politics of the health care law have already been decided by voters and suggested Cruz's debate will no doubt play out again in the 2014 elections.

""There's a time and a place, as the scriptures say. We will certainly debate in the 2014 elections Obamacare,"" Schumer said. ""We did in the 2012 elections, and not a single Democrat who voted for Obamacare in this Senate lost.""

Cruz took control of the Senate floor around 2:41 p.m. ET on Tuesday, vowing to speak ""until I am no longer able to stand."" Overnight, he filled time by talking about the Revolutionary War, the battle against the Nazis, reading tweets from supporters and even reciting Dr. Seuss' Green Eggs and Ham.

Cruz also shared ""words of wisdom"" from the reality TV show Duck Dynasty and quoted much of country music singer Toby Keith's song Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue.

In terms of time spent controlling the floor, Cruz lapped such legendary Senate talkers as Robert Byrd, Al D'Amato, Huey Long, William Proxmire and Robert LaFollette.

Paul said Wednesday that he congratulated Cruz for his efforts but joked he was in no hurry to try to pass him on the longest-speech list. ""Not anytime soon,"" he said.

GOP Sens. Mike Lee of Utah and Florida's Rubio arrived before dawn Wednesday to ask questions of their fellow Tea Party disciple, so Cruz didn't have to speak the whole time — one of the quirks of Senate rules. Cruz could yield, so someone could ask a question, but not give up his control of the floor.

Cruz and Lee have led the defunding effort despite criticism from Senate Republicans who view their tactics as short-sighted because there is no chance of passage up against a Democratic-led Senate and Obama's veto pen.

A majority of Senate Republicans have said they opposed Cruz's tactics on the spending bill, partly out of fears they will be blamed for a government shutdown. That kind of finger-pointing happened more than a decade ago, when the GOP-controlled House led by then-Speaker Newt Gingrich forced a 21-day shutdown in 1995-1996.

The chamber's top two Republicans, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Senate Minority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, said earlier in the week that they would not vote with Cruz.

""We'd all be hard-pressed to explain why we were opposed to a bill we were in favor of,"" McConnell said Tuesday.

http://news.yahoo.com/senator-irs-pay-70m-employee-bonuses-081255026.html,,[],Senator: IRS to pay $70M in employee bonuses,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Internal Revenue Service is about to pay $70 million in employee bonuses despite an Obama administration directive to cancel discretionary bonuses because of automatic spending cuts enacted this year, according to a GOP senator.

Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa says his office has learned that the IRS is executing an agreement with the employees' union on Wednesday to pay the bonuses. Grassley says the bonuses should be canceled under an April directive from the White House budget office.

The directive was written by Danny Werfel, a former budget official who has since been appointed acting IRS commissioner.

""The IRS always claims to be short on resources,"" Grassley said. ""But it appears to have $70 million for union bonuses. And it appears to be making an extra effort to give the bonuses despite opportunities to renegotiate with the union and federal instruction to cease discretionary bonuses during sequestration.""

The IRS said it is negotiating with the union over the matter but did not dispute Grassley's claim that the bonuses are imminent.

Office of Management and Budget ""guidance directs that agencies should not pay discretionary monetary awards at this time, unless legally required,"" IRS spokeswoman Michelle Eldridge said in a statement. ""IRS is under a legal obligation to comply with its collective bargaining agreement, which specifies the terms by which awards are paid to bargaining-unit employees.""

Eldridge, however, would not say whether the IRS believes it is contractually obligated to pay the bonuses.

""In accordance with OMB guidance, the IRS is actively engaged with NTEU on these matters in recognition of our current budgetary constraints,"" Eldridge said.

The National Treasury Employees Union did not respond to requests for comment.

The IRS has been under fire since last month, when IRS officials acknowledged that agents had improperly targeted conservative groups for additional scrutiny when they applied for tax-exempt status during the 2010 and 2012 elections. A few weeks later, the agency's inspector general issued a report documenting lavish employee conferences during the same time period.

Story continues

Three congressional committees and the Justice Department are investigating the targeting of conservative groups. And key Republicans in Congress are promising more scrutiny of the agency's budget, especially as it ramps up to play a major role in implementing the new health care law.

Much of the agency's top leadership has been replaced since the scandals broke. President Barack Obama forced the acting commissioner to resign and replaced him with Werfel, who used to work in the White House budget office.

In a letter to Werfel on Tuesday, Grassley said the IRS notified the employee union March 25 that it intended to reclaim about $75 million that had been set aside for discretionary employee bonuses. However, Grassley said, his office has learned that the IRS never followed up on the notice. Instead, Grassley said, the IRS negotiated a new agreement with the bargaining unit to pay about $70 million in employee bonuses.

Grassley's office said the information came from a ""person with knowledge of IRS budgetary procedures.""

""While the IRS may claim that these bonuses are legally required under the original bargaining unit agreement, that claim would allegedly be inaccurate,"" Grassley wrote. ""In fact, the original agreement allows for the re-appropriation of such award funding in the event of budgetary shortfall.""

Werfel wrote the directive on discretionary employee bonuses while he was still working in the White House budget office. The directive was part of the Obama administration's efforts to impose across-the-board spending cuts enacted by Congress.

The spending cuts, known as ""sequestration,"" are resulting in at least five unpaid furlough days this year for the IRS' 90,000 employees. On these days, the agency is closed and taxpayers cannot access many of the agency's assistance programs.

Werfel's April 4 memorandum ""directs that discretionary monetary awards should not be issued while sequestration is in place, unless issuance of such awards is legally required. Discretionary monetary awards include annual performance awards, group awards, and special act cash awards, which comprise a sizeable majority of awards and incentives provided by the federal government to employees.""

""Until further notice, agencies should not issue such monetary awards from sequestered accounts unless agency counsel determines the awards are legally required. Legal requirements include compliance with provisions in collective bargaining agreements governing awards.""

But I guess we must.

So: Food stamp usage has indeed soared in recent years, with the percentage of the population receiving stamps rising from 8.7 in 2007 to 15.2 in the most recent data. There is, however, no mystery here. SNAP is supposed to help families in distress, and lately a lot of families have been in distress.

In fact, SNAP usage tends to track broad measures of unemployment, like U6, which includes the underemployed and workers who have temporarily given up active job search. And U6 more than doubled in the crisis, from about 8 percent before the Great Recession to 17 percent in early 2010. It’s true that broad unemployment has since declined slightly, while food stamp numbers have continued to rise — but there’s normally some lag in the relationship, and it’s probably also true that some families have been forced to take food stamps by sharp cuts in unemployment benefits.

What about the theory, common on the right, that it’s the other way around — that we have so much unemployment thanks to government programs that, in effect, pay people not to work? (Soup kitchens caused the Great Depression!) The basic answer is, you have to be kidding. Do you really believe that Americans are living lives of leisure on $134 a month, the average SNAP benefit?

Still, let’s pretend to take this seriously. If employment is down because government aid is inducing people to stay home, reducing the labor force, then the law of supply and demand should apply: withdrawing all those workers should be causing labor shortages and rising wages, especially among the low-paid workers most likely to receive aid. In reality, of course, wages are stagnant or declining — and that’s especially true for the groups that benefit most from food stamps.

So what’s going on here? Is it just racism? No doubt the old racist canards — like Ronald Reagan’s image of the “strapping young buck” using food stamps to buy a T-bone steak — still have some traction. But these days almost half of food stamp recipients are non-Hispanic whites; in Tennessee, home of the Bible-quoting Mr. Fincher, the number is 63 percent. So it’s not all about race.

What is it about, then? Somehow, one of our nation’s two great parties has become infected by an almost pathological meanspiritedness, a contempt for what CNBC’s Rick Santelli, in the famous rant that launched the Tea Party, called “losers.” If you’re an American, and you’re down on your luck, these people don’t want to help; they want to give you an extra kick. I don’t fully understand it, but it’s a terrible thing to behold."

Detroit's Emergency Manager Kevyn Orr—a bankruptcy expert appointed by Gov. Rick Snyder earlier this year to oversee Detroit's finances—has said the federal bankruptcy filing is necessary to get the city out from under some $18 billion in liabilities.

But the city's employee unions argued the bankruptcy is an end-run around the state constitution, which protects their pension benefits. The unions backed a series of lawsuits filed in Michigan courts to block the bankruptcy. Last week, Ingham County Circuit Judge Rosemarie Aquilina ruled the bankruptcy filing unconstitutional, but a state appeals court put her ruling on hold, and Orr argued the federal court should make that stay indefinite.

The emergency manager said bankruptcy is a federal matter. A bankruptcy filing normally puts all other litigation on hold, but Orr's office asked the judge to extend that automatic stay to cover him and state officials, including the governor. Orr's attorneys acknowledged the request was unusual, but said ""recent events""—the lawsuits in state court—made it necessary.

""That kind of activity has got to stop,"" city attorney Heather Lennox said. Lennox is a partner at Jones Day—Orr's former law firm—which is collecting millions of dollars in legal fees from the city.

But attorney Sharon Levine, representing the local council of the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees, said the federal bankruptcy code ""is not there to enforce rights that do not exist.""

The unions said framers of the Michigan constitution decided to guard public employee pensions because public pensions have no insurance protection, unlike private pensions, which are insured by the federal Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp.

""Here, there is no safety net,"" Levine said. She said nonuniformed employee pensions in Detroit are below $19,000 per year.



Attorney Robert Gordon, representing the police and fire pension funds, argued that because of the constitutional provision, the governor had no right to authorize the bankruptcy filing in the first place. As a result, Gordon said, the filing is ""void,"" and it was premature to even be discussing it in federal court.

""The motions assume facts not in evidence,"" Gordon said.

(Read more: What's next for Detroit? Long court battle)

But the judge appeared unconvinced.

""How do you deal with the law that gives the bankruptcy court exclusive jurisdiction,"" Rhodes asked.

Gordon responded that there was no need to deal with the provision, because there was no valid bankruptcy filing to begin with.

Because of the intense interest in the largest municipal bankruptcy filing in U.S. history, the hearing was moved from Rhodes' normal courtroom to a much larger one across the street at the Theodore Levin Federal Courthouset. Many members of the public and the media were relegated to an overflow courtroom down the hall to view a video feed.

Outside the courthouse, a handful of protesters carried signs in support of the unions. One demonstrator played a recording of Martin Luther King's ""I have a dream"" speech through a megaphone.

City firefighter Mark Jackson.said he came to the courthouse because so much is at stake.

""I am scared. Scared that I will lose my retirement. I'm scared for all of us,"" Jackson told CNBC.

(Read more: Detroit bankruptcy could hit millions of retirees)

But Orr and Snyder have repeatedly insisted that city pensions will not be cut entirely under a bankruptcy. In an interview before the hearing, Orr said the majority of the pensions are funded, but there remains a $3.5 billion shortfall—and the city has no way to make it up.

""The money's not there,"" Orr said.

What if Bush had paid attention to those warnings (as Clinton did)? 9-11 might well have been averted.

WHAT IF...Bush had valued what he inherited -- a balanced budget -- and DONE NOTHING. No massive tax cuts benefiting the top 1/10th of 1 percent. No massive deficits. 8 years -- budget still balanced, instead of trillions in new debt and a tax code designed to make the government untenable without savaging the social safety net.

WHAT IF...Bush had treated FEMA as a serious agency with a vital role to play in national emergencies? What if he'd appointed a serious administrator, instead of an incompetent crony bent on looting the agency and wrecking its ability to function properly? Katrina might have turned out quite differently.

WHAT IF...Bush had hadn't worked overtime to destroy the regulation of financial markets? What if he'd DONE NOTHING, and let regulatory agencies do their proper work? The financial crash of 2007-8 might never have happened.

WHAT IF...most importantly...Bush/Cheney/Rumsfeld hadn't conjured stove-piped ""intel"" to stampede us into war after 9-11? No trillion dollar wars, shoveled onto the spiraling national debt...no thousands of American soldiers killed...no hundreds of thousands of Iraqis killed...no Abu Ghraib...no disillusionment of the American public in our ability to fight and win wars...

What always struck me about Bush and his incompetent cronies is the activist nature of their ""wreck everything quickly"" administration. All Bush had to do was NOTHING to have a successful presidency. Everything he touched turned (immediately) to shit...and yet he couldn't wait to destroy more. Thank goodness the American people turned on him during the post 2004 ""Wind At My Back"" ""Hand Social Security Over To Wall Street"" debacle.

I'm convinced that someday, 50 years from now when historians are analyzing the moment that ""broke the back"" of the American dream, they'll focus on the Bush Administration -- specifically the catastrophic response to 9/11. Karl Rove's goal was always to repeal the New Deal, monkey-wrench the government to make it untenable, and hand the burning wreckage over to his billionaire pals who are greatly inconvenienced by all those middle class ""entitlements"", environmental protections and Union rights.

All he had to do was nothing. Instead, he almost wrecked everything

He Has Been With The Los Angeles Times Since', 'Covering Technology News Before Joining The Opinion Section.']",House GOP picks a curious fight with Senate Democrats,"In my zeal Friday to praise House Republicans for dropping their self-destructive stance against raising the debt limit, I neglected to point out that they couldn’t bring themselves to do so without picking a new fight with Democrats.

It’s as if the House GOP can’t stop itself from tilting at windmills.

Advertisement

Republican leaders announced Friday that their membership had agreed to support a three-month suspension of the debt limit, effectively shifting their fight for deeper spending cuts off the debt-limit bill to either (or both) of two looming spending bills: one to adjust more than $100 billion in across-the-board spending cuts due to take effect March 1, and another to provide funding for the federal government after its temporary appropriations run out March 27.

It was a savvy move. Because it doesn’t actually raise the debt limit, the GOP can continue to threaten to block future increases unless Democrats agree to deep spending cuts. More important, it shifts the fight from the debt limit to spending bills, which is where it belongs.

Yet Republicans couldn’t just make a tactical retreat. The temporary debt-limit waiver bill unveiled Monday includes a provision that would withhold the pay of lawmakers if their chamber fails to pass a budget resolution by April 15, as required by the 1974 Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act. This little dagger is aimed squarely at Senate Democrats in general and their leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, in particular. With Reid at the helm, the Senate hasn’t passed a budget resolution since 2009.

The bill would escrow lawmakers’ paychecks, rather than canceling them, until either their chamber passes a budget resolution or the 113th Congress ends two years from now. The escrow provision was designed to avoid violating the 27th Amendment, which states that Congress cannot pass a law “varying the compensation” of its members unless it takes effect in a subsequent Congress. But it’s hard to argue with a straight face that withholding lawmakers’ pay, potentially in non-interest-bearing accounts, doesn’t amount to varying their compensation.

Advertisement

Senate Democrats deserve scorn aplenty for not passing a budget resolution. Even though it’s not a constitutional requirement, it’s an important exercise in setting priorities. But it’s not necessarily a fruitful exercise. It’s hard to imagine House Republicans and Senate Democrats agreeing on a budget; the former want to close the budget gap entirely through cuts in domestic programs and entitlements, while the latter want to do it mainly through tax hikes and reductions in the defense budget.

More important, the budget resolution doesn’t have the force of law. And even if the two chambers find a way to agree on a resolution, it has limited power to bind Congress.

Advertisement

Republicans and Democrats already have plenty of opportunities each year to fight substantively over spending, most notably the annual appropriations bills that finance the day-to-day operations of government. Why, then, does the House GOP care so deeply about having a budget resolution? Do lawmakers really need more brinkmanship?

It’s worth remembering that the 2011 debt-ceiling deal set into law the spending limits for fiscal 2012 and 2013. That made the absence of annual budget resolutions moot. Granted, the Senate ignored the sweeping changes to federal benefit programs that House Republicans called for in the reports the House Budget Committee issued, but those reports don’t have the force of law either. If the House really wanted to start the ball rolling on turning Medicaid into block grants, changing Medicare into a premium subsidy program or shoring up Social Security for the long term, it could start the hard work of introducing bills, holding hearings on them, perfecting them with amendments and passing them. But it hasn’t.

Advertisement

Persuading the Senate to pass a budget resolution won’t bring the two sides any closer to enacting a plan to solve Washington’s long-term fiscal problems. And if the Senate produces a budget, chances are the House GOP will wonder why it was so eager to see it.

On NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday, a top Senate Democrat, Chuck Schumer of New York, said that his colleagues consider a budget resolution “a great opportunity for us” to push for tax reform that (wait for it) raises revenues. “We’re going to do a budget this year and it’s going to have revenues in it,” Schumer said, “and our Republican colleagues better get used to that fact.”

On Tuesday, it found one close to home.

Tours of the executive mansion will be canceled starting March 9, the White House announced, citing “staffing reductions resulting from sequestration.” The tours will not be rescheduled and the freeze will be in effect “until further notice.”

The cancellation will annoy plenty of tourists who tour the White House after securing their tickets well in advance through their elected representative’s office. It will also certainly annoy those congressional offices that must begin notifying disappointed constituents.

“We very much regret having to take this action, particularly during the popular spring touring season,” the White House said in a recorded message on the tour hotline.

QUIZ: How much do you know about sequestration?

Within hours of the announcement, Republicans began to criticize the decision as a stunt. One GOP congressman offered his own solution to the budget cutting at the White House. In an amendment to a bill to fund the government, Texas Rep. Louis Gohmert proposed that none of the money “may be used to transport the president to or from a golf course until public tours of the White House resume.”

The automatic budget cuts are a result of a deficit-reduction deal signed into law in 2011. Lawmakers and the White House agreed to the across-the-board cuts, hoping that the prospect of finding $85 billion in immediate savings would spark compromise on a broader deficit and debt-reduction deal. It did not.

In the lead-up to the budget cuts, which kicked in on Friday, the White House tried to pressure Republican lawmakers to reach a deal by highlighting the pain that would come from axing federal services. But its top spokespeople on the matter occasionally overstepped.

Education Secretary Arne Duncan on Monday apologized for saying that teachers in a West Virginia school district were receiving “pink slips” because of the budget cuts. The district’s superintendent told the Washington Post that the teachers were receiving transfer notices and the move was not directly related to the federal funding cuts.

Republicans pounced on Duncan’s comments and other claims as examples of the president hyping the cuts for political gain. On Tuesday, the news of the canceled tours prompted similar skepticism among some on the Hill and the GOP-led House administration committee offered tourists an alternative: “House Admin welcomes Americans visiting D.C. to tour Capitol instead,” the committee tweeted.

“Manhattan has serious affordability problems,” said Mr. Braconi, the economist. In the last decade, the percentage of people who are paying “unaffordable rents” (defined as more than 30 percent of their income) has increased significantly, according to a report issued in September by the city’s comptroller.

If that trend continues, it will feed the perennial panic that Manhattan’s middle class is on the brink of extinction, no longer able to cope with the city’s prices and fast retreating to its natural habitat, the suburbs.

It is true that the middle class here is smaller than anywhere else in the country. It is true that price pressures from both real estate and the cost of living are not slowing down anytime soon. But it is also true that calamity has been forecast for over a century now.

“Soon, there will be no New Yorkers,” proclaimed the Sunday magazine of The New York Times in 1907, in an article that detailed how families making $1,000 to $3,000 a year — $24,000 to $72,000 a year in today’s dollars — were being pushed out because of increasing rents, and servants’ wages, as well as the crushing cost of ice and coal. Adjusted for inflation, laundry alone for a family cost $115 a week. A pound of chicken? $8.08. Rent, on the other hand, for a “small, middle-class flat in a decent, but unfashionable locality,” would seem to be a bargain in today’s market, at the price of $272 per room per month.

In 1968, New York magazine documented the mad scramble for affordable apartments in a cover article detailing the extreme lengths to which average people went to secure one. “Surgeons have postponed operations, housewives have gone back to work, hippies have cut their hair and families have destroyed their pets,” the magazine reported. “Little hope is held out for the middle-income ($15-20,000 a year) people, career girls who do not want roommates and couples with more than one drawer-sized infant.” Brownstones that had sold for $125,000 in 1958, according to the article, were selling 10 years later for twice that much (in today’s dollars, a jump from $827,000 to $1.65 million).

Reports of the middle class’s demise also appeared in 1978, 1998, 2006 and 2009, when The New York Observer chimed in with “City to Middle Class: Just Not That Into You.”

But members of the middle class remain, scattered among the elite and the growing numbers of the working poor, in that place where lucky deals and tiny kitchens converge, wondering, just as they did in 1910 and 1968, how long they’ll be able to stay put.

Ms. Azeez in TriBeCa is pondering the question. The only young people she sees moving in around her are often buoyed by parental support, given an apartment at graduation the way she was given a Seiko watch. As her own friends and neighbors age or die out, she wonders, “who is going to take our place?”"

Only 19% of California voters in a new USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll said those in the country illegally should be required to leave the United States. About two-thirds of survey respondents said illegal immigrants should be allowed to stay with eventual citizenship rights. An additional 10% said they should be permitted to remain in this country to work but should not be allowed to apply for citizenship.

At a time when the push for immigration reform has gained momentum in Washington, more than two-thirds of California voters say the current immigration system isn’t working and nearly three-quarters favor President Obama’s plan to change it, the poll found.

RELATED: Is the border secure?

Across different ages and ethnic groups, voters were largely supportive of the measures outlined by Obama and a bipartisan group of senators, including enhancing border security, requiring employers to verify the legal status of their employees and permitting certain undocumented workers to become citizens as long as they pay taxes and fines and are processed behind those who come legally.

Though Obama’s association with the proposal made it less palatable to some Republicans, a slender majority of GOP voters in the state said they backed the president’s plan — a finding that, along with the drubbing their party took from Latino voters last fall, helps to illustrate why Republicans have grown more comfortable aligning themselves with citizenship for illegal immigrants.

“There’s really not much of a debate in California about immigration anymore, and there may not even be a national debate,” said Drew Lieberman of Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research, a Democratic firm that conducted the poll with the Republican firm American Viewpoint. “It’s no longer a partisan or racial issue for Californians.”

The state’s voters have long held more moderate views on immigration than voters in other parts of the country, in part because of California’s burgeoning Latino population. But the poll results illustrated that, even here, views about illegal immigrants have changed notably.

Advertisement

In 2010, when pollsters asked about the effect of illegal immigrants on the California economy, 48% of respondents said their effect was negative and 40% said it was positive. In the latest survey, only 36% said their impact was negative, and 53% said it was positive — a “huge shift,” Lieberman said, that spanned all age groups and could not be explained simply by the surging population of Latinos in the state.

Part of what appears to be driving that change are the personal connections that many California voters have formed with illegal immigrants. Latinos were more likely than whites to know one — a majority of Latinos described that person as either a friend or family member — and among all voters who knew any, only 8% said illegal immigrants should be forced to leave the country.

“That tells me that immigration reform is really about la familia, especially for Hispanics, but even white voters can kind of understand that,” said Dave Kanevsky, the research director at American Viewpoint.

And that familiarity has affected views across political lines. Dan Schnur, director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at USC, noted that California Republicans live in a much more multicultural society than party members elsewhere, “so the lives they live every day and the people they see are probably the main reason that their feelings are different than their national counterparts’.”

That has been the case for 33-year-old Fresno Republican Chris Leake, who said the friendships he developed with undocumented workers in the U.S. and while doing volunteer work in Mexico have made him more inclined to support a path to citizenship.

“I understand why they come up here illegally — I don’t agree with it, per se, but I understand why,” said Leake, who works in Internet marketing. For many workers, he said, “it was extremely expensive and they ran great personal risk to do it, but they did it because they felt like they needed the income.”

Advertisement

Leake, along with 73% of poll respondents, said he would favor the inclusion of a guest worker program in any new immigration package, which he said “would start to solve the problem.”

“There’s a significant percentage that want nothing more than to come up here, earn money for a time and then go back to Mexico,” Leake said. “Instead they stay for years at a time, because it’s so hard to get up here in the first place. And that’s having devastating effects on their families.”

Julie Rapoza, a 54-year-old Democrat from Manteca, said her brushes with illegal immigrants have had the opposite effect. The number of illegal immigrants convicted of crimes, she said, has hardened her view that most undocumented workers should be required to return home — a view that puts her at odds with most in her party.

At the same time, however, Rapoza said she believed illegal immigrants had a beneficial effect on California’s economy. “A lot of them do jobs that even unemployed citizens won’t do,” said Rapoza, who favors an expansive guest worker program. Otherwise, employers “would be paying an arm and a leg to get workers to do it and that would make prices go way up.”

Other poll respondents said they felt it would be impossible to deport an estimated 11 million immigrants.

“We don’t have any choice,” said James Scoville, a 67-year-old independent voter, when asked whether he favored giving illegal immigrants a way to become citizens. “Some of them have been here 20, 30, 40 years and have jobs and houses and everything else. Create a path for them, put them at the bottom of the list. I think that’s pretty much the only sensible thing to do.”

Some demographic differences were evident: White voters were more likely than Latinos to support stricter border security measures and requiring employers to verify, under threat of fines, that all employees are legal. Still, a majority of Latinos backed both those ideas.

But white respondents were nearly as supportive of a path to citizenship as Latino voters — 81% and 86% respectively. Not surprisingly, Democrats were the most supportive of all. In the survey, 88% said they favored creating that path, compared with 76% of Republicans and 83% of decline-to-state voters.

The poll, which interviewed 1,501 registered voters by telephone, was conducted March 11-17 for the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences and the Los Angeles Times. The survey has an overall margin of error of 2.9 percentage points, with a higher margin of error for subgroups.

Let me finish tonight with this.

I said it before and am now saying it again.

There are too many people on the American right who hate the very notion of Barack Obama in the White House. It grates on them, just as it thrills – even now – tens of millions of others.

They hate not just his politics but him.

Think about all the days we have known him – from way back when he gave that breathtaking speech at the 2004 convention? Was there ever a time in all those days and weeks and months and years since that his haters on the right have stopped in their tracks and said, “Well, good for him. I liked the way he did that.”

Think hard. Have his haters ever stopped hating him?

When we got Bin Laden?

When the stock market doubled, doubling very 401K, making all those haters richer – twice as rich – as they were when Bush left us stranded with a dropping, scary economy? Did they ever look up and say, even hesitantly, “Well, I’ll give him this one?”

No.

No.

No.

You can discount it all. You can say it’s not about race or whatever. You can say it, but …

Think about this. In all the criticisms you’ve heard the haters say about African Americans all the years of your life – and think about this man’s life – about how hard he worked at school, how he achieved so highly at school, how he married so well and so faithfully, how he’s fathered two great daughters and kept them, protected them, been a truly great father to them, be a true partner in his marriage, treated his office with such respect and dignity – has never once let us down with his personal behavior and yet ….

They hate him. They really do and I don’t have to be the one to tell you.

We live in a country where a good chunk of the country hates its elected leader and won’t really – I mean really- tell you why.

It’s the same reason they spend their time thinking of clever gimmicks to keep so many people from voting. Anybody disagree?"

USA TODAY

Newly elected Republicans are %27conviction politicians%27 in the mold of Margaret Thatcher

Will he challenge Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor next year%3F Maybe.

%22We%27d have to know that we aren%27t encouraging the next wave of illegal immigration%2C%22 he says.

WASHINGTON — Arkansas Rep. Tom Cotton isn't swayed by the bipartisan coalition that passed a comprehensive immigration bill in the Senate or the warnings by senior Republicans that the GOP needs to act on the issue to appeal to Latino voters.

And with that, the lanky freshman represents the significant hurdles facing efforts to craft immigration legislation that might possibly be able to pass both the House of Representatives and the Senate.

""The Senate approach is legalization first and enforcement later, maybe — but probably never,"" Cotton said in an interview with Capital Download, USA TODAY's weekly newsmaker video series. In views he says are widely shared among House Republicans, he opposes establishing a path to legal status for immigrants here illegally until U.S. borders are more secure and visa laws more strictly enforced.

""If they insist upon legalization before any of those steps, then it is not likely that we are going to pass real and valuable immigration reform this Congress,"" he says. He notes that Senate Democrats have said that establishing a path to citizenship for some of the estimated 11 million immigrants in the country illegally is essential to a bill.

His opposition to establishing a way to achieve legal status extends to the ""DREAMers,"" the young people who have grown up in the United States after being brought here by their parents.

""We'd have to know that we aren't encouraging the next wave of illegal immigration,"" he said. ""If you're a mom or dad and you see the opportunity that has been provided to someone else's child who took them to the United States illegally, to become a legal American and maybe a citizen, who wouldn't take that risk?""

Cotton, 36, has been in office for only six months, but he is part of a new breed of Republicans who haven't hesitated to challenge their own leadership, taking a harder line on some issues and being less willing to cut political deals.

""I do think that injection of new blood and kind of fresh thinking, as opposed to the old way of thinking, is good for Congress,"" he said. ""I saw that when I was in the Army. It's always good to get new privates and new lieutenants who are ready to go down-range and fight America's wars.""

The freshman and sophomore classes of Republican House members tend to be in the mold of former president Ronald Reagan and former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher, Cotton said. Thatcher ""said she's not a consensus politician; she's a conviction politician. And you have a lot of people who were elected in 2010 and 2012 who truly are conviction politicians.""

Cotton is an Arkansas native, a graduate of Harvard University and Harvard Law School, and an Army veteran with tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan. He's also a potential challenger next year to Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor. Republican hopes of regaining control of the Senate depend on winning Democratic-held seats in red states such as Arkansas.

""I do hear from a lot of Arkansans, frankly Democrats and Republicans alike, who encourage me to think about that race, and I'm grateful for that,"" Cotton said, ""but in the end, it will be prayerful consideration and deliberations with my family"" that determine his decision.

As of Friday morning, dozens of tractor-trailers were said to be on the road as part of the protest convoy.

Virginia state police say they stopped four tractor-trailer drivers on the Beltway, pulling them over after they began driving side-by side across all four northbound lanes of the Beltway in Fairfax County.

Their actions slowed traffic to about 15 mph. Officers warned the drivers not to impede traffic and did not write any tickets.

Police say a convoy of about 30 trucks began traveling north on Interstate 95 from Doswell, Va., on Friday morning. The truckers are circling the Beltway.

However, the presence was not quite the thousands of truckers that organizers had predicted. On Friday morning, just a handful of people had showed up at a key staging area.

According to MyFoxDC.com, organizers say more could show up through the weekend.

The rally, ""Truckers Ride for the Constitution,"" had called for 10,000 truck drivers to show up Friday morning and circle I-495 for the next three days, according to a Facebook page for the event.

""Truckers will lead the path to saving our country if every American rides with them!"" the Facebook page says, adding ""The American people are sick and tired of the corruption that is destroying America!""

On its website, the group lists several demands, including that President Obama resign immediately, that the debt ceiling not be raised and that National Security Agency surveillance of communications be ceased. The group is also complaining about low wages and rising fuel costs.

The event's organizers, however, have stressed that they intend to keep the protest peaceful and adhere to all traffic laws.

""We're not coming in to cause any violence or disrupt anything,"" protester J.B. Schaffner told Greta Van Sustern Thursday night on ""Greta.""

""We're just coming in to make our voice heard.""

Although the poll shows that people generally are looking forward to the new year with optimism and no blatant sense of foreboding, it also unmasks pent-up worries about international crises and instability, and concerns at home about the standard of living, health care and schools.

What the public thought of 2013:

GOOD YEAR OR GOOD RIDDANCE?

On the whole, Americans rate their own experience in 2013 more positively than negatively. But when asked to assess the year for the United States or the world at large, things turn sour.

—All told, 32 percent say 2013 was a better year for them than 2012, while 20 percent say it was worse and 46 percent say the two years were really about the same. Young people were more apt to see improvement: 40 percent of people under age 30 called 2013 a better year than 2012, compared with 25 percent of people age 65 or older.

—The public splits evenly on how the year turned out for the country, 25 percent saying it was better than 2012, 25 percent saying it was worse. As with most questions about the state of affairs in the U.S. these days, there's a sharp partisan divide. Democrats are more apt to say the U.S. turned out better in 2013 than 2012 (37 percent) than are Republicans (17 percent).

—Thinking about the world at large, 30 percent say 2013 was worse than 2012, while just 20 percent say it was better.

But the outlook for the new year is positive: 49 percent think their own fortunes will improve in 2014, 14 percent are anticipating the new year to be a downgrade from the old. Thirty-four percent say they don't expect much to change.

WHERE'S THE PARTY?

Most Americans — 54 percent — say they'll be ringing in the new year at home, while 1 in 5 are heading to a friend's or family member's house. Only 8 percent say they'll go to a bar, restaurant or other organized event.

Story continues

—Younger Americans are least apt to spend the holiday at home: 39 percent of those under age 30 will celebrate at home, 33 percent at someone else's home, 13 percent at a bar or other venue.

—Regardless of their own time zone, nearly 6 in 10 say they'll watch at least some of the celebration from New York City's Times Square.

COUNTDOWN COMPANIONS

Wherever they're spending the holiday, most Americans prefer the company of family. Asked with whom they want to be when the clock strikes midnight, 83 percent name a family member.

—On a holiday often sealed with a kiss, nearly 4 in 10 say they most want to be next to their spouse, and 13 percent cite a significant other or romantic interest as a preferred companion. Parents like to be with their children, more than the children like to be with their parents.

—Less conventional choices: 2 percent cite their pets, 3 percent God, Jesus or their religious congregation, and less than 1 percent said they wanted to ring it in with their co-workers.

—Of course, some opt out altogether: 18 percent say they're not planning to celebrate on New Year's Eve, and 9 percent say there's no one with whom they'd like to party, preferring instead their pillow, TiVo or their own thoughts.

WHAT MATTERED IN NEWS

Asked to name the most important news story of the year, 26 percent of Americans cited the implementation of the health care law. That story also came out on top in an Associated Press survey of news directors and editors, in which 45 of 144 journalists surveyed called the health care roll out their top story.

In the AP-Times Square poll, the death of former South African President Nelson Mandela occurred as the poll was underway. It rose quickly, with 8 percent naming it as the most important news of the year, matching the share citing the federal government's budget difficulties or shutdown.

A separate question asked respondents to rate the importance of several news stories for them personally. The budget fight, which led to a partial shutdown of the federal government in October, was rated extremely or very important by 60 percent of Americans, and prompted rare bipartisan agreement. About two-thirds in each major party — 65 percent of Republicans and 63 percent of Democrats — rated it highly important.

A majority said the Boston Marathon bombings were extremely or very important, and 47 percent considered the national debate over gun laws that important.

POP CULTURE: MOSTLY FORGETTABLE MOMENTS

Miley Cyrus's MTV Video Music Awards performance. The launch of ""Lean In."" Apologies from Paula Deen and Lance Armstrong. Walter White's exit and the entrance of the Netflix series ""House of Cards."" What do they all have in common? More Americans say these pop culture moments were more forgettable than memorable.

Just one pop culture moment was deemed more memorable than forgettable: The birth of Prince George to Britain's Prince William and his wife, Kate.

—Among men, 64 percent called the debate on work-life balance sparked by the book ""Lean In"" and other writings forgettable. About half of women agreed.

—About 1 in 5 younger Americans said the launch of original programming through streaming services like Netflix or Hulu was a memorable moment, about doubling the share among those age 50 and up.

—Residents of the West were more likely than others to consider memorable the San Francisco ""Batkid"" (31 percent) or the final season of the series ""Breaking Bad"" (19 percent).

The AP-Times Square New Year's Eve Poll was conducted by GfK Public Affairs and Corporate Communications from Dec. 5-9 and involved online interviews with 1,367 adults. The survey has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points for all respondents. The poll is a cooperative effort between AP and the organizers of the Times Square New Year's Eve Celebration, the Times Square Alliance and Countdown Entertainment. The Alliance is a non-profit group that seeks to promote Times Square, and Countdown Entertainment represents the owners of One Times Square and the New Year's Eve Ball Drop.

The survey was conducted using KnowledgePanel, a probability-based Internet panel designed to be representative of the U.S. population. Respondents to the survey were first selected randomly, using phone or mail survey methods, and were later interviewed online. People selected for KnowledgePanel who didn't otherwise have access to the Internet were provided with the ability to access the Internet at no cost to them.

A seasoned turnaround man and former actuary with Ford Motor Co., he was stunned by what he found: an additional $7.2 billion in retiree health costs that had never been reported, or even tallied up.

“The city must take some drastic steps,” the consultant, John Boyle, warned the City Council in delivering his report at a public meeting in 2005. Among the options he suggested was filing for bankruptcy.

“I thought all hell would break loose — I thought the flag would finally be raised,” Mr. Boyle recalled in an interview last week. But his warning drew little notice. “It was utterly astounding,” he said.

The financial crisis that has made Detroit one of the largest cities ever to face mandatory state oversight was decades in the making, a trail of missteps, of trimming too little, too late, of hoping that deep-rooted structural problems would turn out to be cyclical downturns that might melt away as the economy picked up."

Anti-illegal immigration groups and others accused the Obama administration of playing politics, while an immigrant rights group said the incident showed the administration had detained people they shouldn’t have in the first place.

John Hill, executive director of the Phoenix-based anti-illegal immigration group Stand With Arizona, said the Department of Homeland Security was using immigration security as a political weapon.

“The shocking, lawless actions of DHS in releasing thousands of illegal aliens from detention merely to score points on sequestration proves what we have said all along: The DHS is far too politicized to be trusted to implement either the Obama or the ‘Gang of 8' immigration reform plans,” Hill said in a statement.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials said the release of “several hundred” detainees since last Thursday from deportation centers across the nation was in anticipation of spending cuts linked to the so-called budget sequestration, which mandates across-the-board cuts starting Friday unless Congress reaches a compromise.

“As fiscal uncertainty remains over the continuing resolution and possible sequestration, ICE has reviewed its detained population to ensure detention levels stay within ICE’s current budget,” ICE spokeswoman Amber Cargile said in a statement. “Over the last week, ICE has reviewed several hundred cases and placed these individuals on methods of supervision less costly than detention.”

Agency officials emphasized that those freed were on supervised release, with telephonic and electronic monitoring.

Cargile, based in Phoenix, said all of the released detainees remained in removal proceedings. She said priority for detention remained on serious criminal offenders and other individuals who are believed to pose a significant threat to public safety.

United We Dream, a youth-led network advocating for the legalization of 11 million people who are in the country illegally, said it took a “manufactured crisis to reunite families.”

“Every day I get calls from families being torn apart with a loved one about to be deported,” Carolina Canizales, coordinator of United We Dream’s End Our Pain Program, said in a statement. “Low-priority individuals — people who pose absolutely no risk or danger to society, but rather are upstanding members of their communities and families — should not have been locked up to begin with.”

Advertisement

Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer said she was “appalled” by the mass release, adding that it had been done “under the guise of federal budget cuts.”

Immigration officials said they had released 303 detainees since last Thursday from four Arizona facilities: Florence Detention Center, Eloy Detention Center, Pinal County Jail and Central Arizona Detention Center. An estimated 2,280 immigration detainees remain in custody in those facilities.

Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu criticized the move, saying it was harming public safety.

“These are illegals that even President Obama wants to deport,” Babeu said in a statement on the sheriff’s department website. “This is insane that public safety is sacrificed when it should be the budget priority that’s safeguarded.”

He contended that ICE agents were paid overtime over the weekend to release 500 detainees from Pinal County Jail alone.

ICE officials contradicted him, saying they had released a total of 52 people from the Pinal County Jail, not 500.

In it, I highlight all those places that Congress could have cut the military budget, items that the Pentagon itself wanted to cut, and Congress chose not to. Why? Because those cuts would mean ending contracts with companies in their districts. Just.to.hard.to.do.

So instead, Congress is going to repeat it's 1990-style military retiree screw you over deal. Back then, it was health care. Military retirees had been promised a lifetime of free healthcare. They lost it when Congress and President Clinton signed a budget agreement that started to charge retirees for seeing the doctor. They fought back but they fought alone because the civilian community didn't see such a big deal at the time. For 20 years, many a military member has cussed out Clinton for his part in all of this. In fact, I would say it was one of the major reasons why vocal military opinion swayed against Democrats for so long.

Now we're going to see President Obama sign similar legislation. Different retiree benefit but just another generation of military retirees to screw over. Don't think we're getting screwed? Military families certainly do:

From a military spouse at MilitarySpouse.com:



We’ve embraced many hardships. I’ve sacrificed plenty over the years. I know I personally gave up my career to support my husbands – without regret. My occupation is not portable, so I’ll have to start over – someday, when I stop moving every two years. My youngest is five years old and she’s already lived in four states. I’ve said goodbye to family, knowing we’ll never live in the same state again. Because aren’t all grandparents meant for Skyping and not sleepovers? My children are forced to change schools every two years, expected to make new friends and adapt to imbalances in education from state to state. My husband’s office is an intricate part of the national defense of our country. So, that means T-ball games are missed, so are school plays, recitals, activities, help with home work, bed time routines and of course, family vacations. Not to mention, let’s send you off to a war zone for an unknown amount of time, too. My husband has spent 20 years in the United States military. It’s not your typical day job. And, quite frankly, I think I have it pretty good. I know other military families out there have it a lot worse. I’ve embraced my suck, we all do. So, when I hear the Minority Leader of the U.S. House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi (D), spout out in a news conference, we have to “embrace the suck”, I want to scream! How about trying out a new slogan “Embrace Your Promise.”

So how about it? Are you with us or against us?

You can send a letter to your Representative, your Senators, and President Obama in one single go by visiting the Military Officers Association of America. You don't have to be military, just mark that you're an MOAA Family/Friend.

Born In San Francisco', 'He S A Graduate Of Stanford University.']",McManus: Tax reform that hits home,"Would you support a tax reform measure that could help reduce the federal deficit, remove a needless distortion in the economy and make the system fairer?

Me too, which is why I’m taking aim at a sacred cow: the home mortgage interest deduction.

Advertisement

That’s right, the mortgage interest deduction that every homeowner, including me, loves.

If you listen to home builders and real estate agents, they’ll tell you that the mortgage interest deduction is what makes homeownership possible for millions of Americans.

Yet last year, homeownership in the United States, battered by mortgage foreclosures, sank to 65%, a 17-year low, while next door in Canada, where taxpayers don’t get a deduction for mortgage interest, homeownership continues to rise, reaching more than 69% last year, according to Toronto’s Financial Post.

The reason is that our mortgage interest deduction doesn’t directly support homeownership; instead, it supports mortgage indebtedness, which isn’t the same thing at all.

Advertisement

If the goal is really to increase homeownership, a better idea might be to offer a tax break aimed more precisely at middle-income families buying starter houses — a tax rebate for interest on the first $200,000 in mortgage debt, for example.

But that’s not how the mortgage deduction works. First, it’s only useful to people who itemize deductions, which only about 30% of taxpayers do. Second, it helps people with big mortgages more than those with small ones. Third, like all deductions, it helps people with the highest incomes (who get the equivalent of 39.6% of their mortgage interest knocked off their tax bill in the top bracket) more than people with lower incomes (who get 25% or less off if they itemize). Moreover, if someone buys a vacation home, that mortgage interest is deductible too, as long as the total debt is under $1 million.

Advertisement

But don’t take it from me. Take it from the economists at the Mercatus Center, a mostly conservative think tank at Virginia’s George Mason University.

“Most taxpayers do not benefit from this deduction at all or receive a very small benefit,” they wrote in a report issued last month. “The only taxpayers who do receive a large benefit are those in the upper income brackets.... Its primary effect is to encourage Americans who would have already been able to afford a house to take on even more debt.

Advertisement

“Recent empirical research suggests that the mortgage interest deduction increases the size of homes purchased but not the overall rate of homeownership,” they wrote.

And it’s not just conservatives: Policy wonks in both political parties believe that trimming the mortgage interest deduction is a good idea.

Advertisement

President Obama has proposed limiting the value of tax deductions for upper-income taxpayers to 28%, even if they’re paying a higher tax rate. But that idea hasn’t caught fire.

Mitt Romney, last year’s Republican presidential candidate, proposed eliminating all tax deductions for very-high-income taxpayers and putting a cap on deductions — $17,000, for example — for the rest of us. (He wanted lower tax rates too.)

Advertisement

The co-chairmen of Obama’s bipartisan debt commission, Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles, offered a more homeowner-friendly proposal: a 12% tax credit that would go to all taxpayers, even low-income families, on mortgages up to $500,000. (A credit directly reduces your taxes; a deduction merely reduces the amount of your income that’s taxed.)

But wait, you and your real estate agent will say. Won’t a change in the mortgage interest deduction knock a hole in home values?

Advertisement

Yes — at least at the high end, where high-bracket taxpayers take on million-dollar mortgages. At the lower end, where modest homes are bought by people of modest means? No effect on prices at all, economists say.

And even at the high end, the Mercatus report found, “it is likely to have little effect.”

Advertisement

You can be sure that home builders and Realtors, whose businesses thrive on big houses and high prices, will push back hard against any proposal for change.

“We’ve been preparing for this debate for a year and a half,” Jim Tobin, chief lobbyist at the National Assn. of Home Builders, told me recently. “The housing industry is just coming out of its depression,” he argued. “This is not the time to dampen that recovery.”

Advertisement

OK; not this month, then. But by the end of the year, the economy, and the housing industry, are likely to be in better shape.

The mortgage interest deduction subsidizes big houses and bigger mortgages, but that’s not a good use of tax dollars. Its benefits flow disproportionately to the wealthy and do nothing for the working poor.

Advertisement

The deduction currently costs the Treasury about $100 billion a year. That’s money we could use to lower taxes, shrink the deficit or pay for Medicare — a debate Obama and the Republicans will surely have.

There aren’t many policy changes that would increase government revenue, remove distortion from the economy and make the distribution of income fairer all at the same time.

Schools will be the big winner in the governor's new spending plan, receiving $56.2 billion in state funds, an increase by $2.7 billion over the last year. That funding is set to jump to more than $66 billion by 2016.

The budget also dedicated an additional $350 million to the state’s public insurance program, Medi-Cal, to help implement President Obama’s healthcare law.

Brown’s budget predicts only the second budget surplus in the last decade, with an $851-million surplus projected at the end of the 2013-14 fiscal year -- if all his proposals are approved by lawmakers.

With Democrats firmly in control of both legislative houses and the governor’s office, and without what had become familiar multibillion-dollar deficits, this year’s announcement lacked the anxiety and urgency that had surrounded past budget unveilings.

Instead of railing against proposed reductions in popular programs, activists are now girding for long policy battles based on the ideas put forward by the governor on Thursday.

Those fights will play out in the Legislature over the coming months. While they include sweeping changes in how Sacramento spends its money, those skirmishes, too, will lack the drama over cuts to schools and health services that have dominated Capitol discourse for the better part of the last decade.

http://news.yahoo.com/nc-protests-split-bibles-message-help-poor-161430742.html,,[],NC protests split on Bible's message to help poor,"RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — Over the last two months, hundreds of protesters have walked out of North Carolina's capitol in handcuffs to show their opposition to policies by the GOP-controlled Legislature.

While a broader coalition of supporters is building around the ""Moral Mondays"" started by the state chapter of the NAACP, the inspiration behind the protests is a throwback to the biblical message of civil rights leaders fighting segregation in the Jim Crow era.

They argue that cutting benefit programs and cutting tax breaks for low- and middle-income families violates Jesus Christ's teaching to care for those with the least. It's running into another school of Christian thought followed by many Southern conservatives: The best way to help the poor is through private charity, providing jobs and promoting self-reliance, rather than government programs.

The NAACP, and other groups that are joining them in larger numbers, oppose a range of Republican policies, from refusing to expand Medicaid to about 500,000 more people to restricting eligibility for the state's pre-kindergarten program. Republicans, who control both chambers of the Legislature for the first time in more than a century, have also cut unemployment benefits and abolished the earned-income tax credit, which serves low to middle-income people.

State bishops and church leaders from five major Christian denominations issued a statement supporting the NAACP's actions ahead of a clergy-led protest on Monday.

Robert Daniels, senior pastor at St. John's Missionary Baptist Church in Durham, said Monday that he chose to get arrested to let legislators know that disproportionately hurting the poor wouldn't go unnoticed by voters or God.

""I want them to know that justice will win,"" he said. ""God will show his hand that he's for the poor. It's only a matter of time.""

On Wednesday, eight more people were arrested outside the doors of the Senate chamber after being told to leave. Two were city council members from Durham and Rocky Mount. They were among 100 people who attended a rally to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the killing of national NAACP field secretary Medgar Evers.

Matthew Wilson, a professor at Southern Methodist University who writes about the intersection of religion and politics, said differences in responses to poverty historically come down to denomination. Roman Catholics and black Protestants don't oppose public solutions, but Protestants of evangelical or Baptist leanings often do. And those denominations — heavily clustered in the South — emphasize personal responsibility, an individual relationship with God and work ethic, he said.

""A lot of studies show that evangelicals give more money to private anti-poverty groups than any others, so they do take very seriously the biblical imperatives to help the poor, but they differ in that they see the biblical imperative to help the poor as being an individual imperative as opposed to a collective social imperative,"" Wilson said.

Russell Moore, president of the Southern Baptist Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, said he sees Christians as similarly concerned with prosperity for all, but divided over how to bring it about.

""Obviously there will always be those who have no concern for the poor at all, and that's clearly forbidden by Scripture, but usually the differences we have are over unintended consequences,"" he said. ""And so Democrats and Republicans will disagree on what policy objectives will actually help the poor and what will put into place patterns that will, in the long-term, harm poor people.

The protests are dominating local news coverage and attracting national attention, but that doesn't mean they'll be immediately effective. Republicans maintain that they're doing exactly what the public wanted in electing them to veto-proof majorities and the protesters don't represent a clear majority. But the NAACP plans to continue its weekly protests indefinitely.

While some Republicans hesitate to apply biblical lessons to fiscal programs, that hasn't stopped a raft of legislation on private social behavior. In recent years, North Carolina lawmakers have pushed through a constitutional amendment for voters to ban gay marriage and new restrictions on abortion.

Rep. Ruth Samuelson, R-Mecklenburg and a long-practicing Christian, said social legislation as well as economic policy are inevitably driven by worldviews, and among people of faith those perspectives are influenced by their religious beliefs. She said she and her family act charitably in private, but she thinks the best economic policies rein in spending and create a better climate for businesses.

""If we're spending money on this thing, we're taking it from somewhere else, but we can't do it at the cost of the ability of the person paying for the taxes to still have enough to provide for their own families and to create that environment for jobs,"" she said.

To other Christians, the Bible calls for reforms that more directly address systems of inequality.

Miguel De La Torre, a professor of social ethics at Iliff School of Theology and an ordained Southern Baptist minister, said he sees the NAACP's efforts akin to the Occupy movement but with more of a moral current. The one-time Republican candidate for the Florida House of Representatives said the more evangelical strain of Protestantism is tied to the American ideal of individualism, which he believes misses a clear biblical call to address economic strife.

""Having faith without the work of changing the structures is meaningless, which is where I think the NAACP is opposed to the more dominant evangelical view of Christianity,"" he said.

The state NAACP chapter president, the Rev. William Barber, argues it's impossible to divorce a call for collective social justice from the Bible, given that most of it was written under systems of exploitation and Christ focused so heavily on uplifting the poor.

""The problem with (private initiative) is, if you see a kid floating down the river, you can run in and rescue that one child. But if you see a bunch more, you have to go up that river to see who's throwing them in,"" he said. ""If we didn't apply that moral critique we wouldn't have hospitals, public schools, universities, Medicaid, Medicare, unemployment (benefits), even labor laws."""
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/09/14/social-security-paid-13-billion-in-potentially-improper-disability-payments/,2013-09-14 00:00:00,[],"Social Security paid $1.3B in potentially improper disability payments, report says","The Social Security Administration made $1.3 billion in potentially improper disability payments to people who were believed to be employed when they were supposed to be unable to work, according to a Government Accountability Office report released Friday.

The Government Accountability Office estimated that the agency made the potential cash benefit overpayments to about 36,000 individuals from December 2010 to January 2013.

The numbers represent less than 1 percent of beneficiaries and less than 1 percent of disability payments made during the time frame. But GAO said the overpayments reveal weaknesses in Social Security's procedures for policing the system.

The precise number of individuals who received improper disability payments and the exact amount of improper payments made to those recipients cannot be determined without detailed case investigations, according to the report.

The report comes as Social Security's disability program faces a financial crisis. If Congress doesn't act, the trust fund that supports the disability program will run out of money in 2016, according to projections by Social Security's trustees. At that point, the system will collect only enough money in payroll taxes to pay 80 percent of benefits, triggering an automatic 20 percent cut in benefits.

Congress could redirect money from Social Security's much bigger retirement program to shore up the disability program, as it did in 1994. But that would worsen the finances of the retirement program, which is facing its own long-term financial problems.

""This report demonstrates just how little importance the Social Security Administration places on policing its disability rolls,"" said Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, the ranking Republican on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. ""SSA has known for years that it could prevent millions of dollars in improper disability payments using quarterly wage records, but chose not to.""

Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said the report offers common-sense steps that the Social Security Administration can take in order to avoid improper payments.

""However, if we're serious about preventing waste and fraud and ensuring that these critical benefits get to the people who need and deserve them, Congress must also do its part and provide needed resources and access to basic anti-fraud data to the Social Security Administration,"" Carper said.

The Social Security Administration said its accuracy rate for disability payments is more than 99 percent. But the agency noted that even small errors translate into big numbers.

""We are planning to do an investigation, and we will recoup any improper payments from beneficiaries,"" Social Security spokesman Mark Hinkle said. ""It is too soon to tell what caused these overpayments, but if we determine that fraud is involved, we will refer these cases to our office of the inspector general for investigation.""

More than 8.2 million disabled workers received disability payments in December 2010, a figure that has grown to nearly 9 million. Last year, the agency paid out $137 billion in disability payments.

Before people can receive disability benefits, there is a 5-month waiting period in which they can, in general, earn no more than about $1,000 a month. The waiting period is to ensure that beneficiaries have long-term disabilities.

Using a federal wage database, investigators checked whether a sample of disability beneficiaries had worked and earned significant wages during the waiting period, the report said. They found that most of the improper payments went to people who worked during the five months they waited for payments to begin.

Once people start receiving benefits, they can return to work and still get benefits during a trial work period, in an attempt to re-enter the workforce. Using the same wage database, investigators checked whether another sample of disability beneficiaries earned significant wages after their trial work period had ended, the report said.

Based on their findings, the GAO estimated the amount of improper payments and the number of people receiving them.

Citing a potential weakness, the report said Social Security might not detect a person who worked during the waiting period if the period started in one year and ended in another. For example, if Social Security starts paying benefits in February, the agency might not detect significant wages earned the previous November because they weren't earned in the same year that benefits were awarded, the report said.

In a written response to the report, the Social Security Administration agency questioned whether GAO overestimated the amount of overpayments. The agency said investigators did not determine whether the work activity qualified as an unsuccessful attempt to return to work, or whether there were any other special circumstances.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/08/prison-overcrowding_n_4235691.html,2013-11-08 00:00:00,[],10 Ways To Reduce Prison Overcrowding And Save Taxpayers Millions,"America’s federal prisons are in trouble.

They’re so crowded they’re endangering the lives of inmates and corrections officers, the director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, Charles Samuels Jr., testified at a Senate hearing on Wednesday. And the immense cost of confining so many people is draining vital resources from from other public safety endeavors, including investigations and prosecutions.

Politicians across the political spectrum, from Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) to Rand Paul (R-Ky.), increasingly agree that something has to be done.

Now, a report from the Urban Institute, a Washington-based think tank for social and economic policy research, examines a host of specific suggestions, including several proposals awaiting a vote in Congress.

The study, released this week, concludes that the federal government could save billions and significantly ease the overcrowding crisis by adopting strategies that include cutting fixed sentences for drug offenses in half, retroactively applying a law that lessens the disparity between crack and powder cocaine sentences, and offering early-release credits to inmates who participate in programs designed to keep them from committing new crimes after they're released.

“The current situation with respect to the prison system is unsustainable,” said Julie Samuels, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute’s Justice Policy Center and one of the authors of the report (no relation to the prisons director). “I think what we’ve tried to do is lay out the array of options that we have to change that.”

Not everyone agrees that it’s in the country’s best interests to pursue these options. At the Senate hearing where the prisons chief spoke, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), a former U.S. attorney, attributed the dramatic reduction of violent crimes over the last three decades to the growth of the prison population. The more murderers and rapists “you have in jail, the fewer murders and rapes you are going to have,” he said. “That’s just a fact.”

But supporters of prison reform argue that it’s possible to reduce overcrowding without compromising public safety. Below are 10 key proposals examined by the Urban Institute and how they may help save money and empty prison beds over the next decade.

1. Send fewer people to prison for drug crimes.

The problem: There are 219,000 inmates in the federal prisons system -- compared with 25,000 in 1980. About half are there for drug offenses.

The fix: In a major speech in August, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder announced that the Justice Department would try to ensure that fewer people spend years behind bars for non-violent drug crimes, in part by directing prosecutors to bring fewer drug cases to federal court.

Potential savings: If prosecutors and judges send 20 percent fewer drug offenders to prison, the federal government would save $1.29 billion and the prisons would save 125,000 “bed years.” (A bed year is a year’s worth of prison time for one person.)

2. Allow drug offenders to serve shorter sentences.



The problem: Why are so many people locked up for drug crimes? The answer has a lot to do with federal mandatory-minimum sentencing laws. Under one law, judges are required to sentence drug offenders to prison terms ranging from 5 years to 20 years, depending on the type and quantity of the drug. Before this 1986 law, one-quarter of all federal drug offenders were fined or sentenced to probation, the study notes. Today, 95 percent end up behind bars.

The fix: A recent bill introduced by Sens. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Mike Lee (R-Utah), and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) in the Senate, and an identical proposal unveiled last week by Reps. Bobby Scott (D-Va.) and Raul Labrador (R-Idaho), among others, would cut the length of those mandatory prison sentences in half.

Potential savings: The report concludes that this reform would have “a monumental effect,” saving the government $2.49 billion over 10 years while reducing overcrowding to “its lowest level in decades.”

3. Give judges greater discretion over sentencing.



The problem: Even under the current law, judges don’t always have to subject defendants to minimum sentences. A judge can deviate from this protocol, but only if the defendant has been convicted of a nonviolent drug crime and has a very clean criminal record.

The fix: The bill introduced by Durbin, Lee, and Leahy would expand this “safety valve” to include drug offenders with slightly greater criminal histories who pose little danger to the public.

Potential savings: 53,000 bed years, $544 million.

4. Give judges even greater discretion.



The problem: That “safety valve” only applies to drug offenders, not to people who face mandatory minimum sentences for offenses that have nothing to do with drugs, like some white-collar crimes.

The fix: Create a new “safety valve” that could be offered to everyone facing a mandatory minimum sentence.

Potential savings: 81,000 bed years, $835 million.

5. Lower the “truth-in-sentencing” requirement.

The problem: Current law says that everyone in the federal prison system must serve at least 85 percent of the time to which he or she is sentenced, known as the “truth-in-sentencing” requirement.

The fix: Require offenders instead to serve 70 percent of their sentences.

Potential savings: 150,000 bed years, $1.55 billion.

6. Make sure that people aren’t disproportionately punished for using crack instead of powder cocaine.

The problem: A sentencing law passed in the 1980s dictated that that people caught dealing or posessing crack would go to prison for much longer than people caught with powder cocaine. Many criminal justice advocates have argued that this law essentially targeted blacks, since crack is cheaper than powder cocaine and more popular among low-income people. Carl Hart, an associate professor of neuroscience at Columbia University and an expert on illegal drugs, writes that “there are no pharmacological differences between crack and powder cocaine to justify their differential treatment under the law.”

The fix: The Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 decreased the disparity between crack and powder cocaine punishments for anyone sentenced after the law was passed. By applying this law retroactively, to people now serving crack-related prison time, the government would extend its benefits to people who were sentenced before the law was adopted.

Potential savings: 22,000 bed years, $229 million.

7. Allow more prisoners to reduce their sentences through credit for good behavior.



The problem: Many federal prisoners are eligible to get months or years chopped off of their sentences, but only if they participate in a particular drug treatment program.

The fix: Expand the number of rehabilitation programs that offer credits toward early release for those who participate. (This option also offers the benefit of providing more inmates with skills that could help them stay out of trouble after they’re released.)

Potential savings: 22,000 bed years, $224 million.

8. Give prisoners a full year off their sentences for participation in a drug rehabilitation program.

The problem: Federal prisoners who graduate from the system’s main drug program are supposed to get a full year off their sentences. But thanks to overcrowding, the line to get into the program is so long that many offenders have less than a year of their sentences left by the time they graduate.

The fix: Expand the program so that every graduate receives a full year off his or her sentence.

Potential savings: 880 bed years, $9.1 million.

9. Release more elderly prisoners from Bureau of Prisons custody.

The problem: After the age of 55, people who are released from prison are highly unlikely to commit new crimes, according to many studies. Yet 17,400 people in federal prisons are older than 55, according to the report.

The fix: Release some of them before their sentences are up. (The report assumed that fewer than half would be promising candidates.)

Potential savings: 700 bed years, $7.8 million.

10: Send more foreign inmates back to their home countries.

The problem: 54,200 federal prisoners aren’t U.S. citizens.

The fix: Streamline the “international transfer” program so that twice as many prisoners are sent to prisons in their home countries.

Potential savings: 670 bed years, $6.9 million."
http://news.yahoo.com/public-tours-white-house-resume-nov-5-195950760--politics.html,,[],Public tours of White House to resume Nov. 5,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Public tours of the White House, canceled earlier this year because of budget cuts, are resuming next month on a limited basis.

The self-guided tours of the ground floor, first floor and East Wing of the White House are to resume Nov. 5 and continue through Jan. 15. Tours will be allowed an average of three days a week, down from five, said the Secret Service, which is responsible for White House security.

Separately, the White House said its gardens and grounds will be open to the public on the weekend of Oct. 26-27.

The White House scrapped the tours after mandatory budget cuts took effect in March. The cuts, known as sequestration, affected many government departments and agencies, including the Secret Service, which then told the White House its options included cutting the tours or furloughing officers as a result.

Uniformed Secret Service officers are stationed in rooms along the tour to provide security and help tourists.

The Secret Service said Friday that the tours can resume at a reduced pace under a temporary funding bill President Barack Obama signed early Thursday for the budget year that began Oct. 1. The bill fully reopened the government after a 16-day partial shutdown brought on by a spending impasse between the Obama administration and Congress.

That funding runs out Jan. 15, same as the tours, which raises the possibility that the tours could be reduced or canceled again if Obama and lawmakers can't agree on spending for the remainder of the budget year.

""Last year's sequestration came midway through the fiscal year, and we were unable to adjust or reallocate remaining funding to continue tours while still ensuring enough funding remained to meet all operational needs and avoid furloughing our employees,"" said Secret Service spokesman George Ogilvie. In light of the new fiscal year, Ogilvie said the agency was confident that the tours can operate at a reduced level while still meeting operational requirements.

Story continues

Republicans, led by House Speaker John Boehner, had needled the White House over its decision to cancel the tours. Boehner said alternative spending cuts helped keep the Capitol open to the public and he wished the White House had figured out how to do the same.

House Republicans also produced a video of stops on the Capitol tour that ended with this line: ""This is your house. Tour it.""

Members of the public who want free tickets for public tours of the White House should contact their representatives in Congress. The green, red and blue rooms, the State Dining Room and the East Room are among the stops on that tour.

Free tickets for the White House garden tours at the end of October will be distributed on a first-come, first-serve basis each morning of the tour at the visitor pavilion on the Ellipse near the White House. Visitors will be able to visit the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden, the Rose Garden, the South Lawn and first lady Michelle Obama's vegetable garden.

Wal-Mart has attracted controversy for decades: Its supporters laud its low prices and market efficiencies, while its opponents charge that the company exploits workers, destroys local economies and pollutes the environment. Now, despite warnings from the retailer that it would reconsider its plans to open three stores in Washington, the D.C. Council has passed a living-wage bill that would require Wal-Mart to pay its workers here at least $12.50 per hour. Let’s examine a few of these impressions about the world’s largest retailer.

1. Only lower-income people shop at Wal-Mart.

Wal-Mart sells lots of cheap stuff, so it’s no surprise that low- and middle-income shoppers are the store’s most regular customers. However, wealthier people are among the more than 60 percent of Americans who shop at Wal-Mart each month. A 2005 Pew Research Center survey found that more than three-quarters of respondents from households earning more than $75,000 a year thought Wal-Mart was a good place to shop, and nearly 80 percent of them had shopped at Wal-Mart in the previous year. Of customers in this income group, 38 percent described themselves as regular Wal-Mart shoppers.

2. Critics just want to unionize Wal-Mart workers.

Most of the efforts to improve working conditions and compensation at Wal-Mart are led by union-funded groups that have been branded as allies of Big Labor seeking only to line their pockets with more union dues. But practically, none of these efforts has focused on formally unionizing Wal-Mart’s unorganized domestic workforce.

Instead, as early as 2005, groups such as Walmart Watch and Wake Up Walmart waged a largely successful campaign focusing not on Wal-Mart workers’ union status but on their compensation and benefits. A year after Walmart Watch was founded, the retail giant lowered premiums on its health insurance policies and allowed part-time workers to obtain medical coverage for their children. The newer group Our Walmart has coordinated recent worker strikes in a similar attempt to put pressure on the retailer in the court of public opinion, but still explicitly says that it does not intend to represent Wal-Mart workers in formal negotiations with their employer.

3. Wal-Mart is great for low-income Americans.

Low-income shoppers need low prices because the manufacturing jobs with living wages that might have sustained them in earlier generations have been moved to sweatshops overseas, leaving poorly paid service jobs in their wake. Wal-Mart’s low-income customers thus have more in common with foreign workers than they may realize: Both are caught in a global economy that has discounted their labor in the name of cheap consumption.

Prioritizing consumption (what we pay for goods) over production (what workers earn for making goods) means that even low-income families whose economic futures have been jeopardized by the outsourcing of manufacturing jobs can see Wal-Mart as a savior, not a villain. Yet the retail giant’s genius lies in camouflaging its exploitation in terms that frame its relentless cost-cutting as a kind of benevolence. For example, the company in 2006 declared itself “a lifeline” for millions of Americans facing harsh and uncertain economic times, adding that “perhaps more than any single company in America, Walmart is providing the opportunity for a better life for poor and working families.” Still, even if Wal-Mart’s low prices help low-income Americans make ends meet at the cash register, the low wages offered by Wal-Mart (and other comparable retail service jobs) do little to help low-income families shoulder the burden of other rising costs, such as health care and housing.

4. Wal-Mart is bad for the environment.

The Environmental Protection Agency has repeatedly sued Wal-Mart for faulty stormwater management and illegally dumping hazardous chemicals and pesticides at its retail sites, among other offenses. As recently as May, for instance, Wal-Mart agreed to pay nearly $82 million in fines for violating environmental regulations in California and Missouri.

But the truth about the chain’s environmental record is more complex, simply because Wal-Mart has unmatched power to promote change on the consumption end. The company is good at lowering prices, and it turns out that many forms of conservation are also good business. When something helps the bottom line — be it developing more fuel-efficient trucks or demanding that suppliers develop lighter, low-waste packaging — conservation measures are a no-brainer. Moreover, consumer blocs seeking environmentally friendly products can create changes that ripple throughout the food and grocery industry, given Wal-Mart’s unparalleled market clout. When the retailer announced in 2008 that its store brand of milk would come from cows not treated with synthetic hormones, it credited consumer demand. The intense environmental scrutiny on Wal-Mart has also led the company to pursue additional sustainability measures. Wal-Mart’s most recent Global Responsibility Report notes that its stores and distribution centers drew more than one-fifth of their electricity from renewable sources.

5. Washington’s living-wage bill shows that communities can stand up to Wal-Mart.

It’s true that living-wage ordinances like the one the D.C. Council passed recently can potentially boost wages for the employees of large retailers. But such legislation is frequently defeated or vetoed, or struck down in federal court. For example, in 2006, Chicago’s city council passed a measure similar to D.C.’s that required big-box retailers to pay well above minimum wage, and to spend additional money on benefits. Less than two months after it passed, Mayor Richard Daley vetoed it, citing the promise of economic development that Wal-Mart could offer some of Chicago’s poorest neighborhoods.

Similarly, the Maryland Senate approved legislation in 2005 that required large employers to spend a set portion of their payroll on health benefits or contribute to state Medicaid coffers. (Although not mentioned by name, Wal-Mart was effectively the bill’s only target.) Then-Gov. Bob Ehrlich promptly vetoed the measure — and even after the state Senate overturned his veto, the legislation was found illegal in federal courts.

As Wal-Mart attempts to open stores in urban areas, challenging the world’s largest retailer requires more than legislation. New York City, for instance, has successfully resisted company’s attempts to enter Queens, Staten Island and Brooklyn. Not only have city council members been opposed to the retailer’s advances, they’ve been supported by relatively strong displays of union clout signaling that a long, protracted battle awaits. Local governments are probably more effective in keeping out Wal-Mart than they are in garnering concessions on wages and benefits.

Thank you all so much! Keep spreading the word about Senator Begich's plan. He has the right idea about what to do to strengthen Social Security and we need to get Democrats to make this the party's official plan. Expect more diaries about Begich from me.

Ok, so far Laurence Lewis' front page post is about Chuck Hagel and John Brennan, which yes highlights some valid points and the rec list has diaries about Obama wanting to cut Social Security. Great way to start Sunday Morning off with the first big Obama Rocks/Obama Sucks Pie Fight. Well since the rec list gets filled with both ""Obama Will Betray Us"" and ""11th Dimensional Chess"" themed diaries, I for one am going to repeat a call for action that I have made several times but only made the rec list once. And that is to get everyone to get their Senator and Congressman to back Senator Mark Begich's (D. AK) plan to strengthen Social Security. I've already written about it quite a few times but if Sunday is going to turn out to be a big pie fight, I will take the role of the diarist actually proposing solutions.

Ok, so here's the very first diary I wrote about Begich's plan to strengthen Social Security:

http://www.dailykos.com/...

Begich's plan is known as the Protecting and Preserving Social Security Act and here's what the plan calls for:



Lifts the Cap on High-Income Contributions. Current law sets a cap based on income at $113,700 for paying into Social Security. If an individual’s wages hit that total for the year, they no longer pay into the program. Sen. Begich’s bill lifts the cap and asks higher income earners to pay Social Security on all their earnings in order to increase the program’s revenue stream and extend the overall solvency of the program. Extends Social Security for approximately 75 years through modest revenue increases gradually implemented over the course of seven years. - Alaska Native News, 11/14/12

“Sen. Begich’s bill serves the American people well in very important ways,” said Eric Kingson, co-chair of the Strengthen Social Security Coalition. “By asking high-income people to pay the same payroll tax contribution as everyone else, he dramatically improves the financing of Social Security. By improving the accuracy of the cost of living adjustment, he assures that seniors and people with disabilities will be able to maintain their standard of living as time goes on.” - Alaska Native News, 11/14/12

""Mr. President, a few weeks ago back home in Anchorage, I joined a group of seniors I presented this piece of legislation to them at the Anchorage Senior Center and she says she loves to describe herself as a ""young woman from Alaska"" stood up. Beverly Moore, an 81-year old Korean War Navy veteran. Beverly was there because the majority of her modest income comes from Social Security. And she wanted to know how this proposal will strengthen that lifeline for her and thousands of Alaskans. In fact, one in nine Alaskans receive Social Security. With my states population of those 65 and older expanding rapidly, Social Security will continue to play a key role in supplementing a decent living. If Social Security was not there for the elderly Alaskans, a fifth of them would live below poverty. It's vital for our state, it's vital for all our states and for this whole country. Mr. President I have no illusions that this bill is going to pass in the final weeks of this 112th congress but I wanted to get it into the mix. I wanted to make sure people got the bigger point and again I would say to my residing officer and says this well and I know my friend here from Oregon who is on the floor also as we talk about the deficit that has taken center stage right now, we want to highlight one very clear thing: Social Security has not contributed, is not part of and never will contribute to the deficit. So those who like to meddle in it and try to combine it into this deficit talk are just playing games with our seniors and disabled in this country."" - U.S. Senator Mark Begich (D. AK), 12/7/12

You can help in three ways. (1) Call Senator Begich’s office and thank him. It’s seriously important to let him know that real progressives are behind a real progressive proposal. His DC office number is: Senator Mark Begich

(202) 224 – 3004

(877) 501 – 6275 (toll-free) (2) Get behind this bill. If you can publicize it, do. If you can write about it, do. If you can talk about it, do. We need to do our part as well to promote real progressive legislation. The next four years should not be a spectator sport. (3) Call your senators — both of them — and ask them to co-sign this bill. This needs momentum, and co-signers provide that. The list of Senate phone numbers is here.: http://www.senate.gov/... - America Blog, 11/19/12

Now here's the actual plan:The Alaskan AARP and the coalition to strengthen Social Security have endorsed Begich's plan:Now here's Begich making the case for the Protecting and Preserving Social Security Act on the Senate floor and explaining how Social Security doesn't contribute to the defict:Sounds like a great plan, right? Wouldn't it be nice if every Democratic Senator backed this plan? Well instead of spending the day fighting each other in the comments section of people's diaries, how about we focus on putting the pressure on the Senate to make it a reality. Here's how you can do so:I'll leave you with this diary. Every time I sense an Obama pie fight regarding Social Security a brewing, I'm just going to post another diary about Begich's plan.

Story highlights NEW: The White House urges Republicans to favor the middle class over tax loopholes The plan raises taxes on millionaires, ends farm subsidies and cuts defense spending An aide to Sen. Mitch McConnell says Americans oppose higher taxes Spending cuts to take effect March 1 absent congressional action to avert them

Senate Democrats proposed a $110 billion measure Thursday to put off mandatory across-the-board spending cuts set to take effect March 1.

The package made public by Senate Democratic leaders calls for replacing the so-called sequester cuts with a combination of increased tax revenue from millionaires, ending agriculture subsidies and reducing defense spending after the war in Afghanistan ends.

Republican leaders in Congress have demanded that Democrats come up with a plan for avoiding the imminent cuts, technically known as sequestration.

However, the GOP opposes any increase in tax rates or other steps to bring in more tax revenue, saying the nation needs to reduce the cost of government.

Kerry: Cuts would hit foreign aid, diplomatic security

“I would respectfully disagree that the American people are going to suddenly demand more tax hikes,” an aide to Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said.

A White House statement said that opposing what it called the balanced plan by Senate Democrats would amount to prioritizing “tax loopholes that benefit the very few at the expense of middle- and working-class Americans.”

The issue extends a long-running political dispute over government spending and federal deficits that dominated President Barack Obama’s first term, as well as his successful re-election campaign last year.

Republicans were forced to concede on their steadfast opposition to increased taxes by agreeing in January to higher rates on top income earners as part of a deal to avoid some of the harshest impacts of what was known as the fiscal cliff, which included the sequester cuts and automatic tax hikes.

Napolitano: Spending cuts will hurt homeland security

That agreement put off action on the sequester cuts, which were mandated by a 2011 agreement to raise the federal debt ceiling.

The purpose of the deep cuts to all discretionary programs and the military was to motivate Congress to reach a comprehensive deficit reduction agreement that would replace it.

However, such a deal has proved impossible, leading to the imminent application of $85 billion in spending cuts for 2013 and almost $1 trillion over 10 years.

Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and other officials warn that the cuts will have a dire impact on government operations and military readiness. The Pentagon would absorb about half of the reductions.

While the White House and congressional leaders from both parties oppose sequestration, the approach for averting it has become the latest congressional showdown involving ideological differences over the size and role of government.

House Speaker John Boehner noted on Thursday that the House passed bills last year to prevent the cuts from affecting the military, but Senate Democrats never acted.

“Those days are over,” Boehner declared, but he also signaled a willingness to negotiate with the Senate over any legislation it sends over. “It’s time for the Senate to do their work. We can … if they’re willing to pass a bill, we’ll find some way to work with them to address this problem.”

Panetta: World is watching U.S. on budget

The plan unveiled Thursday by Senate Democrats would just replace the cuts through the end of this year, leaving time for possible negotiations on a broader deficit-reduction package that would eliminate sequestration entirely.

The Democrats proposed $54 billion in revenue by implementing the “Buffett rule,” a principle by billionaire financier Warren Buffett that he shouldn’t pay a lower tax rate than his secretary.

Under it, anyone with adjusted income of more than $1 million after charitable deductions would pay a minimum 30% tax rate.

Other revenue measures in the package include ending tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas and closing tax loopholes for the oil industry.

In addition, the package would cut military funding starting in 2015, following the planned end of U.S. combat operations next year in Afghanistan. It would also end agriculture subsidies for a total saving of $55 billion.

“Billions in direct payment subsidies are paid out even in good times and for crops farmers aren’t even growing,” explained Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Michigan, who chairs the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry.

Panetta said Wednesday that Congress needs to put aside party and ideological divisions that he called “the greatest concern I have for our national security.”

He expressed concern over how the world will view the United States if it fails to avert sequestration.

“What (other countries) worry about is what I worry about, which is whether or not we can govern and whether or not we can face the tough decisions that have to be made and resolve those,” Panetta said.

Postal Service proposed delivering only packages on Saturday%2C starting Aug. 5

Congress barred the service from changing its delivery schedule

Postal Service says limiting Saturday delivery is a critical part of a 5-year-plan to make the service solvent

The nation will continue to get its Saturday mail through at least Sept. 30, the U.S. Postal Service said Wednesday.

The Postal Service backed down from its plan to cut mail delivery starting this summer from six days a week to five, saying Congress had prohibited such a move.

A measure passed by Congress last month to fund government operations while the budget remains in limbo included language that barred changing the delivery schedule, the Postal Service board of governors said in a written statement Wednesday.

The Postal Service had proposed delivering only packages on Saturdays. The new schedule was to begin Aug. 5.

The board said it was ""disappointed"" with the move by Congress but would follow the law. The board directed the Postal Service to delay the start of its new delivery schedule while it seeks authority from Congress to make the change.

""The board believes that Congress has left it with no choice but to delay,"" the statement said.

Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which oversees the Postal Service, called the decision a disappointing setback. Polls show Americans support a pared-down schedule, he said.

""This reversal significantly undercuts the credibility of postal officials who have told Congress that they were prepared to defy political pressure and make difficult but necessary cuts,"" Issa said in a written statement. ""It's quite clear that special-interest lobbying and intense political pressure played a much greater role in the Postal Service's change of heart than any real or perceived barrier to implementing what had been announced.""

Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., the ranking Democrat on the committee, said the Postal Service must abide by the law, but Congress should pass legislation to allow it to revamp services and become profitable. Cummings introduced a bill last year that would give the Postal Service more flexibility to change its business model, but the House did not take up the measure.

Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe had said eliminating Saturday mail delivery would save the Postal Service $2 billion a year and is a critical part of a five-year-plan to make the service solvent. He has said he would buck any Capitol Hill efforts to dismantle the plan.

The agency said it lost almost $16 billion last year, due in part to a 2006 congressional mandate requiring it to prepay 75 years worth of retiree benefits within a decade.

Last month, however, a resolution passed by Congress to fund the government through September required six-day Postal Service delivery for the rest of the fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30."

Here’s how it happened: In 1894 Pullman workers, facing wage cuts in the wake of a financial crisis, went on strike — and Grover Cleveland deployed 12,000 soldiers to break the union. He succeeded, but using armed force to protect the interests of property was so blatant that even the Gilded Age was shocked. So Congress, in a lame attempt at appeasement, unanimously passed legislation symbolically honoring the nation’s workers.

It’s all hard to imagine now. Not the bit about financial crisis and wage cuts — that’s going on all around us. Not the bit about the state serving the interests of the wealthy — look at who got bailed out, and who didn’t, after our latter-day version of the Panic of 1893. No, what’s unimaginable now is that Congress would unanimously offer even an empty gesture of support for workers’ dignity. For the fact is that many of today’s politicians can’t even bring themselves to fake respect for ordinary working Americans.

Consider, for example, how Eric Cantor, the House majority leader, marked Labor Day last year: with a Twitter post declaring “Today, we celebrate those who have taken a risk, worked hard, built a business and earned their own success.” Yep, he saw Labor Day as an occasion to honor business owners."

Put simply, the recession took middle-class jobs, and the recovery has replaced them with low-income ones, a trend that has exacerbated income inequality. According to Labor Department data, about 1.7 million workers earned the minimum wage or less in 2007. By 2012, the total had surged to 3.6 million, with millions of others earning just a few cents or dollars more.

In his State of the Union address in February, President Obama made raising the federal minimum wage his banner economic proposal. The White House argued that increasing the wage to $9 an hour from its current $7.25 and indexing it to inflation would lift hundreds of thousands of families above the poverty line.

Combined with tax measures the administration has supported, Alan B. Krueger, the departing chairman of the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers, said that raising the minimum wage would undo “a lot of the rise in inequality we’ve seen over the last 20 years.”"

Five months after his resounding reelection victory, President Obama is bumping up against the boundaries of his political power in Washington as the core of his second-term legislative agenda moves into a still-divided Congress.

His ability to secure the three high-profile legislative items now confronting Congress — gun-control measures, reform of the immigration system and his long-term budget priorities — is likely to determine his domestic legacy. Obama’s plan now is to ensure that as much of his politically challenging agenda as possible is enacted, after months of effort to frame the policies for the American public and, perhaps more important, for the House and Senate.

Each of the issues that Obama is pursuing is being managed independently by the second-term White House team — an improvisational strategy that is testing the president’s ability to calibrate when to get involved and when to stay out of the way.

But senior administration officials acknowledge that only immigration legislation has a chance of resembling Obama’s ideal bill once it emerges from the Democratic-run Senate and the Republican-controlled House.

On his other major initiatives, they say Obama would settle for less than he claims he wants, a sign that he remains pragmatic in the face of partisan opposition that continues to limit his ambitions.

“I have the same worry about all of these issues, and it’s the Republican House,” said Dan Pfeiffer, an Obama senior adviser.

Obama outlined a broad progressive agenda in his second inaugural address, and he has spoken frequently about the validation that he believes the public gave his plans by reelecting him last year. But second-term presidents traditionally have less than two years to secure a legislative agenda before lame-duck status sets in, and Obama already has seen his popular support shrink in recent months from its post-

election highs.

The election also did not change the basic political dynamic in Washington: a Democratic president in conflict with congressional Republicans, only some of whom believe last year’s election represented a call for compromise.

Each morning, the new White House chief of staff, Denis McDonough, reviews the overall legislative progress with senior staff. Inside the White House, each issue has a group responsible for its day-to-day management on Capitol Hill.

The strategy has led Obama to alternately court Senate Republicans — as he did last week in his second such dinner with a dozen of them — and to scold them before outside-the-Beltway audi-

ences, as he did this month in denouncing GOP threats to block gun-control legislation. Advisers say he does so to keep the political momentum alive in Washington for measures with strong public support outside the capital.

After months of campaigning for his agenda, two of his priorities appear to be inching through the Democratic-controlled Senate: a compromise on gun-purchase background checks was announced last week and another deal is expected this week on immigration.

But the budget he announced last week, which proposed restricting cost-of-living increases for Social Security, appears to have angered his own supporters more than it has convinced Republicans. It is an issue on which his strongest political leverage lies in going against his own party.

“I think they put something on the table which no Democrat should ever put on the table,” said Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. “It’s not okay to be bargained with. The risk is that voters mistakenly identify his budget priorities with all of ours.”

Immigration

After outlining what he wants in an immigration bill, Obama has largely taken a hands-off approach to designing the legislation, now the subject of negotiations among a bipartisan group of senators known as the Gang of Eight.

The strategy was adopted soon after his second-term inauguration, when Obama, eager to push the issue after winning more than 70 percent of the Latino vote, prepared to introduce his own bill during a visit to Las Vegas to break a long-standing deadlock among Senate negotiators.

Administration officials said Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), a Gang of Eight member, called the White House a few days before the Jan. 29 event. Schumer said the group was close to reaching consensus on a bill and asked Obama to hold off on announcing his own in order to avoid disrupting the talks.

Obama agreed.

“On any issue where there is progress being made, we don’t want to get in the way,” said a senior administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the White House legislative strategy and assess its prospects. “Every one of these issues has potential pitfalls and potential opportunities.”

Inside the White House, the issue is being managed by Cecilia Muñoz, director of the Domestic Policy Council. Administration officials acknowledge that immigration is the issue on which they can be the most patient, given that many Republicans are eager to repair relations with the fast-growing Latino electorate after the November election.

While Obama has allowed Senate negotiators to work on a compromise that can win approval, a White House staff member attends each staff-level meeting to monitor progress and assist with the technical aspects of writing the bill.

“We know we have the upper hand on immigration,” the administration official said, acknowledging that Obama has far less sway when it comes to gun-

control measures and the budget.

Guns

Obama has employed an outside-the-Beltway strategy on guns, traveling to the sites of mass shootings to implore Congress to take action.

White House aides believe that the school massacre in Newtown, Conn., in December, in which a gunman killed 20 children and six adult staff members, created the first political moment in decades for Congress to tighten gun laws. A large majority of the public supports tighter restrictions, but many in Congress would rather not confront the powerful gun rights lobby.

Obama’s aides also worry that the political environment could change quickly unless the president keeps pressuring Congress to act, which he did Monday when he visited the University of Hartford in the company of Newtown parents.

This weekend, for the first time ever, Obama turned his weekly radio address over to someone other than Vice President Biden: Francine Wheeler, whose 6-year-old son, Ben, was fatally shot in Newtown’s Sandy Hook Elementary School.

“Please help us do something before our tragedy becomes your tragedy,” Wheeler said, adding that the Senate hasn’t “yet passed any bills that will help keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people. “

The president began the year with a sweeping set of proposals to ban military-style assault weapons, limit the size of ammunition magazines, require background checks for virtually all weapons sales and increase funding for mental health care, among other issues.

Yet it has become increasingly clear to the administration that most of the ambitious ideas don’t have enough support to pass Congress. The issue is being managed by Biden’s office, and the White House is trying to strike a balance between when to pressure lawmakers and when to accept a compromise, even if it is far more modest than originally envisioned.

Obama took the latter approach last week when he praised a bipartisan deal to expand background checks, while acknowledging it is not as expansive as he wanted.

Advisers concede that the most high-profile of the Obama proposals — renewing the expired federal ban on assault weapons — has virtually no chance of becoming law.

“You have to have an analysis of the possible,” the senior administration official said. “Anything we do on guns is a positive for the country.”

Budget

Obama’s continuing struggles over the budget, perhaps more than anything else, show the limits of his power.

White House officials believe that Obama won the public argument over taxes and spending in the recent presidential election — a long “outside game” that Obama hopes will translate into leverage inside the Beltway.

Now the administration is trying to coax Republicans into a budget compromise that would replace across-the-board spending cuts, known as the sequester, that took effect last month and undercut Obama’s vision for how to build the economy.

Last week, Obama presented a budget that he said did not reflect his ideal view but that he believes might appeal to moderate Republicans looking to put fiscal fights behind them.

The budget fully incorporates the offer Obama made to House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) in December during “fiscal cliff” talks, embracing policies such as cuts to Social Security benefits that are noxious to many Democrats.

Obama is counting on preliminary discussions to try to reconcile separate budgets passed by House Republicans and Senate Democrats last month, although it’s not clear whether those talks will reach a more serious phase.

As Congress goes through that process, Obama plans to continue reaching out to Republicans who may be open to a deal.

“There’s an awful lot of work to be done,” said Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) after the latest GOP dinner with Obama on Wednesday. “But these overtures are encouraging.”

White House aides are looking for help from lawmakers such as Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who organized the guest list for the first dinner with Obama and suggested he would be open to a compromise that raises revenue in exchange for significant entitlement reform.

But White House officials acknowledge there is no clear path toward a deal, meaning that sequester spending cuts are likely to remain in place for the foreseeable future.

The budget process is being handled by the same men who have been running it for several years: National Economic Council Director Gene Sperling and deputy chief of staff Rob Nabors. Any progress on the budget will rely on Republicans agreeing to at least some degree of higher tax revenue, White House officials said, by way of scaling back tax breaks that benefit the wealthy.

Administration officials say the only hope of getting an agreement through the House is to have resounding support in the Senate. They concede they will need to work to get even some Democrats on board given the changes to Social Security now on the table.

“The best strategy for the House is to do as well as we can in the Senate,” the administration official said. “Step two is to get as many Democrats as possible.”

John McCain (R-AZ) gave the clearest indication that proponents of comprehensive immigration reform may make their final–and strongest–push to get legislation passed next year after House Republicans make it through their primaries.

“I think conventional wisdom is that time is not on our side,” McCain told reporters on Monday after an event in Chicago. “But there are a number of members of Congress who have primaries and when those primaries are done, they may be more inclined to address the issue of comprehensive immigration reform.”

President Barack Obama has urged Congress to pass immigration reform legislation this year. House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) is reportedly going to bring legislation to the floor within the next month and other House Republican leaders have indicated support for piecemeal pieces of legislation that can make it to conference with the Senate, where proponents and opponents of immigration reform had said a pathway to citizenship will prevail.

Though the Congressional Budget Office has determined the Senate’s immigration bill would lower the wages of working class Americans, House Republicans are reportedly working on piecemeal pieces of legislation to eventually get to conference with the Senate. McCain also said on Monday that the House should just “pass something” to get to conference with the Senate. House Republicans like Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) are reportedly working on legislation that would grant a pathway to citizenship to all of the country’s illegal immigrants.

McCain’s comments indicate even if the current push to enact comprehensive immigration reform fails, the real fight may be in the spring and summer of next year, when Obama could use immigration as a midterm election issue and Republican lawmakers will not be worried about primaries in the 2014 election cycle.

In 2010, McCain made a right turn on immigration, infamously promising to “complete the danged fence” as he was fighting for his political life to win re-election in Arizona. Shortly after he got elected to serve another term, McCain quickly lurched back to the left, becoming a champion for comprehensive immigration reform and calling Tea Partiers whose support he needed in 2010 “hobbits” and “wacko birds.”"

I staggered to the door to discover a big box from Amazon deposited on the stoop, and a U.S. Postal Service truck just rounding the corner on its way to make another Sunday delivery. “What the --?” I asked.

The delivery, as I was presently to learn, was the harbinger of the Postal Service’s new deal with Amazon for Sunday delivery of the online retailer’s packages in big cities. It’s a brilliant move that serves both the partners and customers too. It builds on the Postal Service’s reach in parcel delivery -- the USPS performs the same last-mile service in many communities for UPS and FedEx -- and provides it with a new source of revenue.

But it doesn’t solve the service’s most significant problems, which contributed to its $5-billion loss in the latest fiscal year, reported late last week. One problem is the secular decline in first-class mail, which is unlikely to recover its bygone volume.

But the bigger problem is the enduring hostility to the USPS shown by many conservatives in Congress. It’s because of them that the USPS has maxed out its statutory borrowing authority and faces an annual payment of $5.5 billion into a health fund for its future retirees. The service defaulted on that obligation last year and this year, but it shows up as a liability on its balance sheet and destroys its financial flexibility.

Advertisement

In real terms it’s an obnoxious fiction imposed by a cynical Congress in 2006. Barring the unnecessary healthcare payments, the postal service’s deficit would be manageable -- $5 billion is a bit more than one-tenth of 1% of the federal budget.

We examined the reasons for this congressional hostility last year. As we wrote at the time: “What could explain conservative hostility toward the U.S. Postal Service? After all, most members of Congress, Republican or Democrat, will defend to the death the smallest one-room post office in their district.

“But what about the characteristics of the workforce? It’s heavily and effectively unionized, for one thing. For another, over a long period, the post office has been a reliable steppingstone to the middle class for African American families. (Black workers make up about 11% of the USPS payroll, about twice their representation in the overall workforce.) Maybe some people just think these workers are expendable.”

Things haven’t changed since then. This year’s loss is an improvement over last year’s, when the red ink came to $16 billion, but it’s folly to think that the USPS should turn a profit or even break even.

Congressional conservatives in particular like to argue that the USPS should operate like a business -- if it can’t make money delivering mail to the far-flung corners of the country, it should stop trying. This is the sort of idea that could only be hatched by smug, comfortable politicos and pundits with offices in downtown Washington, D.C., who couldn’t find, say, Supai, Arizona, with a road map. Remote as it is, Supai is entitled to postal delivery at the same flat rate as you pay to deliver to Dupont Circle.

That’s why the post office was written in to the U.S. Constitution -- at the time it was seen as a crucial governmental function binding the nation together. It still is. Treating universal mail service as something that should compete profitably with commercial carriers or die is not only foolhardy, it’s probably unconstitutional. Congress should get over the idea.

Like its decision to end White House tours when the sequester cuts took effect, there is no rational reason for this. The Park Police, nominally in charge of monitoring these spaces, isn’t even affected by the shutdown. Shutting off access to these sites is gratuitous and petulant.

On Monday, the first day of the government shutdown, a number of WWII veterans showed up at a memorial to their service to find that access had been blocked. The memorial is in a public space and is open 24/7, with almost no oversight from Park Police personnel. (Who, by the way, are exempt from the government shutdown.) The White House was, according to reports, informed of the veterans’ visit and chose to block access.

Having lived in DC for 18 years, I can tell you, the WWII Memorial is simply an architectural structure in an open public space. There is no official “access” to it. There are no guards. It’s a building in a park. Yet, the Obama Administration tried to block veterans from viewing the public memorial, even after hearing about the planned visit.

Fortunately, the “greatest generation” was having nothing of this and easily overcame the government barricades. (Do we yet again have to rely on this generation to show the promise of America?)

On Wednesday, the veterans’ group is planning to visit the Lincoln Memorial, which the Obama Administration has also vowed to close to visitors. I have regularly visited this memorial at one or two in the morning. At those hours, it is a peaceful and reflective place. It is an open space. There is no access that needs to be blocked. It is only by a conscious decision, and a great deal of work, that access would be blocked.

This is nothing more than a petulant response by the Obama Administration to the government shutdown. Over the next week, more than 500 WWII veterans are expected in DC to visit the memorial dedicated to their sacrifice. If the Park Police again try to erect barricades to this public space, it will be another sign that the Obama Administration has made an affirmative decision to separate itself from the American public.

Obama chose this pass. He ought to be made to own it."

The “sequester” -- the drastic set of budget cuts formerly known as the “fiscal cliff” -- seems very likely to go into effect at the end of this week due in no small part to the fact that hyper-conservative lawmakers, such as Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, actually think it’s a pretty swell idea.

Their obsessive and mistaken belief that the federal deficit is the greatest threat to the republic is leading them to block any compromise with Democrats that would delay or repeal the looming budget reductions.

They want government to get smaller and smaller, even if the cuts will come too quickly and slash too indiscriminately. The supreme absurdity of their position is that this could so damage the American economy that federal revenue will drop and deficit reduction will become even harder to achieve.

The tea party folks may be sincere, loyal citizens, but their notions about how the economy works are exactly that: mere notions. Their core notion is that government needs to do nothing more than get out of the way of business in order for the economy to boom and bloom.

In an 18th century world or in the fiction of Ayn Rand that might have worked, but the reality is different. The United States became the world’s biggest economy in the post-World War II years for many reasons, but one big reason is that government played a pivotal role.

Government built infrastructure like the interstate highway system, paid for crucial research and development, ran the space program, supported a massive military and played referee in the financial realm so that those who wanted to rig the system could not do it as easily as they had in the 1920s.

When, in his first inaugural address, Ronald Reagan famously said government is the problem, not the solution, he established the Republican mantra that has not changed in all the years since. It was a clever bit of rhetoric, but it has turned too many Republicans into economic simpletons. Government can, indeed, be part of the problem sometimes, but it cannot be left out of any solution to the challenges of our complex modern economy.

Pete Peterson, President Nixon’s secretary of Commerce, has campaigned for years against rising deficits and has earned the ire of liberals who think his insistence on restructuring Social Security and Medicare is too extreme and unnecessary. Yet, even Peterson, in an interview on public radio’s “Marketplace” on Tuesday, said many of his fellow Republicans are crazy to think the sequester cuts are a smart idea.

Peterson said the deficit problem is long-term and must be dealt with comprehensively through spending reductions, entitlement reforms and revenue increases, a.k.a. taxes.

What should not happen, Peterson insisted, is a governmental retreat from investing in America’s economic future through funding of things such as education, infrastructure and basic scientific research. Of course, to the tea party Republicans, such talk is heresy.

There is one other fallacy that anti-government conservatives cling to, and they talk about it so much that they have convinced most of the people in the country it is true. That fallacious premise is that President Obama has done nothing to reduce the federal deficit. In fact, the deficit has shrunk as a percentage of GDP every year since Obama took office. Check the numbers. Look it up. We are actually on the right track!

But that will not last long if hundreds of thousands of government workers are furloughed, if military bases are closed, if the air traffic control system is disrupted or if many other important government services are crippled. That will start happening on Friday when the sequester kicks in. If it does, we will have a bunch of deluded deficit hawks to thank for it."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/01/22/GOP-suspends-constitution-in-debt-fight,2013-01-22 00:00:00,['Mike Flynn'],GOP 'Suspends' Constitution in Debt Fight,"In legislation filed yesterday, the House GOP Leadership made an important twist in their plan to pass a short-term increase in the debt ceiling. Rather than increase the debt ceiling by a few hundred billion dollars, buying them time for further talks on the budget, they have opted to “suspend” the debt ceiling. Its a blatant abdication of their constitutional authority. It’s an ominous sign of the talks to come.

Article 1 of the US Constitution gives Congress the exclusive authority to borrow money to fund the government. Up until World War I, Congress would approve every bond issuance. The borrowing demands of the war made this impractical, so Congress authorized a “debt ceiling,” where the government could freely borrow up to a statutory limit and then go back to Congress to approve additional borrowing. Think of it as giving your teenager a pre-paid debit card.

With this measure, the government had more flexibility to manage its affairs while preserving the Constitutional principle that Congress controlled the purse strings.

“Suspending” the debt ceiling until May upends this principle. Upon enactment, the government’s borrowing authority would be unlimited until May. Presumably, the government could borrow trillions in this window, providing either the markets or the Fed would meet the new supply of debt.

Worse, however, is that the GOP move establishes a very slippery precedent. The left has been agitating to simply eliminate the idea of a debt ceiling entirely. For all its flaws, the ceiling at least guarantees we will have some debate about government spending. The left finds this annoying. Unfortunately, the GOP plan to “suspend” the ceiling provides at least partial support to this argument. If we can “suspend” it for three months, why not a year? Once you’ve surrendered the constitutional principle behind the ceiling where and how can you draw a line?

Despite their past history of punting on difficult fiscal issues, I was willing to give the House GOP a skeptical benefit of the doubt on their plan for a short-term lift in the ceiling. The deficit debate has three components, ie. debt ceiling, sequestration, and budget expiration, which happen close to each other, but not simultaneously. It made some strategic sense to weave them together into a single debate.

I assumed, however, that this would entail an increase in the debt ceiling of a few hundred billion dollars, to provide the time to negotiate a longer-term deal. I did not anticipate it would feature the House GOP surrendering its constitutional obligations.

When the GOP took control of the House, they vowed that every piece of legislation would contain specific language citing the constitutional authority for the proposed law. It would be interesting to see their interpretation of the constitutional authority to suspend the document.

(CNN) – The head of the House Republican campaign arm, Rep. Greg Walden, is getting pushback from both his own party and the White House for bucking the party line and saying the president was wrong to include entitlement changes in his budget proposal.

""I've made it clear that I disagree with what Chairman Walden said,"" Boehner said in his weekly press conference on Thursday, referring to the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee.



""I've talked to chairman Walden, and we had a conversation,"" Boehner added. ""We'll leave it at that.""

In an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer, Walden said Wednesday that Obama's budget ""lays out kind of a shocking attack on seniors.""

""And we haven't seen all the detail yet, and we'll look at it, but I'll tell you, when you're going after seniors the way he's already done on ObamaCare, taking $700 billion out of Medicare to put into Obamacare, and now coming back at seniors again, I think you're crossing that line very quickly here in terms of denying access to seniors for health care in districts like mine, certainly, and around the country,"" the congressman from Oregon said.

In the budget, Obama backed a popular measure among Republicans called ""Chained CPI."" The provision measures inflation in a way that would reduce projected federal spending by slowing the growth in federal benefits that are annually adjusted for cost of living. Those include Social Security benefits.

Chained CPI is hotly opposed by liberal Democrats, many of whom are blasting Obama for supporting the measure. Obama's budget also includes $400 billion in cuts from Medicare and other federal health programs.

""I think he's going to have a lot of pushback from some of the major senior organizations on this and Republicans, as well,"" Walden said.

While he's getting scorned from the right, he's also seeing criticism from the left. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney faulted Walden for trying to dismiss a plan advocated by his own party. He argued Walden's comments were simply an example of division within the GOP.

""This is a Republican proposal,"" Carney said Thursday in the daily press briefing. ""And cynical attempts to make it otherwise by some represent, I think, dissonance within the Republican Party, and we've seen plenty of condemnation from conservatives and Republicans of that sort of flagrantly ridiculous and cynical attempt to disown a proposal that emanated from Republican leaders.""

The National Republican Congressional Committee, which Walden chairs, released a statement Thursday stating “Chairman Walden supports the budget passed by House Republicans that preserves and protects Medicare and Social Security while also balancing the budget in 10 years. He disagrees with President Obama’s political plan that hurts current seniors just so he can pay for more wasteful spending.”

Boehner (R-Ohio) took direct aim at some of his tea party critics Thursday, accusing them of working against the interests of the Republican Party.

Calling the groups “misleading” and without “credibility,” Boehner pointed to the string of bipartisan deals that passed the House on its last legislative day of 2013 as the sort of “common ground” that should provide a new path for congressional work.

The House voted 332 to 94 on Thursday night to approve a two-year budget outline that would reduce the chance of another government shutdown and end the cycle of crisis budgeting that has been the scourge of Washington for much of the past three years.

The budget approval was the most prominent accomplishment of a day on which the usually moribund House also passed legislation that would extend the farm bill through January and approved the annual policy bill for the Pentagon.

That collection of legislation will head next week to the Senate, where the budget pact will have to steer a narrow path to victory through concern from GOP defense hawks who oppose a provision in the bill that would reduce military pension benefits.

View Graphic How House members voted on a two-year budget deal

With his assault on outside groups that have opposed him time and again over the past three years, Boehner gave voice to a growing feeling among congressional Republicans that their nominal allies at advocacy groups and think tanks have turned into puritanical partisans whose posture on many issues has undermined the GOP’s standing on Capitol Hill. Boehner’s remarks came amid increasingly strident clashes between establishment Republicans and Washington-based groups that claim the tea party banner, most prominently Heritage Action for America, the Club for Growth and FreedomWorks.

The 16-day federal government shutdown in October, largely orchestrated by groups such as Heritage Action, became a pivot point for many longtime Republican lawmakers to begin pushing back against more conservative newcomers.

The turning point for Boehner — who acknowledged feeling this way for several years — was an effort to sabotage the bipartisan budget deal crafted by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Senate Budget Committee Chairman Patty Murray (D-Wash.).

Ryan, the Republican Party’s 2012 vice presidential nominee, still engenders much respect in all ideological corners of the GOP caucus, and his plan won plaudits from senior Republicans for establishing a two-year framework that many hope will provide evidence that the House GOP is able and willing to govern.

“This is good government, it’s also divided government. And under divided government, we need to take steps in the right direction,” Ryan said on the House floor before the vote.

But those outside groups attacked Ryan for allowing an additional $63 billion in agency spending over the next two years in exchange for savings that come over the next decade.

“Frankly, I think they’re misleading their followers,” Boehner told reporters at his weekly news briefing. “I think they’re pushing our members in places where they don’t want to be. And frankly, I just think that they’ve lost all credibility.”

Hours later, Ryan’s deal won a majority of House GOP votes — 169 for it, 62 against it — unlike every other bipartisan fiscal pact in 2013, most of which barely attracted a third of the Republican caucus.

For the House GOP, the year began with an attempted coup against Boehner by House conservatives in early January and continued with a string of failed votes for the speaker and his leadership team.

Instead of the dysfunction that dominated the year, House Republicans in recent weeks had hoped to better position themselves to negotiate deals with Senate Democrats by passing legislation that was not perfect in the most conservative eyes, but that advanced their cause. But that repositioning has done little to ease tensions in the party.

Conflagrations already have occurred in a Republican primary for a special congressional election in Alabama, and more than half a dozen Senate primaries next year pit mainstream conservatives against those from the far right. Establishment groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have vowed to wade into primaries if it means electing a more traditional, business-friendly Republican.

This week’s clash over the Murray-Ryan budget served as the first big policy contest inside the fractured House Republican Conference since the shutdown. Some conservatives recoiled at both Ryan’s proposal and Boehner’s critique of the outside groups, with the central complaint focusing on the increased funding for federal agencies above certain limits that were part of a 2011 budget deal.

“The more information that gets out about this deal, the harder it is for members to vote yes and go back home and explain that vote,” said Dan Holler, a spokesman for Heritage Action. Holler warned that Boehner will risk the Republican majority if conservative voters “are not going to motivate to turn out in November 2014.”

He described Boehner’s message to conservative voters as, “We use you guys to get elected.”

One of Heritage’s staunchest allies, Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R-Kan.), said he thinks Boehner’s moment of candor was prompted by the belief among some Republicans that he will not run for speaker next term. “I don’t think the speaker’s too worried; the rumor is that he’s not going to be here in a year and a half,” Huelskamp told reporters. “This would match that.”

Boehner has said that he intends to remain speaker and on Monday filed to run for reelection next year in his southwest Ohio district.

The more prominent view among House Republicans was that Ryan’s deal with Murray, while disappointing with just $23 billion in deficit reduction, would make another government shutdown highly unlikely and signals that House Republicans are trying to move beyond the past three years of fiscal brinkmanship they have engaged in with the Obama White House.

The outside groups opposing Ryan — including Heritage Action, the Club for Growth, FreedomWorks and the Senate Conservatives Fund — would instead steer House Republicans onto a familiar path, lurching from crisis to crisis, many House Republicans said.

“It's not helpful for them to say that that’s completely unacceptable. What would they like? Another government shutdown? If that’s what they want, they should run for Congress,” said Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. Issa called his view “absolutely a majority of the majority.”

The battle has left some Republicans conflicted. On Wednesday, Rep. Steve Scalise (La.), chairman of the Republican Study Committee, an influential conservative caucus, fired the organization’s longtime top staffer because he was secretly collaborating with the outside groups trying to pressure Republicans to oppose Ryan’s deal. Scalise said the aide had lost the trust of lawmakers by working against their positions, but on Thursday he said that he still appreciates the help that Heritage Action and others provide in supporting conservative causes.

“I’m not sure what the speaker’s thought process is. Look, outside groups have an important role to play in this process. I support what they do and their role in the process,” he said.

Boehner, however, turned his normally staid weekly news briefing into a moment of political theater, unmatched in his speakership. Fed up after holding his tongue for three years, he lashed out in a fashion that was reminiscent of Warren Beatty’s character in the movie “Bulworth,” about a Democratic senator who lashes out at the influence of outside special interests in politics.

On Wednesday, Boehner issued a brief aside, accusing Heritage Action and others of “using” younger, less experienced GOP lawmakers. On Thursday, he delivered a more expansive critique, acknowledging that he felt pushed.

“It’s just that, you know, there just comes to a point when some people step over the line,” he said. “You know, when you criticize something and you have no idea what you’re criticizing, it undermines your credibility.”

Then he smiled and added, “Have a merry Christmas.”"
http://news.yahoo.com/obama-fundraiser-calls-gop-impediment-042548707--politics.html,,[],"Obama, at fundraiser, calls GOP an 'impediment'","SEATTLE (AP) — President Barack Obama sounded a nostalgic personal note Sunday night and offered a rare self-assessment while criticizing congressional Republicans as an ""impediment"" to governing during the start of a West Coast fundraising tour for the Democratic Party.

Obama told donors the sight of Mt. Rainier illuminated by a setting sun was particularly special because it reminded him of his mother, who attended high school in the Seattle area. ""I feel the spirit of my mom,"" he said.

He also attempted to contrast himself with Republicans who control the House of Representatives, saying they are ""more focused on positioning themselves for the next election.""

""I'm not a particularly ideological person,"" he said, adding he still is passionate about giving people a fair shake, about the environment, and working for peace and national security. ""But I'm pretty pragmatic about how we get there.""

Money, star power and Hollywood awaited the president on this trip, which featured a bit of official business, but mostly fundraising for a Democratic Party eager to go on offense after a politically debilitating two months.

Obama arrived Sunday evening in Seattle. He also planned stops in San Francisco and Los Angeles, raising money for House and Senate Democrats as well as the national party.

High-profile events on the schedule include a reception at the home of retired basketball star Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson and his wife, Cookie, in Beverly Hills, Calif., and one at the house of Marta Kauffman, co-creator of television's ""Friends.""

Accompanied by House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California, Obama attended a reception and dinner Sunday at the home of former Microsoft executive Jon Shirley.

Though he professed he was not looking for the defeat of another party, he said the country needs Pelosi to be House speaker again.

The money raised — $32,400 per couple — went to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which benefits House Democrats.

Story continues

""In the year before an election like this, I think the most tangible way that an incumbent president of either party, frankly, can benefit his party's prospects in congressional races is to try to help them raise money,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said earlier. ""And I would anticipate that the president's efforts on that front will continue into next year.""

The trip comes as Obama's health care law approaches a crucial Nov. 30 deadline for an improved insurance enrollment website whose catastrophic start Oct. 1 dealt a serious political blow to the White House. Also, the U.S. and other world powers just sealed a historic deal with Iran for a temporary freeze of its nuclear program.

In addition to a half-dozen fundraisers, Obama intended to use the trip to keep the heat on Congress to pass an overhaul of immigration laws. He planned to address that issue during a stop Monday at a Chinese recreation center in San Francisco, and to promote his economic agenda Tuesday at the DreamWorks Animation studio in Glendale, Calif.

In recent days White House officials have tried to draw attention back to the economy to avoid getting bogged down by the botched launch of the health care enrollment.

Lately, Obama has devoted time to raising money for the party, helping the Democratic National Committee reduce a massive 2012 debt and build up cash for House and Senate Democratic Committees.

The White House has been especially attentive to Senate Democrats to ensure that the party retains its majority in the chamber. The House is controlled by the Republican Party.

In addition to the dinner at Shirley's home, Obama also attended a Democratic National Committee event Sunday at the home of Tom Campion, co-founder of the clothing chain Zumiez. Unlike the dinner at Shirley's house, reporters were not permitted into the fundraiser.

The event attracted about 30 donors, the DNC said. Tickets also were $32,400 per couple, according to an invitation."

The good news is that the ordinary citizens nearby, who are not the press and who are not obligated to treat Randy Neugebauer Being An Asshole as quite literally just another day at the park, came to the Ranger's defense.



At that point, a crowd of onlookers got involved. ""Ask those questions of the people who aren't passing the budget,"" shouted a voice from the crowd. ""That's who you need to ask these questions to."" ""This woman is doing her job, just like me,"" shouted another. ""I'm a 30-year federal veteran -- I'm out of work.""

Rep. Neugebauer protested a bit, then quickly ran off to buy himself an even bigger flag for his pocket. Good God, man, just get out.

""There are no winners here.""



But according to a study conducted by the conservative Media Research Center, there was a clear loser presented to the more than 20 million viewers who tuned in to the evening newscasts of the three major television networks during the shutdown: the GOP.



""What those viewers heard,"" according to the MRC analysis, ""was a version of the shutdown story that could easily have emanated from Barack Obama’s own White House.""



“This current government shutdown traces its history back to a determined core of GOP House members who are vehemently against Obamacare and were willing to shut down the government because of it,” Brian Williams said on the Oct. 14 broadcast of ""NBC Nightly News,"" MRC's Rich Noyes noted in a blog post announcing the study.



Of the 124 stories broadcast on the ABC, NBC and CBS nightly newscasts about the shutdown from Oct. 1 through Oct. 15, the study found 41 blamed Republicans or conservatives for the impasse, 17 blamed both sides and none specifically blamed Democrats.



In the two weeks leading up to the shutdown, the MRC said, the same networks ran 21 stories blaming Republicans, four blaming both sides and none blaming Democrats.



That's 62 blaming Republicans and none blaming Democrats for those of you keeping score at home.



But those numbers mirror polls conducted before and during the shutdown, which found most Americans blamed the GOP for the shutdown. In one, 62 percent of respondents blamed Republicans for the shutdown, while less than half blamed Obama or the Democrats in Congress.



According to TruthRevolt.org, another conservative site, the slant against the GOP was equally evident in print. The Washington Post and New York Times, the site said, ""covered victims of the government shutdown over victims of Obamacare by a margin of 100 to 1.""



Media Matters, the progressive research center that monitors conservative media, has yet to publish a similar study on the shutdown coverage.



The MRC study did not include cable news, which had mostly wall-to-wall coverage of the shutdown since it began on Oct. 1. CNN, for example, ran on-screen shutdown and debt ceiling deadline clocks for virtually the entire impasse and consistently featured interviews with moderate Republicans who disagreed with the tea party's tactic.



""I know you have the counter on your screen right now that talks about how many hours we've been in the shutdown,"" Republican Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann, a tea party conservative, said on CNN on Oct. 10. ""I would suggest that CNN also put up a counter of the debt clock, about how quickly we're accumulating debt. It's frightening when people see how fast that's accumulating.""



Fox News' approach to covering the shutdown, on the other hand, was to pretend it wasn't a shutdown at all. According to the cable news network, it was more of a ""slimdown.""



The MRC study also did not look at Sunday morning talk shows, which have featured a parade of congressional lawmakers arguing for and against the shutdown in recent weeks.



On CBS on Thursday morning, “Face the Nation” anchor Bob Schieffer declared Obama the clear winner in the shutdown.



“The president won this thing,” Schieffer said."

The advantages and responsibilities of world leadership was in our hands. We built on the New Deal to strengthen the middle class with Social Security and Medicare and then focused on human rights with the Civil Rights Act. Then in 1981 came the Reagan revolution. And in a symbolic act President Reagan took down the solar panels which had been installed on the Carter White House. This act symbolized that new guys were in town and it also meant that government was being pushed out of the way for business to take its place as the rightful representative of the American people.

That was about the same time that understanding about our species' contribution to climate warming was being discussed in the global scientific community. It was already recognized that our industrial consumption based on fossil fuels was the leading cause of our atmospheric pollution. It was also recognized that global warming would require a global response, with nations working together to advance and implement solutions. Our global economic and political leadership placed us in a position of responsibility to the global challenge of climate change; but here is where we abdicated our global leadership responsibility and the Republican ideology of laissez faire collided with the needed response to our changing climate.



In the over 30 years of Republican political dominance, the evidence of anthropogenic climate change has only strengthened to the point that 97 percent of credible climate scientists support the overwhelming evidence of human caused climate change. Yet over that time the Republican/conservative response has been to use its power to misinform and to obstruct any progress to mitigate. The Republican political leaders have taken the side of their business buddies —the fossil fuel industry, who have rewarded them with obnoxious sums of money for their support which has assured them of unrivaled control of the energy market. In the 112th GOP-controlled congress alone there have been 317 votes taken against the environment.

The cost of this obstruction and misinformation? It increasingly looks like the cost the world will be paying for this idiotic political malfeasance is a safe future for our children and grandchildren. We have lost too much time in implementing solutions and already many in the world especially the most vulnerable are on the road to mass suffering and hunger.

Republicans: The blood is on your hands.

Michele Bachmann, with her toothy grin and startling wide-eyed stare, is especially adept at this.

The other day, the queen of the House tea party was standing before the TV cameras at the World War II Memorial with her arm around a frail-looking veteran of that war. A group of ancient vets had come to the capital for an event at the memorial only to find they couldn’t get in because of the government shutdown. Bachmann fawned over the elderly man while telling reporters how utterly shameful it was for President Obama to lock out these venerable old soldiers. The shutdown was the president’s fault, she said; he was to blame for inflicting so much unnecessary inconvenience and pain.

This is the same woman who has been absolutely giddy in other interviews talking about how “very excited” she and her colleagues are, as if the shutdown is the best thing since Jesus turned water into wine. “It’s exactly what we wanted, and we got it,” Bachmann said to the Washington Post.

On Sunday, House Speaker John A. Boehner was acting like a jilted girlfriend in an interview with George Stephanopoulos on ABC. Boehner insisted Obama’s refusal to give him a phone call is the reason government offices remain shuttered. Boehner, of course, could end the impasse all by himself simply by allowing a vote on the Senate-passed continuing resolution to fund the government. It would easily get thumbs-up from Democrats and a significant share of Republican House members, but letting that happen would earn Boehner major grief, not only from the radicals in his caucus, but from the rich conservative money men who spearheaded the drive for this showdown.

And that is the highly pertinent fact that Boehner, Bachmann and the rest of the Republicans conveniently fail to mention. As detailed in a Sunday New York Times story, a well-financed cohort of conservative activists have been planning for months to use a government shutdown as a cudgel to cripple the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Among those behind the effort are, predictably, the Koch brothers, the right-wing billionaire industrialists who, the newspaper reports, gave out $200 million last year to anti-Obamacare groups. Another key leader is a figure from the dark past, Ronald Reagan’s former attorney general, Edwin Meese III.

Also pushing the Obamacare battle is Michael A. Needham, who runs the political arm of the conservative Heritage Foundation. Unlike Bachmann and her buddies, Needham did not play coy when asked about what is going on, telling the New York Times, “We felt very strongly from the start that this was a fight that we were going to pick.”

And it’s the fight they got. Republicans should stop feigning innocence and be brave enough to own it.

[For the record, 2:51 p.m. Oct. 8: An earlier version of this post referred to Edwin Meese III as Richard Nixon’s former attorney general. He was attorney general under Ronald Reagan.]"
http://news.yahoo.com/pentagon-most-furloughed-civilians-ordered-back-175149741--politics.html,,[],Pentagon: Most furloughed civilians ordered back,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Pentagon is bringing back to work at least 90 percent of the estimated 350,000 defense civilian employees who were furloughed in the partial government shutdown. The move takes a big bite out of the impact of the political impasse in Washington that has left the government without a budget.

The decision announced Saturday by Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel is based on a Pentagon interpretation of a law called the Pay Our Military Act. That measure was passed by Congress and signed by President Barack Obama shortly before the partial government shutdown began Tuesday.

Republican lawmakers had complained in recent days that the Obama administration was slow to bring back those workers even though the law allowed it.

In a written statement explaining his action, Hagel said the Justice Department advised that the law does not permit a blanket recall of all Pentagon civilians. But government attorneys concluded that the law does allow the Pentagon to eliminate furloughs for ""employees whose responsibilities contribute to the morale, well-being, capabilities and readiness of service members.""

Hagel said he has told Pentagon officials, including leaders of the military services, to ""identify all employees whose activities fall under these categories."" He said civilian workers should stand by for further word this weekend.

In remarks to reporters, Robert Hale, the Pentagon's budget chief, said he did not yet know the exact number of civilians who would be brought back to work but that it would be ""90 percent plus."" He said there are about 350,000 civilians on furlough, somewhat fewer than the 400,000 that officials had previously indicated. If 90 percent were recalled that would mean 315,000 coming off furlough.

Hale said that even with this relief, the effect of the furloughs has been severe.

""We've seriously harmed civilian morale; this (recall) will be a start back,"" he said.

Hale said he hoped that a ""substantial number"" could be returned to work on Monday but that an exact timetable is not available.

Story continues

Hagel had made clear earlier in the past week that Pentagon lawyers were trying to determine ways for some of the Defense Department's furloughed civilians to get back to work.

""It does have an effect on our relationships around the world and it cuts straight to the obvious question,"" he told reporters traveling with him Tuesday in South Korea. ""Can you rely on the United States as a reliable partner to fulfill its commitments to its allies?""

The law ensured that members of the military, who have remained at work throughout the shutdown, would be paid on time. It also left room for the Pentagon to keep on the job those civilians who provide support to the military."

It may seem like a minor hiccup, or a symbolic failure. But it spells doom for the party’s near-term budget strategy and underscores just how bogus the party’s broader agenda really is and has been for the last four years.

But none of these are excuses for failure. Presidential leadership (or the lack of it) still makes an enormous difference.

What if I told you this big government giveaway would destroy years of hard-won fiscal responsibility, resulting in a ""lost decade for jobs"" as we fought two wars and expanded the government in unprecedented, unfunded ways? And after this $1.3 trillion boondoggle fueled skyrocketing inequality and blasted a gaping hole in the budget we would be left with a once-in-a-half-century financial crisis that would leave America borrowing more than a trillion dollars a year?

You might say, ""Boycott the Bush tax cuts!""

But Republicans would call you a crazy, un-American, ACORN-suckling, Sharia trial lawyer, communistic, socialistic, fascistic, Maoistic, son-of-a-Saul Alinsky. Who would turn down a tax break? That's our money, libtard. GIVE IT BACK.

“There was a betrayal.”

“Disappointing and disgusting.”

“It’s inexcusable.”

“Failed that most basic test of public service.”

And this was coming from the Republicans.

The spark: Boehner’s last-minute decision to let the 112th Congress fade into history without a vote on the $60 billion Hurricane Sandy relief package for the Northeast. In a sense, this was an outrage, because such recovery bills traditionally pass without a fuss. But in another sense, it followed a familiar script: Tea party Republicans balked at taking up the spending bill (it had enough votes to pass), and because the tea party rules the House GOP, Boehner obeyed rather than risk his reelection as speaker on Thursday.

The Sandy sidestep provided a perfect coda for the first two years of this Republican-controlled House, which only by a loose definition can still be called a legislative body.Lawmakers in both parties are congratulating themselves for passing a bill to avoid the “fiscal cliff,” but they did little more than approve a short-term fix that postpones the standoff 60 days. Ominously, even this stopgap measure failed to win the votes of two-thirds of House Republicans, including top Boehner lieutenants Eric Cantor and Kevin McCarthy, who preferred to risk economic calamity.

The House GOP’s antics on the fiscal cliff leave little optimism that lawmakers will be reasonable when it comes to more substantial issues such as restructuring entitlements, rewriting the tax code and reducing the debt. The fury over the Sandy sidestep could be a sign, though, that even some House Republicans are tiring of the tea party’s dominance of their caucus.

Various Republicans, mostly from the Sandy-soaked Northeast, went to the House floor Wednesday morning to join Democrats in denouncing Boehner’s decision.

First came Rep. Michael Grimm, whose New York district was pummeled by the storm. The GOP leadership’s “error in judgment is going to cost, I think, the trust of the American people,” he said. Offering a “heartfelt apology” to his constituents for the House’s inaction, he warned that “to delay this vote even for another day is something that will resonate . . . with the American people for a long time.”

It certainly will resonate with voters in the Northeast, where Republicans such as Grimm are an endangered species. But even some from outside the region didn’t like the message the party was sending.

Rep. Robert Dold of Illinois — who, like Grimm, came to Congress in the tea party wave of 2010 — reminded his colleagues that although “the federal government should play as little role as possible in the lives of Americans, they do need to play a role.” Dold, who lost his reelection bid, warned that “we’re anchoring to the extremes as opposed to coming to the center.”

Rep. Tom Reed, whose Upstate New York district wasn’t hurt by the hurricane, tried to reason with his fellow conservatives: “There is not a better purpose of the federal government than for the federal government to stand with our citizens when they are suffering the most.”

And Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.), reminding conservatives that New York and New Jersey pay more in taxes than they receive from the federal government, made an emotional appeal for Boehner to reconsider. “Nature pulled the rug out from under people,” he said, and “now Congress is going to pull the rug out.” [UPDATE: This quote was uttered by the person who spoke just after Smith, minority leader Nancy Pelosi. It was the rare day in Congress when Smith and Pelosi were on the same side of an issue.]

But it was Rep. Peter King, a Long Island Republican and chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, who delivered the harshest denunciation of Boehner’s leadership and of “a strain in the Republican Party,” which, he said, has a bias against the Northeast.

“I can’t imagine that type of indifference, that type of disregard, that type of cavalier attitude being shown to any other part of the country,” he said.

Accusing Boehner of ignoring “real life-and-death situations,” King thundered: “This should not be the Republican Party. This should not be the Republican leadership.”

[UPDATE: As of Thursday morning, King pronounced that he had been mollified.]

Off the floor, the furious lawmaker hinted in a CNN interview that he might bolt the GOP, saying that anyone in New York or New Jersey who gives money to the House Republican campaign effort “should have their head examined.”

“People in my party, they wonder why they’re becoming a minority party,” he continued. “They’ve written me off and they’re going to have a hard time getting my vote.”

A few more brave voices such as King’s could save the party from itself.

Though Hull did not specifically name IRS Chief Counsel William J. Wilkins as the person who ordered him to send Tea Party group applications to his office “for further review,” Hull’s testimony brought the Obama political appointee to the forefront in the ever expanding scandal.

On July 18, Hull testified that in March 2011 Judy Kindell, a senior technical advisor to Lois Lerner, then the head of the IRS tax exempt division, “told me to forward my recommendations [concerning the approval of Tea Party group applications for tax exempt status] to the Office of Chief Counsel for their review.”

Hull was asked if Ms. Kindell agreed with his earlier recommendations that the IRS had sufficient information at that time to make a determination on the Tea Party groups applications for tax-exempt status.

“She did not say whether she agreed or not. She said it should go to chief counsel,” Hull told the committee.

On Tuesday the connection between Wilkins and the White House was strengthened when several media outlets reported that Wilkins met with the President at the White House on April 23, 2012, just two days before the IRS issued a revised set of BOLO (“Be on the lookout”) instructions to IRS agents reviewing tax-exempt applications that appear to target Tea Party groups for more stringent review standards.

Also on Tuesday, True the Vote, a Tea Party group that focuses on preventing voter fraud and was one of the groups subjected to IRS targeting, announced that it is suing Mr. Wilkins, adding him to the list of defendants in the lawsuit it filed against the IRS in May of this year.

Wilkins, a graduate of Yale University and Harvard Law School, has been a partner with Wilmer, Cutler, Pickering, Hale, and Door (also known as WilmerHale), the prestigious Washington, D.C. law firm, since 1988. According to Federal Election Commission records, Mr. Wilkins has donated generously to political candidates over the years, most of them affiliated with the Democratic Party. In 2008 he represented Reverend Jeremiah Wright’s Chicago church, the one which President Obama attended for twenty years, on a pro bono basis before the IRS. President Obama named him Chief Counsel at the IRS in April, 2009.

Steny Hoyer: ""There does not seem to be a serious effort to reach agreement"" A 29-person House and Senate conference committee is tasked with hashing out budget A lack of confidence in the process has moved into higher gear Republicans in D.C. are mindful they took the brunt of the blame in last shutdown

(CNN) —

Hovering above Congress with the unpleasant scent of deja vu are concerns that current budget talks seem poised to fail and that the word “shutdown” is back on the rise.

First, there’s the apparent budget impasse.

“There does not seem to be a serious effort to reach agreement in the budget conference,” House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland told reporters on Tuesday.

The “budget conference” is the 29-person House and Senate conference committee tasked with hashing out basic budget parameters, including total spending for the next two years. They have until December 13 to come up with a deal.

“Many of us are skeptics there ever will be (a deal),” said Sen. John Thune, R-South Dakota, adding he is confident that the leaders of the budget conference, Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, and Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington, are doing their best.

Battle for the House in 2014: Obamacare vs. shutdown

Personal thoughts about the leaders aside, a lack of confidence in the process has moved into higher gear this week.

On Monday, the 13 top Republicans on the House Appropriations Committee sent Ryan and Murray a letter expressing concern and urging them to at least come up with a topline figure for spending so that appropriators could then start writing the bills that actually spend the money.

The lawmakers behind that letter are worried that they won’t have time to write and pass appropriation bills before January 15, when government funding is set to run out.

They didn’t mince words in the letter: “The failure to reach a budget deal to allow Appropriations to assemble funding… will reopen the specter of another government shutdown.”

“We need that (spending figure),” said Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Virginia, who signed the letter. “It will probably take a good month (to write the spending bills).”

Shutdown cometh? Some aren’t worried; others are

Frank, like most Republicans with whom CNN spoke, does not believe a shutdown is likely in January. Even without a budget conference deal, the House and Senate could pass simple continuing resolutions to keep government funded.

Appropriators don’t want that because it would trigger blunt, across-the-board budget cuts and block any chance to tailor the cuts agency by agency.

So the lack of a budget deal does not mean a shutdown will happen, but nonetheless, murmurs of shutdown politics are emerging. Wolf and other Republicans are concerned that the mantle of a shutdown, or any threat of one, could again harm their party.

“We probably lost the governor’s race and attorney general’s race in Virginia because of the shutdown,” he said, shaking his head. Polling after the shutdown but before the Virginia elections showed Republicans were more tarnished by the fiscal fight. In a CNN/ORC poll, 52% said Republicans in Congress were more responsible for the shutdown compared with President Barack Obama’s 34%.

Democrats are clearly teeing up the connection between Republicans and another shutdown.

“I think Paul Ryan ought to put a serious proposal on the table,” said Democratic Whip Hoyer. “Paul Ryan ought to lead, not follow his caucus down a road which would lead to shutdown.”

“No one’s talking about a shutdown except for Democrats,” responded Donald Stewart, spokesman for Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell. “Everything they’re doing now is to get them away from the pain and problems of Obamacare, of course they want to talk about something else.”

All of this political debris is again swirling in large part because of the absence of clear progress from Ryan and Murray’s budget conference talks.

The two budget committee chairs and their staff have made pragmatic but hopeful statements in public. Aides from both parties tell CNN the two leaders have been in frequent contact and had face-to-face meetings. But their public words on the matter are few. On Wednesday, Ryan repeatedly donned headphones and holding his hand up as if to say “no comment” on Tuesday.

Budget staffers from both chambers point out that the less that negotiators say during talks, traditionally, the closer they are to a deal. But in this case, the wild politics involved lead many to question whether it’s in Ryan’s interest to cut a deal.

Senate leader pays a House call

Perhaps the most significant sign of concern came from a rare cross-Capitol visit Tuesday when McConnell spoke to a closed-door meeting of the House GOP Conference. According to multiple sources in the room, McConnell talked about the upcoming funding deadlines and made it clear that he wants the overall budget reduction slated for January to go into place.

McConnell’s visit was unusual, one of just a handful he’s made to House conference in his six years as Republican leader. In general, he has a reputation as a practical fiscal negotiator who aims to avoid crisis. He and Vice President Joe Biden were among the final negotiators during the fiscal cliff fight of 2011 and 2012. And in October, Democrats and others pointed to McConnell’s role as critical in ending the shutdown.

His decision to start talking with House Republicans about the January shutdown deadline now is significant.

Meantime, the budget conference committee has a timing problem. The group technically has three weeks on the calendar to hash out a deal. But in reality, Congress leaves at the end of the week for Thanksgiving and after it returns, members will have just eight days in session before that December 13 deadline.

If they miss that deadline, then Congress could go home for Christmas with no plan for how to keep government funded past January 15. Lawmakers would return January 7 and have a week to decide.

Tea Party-aligned groups challenge the farm bill as lawmakers work to hammer out a compromise

Fight highlights feud in Republican Party between business interests and activist wing

Some conservatives want deeper cuts to food stamps

WASHINGTON — In the aftermath of the partial government shutdown, some Tea Party-aligned groups that helped push a conservative revolt in Congress over President Obama's health care law are readying for Round 2.

Their top target: the sweeping legislation that will set federal farm policy for years to come. Next week, a group of lawmakers will meet to begin hashing out differences between the Senate and House versions of the farm bill. Conservative groups, such as Heritage Action for America, are lobbying to jettison any compromise, saying neither version does enough to slash taxpayer subsidies to agribusiness.

""You are using taxpayer money to subsidize industries that are making record profits,"" said Dan Holler of Heritage Action. His group is urging lawmakers to approve a one-year extension of existing farm policies rather ""than locking in bad law for another three to five years,"" he said.

The latest confrontation over the farm measure underscores the rift between the pro-small-government Tea Party faction of the Republican Party and the business community. Grassroots Tea Party activists, whose opposition to the health care law helped fuel the budget fight that led to a 16-day partial government shutdown this month, say they won't back down from efforts to reduce government spending and will make their displeasure known in next year's midterm elections.

""We think gridlock is a good thing,"" said Diane Cox, a Tea Party activist from Valdosta, Ga., who is one of 6,000 Heritage Action ""sentinels"" who pushed to defund the Affordable Care Act and is closely watching developments on the farm bill. ""It's called the balance of powers.""

""I don't think politicians understand that we are serious about stopping wasteful government spending,"" said Cox, 68. ""We are going to have to bring a few more of them home.""

Already this year, skirmishes over spending have delayed efforts to complete a new, five-year farm law, now more than a year overdue. In the past, farm bills enjoyed bipartisan support, in part because the measures paired pro-farm policies with continued support for food stamps, guaranteeing ""yes"" votes from lawmakers representing both rural and urban areas.

After rejecting an earlier version of the farm bill in June, the GOP-led House broke the legislation into two pieces, first approving a chunk that dealt with farm subsidies along with other agriculture policies and then passing the food-stamp portion. The House-passed bill cuts food stamps by roughly $40 billion during the next decade, dropping benefits to 3 million people.

The Senate measure cuts far less from food stamps — about $4 billion over 10 years.

Both versions eliminate $5 billion in subsidies known as ""direct payments"" to farmers, long criticized because they pay certain types of farmers the same amount each year regardless of need or whether they plant crops.

Conservative advocacy groups want more. They are challenging an array of provisions, including taxpayer-funded subsidies for crop insurance.

""If you are a Republican and you say social welfare programs are wasteful, you are hypocritical if you turn around and give subsidies to corporations,"" said Tim Phillips, president of Americans for Prosperity, a group backed by the billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch.

The group was not among those that urged lawmakers to defund Obamacare during the recent budget showdown, but it has made repealing the health care law among its top priorities. The group also wants deeper cuts to the food stamp program, which has grown dramatically. More than 47 million people now receive food stamps, up from 21 million a decade earlier.

Mary Kay Thatcher, a lobbyist for the American Farm Bureau, said the House and Senate measures contain ""significant reform.""

""The elimination of direct payments is a big deal,"" she said. ""It might not be enough reform for Heritage, but it's real reform.""

She said the measure has drawn conservative attention, in part, because so few bills have any chance of winning approval in a gridlocked Congress. ""You have more Tea Party members in the House,"" she said. ""There are more reformers, and they want to reform whatever comes along.""

What happens next will be a test of the clout of the Tea Party, derided by the party establishment for helping to engineer a budget showdown that shuttered parts of the government and threatened a debt default without winning any significant concessions on the health care law.

So far, top Republicans and Democrats on the agriculture panel appear eager to move forward on a compromise. Last week, President Obama said the farm bill was one of three priorities for Congress to resolve before year's end. The others are a budget agreement and an overhaul of the nation's immigration system.

Even as they sound alarms on the farm measure, conservative advocacy groups say they do not plan to retreat from efforts to dismantle the health care law. FreedomWorks, another Tea Party-aligned group, wants to force lawmakers to vote on a measure that would eliminate the employer contribution on health care for members of Congress and is urging more votes on measures that would delay the health law's mandate that uninsured Americans buy health insurance starting next year or pay a fine.

On Wednesday, meanwhile, Americans for Prosperity launched a $2 million advertising campaign highlighting four vulnerable House members over their votes on the health care law. It also is working to keep states from expanding Medicare, the government's health-insurance system for the poor.

""Repealing Obamacare is a long-term effort,"" Phillips said."

[Washington Post Reporter Dan] Balz tried to point this out: ""But when you said there are 47 percent who won't take personal responsibility—."" Romney interrupted: ""Actually, I didn’t say that... That's how it began to be perceived, and so I had to ultimately respond to the perception, because perception is reality.""

There are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the president no matter what. All right, there are 47 percent who are with him, who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it. That that's an entitlement. And the government should give it to them. And they will vote for this president no matter what… These are people who pay no income tax. [...] My job is is not to worry about those people. I'll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.

So I saw this tweet from David Corn......and I thought to myself, ""No way! Not even Mitt Romney could say something that dumb."" But David Corn is the guy who broke the whole 47 percent thing in the first place, so I clicked. And sure enough: Gee, Mitt, where could that perception possibly have come from? Perhaps the simple fact that it's exactly what you said?It'd be one thing if Mitt Romney apologized for his comments—or if he defended them. But pretending that he never even said them in the first place? That's like saying that not only does he believe 47 percent of Americans are lazy freeloaders who refuse to take personal responsibility for themselves, they—along with the rest of Americans—are stupid idiots who would trust Romney's revisionism over their lying eyes. Well, in this case eyes and ears."

There are consequences%2C but not for them.

People who are to blame lose their jobs. People who are %22responsible%2C%22 do not.

I%27d favor some changes that put accountability back in.

As scandals explode across Washington -- from the IRS scandals, to the Benghazi scandal, to the HHS donations scandal, to Pigford and more -- one thing that I've noticed is that the people involved don't seem to suffer much. There are consequences, but not for them. Likewise, Rep. Anthony Weiner, D-N.Y., left office in disgrace, but wound up with surprisingly lucrative consulting gigs.

This reminds me of something writer Robert Heinlein once said: ""Any government will work if authority and responsibility are equal and coordinate. This does not ensure 'good' government, it simply ensures that it will work. But such governments are rare — most people want to run things, but want no part of the blame. This used to be called the 'backseat driver' syndrome.""

Government officials are happy making and executing plans that affect the lives of millions, but when things go wrong, well ... they're willing to accept the responsibility, but they're not willing to take the blame. What's the difference? People who are to blame lose their jobs. People who are ""responsible,"" do not. The blame, such as it is, winds up deflected on to The System, or something else suitably abstract.

But when you cut the linkage between outcomes and experience, you make learning much more difficult. When you were a toddler learning to walk, you fell down a lot. This was unpleasant: shocking, at least, and often painful. Thus, you learned to fall down a lot less often.

But imagine if falling down didn't hurt. You wouldn't have learned not to fall, or at least, you would have accumulated a lot more bruises along the way.

Given the low penalties for failure it faces, our political class is one for whom falling down is usually painless and even -- given the surprisingly common tendency of people who have presided over debacles to be given promotions rather than the boot -- actually pleasurable. The leaders move society's arms and legs, but we're the ones who collect the bruises.

The problem is that they don't have, in President Obama's words, ""skin in the game."" When it comes to actual wrongdoing, they're shielded by doctrines of ""absolute immunity"" (for the president) and ""qualified immunity"" (for lesser officials). This means that the president can't be sued for anything he does as president, while lower-ranking officials can't be sued so long as they can show that they were acting in a ""good faith"" belief that they were following the law.

Such defenses aren't available to the rest of us. And they're not even the product of legislation passed by Congress after considered judgment -- they're judicially created. (Judges gave themselves absolute immunity, too, for good measure.)

Then, of course, there's the unfortunate fact that the worse the economy does, the more important the government becomes. As Tim Noah pointed out back when the financial crisis was new, ""On Wall Street, financial crisis destroys jobs. Here in Washington, it creates them. The rest is just details.""

Some incentive system. And yet they want us to trust them to ""fix the economy."" My worry is that their idea of ""fixed"" may not be the same as mine.

I'd favor some changes that put accountability back in. First, I'd get rid of judicially created immunities. The Constitution itself creates only one kind of immunity, for members of Congress in speech and debate. (Perhaps unsurprisingly, courts have interpreted this grant of immunity, explicitly in the Constitution, more narrowly than the judicially created ones).

I'd also cut all payments to members of Congress whenever they haven't passed a budget. If they can't take care of that basic responsibility, why should they get paid? Likewise, I'd ban presidential travel when there's not a budget. He can do his job from the White House.

I'm willing to consider other changes: Term limits that kick in whenever there's a deficit for more than two years in a row. Limitations on civil-service protections to allow wronged citizens to get offending bureaucrats fired. Pay cuts for elected officials whenever inflation or unemployment are above a threshold.

But the real lesson is this: We entrust an inordinate amount of power to people who don't feel any pain when we fall down. The best solution of all is to take a lot of that power back. When the power is in your hands, it's in the hands of someone who feels it when you fall down. When it's in their hands, it's your pain, their gain. That's no way to run a country.

The US government has begun a partial shutdown after the two houses of Congress failed to agree a new budget.

The Republican-led House of Representatives insisted on delaying President Barack Obama's healthcare reform - dubbed Obamacare - as a condition for passing a bill.

More than 800,000 federal employees face unpaid leave with no guarantee of back pay once the deadlock is over, as certain agencies and national parks also close.

Under the US presidential system, different branches of government can be controlled by opposing parties. Currently the Senate is controlled by the Democrats, while the Republicans control the House of Representatives.

This legislative conflict has led to the current gridlock and subsequent partial shutdown of government, the first for 17 years.

With the US political system seemingly in legislative paralysis, is American politics broken? Experts give their views below.

Darrell M West, vice president of Governance Studies at the Brookings Institution

The problem with American politics is that Tea Party activists have taken over the Republican Party.

They come from small, rural districts and now are demanding that House Speaker John Boehner practises extremist politics.

Boehner could end this stalemate today by allowing a continuing resolution to go to the floor for a vote without repealing Obamacare. It would pass and this crisis would be resolved.

However, conservatives have warned that if Mr Boehner allows a floor vote without their support, they will depose him and elect another Speaker.

This crisis is not so much a governability problem as a war within the Republican Party. It won't be resolved until prominent Republicans demand that the House takes action.

Prof Iwan Morgan, head of US Programmes at the Institute of the Americas, University College London

""Broken"" is a very strong word. In one way American politics is working exactly how the founding fathers intended when they created the separation of powers.

But they always assumed that at times of need, the ""energy"" of government would overcome the separation of government. They never anticipated that there would be this polarisation of politics.

We're now in a situation where the intentions of the founders are being overcome by the nature of the political parties and the lack of middle ground between them, so you could say American politics is broken.

I don't think it's irreparable but you now have to have a supermajority [60 out of 100] in the Senate [to pass legislation], and the Republicans showed in 2009-10 how the lack of 60 Democrats in the Senate could be exploited to tie up the work of the upper house.

I don't imagine the Democrats will lie down and play dead even were the Republicans to become the single party of government in 2016.

Angelia R Wilson, professor of politics at the University of Manchester

Charges that America is broken are a longstanding trope of the US Christian Right. Such charges harken back to a fictitious 1950s shared cultural values.

Employing this measure, changes of the last 60 years indicate that American is ""broken"". But that fictitious narrative fails to include those on the socio-economic margins eg women, African-Americans, Latinos, and LGBTs, who are now moving at pace into the mainstream.

For these benefactors of change, America is not broken - it is increasingly realising its potential as a representative democracy based on justice and equality.

Change has left those previously occupying places of privilege outraged.

With more states allowing same-sex marriage, the working class accessing affordable healthcare, immigration reform afoot and a black man in the White House, the Tea Party has had enough. This government shutdown is not the culmination of their outrage, it is only a beginning.

Chris Edwards, editor of the Cato Institute's website DownsizingGovernment.org

There's no doubt that the federal budget process is broken, and there is wide acceptance of that. The federal budget system doesn't work. Congress hasn't passed a regular budget in many years now, [instead] they've appropriated money based on continuing resolutions and other special procedures.

The instability caused by the Obamacare health law is because it was passed in 2010 on a wholly partisan basis. Not a single Republican voted for the law in either the House or the Senate.

In recent decades the most enduring federal legislation has been bipartisan. So I would blame President Obama for ramming through legislation that only his party supported.

The battle over Obamacare is unique and has been poisoned, initially by President Obama.

That said, it used to be that both parties had both liberal and conservatives. But over the last few decades the Republican Party has become more conservative and the Democratic Party has moved far to the left.

Prof Stefan Halper, director of American studies at the University of Cambridge

In the UK, where you have a parliamentary system, if the prime minister's party loses a floor vote in parliament you have to have a new election - it's a vote of no confidence.

In the US, we have a situation where the administration's proposed policies can be blockaded by a minority in either House of Congress - and that can bring the government to a standstill.

The unusual thing in this case is that this radical faction, the Tea Party, have chosen to use the national budget [and] are demanding that the healthcare programme be modified or abandoned in return for funding government.

It's a form of political extortion.

It is broadly unacceptable to the American people, and the Tea Party will be hurt by it.

The system is stretched, the system is challenged. But the system itself is not broken. Eventually public pressure will come to play on the Republicans and will force them to accept some compromise solution. Both sides must find a face-saving way through this conundrum.

The House Speaker, Mr Boehner, has chosen not to confront the radical minority in his party, but rather to accommodate them.

A stronger or more principled House leader would've said ""enough is enough"". But he hasn't done that. So another reason the system is not broken is because it is a personality in a critical position who is not doing his job properly.

Hans A von Spakovsky, manager of the Election Law Reform Initiative at the Heritage Foundation

I don't think the system is broken, the system works. The problem right now is that the two political parties, who are fairly evenly matched in political support across the country, are having a crucial argument about the direction of the country.

This is not unusual; there have been prior times in American history where there have been substantive and critical fights over different issues.

We have an out of control federal budget, we have a gigantic deficit, and we're having a critical debate over what to do about those problems.

I don't think there is a serious structural problem in the US political system, we've just come to a fork in the road about the direction that the country should move in. The system is handling it, we're just at loggerheads over what to do about it - in particular where we should go with the growth and size of the federal government.

John E Owens, professor of US government and politics at University of Westminster

The [shutdown] goes to the basic structural problem in the US constitution.

It's a separated system with separate institutions sharing in power, so that means that each of the major institutions of national government can exercise a veto against any decision they don't like - and that's exactly what's happening.

Historically compromise has usually been available. [But] now you have an extremist group in the Republican Party holding the system to ransom.

What you have seen over the last 20 years in Congress is a kind of procedural arms race, and this is the latest example of it - one party, and it's usually the Republicans, finding some procedural device, [and] attaching this rider to a resolution to throw a spanner in the works and stop the government working."
http://news.yahoo.com/john-boehner-voters-8th-congressional-district-162828908.html,,[],"Embattled in the House, John Boehner draws mostly sympathy, support back home","John Boehner’s 8th Congressional District is a jigsawed chunk of southwestern Ohio that hugs the Indiana border to the west and runs north along Highway 127 from Hamilton through Eaton and Greenville before jutting east to Springfield. Significantly farmland — its largest cities are Hamilton with 62,447 residents, and Springfield with 60,608 — it eschews the Cincinnati and Dayton metro areas, and it provides an incumbent like Boehner plenty of political flexibility for his stances in Congress and re-election bids back home.

According to 2012 data from the Ohio Secretary of State’s office, 326,825 of its 468,484 voters are registered as “other” or are unaffiliated. Of the leftovers, 109,781 Republicans call Ohio’s 8th home, while only 31,878 Democrats live in its boundaries — a huge advantage for Boehner, who’s held the seat since Jan. 3, 1991.

In 2012 the Democrats didn’t even field a candidate and Boehner, running essentially unopposed, captured 99.97 percent of the vote. Earlier, he beat his primary opponent, David Lewis, by more than 5-to-1.

So how could a man with such a substantial political advantage run aground lately in battles over the budget and debt? First, and obviously, he’s contending with White House and Senate Democrats, but he’s also sparring with more conservative House members who have pushed Boehner into this stalemate.

Could his district be a microcosm of a fractured House? Numbers say no, but how do Ohioans feel about their representative and the House speaker — proud, upset, exhausted, hopeful, chagrined? This week, Yahoo News asked voters in his district to judge him specifically on how he’s handled the shutdown, the infighting with tea party Republicans and the across-the-bow bickering with President Barack Obama.

Here are some excerpts from what they wrote. Some residents shared their opinions before the House offered a deal on Thursday to raise the debt limit and possibly end the shutdown.

Mixed feelings for Boehner, caught in a tough spot

Story continues

Brian Smith dubs himself the “rare Democrat” in West Chester, north of Cincinnati. He’s lived in the area for 16 years and says when Boehner assumed the speakership, he felt pride for his neighbor and fellow Buckeye. But now he worries Boehner’s become dangerous. He writes:

The Speaker of the House is playing Russian roulette with the American economy in an effort to appease a minority of his majority in the House of Representatives and to hold onto his speakership.

But with the rise of the tea party within the Republican Party — and particularly within the House of Representatives — I began to feel a bit sorry for Boehner. I've thought him a reasonable man who knows how things get done in Washington, D.C. Trying to manage his caucus now, though, is like trying to herd cats. Not only do tea party representatives not understand how things in Washington work, they don't care if they work at all. Speaker Boehner is now caught between the proverbial rock and a hard place.

I am torn between feeling sorry for the man and feeling contempt for his blatant ambition, which is single-handedly putting the nation at risk. He could call a vote to end the stalemate today, and that would probably pass a clean continuing resolution and a clean debt limit, ending the shutdown and moving us back from the edge of another fiscal cliff.

But to do so he would have to violate the Hastert Rule, risk the wrath of the tea party and possibly lose his role as speaker. He could be putting his job as a congressman on the line as well, as he would risk someone running to the right of him in 2014's GOP primaries.

If he called for a vote, however, he would be a hero in my book, and I'd even consider switching over to vote for him in the primary.

Washington politics are child’s play — and that’s not a good thing

In the predominantly conservative areas of Miami County, which is just north of Dayton and west of Springfield, Maggie May notices her neighbors solidly backing Boehner. But she fears global perception of the scuffle between the House GOP and Democrats has been distilled to “a bunch of little kids arguing over a sandbox toy.” She writes:

Boehner has the right idea, executed poorly. To compromise with people who don't want to is just like dealing with a child. He is overseeing an understaffed ""daycare"" full of a bunch of whining, screaming people that are paid way too much not to compromise. And I feel sorry for him.

To get past this, let's give and take and, please, for God's sake, keep talking.

Quit fearing being re-elected as Speaker. Who cares? If he does his job with tact and a straightforward approach, he will have nothing to worry about. There's no risk, no reward — as history has shown only those bold enough to take a stand and offer a solution are the people who change the world.

I would like to say this to all of the lawmakers: The pawns are off the board. Stop using scare tactics like school cuts, the poor, children, elderly, sick and dying. It’s the knights and bishops that are really in play — big business, lobbyists, and your own pay and luxuries.

Stalemate a fool’s errand for GOP

Troy resident Charles Snee says he has major concerns about the Affordable Care Act, but he doesn’t believe shutting down the government will do anything other than sag down Republican poll numbers. He writes:

It's been disheartening to watch this deplorable spectacle unfold in Washington. There seemed to be a ray of hope earlier this week, when Boehner and the House Republican leadership began pivoting away from trying to defund the Affordable Care Act as a condition for passing a continuing resolution to reopen the shuttered parts of the government.

Boehner asserted on ABC's This Week that he didn't want the United States to default on its debt obligations. This is reassuring, but Boehner continues to press for spending and other concessions that the president and his Democratic allies will only consider after the government is fully opened and the debt ceiling has been raised.

Based on Thursday's news, it seems Boehner is now trying a divide-and-conquer strategy, by proposing a six-week extension of the debt ceiling, while still keeping the government partially closed. The intent, according to some of the more conservative hard-liners, is to couple taxes, entitlement reform and so on to the debt-ceiling debate, while linking the shutdown debate to the Affordable Care Act.

If that is the intent of House leadership, then Boehner ought to be forthright with the American people and say so.

This political trench warfare serves no useful purpose. At this point, I am still proud to be an American, but I am ashamed of my government. Mr. Speaker: It's time to dispense with the political brinkmanship and lead the nation out of this fiscal morass.

Obama ‘derogatory and dismissive,’ while Boehner rightfully stands pat

Julie Wallace of Butler County, which is north of Cincinnati, says she’s not a registered Republican, but she usually votes for the party. She opposes the Affordable Care Act and says she doesn’t believe it will have a positive effect on health care and insurance costs. She writes:

At no time in my life would I expect the type of shenanigans going on in Washington to be going on in Washington.

Speaker Boehner and the Republicans have said repeatedly that they do not agree with the Affordable Care Act. Speaker Boehner has made it clear that he and tea party Republicans in the House want spending cuts. Speaker Boehner and tea party Republicans speak for a large percentage of Americans on these issues. Yet, President Obama refuses to address or give value to their views, other than to say the government won't be held hostage. His public responses to these demands are derogatory and dismissive. Meanwhile, Speaker Boehner's tactics are the only way to get concessions.

On Thursday, he announced a new plan to address the debt ceiling. Again, he asks that the president and Senate Democrats come to the table. Earlier that day, the White House indicated the president would not fully negotiate with Republicans until the debt ceiling was raised and the government was reopened:

""Once Republicans in Congress act to remove the threat of default and end this harmful government shutdown, the president will be willing to negotiate on a broader budget agreement to create jobs, grow the economy and put our fiscal house in order.""

So basically what the White House is saying is, “Once I get everything I want, then I will be willing to talk.” What would be left to talk about? What leverage would be there to encourage negotiations?

It’s not just Boehner; it’s the government system, too

Chris Stevens, a 24-year-old Oxford resident, has voted against Boehner on every ballot. He says he realizes he’s not in the Republican majority in his town, and his dislike for Boehner — and Obama, too — has grown. He writes:

John Boehner is an arrogant, self-righteous, and selfish human being and politician. His actions are what is wrong with this two-party democratic system and his flaws are surfacing that feeling among Americans throughout the country.

The House of Representatives are divided and, as the Speaker of the House, Boehner has proven he cannot sit down and negotiate with anyone who doesn't agree with him. I admit I voted for President Obama in both elections, yet I have been thoroughly disappointed in how he has handled the divide as well.

After the shutdown is finished and when Boehner is up for re-election, again, I hope he is voted out of office. But when I look around and I see the type of people who have voted for him and have kept him in office, I know that will never happen. Boehner has played his cards so well … in this area that no matter what he says or does, he will come out ahead.

The issue here is not only Boehner, but the government system itself."

Chris Christie of New Jersey unloaded Wednesday on House Speaker John A. Boehner and Republican lawmakers in Washington for putting “palace intrigue” ahead of their official responsibilities.

Washington politicians “will say whatever they have to say to get through the day,” Christie said, adding that, as a governor, he had “actual responsibilities” -- “unlike people in Congress.”

Christie, a potential 2016 GOP presidential contender, reserved his most blistering words for the Republican House speaker. He described Boehner, variously, as selfish, duplicitous and gutless for reversing course at the last minute on Tuesday night and refusing to allow a vote on a $60-billion aid package before the current Congress adjourned.

PHOTOS: Scenes from the fiscal cliff

Christie said that as a result of “the speaker’s irresponsible action,” there will be further delay in federal disaster aid to New Jersey, New York, Connecticut and other areas hit by the October storm. He pointed out that it had been 66 days since the storm hit and that areas struck by other hurricanes in recent years had received relief packages in far less time.

However, as outrage continued to pour in from elected officials in the affected area, Boehner agreed to hold a vote Friday to direct needed resources to the National Flood Insurance Program. And on Jan. 15, the first full legislative day of the 113th Congress, the House will consider the remaining supplemental request for the victims of Hurricane Sandy.

But that came after Christie dished out his cold outrage on members of his own party.

“Shame on you. Shame on Congress,” Christie said at a news conference in Trenton, the state capital. “It’s absolutely disgraceful, and I have to tell you, this used to be something that was not political. Disaster relief was something you didn’t play games with.” But “in this current atmosphere, [it’s] a potential piece of bait for the political game. It is why the American people hate Congress.”

At another point, he said of Republicans in Congress: “We’ve got people down there who use the citizens of this country like pawns on a chessboard.”

“My party was responsible for this,” Christie said, charging “one set of Republicans was trying to prove something to another set,” and that Boehner was trying to “prove something. I hope he accomplished it.”

Christie, whose disaster-relief-themed efforts to reach across partisan lines to President Obama in the days leading up to the election angered many Republicans, said he did not think that was a factor in Boehner’s decision.

But the governor, who delivered the keynote address at last summer’s Republican National Convention and has helped raise money in recent years for fellow members of the party, did not rule out retaliating against his enemies in Washington.

“We’ll see. Primaries are an ugly thing,” he said.

But as Congress fast-approached a midnight deadline, the two sides appeared no closer to an agreement.

“Republicans are still playing games,” Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid declared on the Senate floor.

The Senate earlier in the night rejected the latest Republican counteroffer that would rein in ObamaCare while still funding the government past midnight.

House Republicans have started floating the possibility of taking their disagreement to what’s known as a conference committee – a bicameral committee where lawmakers from both chambers would meet to resolve the differences between the warring pieces of legislation.

More On This...

“It means we're the reasonable, responsible actors trying to keep the process alive as the clock ticks past midnight, despite Washington Democrats refusal - thus far - to negotiate,” a GOP leadership aide said.

Reid, though, said the Senate would not agree to the approach unless and until the House approves a “clean” budget bill.

Lawmakers are facing a midnight deadline to reach an agreement on a government spending bill, or the government begins to shut down. The rhetoric was getting more heated as the deadline neared.

“They’ve lost their minds,” Reid said of Republicans, in rejecting the latest proposal.

“Senate Democrats have made it perfectly clear that they’d rather shut down the federal government than accept even the most reasonable changes to ObamaCare,” Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell countered.

The latest House bill, which the chamber backed on a 228-201 vote, would have delayed the law's individual mandate while prohibiting lawmakers, their staff and top administration officials from getting government subsidies for their health care.

The Senate voted 54-46 along party lines to reject it.

Amid the drama, President Obama said he's holding out hope that Congress will come together ""in the 11th hour.""

A shutdown ""does not have to happen,"" Obama said, during remarks at the White House.The president has called the top four congressional leaders, including House Speaker John Boehner, though no breakthrough was reported.

At this point, it’s unclear what common ground the two sides can find. The latest GOP proposal stirred dissension in the ranks, with some lawmakers reluctant tohurt their own staff by taking away additional subsidies for their health care costs. According to the site Legistorm, the average House staffer salary is under $60,000.Twelve House Republicans peeled off in the latest vote to oppose the bill.

Congress has until midnight to craft a spending bill, or else the government will begin to wind down. Both sides, though, are digging in deep.

The Senate earlier Monday rejected a GOP proposal that would delay the health care law by one year and repeal an unpopular medical device tax. Reid warned Republicans not to fiddle with the spending bill any more.

Ahead of the House vote, Obama said Congress can avert a shutdown by passing a straight budget bill without ""extraneous and controversial demands.""

Obama warned that a shutdown would hurt all Americans, noting that the federal government is the country's largest employer.""A shutdown will have a very real economic impact on real people, right away,"" Obama said.

A prior Republican effort to include a provision defunding ObamaCare in the budget bill failed. House Republicans then voted, early Sunday, to add amendments delaying the health care law by one year and repealing an unpopular medical device tax.

The Senate, in a 54-46 vote, rejected those proposals on Monday afternoon.

In a rare note of optimism, Obama said earlier Monday that he's ""not at all resigned"" to a shutdown.

But the path forward is not clear. With nothing less than the operation of government on the line, the battle in Congress over ObamaCare was shaping into a test of wills.

Reid has outright stated he will not accept any measures that undermine the health care law as part of the budget bill. With the bill back on the House side, Boehner and Reid now face off with their final set of chess moves in a very narrow time frame. Lawmakers have until midnight to strike a deal.

Reid wants Boehner to simply call up the ""clean"" budget bill, without any ObamaCare provisions, and presumably let it pass with majority Democratic support.

""I have a very simple message to John Boehner: let the House vote,"" Reid said Monday.

But at this stage, a shutdown is highly possible, and congressional leaders are hard at work trying to assign blame. Democrats have already labeled this a ""Republican government shutdown."" But Republicans on Sunday hammered Reid and his colleagues for not coming back to work immediately after the House passed a bill Sunday morning."

""More Whites Dying Than Being Born,"" blared The Wall Street Journal. What does this mean? I'm guessing that it means white people don't have children unless they can afford to raise them...just a guess!

I have never seen a good answer to the following question: Why were the immigration laws changed in 1965 to favor Third World citizens, Asians and New world latinos while penalizing the ""old tribes"" from Europe, especially considering that this country's heritage is Eurocentric? Was this Teddy Kennedy and his Irish mafia's way to get back at the Brits? The country club set's distaste for those of us with Slavic backgrounds? Just wondering.

Who is surprised? For many years we have provided welfare for baby mommas and increased the black numbers and allowed Mexicans that make it across the border and Cubans who make it across the beach the same welfare for reproducing and thus increasing brown numbers. There always were more people of color than those of us whites on a worldwide basis. We were blessed by the Judeo Christian belief system that hard work and good morals would always triumph. And if not we had all the guns. Politicians have long been aware of this. Last year the child was born that in 18 years will tip the scale to majority voters of color. Then white folk will come to understand the true meaning of living in a minority world.

egardless of the demographics, if the GOP would simply try to do this: Stop our out-of-control, big government, Unconstitutional welfare/warfare/police state. That means:

1. No more Federal welfare or ""entitlements"". Phase them all out & let the States take them over or modify them, if they want.

2. Recall the troops from 800+ bases in 120+ nations around the world. No more wars not officially declared by Congress.

3. Repeal the Patriot Act & NDAA & eliminate Homeland Security. Stop the NSA information gathering on innocent Americans. Give us back our Bill of Rights.

4. Balance the budget asap, return to Constitutional money (gold/silver) & get rid of the Federal Reserve.

It's unbelievably frustrating to hear the same, tired claim that demographics will doom the GOP. That's completely wrong. It's poor communication that's dooming the GOP. The GOP is the only major party that supports free market policies. And free market policies are THE means to empowerment. Any other system inevitably leads to more poverty. TEACH PEOPLE THIS FACT AND THEY WILL VOTE FOR YOU. I started a Facebook page a few weeks ago called Unbiased America that is trying to do just that. I do my best to bring people from all sides of the political spectrum in to discuss ideas and policies the childish demagoguery and name-calling that usually happens when the left and right get together.

Brown people are so irresponsible! Then again, maybe voting for a party that is trying to expand economic opportunity, rather than restrict it to the top one percent, could help in that regard. Just a guess!The Irish are a ""new tribe"" from Asia?The Judeo Christian belief system includes a militarized enforcement clause?If only Republicans adopted Ron Paul's platform, they'd win, just like Ron Paul did!Seven percent of America's growth in 2012 came from white people. A total of 93 percent came from Asians, African Americans and Latinos. If I was a racist conservatives, I'd be frustrated too.

But speaking of ""poor communication that's dooming the GOP"":



I went to a top 20 university and have an advanced degree-- I GET your points. But lower aptitude American blacks and Hispanics want free stuff. They have PERNICIOUS social pathologies-- they drop out of school and get pregnant at prodigious rates...hearing about how the educated and game can do well in a free market of competition means NOTHING to them. Multiple theories of free republics say that they are doomed to fail because the Left will simply demagogue with promised freebies.

As usual, Mr. Buchanan has hit the nail on the head. 50 years from now, America as we know it will not exist. It will have been replaced by a polyglot of blacks, browns, yellows, and a few whites, who will be fortunate if they can survive, much less thrive, in the new environment. I grieve for my grand-son, who will have to cope with that situation.

""If only they weren't so stupid compared to us whites"" sure is great communication! If only Republicans were able to discuss the issue so freely, they wouldn't be so doomed.Hmm, Scandinavia is out, all those socialists. Germany has too many brown-skinned Turks. France has too many Africans. And French things.

I'm thinking Russia is your grandchild's last hope.



White liberals think that by breeding out whites and continuing to bar them from immigrating to this country, they will remain as the great white lords of the land... LOL. Reality and history says different. With years of heavy third world legal immigration and millions of illegals with birthright citizenship, the balance may have tipped to the point of no return. The entire world should be fearful. No more will there be the once great USA to turn to in time of trouble. ""Diversity"" has increased the welfare state to the point of collapse. We knew the end was near when history was re-written and national pride was labeled ""offensive"" while foreign ""pride"" praised. No unity, no country.

Diversity didn't work for the Balkan nations and it isn't working here. It's a deliberate way to bring down this country to the level of the third world.

That ""diversity is strength"" is just a gimmick schtick con job of the Left...deep down, those who love guvment KNOW that some ethnic groups will inexorably flock to guvment dependence, and the Left THRIVES on cultivating same. ILLEGAL aliens ARE undocumented democrats! Asians almost never resort to welfare services, but Hispanics and blacks FLOCK to them. Factor in I.Q./aptitude and social pathology problems (proclivities to crimes, gangs, dropouts, teen and illegitimate pregnancies, neighborhood/barrio blight), and you see substantial correlations by ethnicity. Europe is REELING WITH REGRET for having imported Islamists 'just to do our work for us."" Very soon, the imported populations will predominate. They are not lower aptitude, BUT their culture and religion are noxious and pernicious.

Guess it could be worse but I don't see how. I always thought the election and re-election of Obama would bring nothing good and everything bad for America. But it was actually something much more tragic. It was the beginning of the end of a once great country.

And more not easy answers include to stop feeding them [Latinos] literally. We need to stop giving them so much money in social welfare benefits. If they can survive on their own then fine. If they starve to death, then it will reduce the surplus population as Scrooge would say and i do not have a problem with that at all. When you keep feeding stray animals they reproduce a lot more and become totally dependent and bring their friends. That is what we have been doing in this country and it needs to stop. That will help take care of this issue.

And this has been the plan all along. No other coutries/continents besides Europe and America have been shamed and criticized into committing national suicide by letting in people from third world countries and of all different races in the name of multiculturalism and diversity. These are perverted Western ideas. Japan is for the Japanese, China for the Chinese, Korea for the Koreans, Africa for the Africans and so on. Only the US and Europe are for any third world vermin that wants to come here.

100% of white growth in 2012 came from immigration. Actually, more than 100 percent, since more white people died in America than were born. So yeah, white liberals need to be better at keeping those European immigrants out. STAT!You know who else was into white supremacism? Yeah,guy. Did that work?Asians vote more Democratic than Latinos. But the stereotypes say they're good at math, so all's good with those guys!Everything was white but now there are more brown people. Somehow, I suspect you'll find a way to soldier on.I'm old enough to remember when conservatives actually tried to win elections.Interesting theory. So ... you're Native American?"
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/11/darrell-issa-irs-investigation-transcripts_n_3424166.html,2013-06-11 00:00:00,['Senior Politics Editor'],Darrell Issa On IRS Investigation: Releasing Full Transcripts Now Would Be 'Reckless',"WASHINGTON -- One week after he released partial transcripts of interviews with IRS officials involved in the scandal surrounding the targeting of conservative groups, the chair of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee said releasing the full transcripts would be ""reckless"" and ""irresponsible.""

Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) pushed back Tuesday against calls to put out more information on the committee's investigation into the controversy, sparked after a Treasury Department Inspector General report revealed the IRS had singled out tea party groups applying for nonprofit status for extra scrutiny. Responding specifically to criticism from Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the ranking Democratic member of the committee, Issa said that releasing full interviews conducted with IRS employees would hurt the ongoing investigation.

""Your decision to publicly announce that the investigation should wrap up was irresponsible, but not surprising,"" said Issa, in a letter to Cummings. ""However, your push to release entire transcripts from witness interviews while the investigation remains active was reckless and threatened to undermine the integrity of the Committee’s investigation.""

The position is a tenuous one for Issa, who during an appearance on CNN's ""State of the Union"" just over a week ago promised that the full transcripts would be released. On that same program, Issa revealed several partial transcripts that suggested the directive to screen tea party groups came from officials in Washington.

Since then, The Huffington Post has sent four emails asking Issa's office when the full transcripts would be made public. Not one was returned. When asked why Issa's release of a partial transcript was fine but he opposed releasing the transcripts in full, a spokesman for the congressman referred HuffPost to another statement.

“Limited releases of testimony may also serve to empower other witnesses to become whistleblowers and serve to vindicate individuals who have been subjected to criticism or retaliation at the hands of their managers,"" said Issa, in that statement. ""On the other hand, if a full transcript were released, it would serve as a roadmap of the Committee’s investigation.""

It could take weeks, if not months, to see the full transcripts should the committee wait to release them until the investigation is completed. According to a Democratic aide on the committee, investigators have interviewed five IRS employees so far and have 18 more to go. In addition, investigators are hoping to look through hundred of thousands of documents that could shed light on the tax agency's controversial screening practices.

Unwilling to allow the partial transcripts Issa released to be the only evidence in the public record, Cummings this week also released segments of interviews. In a Sunday memo to his colleagues on the oversight committee, the congressman said that a manager in the IRS Cincinnati office who oversaw the nonprofit screening said that no one in Washington ordered him to employ the practice of targeting tea party groups.

""Although the Committee interviewed a self-identified ‘conservative Republican’ who denied any White House involvement or any political motivation for screening Tea Party cases, Chairman Issa now appears to be going back on his promise to release the full interview transcripts of IRS employees,"" said Cummings, in a statement. ""Chairman Issa changes his mind so fast that even when I agree with him, we’re not on the same page. I fully support responsible oversight, but cherry picking transcript excerpts to fuel partisan and unsubstantiated claims is not a credible or effective way to investigate.""

On Tuesday, an aide to Cummings said the congressman would release the full transcripts of the already completed interviews by the end of the week, if Issa did not do so himself -- though the aide also cautioned that those plans could change.

The squabbling between the chairman and ranking member of the oversight committee has made the conversation surrounding the scandal far more contentious. When news first broke that the IRS had targeted conservative groups, there was near bipartisan condemnation of the agency.

Over time, however, politics has entered the debate, and Issa's handling of the committee's investigation has been criticized as a poorly disguised attempt to tie the issue to the president.

When Issa called White House Press Secretary Jay Carney a ""paid liar"" earlier this month, he was criticized publicly by Democrats and privately by his own party. More recently, Republicans have been more open in their concerns about where the investigation is heading.

As Politico reported on Tuesday:

Rep. Charles Boustany of Louisiana, a senior Ways and Means Republican who chairs the panel’s Oversight subcommittee, criticized Issa’s tactics, saying the release of partial transcripts could “adversely alter our ability to get future information from other IRS employees.” “Just simply from a process standpoint, you don’t want to do that and alter what others might say,” Boustany told POLITICO. “I really am concerned that it could tip this into the political realm rather than a true detailed investigation to get the facts out.” He added: “A lot of this has to be done quietly, obviously, as we piece together what has happened, and once we piece it together and get the firm proof, then you can come out” and say what happened.

Zuckerberg announced the formation of Fwd.us (pronounced ""forward us"") in an op-ed article in The Washington Post late Wednesday. In it, he said the U.S. needs a new approach to these issues if it is to get ahead economically. This, he wrote, includes offering talented, skilled immigrants a path to citizenship.

[pullquote]

""We have a strange immigration policy for a nation of immigrants,"" Zuckerberg wrote. ""And it's a policy unfit for today's world.""

The move comes as a bipartisan Senate group is expected to roll out a comprehensive immigration bill in the coming days. Zuckerberg's goal echoes the proposed legislation. Zuckerberg, whose great-grandparents were immigrants, said he wants ""comprehensive immigration reform that begins with effective border security, allows a path to citizenship and lets us attract the most talented and hardest-working people, no matter where they were born.""

Zuckerberg also calls for higher standards and accountability in schools and increased focus on learning about science, technology, engineering and math. Today's knowledge and ideas-based economy, the 28-year-old Harvard dropout wrote, is very different from the economy of the 20th century that was based on natural resources, industrial machines and labor.

Fwd.us, he said, was created to ""to build the knowledge economy the United States needs to ensure more jobs, innovation and investment.""

Also backing the group are tech leaders such as LinkedIn Corp. CEO Reid Hoffman, venture capitalists John Doerr and Jim Breyer, as well as Ruchi Sanghvi of Dropbox, who was Facebook's first female engineer. Joe Green, founder of Causes.com, a social network for community organizing, serves as the group's president and founder.

Major financial contributors include Google Chairman Eric Schmidt, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer, SpaceX and Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk, Zynga CEO Mark Pincus and former Groupon CEO Andrew Mason.

Zuckerberg is not the only high-ranking Facebook executive to use his role to advance social causes. Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg launched LeanIn.org, a nonprofit aimed at arming women with the tools and guidance they need to keep moving forward in the workforce.

The formation of Zuckerberg's group was reported by The Associated Press and other outlets last month.

Sacramento-based Privacy For All Students, a coalition of conservative groups, filed the lawsuit Thursday against the secretary of state and two counties.

It says a courier delivered signatures collected in Tulare ahead of a deadline of Nov. 10, but offices were closed early before the three-day weekend. In Mono County, a courier dropped the signatures in a county mail slot a day before the deadline, but workers did not return to their jobs until the deadline had passed, according to the plaintiffs.

The plaintiffs say the secretary of state's office is refusing to validate the signatures from the two counties.

The secretary of state's office did not immediately return phone calls on Friday seeking comment.

Opponents of the law that goes into effect on Jan. 1 said they have collected enough signatures for an initiative that would repeal it.

Counties, however, were still reviewing the signatures.

The coalition submitted 620,000 signatures to get the initiative on the November 2014 ballot, said Frank Schubert, political strategist handling the signature gathering effort.

To qualify, at least 505,000 valid signatures of registered voters must be verified through a random sampling.

After that, it is likely the state would order a full review before the measure could be placed on a ballot.

California is the first state to pass a law allowing such choices by transgender K-12 students.

One provision gives them the choice of playing on boys or girls sports teams. It also allows them to choose which restroom they use.

Opponents say the law would violate the privacy of the majority of students and some might try to claim to be another gender simply to gain access to bathrooms.

School officials say decisions would be made under careful scrutiny involving parents, counselors, teachers, staff and the student.

The goal of the law is to reduce discrimination against transgender students."

What do you think of the court’s decision? Share your thoughts in a short video on CNN iReport.

(CNN) —

The Supreme Court sidestepped a sweeping decision on the use of race-conscious school admission policies, ruling Monday on the criteria at the University of Texas and whether it violates the equal protection rights of some white applicants.

The justices threw the case back to the lower courts for further review.

The court affirmed the use of race in the admissions process, but made it harder for institutions to use such policies to achieve diversity.

The 7-1 decision avoids the larger constitutional issues.

Read the decision (.PDF)

Abigail Noel Fisher individually sued the flagship state university after her college application was rejected in 2008 when she was a high school senior in Sugar Land, Texas.

She claims it was because she is white and that she was being treated differently than some less-qualified minority students who were accepted.

In a statement after the ruling Fisher said, “I am grateful to the justices for moving the nation closer to the day when a student’s race isn’t used at all in college admissions.”

The decision comes as the justices work toward wrapping up a busy term.

Among the big issues yet to be resolved: federal enforcement of the Voting Rights Act and the politically blockbuster constitutionality of same-sex marriage.

The Supreme Court plans to meet again on Tuesday to issue additional opinions.

In the Texas case, the school defended its policy of considering race as one of many factors, such as test scores, community service, leadership, and work experience, designed to create a diverse campus.

University encouraged by decision

The university said it was encouraged by the decision.

“We remain committed to assembling a student body at The University of Texas at Austin that provides the educational benefits of diversity on campus while respecting the rights of all students and acting within the constitutional framework established by the court,” said school President Bill Powers.

The Obama administration agreed with the school, saying to grow a nation built on differing complexions and backgrounds will depend on future leaders “who possess the understanding of diversity that is necessary to govern and defend the United States.”

In ruling narrowly, the court reaffirmed earlier decisions allowing for a limited use of race-conscious public policies.

“The attainment of a diverse student body serves values beyond race alone, including enhanced classroom dialogue and the lessening of racial isolation and stereotypes,” wrote Justice Anthony Kennedy in the majority opinion.

Ex-student challenges university’s affirmative action policy

But Kennedy said that such admissions programs must withstand close review.

Kennedy said the “university must prove that the means chosen” to attain diversity “are narrowly tailored to that goal,” adding that the highest level of legal standard must be met before institutions use diversity programs.

“Strict scrutiny (of the policy) imposes on the university the ultimate burden of demonstrating, before turning to racial classification, that available, workable race-neutral alternatives do not suffice,” he said.

The Supreme Court in recent decades has established a three-pronged test to balance the government’s interest against a constitutional right or principle, and decide which laws may go too far. These standards of review are rational basis scrutiny, heightened scrutiny, and strict scrutiny.

Kennedy said the appropriate standard was not applied properly by the lower federal courts in the Fisher case.

He said state universities must demonstarte to the courts that no workable race-neutral alternatives would produce the desired educational and social benefits.

Justices Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor, who are more left-leaning, agreed with the Supreme Court’s five conservatives.

Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas also agreed with the limited reach of the ruling, but separately suggested continuing use of diversity programs in the classroom were unconstitutional.

“Although cloaked in good intentions, the university’s racial tinkering harms the very people it claims to be helping,” said Thomas, the court’s only African-American, who himself benefited from affirmative action programs early in his academic and professional career.

Only Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg disagreed with the majority’s conclusion lower courts should take another look at the Fisher case.

“Government actors need not be blind to to the lingering effects of an overtly discriminatory past,” she said. “I have said before and reiterate here that only an ostrich could regard the supposedly neutral alternative as race unconscious.”

Justice Elena Kagan did not participate in the case because she apparently had been briefed on the issue as the Obama administration’s solicitor general before joining the high court.

Three questions for Clarence Thomas

Ideological differences

The justices said in 2003 that state universities can, in limited circumstances, tailor their admissions policies to consider an applicant’s race.

And this court was clearly divided along ideological lines during last October’s oral arguments about whether affirmative action essentially has run its social and legal course, and should no longer be used in the way schools like the Texas university has done.

The state of Texas provides for a hybrid admissions policy: Automatic acceptance to its university’s main campus in Austin for in-state students finishing in the top 10 percent of their high schools, ensuring a measure of non-subjective diversity. Three-fourths of the in-state student body get in this way.

Fisher just missed that opportunity, so had to compete in a separate pool of students seeking to attend the highly competitive school. It is that selection process that was before the court.

The school, with 52,000 students, has touted its “holistic” policy of considering race as one of many factors.

African-Americans in Texas as a whole represent about 12 percent of the overall population, but only make up about 5 or 6 percent of University of Texas admissions.

The high court will get another crack at the issue this fall in a separate appeal.

The justices will decide the constitutionality of a voter referendum in Michigan banning race- and sex-based discrimination or preferential treatment in public university admission decisions. Oral arguments are likely in October.

The case is Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin (11-345).

Supreme Court sent Texas ruling back to lower court

Burden of proving real need for affirmative action rests with colleges

Ruling could have implications for Michigan%27s Proposal 2

While a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on affirmative action in a Texas case will do nothing to change practices at Michigan's public universities, it does offer hope to those supportive of Michigan's voter-approved ban on the use of affirmative action in college admissions, legal experts said.

In a 7-1 decision Monday, the Supreme Court allowed affirmative action programs to remain legal — for now — but told the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals to reconsider its earlier ruling upholding the University of Texas' admissions process, which uses race as a factor. The justices held that universities have to prove there is a real need for affirmative action programs to diversify student enrollment and that courts must take a strict review of such programs to determine whether they are justified.

That toughening stance on the use of affirmative action in college admissions signals what the high court might do this fall when it takes up an appeal of a lower federal court's decision last fall to throw out Michigan's Proposal 2, said Kevin Saunders and Philip Pucillo, both law professors at Michigan State University, in separate interviews.

""This ruling may indicate a reluctance by the majority of the court to allow the overturning of Prop 2 to stand,"" Saunders said.

Pucillo said making universities prove they need affirmative action programs could signal the court's willingness to allow voters to restrict or outlaw those programs.

In essence, the courts have been taking universities at their word that affirmative action programs were needed in order to get diverse student bodies. Monday's ruling reminds lower courts that justices want universities to prove that race-neutral programs weren't working to get more minority enrollment, Pucillo said.

""The court made it clear that when lower courts are reviewing the cases, they have to do it with rigor,"" he said. ""They were giving universities the benefit of the doubt. The University of Texas has to prove why it needs (affirmative action).""

Writing for the majority, Justice Anthony Kennedy said a stricter standard needed to be applied by federal courts in determining whether a university's use of racial preferences was justified and ""narrowly tailored to obtain the educational benefits of diversity.""

""Strict scrutiny does require a court to examine with care, and not defer to, a university's serious, good faith consideration of workable race-neutral alternatives"" before signing off on race-based admissions practices, Kennedy wrote.

In the Texas case, the justices were looking at a program used to help fill the last quarter or so of the university's incoming freshman classes. Race is one of many factors considered by admissions officers. The rest of the roughly 7,100 freshman spots automatically go to Texans who graduated in the top 8 percent of their high school classes.

A white Texan, Abigail Fisher, sued the university after she was denied a spot in 2008.

Even those fighting to overturn the Proposal 2 ban passed by Michigan voters in 2006 agreed with experts' interpretation of Monday's ruling, that the court passed on making wholesale changes to affirmative action with this ruling.

""While everyone assumed the court would weigh in on the merits of affirmative action, that's not what they did,"" said Mark Fancher, an attorney with the ACLU of Michigan, one of the groups fighting against the Proposal 2 ban. ""In fact what they said, implicitly, was we've already done that. The only question is whether the rules are being applied properly by universities.

""The landscape is unchanged.""

Detroit attorneys Shanta Driver and George Washington of the Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, noted that Monday's decision did not strike the University of Texas affirmative action program, but only remanded it for reconsideration by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.

""We believe that it will take a big fight in Texas and nationally to persuade the conservative Fifth Circuit to recognize this truth,"" they said in a written statement. ""To win this fight — which it is now clear we can do — we have to return to the streets. That is how affirmative action was won and the only means by which it can be defended today.""

They said when the Michigan case is heard before the Supreme Court this fall they will be ""organizing a massive demonstration at the Court on the day of the argument, and we ask for every individual and every organization that supports affirmative action to join us in building that rally and march.""

The Proposal 2 ballot initiative was pushed by Jennifer Gratz, who was denied admission to the University of Michigan and sued, and by Ward Connerly, a former University of California regent who backed a similar voter initiative in that state.

Michigan voters approved the ban, 58 percent-42 percent.

The ban came several years after U-M was involved in a landmark Supreme Court ruling governing race and universities in two companion lawsuits, one filed by Gratz and others over undergraduate admissions policies. The high court upheld the U-M Law School's use of race as a consideration in admissions, as long as there were no quotas attached, but threw out the undergraduate admissions system that awarded extra points to African-American, Hispanic and Native American students.

It was considered a win for U-M, despite the ruling on undergraduate admissions.

Proposal 2 erased U-M's court victory by banning the state's universities and other public institutions from considering an applicant's minority status or gender in their admissions or hiring processes.

A federal appeals court, in November, threw out Michigan's voter-approved ban on affirmative action.

November's ruling focused on university admissions, although the ballot initiative approved by Michigan voters in 2006 also banned the use of affirmative action in government contracting and hiring. Lawyers said the federal appeals court opinion struck down only what some consider the most significant piece, dealing with university admissions.

That case is about the equal protection clause, Fancher said.

""The only thing we suspected as we waited for the ruling (in the Fisher case) was that it wasn't going to knock us out of the ballpark, and it didn't,"" Fancher said.

But Gratz and her supporters were heartened by the Fisher ruling.

""It's hard to predict what the court will do, (but) this ruling shows the court barely tolerates these policies,"" she said."

The rally at the state capitol in Raleigh on Monday night was one of the largest since the protests began this spring, drawing about 2,000 people, including 64 protesters who refused to leave the legislative chambers and were arrested.

The protests have gained momentum since a few dozen people first rallied against the political shift to the right in a state that Barack Obama won in the 2008 presidential election but lost in 2012. Some 700 people have been arrested in acts of civil disobedience over issues ranging from natural gas drilling to school vouchers to voting rights.

Republican legislators have largely stayed mum in the midst of the protests, though some state officials have grumbled about the cost of the arrests and the impact on the state.

""I'm fielding calls every day, ‘What the heck's going on (over) there?'"" the state's Commerce Secretary Sharon Decker told a crowd of reporters Monday. ""The current environment makes it very challenging to market North Carolina.""

This week, the protest zeroed in on a bill passed last week by the North Carolina state Senate requiring abortion clinics to conform to the same safety standards as ambulatory surgery centers, a regulation currently met by only one of the state's five clinics.

Opponents say it will limit access to safe abortions. Supporters of the measure say the higher standards will make abortion safer.

Governor Pat McCrory, a Republican, criticized senators for pushing the regulations through without a public hearing.

The state House of Representatives has scheduled a public hearing on the proposed regulations for Tuesday.

The bill makes North Carolina the latest state to consider abortion restrictions. The issue has dominated politics in Texas in recent days, after Democratic state Senator Wendy Davis spent 11 hours on the senate floor in an effort to stall the measure.

On Monday, a U.S. federal judge temporarily blocked a part of a new Wisconsin law, signed on Friday by Republican Governor Scott Walker, that opponents say will close two of the four abortion clinics in the state if enforced.

Cecil Bothwell, a city councilman from Asheville, North Carolina, made the four-hour bus ride to Raleigh with about 100 of his constituents. He said state lawmakers want to have it both ways when it comes to the state's role in health care.

""It amazes me that they claim they don't want government intervening in health care issues, yet they want to tell women what to do with their bodies,"" Bothwell said.

Melissa Reed, a vice president of Planned Parenthood Health Systems, brought a petition with 10,000 signatures opposing the measure.

Like many at Monday's protest, Tanya Glover, 34, who lives in Harnett County, a rural area outside of Raleigh, wore pink.

As she lined up with her father to be arrested, she said the legislature's lean education budget will slash services for her special needs child.

""This state has gone to hell and it's hurting my family,"" said Glover.

Shear']",White House Sharpens Focus on Path Forward After Troubles,"BALTIMORE — President Obama, struggling to find his footing after one of his most turbulent weeks in office, will try to push past the moment’s political furor with a focus on the few pieces of legislation he believes have a chance in Congress and on executive actions that do not require Republican approval.

The president’s aides, wary of what they say are Republican attempts to seize on woes as a way of thwarting Mr. Obama’s agenda, have ordered the White House staff not to be distracted by approaching hearings on Capitol Hill. Denis R. McDonough, the White House chief of staff, has told those in the West Wing that he expects them to spend no more than 10 percent of their time on the controversies.

In a meeting with Democratic strategists on Thursday morning, Mr. McDonough outlined a plan to intensify focus on revamping immigration laws, reaching a budget deal, and carrying out the health care law. The White House is also preparing a new push to keep student loan rates low when the current ones expire this summer, on the theory that the best way to get past the controversies is to emphasize policy proposals and contrast them with what the administration will portray as political gamesmanship by the Republicans.

“We’ve got to stay focused,” Mr. McDonough told the group of strategists, according to Mike McCurry, a former spokesman for President Bill Clinton, who was at the meeting. “Even if it’s not going to break through in the short run, we’ve got to keep hammering on,” Mr. McDonough added, according to the account."

They are hell-bent on destroying the Affordable Care Act in Americans' minds.

A document circulating among House Republicans (reported by the New York Times) instructs them to repeat the following themes and stories continuously: ""Because of Obamacare, I Lost My Insurance."" ""Obamacare Increases Health Care Costs."" ""The Exchanges May Not Be Secure, Putting Personal Information at Risk.""

Every Republican in Washington has been programmed to use the word ""disaster"" whenever mentioning the Act, always refer to it as Obamacare, and demand its repeal.

Republican wordsmiths know they can count on Fox News and right-wing yell radio to amplify and intensify all of this in continuous loops of elaboration and outrage, repeated so often as to infect peoples' minds like purulent pustules.

The idea is to make the Act so detestable it becomes the fearsome centerpiece of the midterm elections of 2014 -- putting enough Democrats on the defensive they join in seeking its repeal or at least in amending it in ways that gut it (such as allowing insurers to sell whatever policies they want as long as they want, or delaying it further).

Admittedly, the president provided Republicans ammunition by botching the Act's roll-out. Why wasn't HealthCare.gov up and running smoothly November 1? Partly because the Administration didn't anticipate that almost every Republican governor would refuse to set up a state exchange, thereby loading even more responsibility on an already over-worked and underfunded Department of Health and Human Services.

Why didn't Obama's advisors anticipate that some policies would be cancelled (after all, the Act sets higher standards than many policies offered) and therefore his ""you can keep their old insurance"" promise would become a target? Likely because they knew all policies were ""grandfathered"" for a year, didn't anticipate how many insurers would cancel right away, and understood that only 5 percent of policyholders received insurance independent of an employer anyway.

But there's really no good excuse. The White House should have anticipated the Republican attack machine.

The real problem is now. The president and other Democrats aren't meeting the Republican barrage with three larger truths that show the pettiness of the attack:

The wreck of private insurance. Ours has been the only health care system in the world designed to avoid sick people. For-profit insurers have spent billions finding and marketing their policies to healthy people -- young adults, people at low risk of expensive diseases, groups of professionals -- while rejecting people with preexisting conditions, otherwise debilitated, or at high risk of heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. And have routinely dropped coverage of policy holders who become seriously sick or disabled. What else would you expect from corporations seeking to maximize profits?

But the social consequences have been devastating. We have ended up with the most expensive healthcare system in the world (finding and marketing to healthy people is expensive, corporate executives are expensive, profits adequate to satisfy shareholders are expensive), combined with the worst health outcomes of all rich countries -- highest rates of infant mortality, shortest life spans, largest portions of populations never seeing a doctor and receiving no preventive care, most expensive uses of emergency rooms.

We could not and cannot continue with this travesty of a healthcare system.

The Affordable Care Act is a modest solution. It still relies on private insurers -- merely setting minimum standards and ""exchanges"" where customers can compare policies, requiring insurers to take people with preexisting conditions and not abandon those who get seriously sick, and helping low-income people afford coverage.

A single-payer system would have been preferable. Most other rich countries do it this way. It could have been grafted on to Social Security and Medicare, paid for through payroll taxes, expanded to lower-income families through Medicaid. It would have been simple and efficient. (It's no coincidence that the Act's Medicaid expansion has been easy and rapid in states that chose to accept it.)

But Republicans were dead set against this. They wouldn't even abide a ""public option"" to buy into something resembling Medicare. In the end, they wouldn't even go along with the Affordable Care Act, which was based on Republican ideas in the first place. (From Richard Nixon's healthcare plan through the musings of the Heritage Foundation, Republicans for years urged that everything be kept in the hands of private insurers but the government set minimum standards, create state-based insurance exchanges, and require everyone to sign up).

The moral imperative. Even a clunky compromise like the ACA between a national system of health insurance and a for-profit insurance market depends, fundamentally, on a social compact in which those who are healthier and richer are willing to help those who are sicker and poorer. Such a social compact defines a society.

The other day I heard a young man say he'd rather pay a penalty than buy health insurance under the Act because, in his words, ""why should I pay for the sick and the old?"" The answer is he has a responsibility to do so, as a member the same society they inhabit.

The Act also depends on richer people paying higher taxes to finance health insurance for lower-income people. Starting this year, a healthcare surtax of 3.8 percent is applied to capital gains and dividend income of individuals earning more than $200,000 and a nine-tenths of 1 percent healthcare tax to wages over $200,000 or couples over $250,000. Together, the two taxes will raise an estimated $317.7 billion over 10 years, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation.

Here again, the justification is plain: We are becoming a vastly unequal society in which most of the economic gains are going to the top. It's only just that those with higher incomes bear some responsibility for maintaining the health of Americans who are less fortunate.

This is a profoundly moral argument about who we are and what we owe each other as Americans. But Democrats have failed to make it, perhaps because they're reluctant to admit that the Act involves any redistribution at all.

Redistribution has become so unfashionable it's easier to say everyone comes out ahead. And everyone does come out ahead in the long term: Even the best-off will gain from a healthier and more productive workforce, and will save money from preventive care that reduces the number of destitute people using emergency rooms when they become seriously ill.

But there would be no reason to reform and extend health insurance to begin with if we did not have moral obligations to one another as members of the same society.

The initial problems with the website and the president's ill-advised remark about everyone being able to keep their old policies are real. But they're trifling compared to the wreckage of the current system, the modest but important step toward reform embodied in the Act, and the moral imperative at the core of the Act and of our society.

The Republicans have created a tempest out of trivialities. It is incumbent on Democrats -- from the president on down -- to show Americans the larger picture, and do so again and again.

The bill passed Thursday in the General Assembly and is headed to the desk of Democratic Gov. Martin O’Malley for signing after Monday, the final day of Maryland’s 2013 legislative session.

The bill is also part of a larger progressive agenda put forth this year by leaders of the Democrat-controlled Assembly that includes the approval of tax increases and one of the toughest gun-control proposals in the country.

State Sen. David Brinkley calls the fees a “forced tax” and disagrees with union claims that representation will benefit every teacher.

“If the representation is so exceptional, then everybody would join,” he said. “I just don’t buy it. It’s a political payback that has nothing substantial to do with the merits of education.”

The bill will require tens of thousands of public school teachers to pay close to 1 percent of their paychecks in so-called “fair share” fees to cover the cost of contract negotiations and grievance representation.

Union leaders say the legislation attempts to create uniformity across Maryland and that non-union workers should share the cost.

“We just have a patchwork of bills with no consistency,” said Sean Johnson, the Maryland State Teachers Association’s managing director of legislative and legal affairs.

Johnson acknowledged some issues are best decided on a local level but not in this case, in which some workers pay for union representatives to negotiate fair pay and benefits while others do not.

Right now, 24 states have right-to-work statues, which prohibit unions from requiring employees to join or pay dues as a condition of employment, according to the National Right to Work Foundation.

“The right to work has been on the march for several decades,” said Greg Mourad, vice president for the Right to Work Committee. “And Maryland is moving in the wrong direction in relation to the rest of America.”

He also said the recent efforts by governors in Indian and Michigan that made their states right to work states “stunned a lot of people.”

Mourad said the key points are employees want freedom in the workplace and employers want to open businesses where they can treat their employees fairly and they won’t be forced to join unions.

The new Maryland legislation is an extension of 2009 legislation passed by the Assembly -- at the request of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees – that requires all state workers except teachers to pay the fees.

Right now, teachers in Baltimore City and nine of the state’s 23 counties already pay the fee, as do all other state employees including prison guards and state troopers.

Johnson also said the fees are not automatic and will be decided during future contract negotiations between the union and local school boards. The fees will not go toward political activities and workers are not being forced to join the union, he also said.

The legislature has already passed O’Malley incremental gas-tax increase that will up the price of a gallon of gas by as much as 20 cents by 2016 and the governor’s gun-control bill, which is considered among the toughest in the county. The bill includes bans on assault weapons, limits on high-capacity magazines and fingerprinting for buyers.

Mourad said he expects O’Malley will sign the union bill.

O’Malley’s office said Wednesday the bill was not part of the governor’s legislative agency and “no decision has been made” whether he would sign it.

""Gov. O’Malley has been competing with (New York) Gov. Cuomo to make Maryland the most liberal and high taxed state in the nation,"" said state Republican Delegate Susan Krebs. ""It is a race to the bottom for Maryland. This is all an effort by the governor to position himself to the left of his potential presidential contenders. There is no doubt that Maryland has become the bluest of blue states."""

An administration official said the plan is being distributed to agencies

Proposal calls for more security funding and status checks

Illegal immigrants would apply for %22Lawful Prospective Immigrant%22 visa

WASHINGTON — A draft of a White House immigration proposal obtained by USA TODAY would allow illegal immigrants to become legal permanent residents within eight years.

The plan also would provide for more security funding and require business owners to check the immigration status of new hires within four years. In addition, the nation's 11 million illegal immigrants could apply for a newly created ""Lawful Prospective Immigrant"" visa, under the draft bill being written by the White House.

If approved, they could then apply for the same provisional legal status for their spouse or children living outside the country, according to the draft.

The bill is being developed as members in both chambers of Congress are drafting their own immigration bills. In the House, a bipartisan group of representatives has been negotiating an immigration proposal for years and are writing their own bill. Last month, four Republican senators joined with four Democratic senators to announce their agreement on the general outlines of an immigration plan.

One of those senators, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said Obama's bill repeats the failures of past legislation and would be ""dead on arrival"" in Congress.

""It fails to follow through on previously broken promises to secure our borders, (and) creates a special pathway that puts those who broke our immigration laws at an advantage over those who chose to do things the right way and come here legally,"" Rubio said. ""It would actually make our immigration problems worse.""

The draft was obtained from an Obama administration official who said it was being distributed to various agencies. The official requested anonymity because he was not authorized to release the proposal publicly.

The bill mirrors many provisions of the bipartisan 2007 bill that was spearheaded by the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and ultimately failed.

In his first term, Obama often deferred to Congress on drafting and advancing major legislation, including the Affordable Care Act. He has openly supported the efforts in Congress to take the lead on immigration legislation, and just this week met with Democratic senators to discuss their proposals.

But two weeks ago in Las Vegas, while outlining his immigration plans, Obama made clear that he would not wait too long for Congress to get moving.

""If Congress is unable to move forward in a timely fashion, I will send up a bill based on my proposal and insist that they vote on it right away,"" he said.

White House spokesman Clark Stevens said Saturday that the administration continues to support the bipartisan efforts ongoing in Congress.

""The president has made clear the principles upon which he believes any common-sense immigration reform effort should be based,"" Stevens said. ""We continue to work in support of a bipartisan effort, and while the president has made clear he will move forward if Congress fails to act, progress continues to be made and the administration has not prepared a final bill to submit.""

According to the White House draft, people would need to pass a criminal background check, submit biometric information and pay fees to qualify for the new visa. If approved, they would be allowed to legally reside in the U.S. for four years, work and leave the country for short periods of time. After the four years, they could then reapply for an extension.

Illegal immigrants would be disqualified from the program if they were convicted of a crime that led to a prison term of at least one year, three or more different crimes that resulted in a total of 90 days in jail, or if they committed any offense abroad that ""if committed in the United States would render the alien inadmissible or removable from the United States.""

People currently in federal custody or facing deportation proceedings also could be allowed to apply for the Lawful Prospective Immigrant visa. Application forms and instructions would be provided in ""the most common languages spoken by persons in the United States,"" but the application and all supporting evidence submitted to the federal government would have to be in English.

They would also be given a new identification card to show as proof of their legal status in the country.

The immigrants could then apply for legal permanent residence, commonly known as a green card, within eight years if they learn English and ""the history and government of the United States"" and pay back taxes. That would then clear the path for them to apply for U.S. citizenship.

To combat fraud, the draft proposes a new Social Security card be developed that is ""fraud-resistant, tamper-resistant and wear-resistant."" The Social Security Administration would be required to issue the new cards within two years.

A major requirement for many Republicans is enhanced border security. The bill calls for an unspecified increase in the Border Patrol, allows the Department of Homeland Security to expand technological improvements along the border and adds 140 new immigration judges to process the heavy flow of people who violate immigration laws.

It also orders U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to study whether a land-border crossing fee should be implemented to help offset border security costs. The draft also proposes raising many inspection fees that border-crossers already pay.

The draft bill proposes a new plan to allow Homeland Security to ""accept donations"" from citizens, businesses and local and state governments to improve ports of entry and security features along the border. And it would require CBP to begin collecting statistics on deaths along the border and report them quarterly.

The draft also expands the E-Verify program that checks the immigration status of people seeking new jobs. Businesses with more than 1,000 employees must begin using the system within two years, businesses with more than 250 employees within three years and all businesses within four years.

Homeland Security, working with the U.S. departments of Labor and Agriculture, the attorney general and other agencies, would engage in a $40 million-a-year program to educate business owners and workers about the program.

Homeland Security also would be required to submit a report within 18 months showing how the worker verification system is working, and specifically explain how it is affecting the nation's agriculture industry, which relies heavily on illegal immigrant workers.

The draft obtained by USA TODAY does not include sections that would alter the nation's legal immigration system to adjust the future flow of legal immigrants, which is expected to be a critical component of any immigration overhaul."
"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/chi-lawmakers-reach-an-agreement-on-pension-problem-20131127,0,5758411.story",,"['Ray Long', 'Rick Pearson']",Illinois lawmakers reach tentative deal on pension fix,"Top Illinois legislators said today they've reached agreement on a plan to deal with the state's worst-in-the-nation unfunded public pension liability and expect to vote on it next week.



Details of the measure were unclear today and its prospects of passing remained uncertain. But both Democratic and Republican leaders said they agreed on a proposal, the first such sign of progress in more than two years of discussions spurred by a continued downgrading of the state's credit rating.



The debate has centered on how to reduce costs while balancing the legal protections to public employee retiree benefits laid out in the state constitution. The public employee unions have repeatedly threatened to challenge in court any pension proposal that lacked their support, and they were quick to criticize today's announcement.



Negotiations among the four legislative leaders had centered on plans to slow compounded annual cost-of-living adjustments for public employees—the biggest driver of the state's $100 billion unfunded pension liability.



""We got it done,"" said Senate Republican leader Christine Radogno, who said ""the goal"" is to vote on the measure next week.



A top aide to Democratic Senate President John Cullerton concurred.



""There is a deal,"" said Rikeesha Phelon, spokeswoman for Senate President John Cullerton, D-Chicago, in an email. ""We are asking our members to return on Tuesday. We are going to spend the next week reviewing the plan with our caucus.""



The senators will join House lawmakers, who were told yesterday to return Dec. 3 to Springfield for a one-day session. The Dec. 3 date is politically significant because it is the day after the filing deadline for the March 2014 primary election, and lawmakers will know what competition they have.



Radogno said the proposal would save about $160 billion and the goal is to fully fund the pension system over the next 30 years.



The proposal would raise retirement ages, create an optional 401(k)-styled plan and scale back the cost-of-living increases.



Increasing the retirement age, now set at various levels based on the type of work, would impact the youngest workers the most. Younger workers could see up to five years added to their retirement ages, Radogno said.



The cost-of-living adjustments would be altered ""to be sure that the lower-paid, longest-serving employees have the biggest protection,"" said Radogno. It would be largely patterned after a provision she pushed and was included in a bill that Speaker Michael Madigan passed in the House.



Currently, retirees get an automatic 3 percent compounded increase every year.



The plan that passed the House included a formula that gave weight to the number of years a person worked, a way to rein in the size of the annual pension increases of employees that worked only a few years but got huge salaries



Radogno said that proposal has been ""tweaked"" slightly but would not go into the details



Gov. Pat Quinn issued a statement saying the plan meets his ""standard"" to eliminate the unfunded pension debt and give the retirement systems financial stability.



""We have more work to do,"" Quinn said. ""I look forward to working with the leaders and members of the General Assembly over the coming days to get this job done for the people of Illinois.""



Officials for public employee and teachers' unions, while unfamiliar with the details, said in a statement that they believed the proposal was ""an unfair, unconstitutional scheme that undermines retirement security"" since it was based on previous proposals that they had fought.



""It's no compromise at all with those who earned and paid for their retirement benefits,"" said the ""We Are One"" coalition, an umbrella organization for the state AFL-CIO, the Illinois Education Association, the Illinois Federation of Teachers, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, the Service Employees International Union and the Illinois Nurses Association.

http://news.yahoo.com/obama-washington-taken-eye-off-economy-213406962.html,,[],Obama: Washington has 'taken eye off' the economy,"GALESBURG, Ill. (AP) — Seeking to build momentum for looming fiscal fights, President Barack Obama on Wednesday cast himself as the champion for middle-class Americans struggling to make ends meet. He chided Washington for having ""taken its eye off the ball"" and declared that the economy would be the ""highest priority"" of his second term.

Obama, in an hour-long address that was at times deeply partisan, also accused Republican lawmakers of succumbing to ""an endless parade of distractions and political posturing and phony scandals."" He said gridlock had only gotten worse since his re-election.

""I am here to say this needs to stop,"" Obama said in a speech at Knox College. ""This moment does not require short-term thinking. It does not require having the same old stale debates.""

Obama, as he often does when criticizing Washington, glossed over his own status as the inhabitant of the city's most powerful office.

GOP leaders quickly panned the president's remarks as a series of repackaged ideas and empty promises.

""It's a hollow shell, it's an Easter egg with no candy in it,"" House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said.

Indeed, the president's remarks were void of new policy proposals or fresh solutions for breaking Washington stalemates. And there were no new approaches presented for resolving potential showdowns with Republicans this fall over raising the nation's borrowing limit and curtailing across-the-board federal budget cuts known as ""the sequester.""

For the president's advisers, a central goal of the speech was simply to refocus Obama's agenda squarely on the economy ahead of the fall deadlines. The first six months of his second term largely have been consumed by priorities like gun control and immigration, as well as an array of foreign policy crises and domestic controversies, including the National Security Agency's domestic spying programs and IRS scrutiny of political groups.

While official Washington's attention was elsewhere, the economy was slowly but steadily improving. The housing market is recovering, the stock market is soaring, and unemployment, while still high at 7.6 percent, is falling.

Story continues

But the White House fears that standoffs this fall over the debt ceiling and the sequester could upend that progress. The president has declared that he will not negotiate over the debt ceiling and expects Republicans to lift the borrowing limit without concessions. He's also pushing to end the federal budget cuts before they extend into the next fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1.

The president panned the sequester as a ""meat cleaver"" that has ""cost jobs, hurt our military and gutted investments in American education.""

Obama will seek to keep up his renewed economic focus in the coming weeks with a series of speeches on manufacturing, education, housing, retirement security and health care. Advisers say some of those speeches will contain more specific policy proposals, both for congressional legislation and executive action.

The president said he welcomed ideas from lawmakers of both parties, but wouldn't stand for reflexive opposition to his own initiatives.

""I'm laying out my ideas to give the middle class a better shot,"" he said. ""Now it's time for you to lay out your ideas.""

For Obama, the day trip to Knox College marked a return to the site of his first major economic address. He spoke at the school's graduation ceremony in 2005 as a newly elected U.S. senator.

His remarks back then were strikingly similar to the themes he outlined Wednesday in Illinois and later in Missouri, including the government's role in ensuring all Americans have opportunities to get ahead and the need for the U.S. to be better prepared to compete internationally. Barring action now, Obama said, ""We will be waving the white flag while other countries forge ahead in the global economy.""

The economy in the surrounding Galesburg community reflects much of the underlying economic concerns facing many Americans. A Maytag plant in the town shut its doors in 2004, leaving hundreds of people unemployed. Today, the factory still sits vacant. Galesburg's unemployment rate is just under 8 percent, and nearly a quarter of its population lives in poverty.

""Those old days aren't coming back,"" Obama conceded. He said the proposals he will outline in speeches later this summer will be aimed at adapting the U.S. economy to an increasingly competitive and interconnected world.

On education, the president promised ""an aggressive strategy to shake up the system, tackle rising costs, and improve value for middle-class students and their families.""

During the second stop Wednesday, Obama highlighted a program at the University of Central Missouri in Warrensburg that gives students education and skills at a faster pace while lowering the costs. Students earn a bachelor's degree in two years.

""You are a laboratory for this innovation. ... I want the entire country to notice it,"" Obama said. ""I've asked my team to shake the trees all across the country for some of the best ideas out there for keeping college costs down.""

The president also said he would use the speeches he'll give in the coming weeks to renew his calls for increasing the minimum wage and giving all 4-year-olds access to pre-school programs. The first of those speeches will come Tuesday, when Obama visits an Amazon distribution center in Chattanooga, Tenn.

Obama also pledged to take steps to encourage home ownership, make it easier for people to save for retirement and to continue to put in place the elements of his health care law in the face of efforts by Republicans in Congress to repeal, delay or eliminate funding for its various parts.

The vote was a major defeat for teachers’ unions and the state’s governor, John W. Hickenlooper, a Democrat who campaigned heavily in support of the measure to provide $1 billion mostly for educational improvements. It was also a blow to charter-school advocates and a group of deep-pocketed philanthropists who had supported the effort as a rare opportunity to infuse new money into poor and struggling schools. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York contributed $1 million, as did Bill and Melinda Gates, whose foundation is a major contributor to education projects.

Opponents of the education measure were vastly outspent, but they offered a simple argument to voters leery of higher taxes, saying that the increase would hurt job creation, cost small businesses money and bruise the state’s economic recovery, with no guarantees that the changes would actually work.

The vote came one year after Californians approved a $6 billion tax increase to shore up the state’s finances and schools. But, unlike in California, voters in Colorado sent a message that they were unwilling to shoulder higher taxes, even in the name of a popular issue like education."

Very little, according to a survey of economists released Monday by the National Assn. for Business Economics. The group said that nearly 60% of economists now expect the so-called sequestration, which will slice about $85 billion from the federal budget, to begin March 1 in full or partial form.

The survey of 49 professional economists, representing industry, government and universities, indicates that experts don’t see a recession scenario as a result of the new spending cuts, as they did the “fiscal cliff” of tax increases and fiscal reductions, which were mostly avoided at the last minute at the start of this year.

More than half of these economists predicted that the effects of sequestration and other budget uncertainties would shave economic growth by less than half a percentage point this year. Another one-third said the pain would be greater, with real gross domestic product, or total economic output, sliced by up to a full percentage point.

Either way, that’s no small number given the mediocre pace of GDP growth since the Great Recession of a little more than 2% on average. And many economists, policymakers and business people across the country have expressed fears that the indiscriminate nature of the cuts under sequestration will impose unnecessary hardships on certain programs such as Head Start for preschool children.

Total government spending and investments are now seen as falling by 1% this year from 2012, according to the median, or mid-point, of the responses from the economists surveyed. That is worse than the 0.6% drag forecast in the association’s survey in December.

Real GDP is expected to expand by 2% this year, down a bit from the 2.2% GDP growth in 2012. The nation is projected to add 170,000 jobs a month on average, down from 181,000 last year, according to the median value of responses. That should bring down the unemployment rate gradually, to 7.5% in the fourth quarter of 2013 from 7.9% at the start of this year.

Economists, however, see economic growth accelerating next year as the nation absorbs the fiscal spending cuts and benefits from the housing market recovery and a pickup in business investments. Real GDP is seen as growing by almost 3% in 2014, the survey said, and the unemployment rate is forecast to fall to 7% by the end of next year.

“Let me be clear” he said on the Senate floor the other day. “I don’t trust the Republicans, and I don’t trust the Democrats.” And why not? The last four years have given us all ample reason not to trust the Democrats, as $1 trillion deficits have become the new normal and the national debt has zoomed toward $17 trillion, all under the Obama-Pelosi-Reid team’s watch.

But what about the Republicans, who so often claim to be the party of limited government? The truth is, the GOP’s record is seldom as grand as its rhetoric. Aside from a few Tea Party stalwarts, plenty of Republican senators are ready to throw in the towel on the debt ceiling, let it go up, and get a few scraps from the Democrats in return.

“Here is the dirty little secret about some of those on the right side of the aisle,” Cruz was quoted in the New York Times. “There are some who would very much like to cast a symbolic vote against raising the debt ceiling and nonetheless allow our friends on the left side of the aisle to raise the debt ceiling. That, to some Republicans, is the ideal outcome.”

He is right about that. Senior Republican staffers in Congress tell me that members of the Republican Leadership in both houses of Congress are terrified of not raising the debt ceiling, having been convinced that calamity will ensue if we don’t. But the alternative? Senate Majority Leader McConnell would, I am told, be happy to see the debt ceiling raised with no Republican votes. Then Republicans can beat up Democrats for raising it, while knowing that the economy won’t explode as Paul Krugman has warned it would.

And if House Speaker John Boehner had to choose between a clean debt ceiling increase (one with no limits, allowing Obama to keep raising it ad nauseum) and no debt ceiling increase at all, I am told he would take the former by conservatives in the House of Representatives.

So the establishment Republican mind-set says, “More debt is better than a melt-down, but at least get something in return, even if it doesn’t mean much, we have something to run against the Democrats with.” What do they want in return? They know they don’t have the votes to get much in the way of budget cuts, so they can at least keep the base happy with talk about “economic growth.”

When Cruz, who is anything but your traditional freshman back-bench Senator, said he didn’t trust Republicans, the party establishment, led by John McCain, howled in response. But where is the Republican leadership’s credibility? When they last held real power, these Republicans goosed up domestic discretionary spending faster than it rose under Bill Clinton and piled on the debt.

It was under a Republican president and Congress that we got Medicare Part D, the biggest new entitlement since LBJ’s Great Society. The prescription drug benefit added trillions to Medicare’s unfunded liabilities, passed only when party bosses needed to violate normal procedures to get the votes to pass it. Former U.S. Comptroller David Walker called it “the most fiscally irresponsible piece of legislation since the 1960s.”

Medicare’s chief actuary, Richard Foster, later said he was threatened not to reveal that the drug benefit’s price tag would exceed $400 billion in the first ten years. This figure was necessary under congressional rules to keep the bill from being blocked on a point of order. Foster estimated the real price tag was in excess of $500 billion. Several GOP congressmen would also recount arm-twisting tactics from the party leadership that went beyond the norm.

Instead of reducing the federal role in education, the Bush Administration and Republicans in Congress gave us No Child Left Behind, which helped double the size of the Department of Education, a Cabinet-level agency Republicans had pledged to abolish as recently as 1996. John Boehner, now the speaker of the House, was an NCLB sponsor and described its enactment as “one of the proudest accomplishments of my tenure in Congress.”

Under a Republican president and Congress, a $128 billion surplus was replaced by a $455 billion deficit. By the time George W. Bush left office, the shortfall was $1.2 trillion. Discretionary spending went up faster in Bush’s first term than it did in eight years under Bill Clinton. Under Bush’s watch, the federal budget exceeded $2 trillion, and then $3 trillion, for the first time. Most of these milestones were reached before the Democrats retook Congress. Federal spending rose from 18.4 percent of GDP to an average of 20.51 percent under Bush.

Bush and the Republican establishment bailed out the Wall Street banks with the $700 billion Troubled Assets Relief Program (with Democratic support, naturally). They bailed out the auto industry. They even pioneered a pre-Obama stimulus program, with similar results. The deficits and government growth would later endanger the Bush tax cuts, one of the signature conservative policy achievements of the period.

The Republicans who would negotiate the debt ceiling with the Democrats in a conference will be the same people who voted for all this big government and their successors. This unfortunately includes even Paul Ryan. What faith can we have that the results will be different this time?

So is there any doubt at all why Ted Cruz doesn’t trust Republicans? He explained that he thinks “a whole lot of Americans likewise don’t trust the Republicans and the Democrats because it is leadership in both parties that has gotten us in this mess.”

Maybe we need new leadership."
http://news.yahoo.com/promises-promises-obamas-promises-conflict-130242036.html,,[],"PROMISES, PROMISES: When Obama's promises conflict","WASHINGTON (AP) -- Absent a magic potion or explosive economic growth, it was all but inevitable President Barack Obama would have to break some of his campaign promises to keep others. If there's one thing that distinguished them besides their ambition, it was their incompatibility.

Cut a staggering $4 trillion from deficits while protecting big benefit programs, subsidizing more health care, plowing extra money into education and avoiding tax increases on everyone except the rich? Not on this Earth.

The postelection reality is starting to shake out now, though how it will all settle can't yet be known.

To reach for his promised deficit reduction, Obama has proposed breaking his tax promise. Toward the same end, his pledge from four years earlier that he wouldn't trim cost-of-living benefits in Social Security has given way to a proposal to do just that.

None of that might happen.

Republicans, who oppose tax increases, and Democrats, who object to curbs on entitlements, could block his path and in doing so save Obama from breaking his own promises.

If they do, though, that big pledge to bring down deficits by $4 trillion would surely have no hope at all.

That's the overarching dilemma in a catalog of campaign promises facing varying prospects over the next few years.

Obama is driving toward success on his energy goals. He's got a decent chance of achieving an immigration overhaul. Activists who once ridiculed his promise to be a ""fierce advocate"" of gay rights say he's come around and become just that.

Much else is bogged in the budget swamp or is a nonstarter for one reason or another. Anything costing big money comes with big obstacles, and one promise that cost relatively little, gun control, is dust. Yet Obama, in powering through with his health care overhaul, financial regulation and stimulus spending in his first term, has shown that tough causes aren't always lost ones.

A look at Obama's leading promises and what's happening with them:

Story continues

Debt:

The promise: Cut deficits by $4 trillion over a decade.

Prospects: Deals with Congress to cap spending and raise taxes on wealthier people, along with the resulting savings on interest payments on the debt, have already achieved a projected $2.6 trillion in deficit reduction for the years ahead. But the rest of the $4 trillion will be tough. To get there, he proposes a 10-year $583 billion tax increase, an additional layer of tax increases from slower indexing of tax brackets for inflation and modest curbs to federal health care programs, all helping to produce further interest savings.

Republicans are so far standing firm against further tax increases and liberal Democrats are a tough sell on trimming entitlement programs and other spending. This, as the Congressional Budget Office warns that ""such high and rising debt would have serious consequences"" if unchecked. Among those consequences are reduced national savings and investment, a potential fiscal crisis and higher interest costs for the government.

___

Economy:

The promise: An approach to deficit reduction that doesn't undermine the recovery or unduly burden the middle class. Also, cut some corporate tax rates, penalize those who shift work overseas and create 1 million manufacturing jobs by 2016.

Prospects: Obama has had mixed success cutting the deficit without slowing growth. He struck a deal with Congress to avoid the ""fiscal cliff,"" a set of tax increases and spending cuts in January. Businesses responded by stepping up hiring and spending.

But he and Republican leaders allowed Social Security taxes to rise, cutting take-home pay for nearly all working Americans. He wasn't able to avoid $85 billion in automatic spending cuts that started March 1.

Manufacturing has been creating more jobs but adding 1 million more by 2016 is unlikely. That would require 250,000 new factory jobs per year, nearly double the current pace. Overall, the unemployment rate dropped to 7.5 percent in April, the lowest in four years of recession and ragged recovery. The economy is growing modestly but steadily. It expanded at a 2.5 percent annual rate in the January-March quarter.

___

Education:

The promise: Raise the high school graduation rate from 78 percent to 90 percent by 2020 and make the country No. 1 in college graduates by that year. Cut federal money to colleges that don't control tuition costs.

Prospects: A rocky path at best. There's little momentum in Congress for the spending required, his pledge to make the U.S. first in college graduates is a long shot and tuitions are climbing without the promised federal penalty.

Obama has proposed $36 billion for Pell Grants in 2013. Yet those grants now cover less than one-third of the cost of a four-year public college. In 1980, they covered 69 percent of the costs.

___

Energy:

The promise: Cut oil imports by half by 2020.

Prospects: He could well deliver on this promise. New drilling technologies have unlocked enormous domestic reserves of crude oil and natural gas. Policies that mandate increasing use of renewable fuels and better vehicle fuel economy have helped slash demand. That has translated into a dramatic reduction in oil imports and increase in diesel and gasoline exports.

But oil and gasoline are global commodities. If Mideast turmoil disrupts oil production there, prices worldwide will rise, even if the U.S. gets little or no oil from that region. The U.S. economy won't ever be free from the effect of high oil prices. It just may be able to get much less oil from abroad.

___

Entitlements:

The promise: No cuts in Social Security cost-of-living increases. Protect Medicare from Republican proposals to turn it into a voucher-like program.

Prospects: Obama is ready to break his Social Security pledge from the 2008 campaign. He favors a new measure of inflation that would gradually trim benefit increases in Social Security, Medicare and other programs. The change, if adopted, eventually would cut Social Security benefits $560 a year for an average 75-year-old, $136 for a 65-year-old.

His approach to Medicare savings is different from one proposed by House Republicans to transform the program. He'd cut Medicare payments to service providers and is proposing that a growing share of seniors pay higher premiums over time, based on their incomes. Such Medicare changes were foreseen before the 2012 election. Meantime, Washington is expanding Medicaid to bring in more of the low-income uninsured.

For years, budget hawks have insisted that huge entitlements must be on the table for true fiscal discipline to be achieved. They're on the table now.

___

Gay rights:

The promise: Be a ""fierce advocate"" for gay rights. Obama endorsed gay marriage in 2012.

?Prospects: The course for gay marriage will be shaped by the Supreme Court, expected to rule on the matter in June. It's allowed in 10 states and the District of Columbia; many other states seem unlikely to follow suit unless forced by Congress or the court. But cultural attitudes are changing, as did Obama's views. His administration argued in favor of gay marriage rights to the court.

It seems unlikely the court will order gay marriage to be legalized in all states but its ruling could help same-sex married couples on estate taxes, Social Security benefits and other tangible matters. In his first term Obama lifted the ban on gays serving openly in the armed forces.

___

Global warming:

The promise: ""Continue to reduce the carbon pollution that is heating our planet.""

Prospects: Obama probably will take more steps to reduce the pollution blamed for climate change, but they are unlikely to be of the scale needed to help much in slowing the heating of the planet. Any policy to reduce heat-trapping pollution will target coal burned by power plants and oil refined for automobiles; those industries have powerful protectors in both parties.

Obama has acted on his own, to increase mileage standards and impose pollution control on future power plants. More such executive action is likely; a law is not.

___

Gun control:

The promise: Ban assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines, expand background checks, and more, a postelection pledge made after the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.

Prospects: Obama said he would ""put everything I've got into this."" His everything wasn't enough. Entrenched support for gun rights and a powerful campaign by the National Rifle Association blocked efforts to pass a single aspect of Obama's package, the first attempt to significantly change the nation's gun laws in over two decades.

Polling found as many as 90 percent of those questioned supported expanded background checks, but even that fell short in the Democratic-controlled Senate.

___

Health care:

The promise: Ensure access to affordable insurance for all and no gutting of Medicare or Medicaid.

Prospects: Obama is likely to achieve his goal of extending coverage to the uninsured. Affordability is another question. Costs are expected to go up, not down, contrary to what Obama promised in his first term.

Some Medicare cuts Obama is willing to enact would hit beneficiaries. Well-to-do seniors and growing numbers of upper middle-class retirees could face higher monthly premiums.

___

Immigration:

The promise: Overhaul the immigration system to provide eventual citizenship to those who came here illegally, tighten borders and smooth legal immigration.

Prospects: Obama failed to deliver on his first-term promise to rework immigration law. His chances of pulling that off are much better now.

Even with a bipartisan Senate group having released legislation to accomplish those goals, however, success is not certain. Even so, the political climate is ripe for change thanks to a shift in Republican attitudes in 2012, when Latino and Asian voters backed Obama in record numbers.?

___

Iran:

The promise: ""Do what we must to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.""

Prospects: Sanctions are destroying Iran's economy but not its will to enrich more uranium. By his own timeline, Obama has about a year left to see if diplomacy and sanctions can get Iran to slow its enrichment of uranium and assure the world its nuclear program is peaceful. If the U.S. and its partners cannot succeed, the stage may be set for an American or Israeli military intervention.

___

Taxes:

The promise: Raise taxes on individuals making more than $200,000 and married couples making more than $250,000. No tax increases for people making less. Ensure millionaires pay at least 30 percent of their income in federal taxes.

Prospects: Obama's 2014 budget, if passed, would break his promise to avoid any tax increases for middle and low-income people. He proposes a new inflation yardstick that would expose most people to higher income taxes, especially poorer workers.

He kept his promise to raise taxes on the rich, though at different income levels than he laid out in the campaign: $400,000 for individuals, $450,000 for couples. Republicans dismiss his proposed minimum rate for millionaires as a gimmick.

Marco Rubio

Sen. Marco Rubio

For President Obama to continue the charade of making things like the Blue Angels the culprits of our debt and, therefore, the first thing on the chopping block when government must slim down is an insult to the American people.

Florida Republican Boy Wonder Marco Rubio is very upset about sequestration. His reason, as conveyed in an op-ed, seems to boil down to two words: Blue Angels The Blue Angels are relatively cheap! The savings could have been found elsewhere to preserve Americans' right to see military planes flying demonstrations! Why, why, why?

Oh, Rubio has room for a passing mention of some of sequestration's other inconveniences:



President Obama’s administration should be ashamed for trying to convince the American people that our only choices when it comes to dealing with the debt are either to leave government as big and bloated as it is, or accept a new reality where our people have to endure longer lines at the airport, endless flight delays, the loss of safety net medical assistance, the denial of education services, and many other inconveniences and negative effects to people’s day-to-day lives.

Umm, whut? As Rubio points out, he did vote against the Budget Control Act that produced the sequester. His reasoning was basically this: Slash Medicare, not the military budget, and OMG, what if this leads to tax increases? Well, we got sequestration rather than tax increases on the wealthy and corporations because Rubio's party wanted it that way. And now he's whining that President Obama is posing some kind of false choice between big government and flight delays, as if magical budget fairies are going to sneeze out the services people expect, want, and need from the government without it costing anything or requiring revenue.

Sequester effects that Rubio doesn't have room to mention: cuts to unemployment insurance checks, domestic violence programs, Meals on Wheels, national parks. Rubio doesn't spare a word for all the federal workers who are losing big chunks of their pay to furloughs. He spends more words on flight delays that Congress already acted to prevent than he does on Head Start cuts (if that's even one of the things he means by ""education services"") that are leaving low-income kids without preschool, teachers without jobs, and parents having to scramble to find child care if they're going to be able to keep their jobs or look for work. ""The loss of safety net medical assistance,"" meanwhile, is a nicely bloodless way to describe cuts to cancer treatment for Medicare patients.

The Blue Angels, though? Rubio has room for six full paragraphs about them."

Oregon’s bill would give the task force until the end of 2014 to draw up a plan; the legislature would have to vote again on whether to implement it.

The looming retirement crisis is real and at least some governments—state governments—are recognizing it and attempting to act. Recently, California and Oregon have each taken steps that could lead to the establishment of state-run retirement savings programs for residents who work in companies and organizations that don't offer retirement plans.California's proposal is more targeted, and would require private-sector employers with five or more workers and who don't currently offer a retirement plan to automatically deduct a contribution from employees' paychecks into an IRA at a savings rate of three percent of pre-tax salary. It does allow employees to opt out of the automatic savings program. A handful of other states (Illinois, Rhode Island and Massachusetts) are considering or have already enacted similar plans.

These savings are intended to act as a supplement to Social Security. What's important about them is the that there's a growing recognition in state governments that too many of us are facing insecure retirements. The mechanism might be flawed: more deductions from what for too many are already paltry paychecks and relying on a 401(K) or an IRA system that has shown its vulnerabilities in this great recession. But what matters here is the acknowledgement that something has to be done, and done sooner rather than later, to boost retirement security.

The foundation of these efforts has to be a strong and stable—and more generous—Social Security program, something that is guaranteed and can be relied upon regardless of what the markets are doing. Now that more and more states are paying attention to the fact that something serious has be done, it's time for federal policymakers to take up the challenge.

Walker, a first-term Republican facing re-election next year, said he would offset the tax cuts and spending increases contained in his 2013-2015 budget by redirecting some funds away from public schools and healthcare, freezing aid to local governments and selling off state assets such as power plants.

Democrats said the proposal would weaken the economic security of the state’s most vulnerable residents.

Walker, who touched off massive protests two years ago when he curbed the collective bargaining rights of public workers, said his proposed income tax cut would save residents $343 million.

“More money in the hands of taxpayers will likely drive greater demand for goods and services, which will likely lead to greater production and eventually more hiring of employees,” he said.

The proposed budget, unveiled in an address to both houses of the Legislature in Madison, included expanded state aid to private schools through voucher programs and the tightening of income eligibility requirements for recipients of publicly funded health programs.

Walker said he also wanted “able-bodied, non-elderly” people receiving food stamps in Wisconsin to be enrolled in mandatory employment training.

“I’m all for providing a temporary hand up,” he told lawmakers. “But … it should not be a permanent handout.

Democrats, who tried unsuccessfully last year to recall Walker, were critical of the proposed budget.

State Senator Kathleen Vinehout, who was a candidate for governor in the Democratic primary ahead of last year’s recall election, said, “Roads and bridges are being paid for by borrowing and raiding money that would otherwise go to schools and universities.

“These are political choices, not the choices voters in Wisconsin would make.”

Walker’s proposed budget will now go to the state Legislature, which is controlled by Walker’s fellow Republicans.

Debate on the measure is expected to continue for months.

Faced with unemployment and dim job prospects, Americans made one significant change that should alter their fortunes and those of the middle class for decades: they went back to school. During the recession, there has been a sharp surge in the number of Americans who are getting a college degree.

For much of the last several decades young Americans, particularly young men, had shied away from college. As a share of the population, there were actually more male college degree holders among those ages 25 to 29 in 1976 than there were in 2006. Between 2000 and 2006, the share of all Americans ages 25 to 29 with a four-year college degree dipped by 0.7 percentage points, with men leading the decline, falling from 27.9 percent to 25.3 percent.

Americans have now reversed that decline by going to school in unprecedented numbers. In 2011, there were 3.2 million more people enrolled in higher education than there were in 2006. This 18 percent increase in enrollment was the largest such jump since the end of the Vietnam War.

In the last six years, American higher education institutions conferred nearly 3.5 million more degrees (from associates to Ph.D.’s) than they did over the six years before that. By last year, 29.8 percent of men and 37.2 percent of women ages 25 to 29 possessed four-year college degrees. This blows past previous highs.

Educational gains during the recession were not reserved for the young. By 2010, there were nearly 8 million students over the age of 25 enrolled in higher education institutions, 1.2 million more than in 2007. Degrees conferred at all levels of education for all races, ages and genders are up from six years ago.

The knock on the American work force is that when it comes to brainpower, it has fallen behind our international competitors. In a recent survey of 23 countries by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, American adults were mediocre in both math and reading. In “The Undereducated American,” Anthony P. Carnevale and Stephen J. Rose assert that the United States has been underproducing college graduates since the 1980s, creating a labor force unable to match the needs of employers.

But is college still worth it today? It’s not just that college graduates are riding out the meager recovery living in their parents’ basements; the fear is that they will permanently underperform in the labor market. This seems unlikely. The recession has followed familiar labor patterns, with unemployment rates among college graduates roughly half those of high school graduates, just as in every recession since the mid-1970s.

In time, these young college graduates will find work and they will earn pay that is significantly higher than what they would have earned had they not gone to college.

How can we be so certain? Because the more education you have, the more you earn. In 2012, two-year-degree holders earned close to $7,000 more per year than their high-school-diploma-only counterparts. Someone with a four-year degree earned roughly $15,000 more than that same someone with an associate degree. A professional degree reaped nearly $35,000 more than a four-year college degree, according to the Department of Labor.

What this means is that the income mobility problem that drives policy makers nuts disappears for those who get a degree. Over the past few decades, those born into the middle three income quintiles were more than twice as likely to reach the top income quintile if they possessed a college degree compared with those who did not. The steepest mobility gains came from those in the second poorest quintile. Nearly two-thirds of these working-class Americans jumped to the richest quintile (37 percent) or the next richest quintile (27 percent) on the basis of earning a college degree.

But we still face serious obstacles if we want to turn this recession-led college resurgence into one of the dominant economic trends of the 21st century. First, almost 60 percent of adults over the age of 25 still do not have any degree beyond a high school diploma. For men in particular, this is a problem. When inflation is accounted for, the peak earnings year for men with a high school diploma was 1973. We’re living in a fantasy if we think that 40-year trend is about to change.

Likewise, college graduation rates are still far too low. Even now, 46 percent of students enrolled in a four-year college will not have a degree after six years.

And then there are the record levels of student debt. For people under 35, student loans are the second largest source of debt behind mortgages. College tuition has increased faster than inflation every single year since 1981.

So what can we do? Anya Kamenetz, the author of “Generation Debt,” has put together some excellent ideas for Third Way, the centrist policy organization where we both work. Let’s start by reducing the number of college administrators per 100 students, which jumped by 40 percent between 1993 and 2007. We should demand a cease-fire to the perk wars in which colleges build ever-more-luxurious living, dining and recreational facilities. Blended learning, which uses online teaching tools together with professors and teaching assistants, could also help students master coursework at less cost.

There are 37 million Americans with some college experience, but no degree. So pegging government tuition aid to college graduation rates would entice schools to find ways of keeping students in class. And eliminating some of the offerings of rarely chosen majors could bring some market efficiencies now lacking in education.

The most commonly discussed solutions to the problem of income inequality seem unlikely to get to the heart of the problem. Yes, we could raise additional taxes on the wealthy, but we just did that. Bumping up the minimum wage would help, but how high would lawmakers allow it to go? We should look instead at what Americans are already doing to solve this problem and help them do it far more successfully and at less cost.

http://news.yahoo.com/senators-student-loan-interest-rates-double-184951507.html,,[],Senators: Student loan interest rates to double,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Student loan rates will double Monday — at least for a while — after a compromise to keep student loan interest rates low proved unwinnable before the July 1 deadline, senators said Thursday.

Sen. Tom Harkin, the chairman of the Senate education panel, said none of the proposals being circulating among lawmakers could win passage, and he urged lawmakers to extend the current rates for another year when they return from the July 4 recess. Harkin said his colleagues could retroactively restore the current rates after the holiday.

""Let's put this off for a year,"" Harkin, D-Iowa, told reporters.

Interest rates on new subsidized Stafford loans are set to go from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent on Monday unless lawmakers take action. Congress' Joint Economic Committee estimates the increase will cost the average student $2,600.

""Neither party wants to see rates rise next week,"" said Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C.

But a one-year rate extension isn't an acceptable option, either, he said.

""Last year we kicked the can down the road and passed a one-year extension for only a small group of students. ... Why would we make the same mistake again and just kick the can down the road another year?"" said Burr, who was among a group of senators who worked on a competing proposal with Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va.

The Manchin-led proposal would link interest rates to the financial markets. It borrowed heavily from a version House Republicans passed earlier and from principles included in President Barack Obama's budget proposal.

Critics called it a bait-and-switch move that would provide students lower interest rates at first before they climb upward as the economy improves.

""Students across this country would rather have no deal than a bad deal,"" said Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I. ""We're at the point where we have to do our best to extend the 3.4 percent interest rate while we work on a good deal, not just any deal.""

Republicans blamed Democrats and said they would be responsible for the expected rate hike.

Story continues

""As a result of their obstruction, the Democrat-led Senate will leave town and allow interest rates on some new student loans to increase on Monday,"" said Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell. ""Senate Democrats continue to block reform and insist on kicking the can down the road.""

Republicans also noted the Manchin-led proposal had many similarities with Obama's, including a link between 10-year Treasury notes and student rates.

""This agreement is very much like the proposal in the president's budget, it is very much like the proposal passed by the Republican House of Representatives and it will save billions of dollars in interest for all 11 million students taking out loans this year by dropping rates on all student loans,"" said Tennessee Sen. Lamar Alexander, the top Republican on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.

Alexander, a former education secretary, called Harkin's proposal ""a short-term, political fix.""

""That's no fix at all when we have a plan to help all students that we can pass quickly,"" he added.

Nothing was happening — quickly or not — before July 1, meaning students who take loans would face higher rates. Senators were heading out of town without a deal, and Harkin said his colleagues would consider a retroactive fix on July 10.

""I think we are nowhere between now and July 1,"" said Rep. George Miller of California, the top Democrat on the House Education and the Workforce Committee. ""It sounds to me like the Senate is going to leave town without dealing with this.""

But Democrats promised to turn back to them when they get back to Washington, first with a short-term fix and then a longer-range measure.

The law that governs college and universities expires this fall and lawmakers planned to rewrite it starting in September. Democrats said they prefer to include a comprehensive student loan measure in it, rather than as a stand-alone bill.

""We need a one-year patch to keep interest rates from doubling on student loans,"" said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. ""That buys us the time.""

At the other end, the top brass of federal employees are on track to receive bonuses. And workers who impact the food and airline businesses, like meat inspectors and air traffic controllers, have managed to get a break from Congress.

But underprivileged children waiting to attend preschool, low-income seniors who rely on regular breakfasts from the government and elderly cancer patients seeking chemotherapy are among the first to really feel the impact of $85 billion in forced spending cuts that kicked in on March 1.

The cuts are affecting the poor on other fronts:

* In Michigan, 21,000 children won't get new clothes when they go back to school this fall. The state slashed a $137 clothing allowance for each child being cared for by relatives, according to MLive media group.

*In Kansas City, Kansas, 33 families that had been homeless are slated to lose housing at the Waterstone Apartments, because of cuts to the federal housing voucher programs, according to KCTV news.

* Poor people who wind up in federal court and need legal representation are waiting longer for trials, because so many public defenders are being forced to stay home, unpaid, said Federal Public Defender Lisa Peebles of Syracuse, N.Y. Her staff is taking 20 days off, some of the longest furloughs among federal employees.

""These are the things low income people need: Legal representation, health care, child care,"" said Professor Tim Smeeding, director of the Institute for Research on Poverty at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. ""The more inequality grows, the more they'll need the exact programs we're cutting,""

Giant safety net programs like Medicaid and food stamps, as well as aid programs funded by the Veterans Administration have been protected from cuts.

But agencies and programs that are thinly funded or have no ability to shuffle money around have been hit particularly hard in the first round, said Steve Bell, senior economic policy director at the Bipartisan Policy Center. That includes those that spend most of their budget allocation on programs for the sick and poor and labor.

Related: Four federal agencies to shut down on Friday

""As time goes, you will see more of a cumulative impact,"" Bell said. ""We call it a slow-motion train wreck.""

Some programs are working hard to cushion the effect on the people. Obama administration officials had predicted the early childhood education program Head Start would cut 70,000 children from rolls. However, some of the centers that administer the program have found ways to adjust their smaller funds.

For instance, Kids Central of Norton, Va. trimmed the number of school days by 10, and cut back on school supplies and property maintenance, rather than whittling down the class size, said Darrell Edwards, executive director of that program.

Budget cuts have led to unexpected consequences for cancer-stricken seniors undergoing chemotherapy treatment. Hundreds of independent cancer clinics have either cut back, or are in the process of determining whether to treat Medicare patients because federal spending cuts trimmed reimbursement rates for pricey chemotherapy drugs.

Related: Meals on Wheels budget cuts: 'Slowly developing crisis'

The American Society of Clinical Oncology found in a recent survey of doctors and facilities that half of its members had to stop treating patients and send them to hospitals for chemotherapy.

""Having to travel just an additional 10 miles and be treated in a larger system can be a traumatic experience for these (cancer) patients,"" said the oncology group's president Sandra Swain, in a statement.

In coming months, forced federal spending cuts will carve a more equal, painful path, say budget experts.

Meanwhile, senior executives at the very top of the federal pay scale still may get bonuses this year, according a report released last week by Senator for Missouri Claire McCaskill.

""The idea that some of the highest paid federal government employees could be getting bonuses while others are being furloughed is outrageous,"" said McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat, who has crafted a bill to end such bonuses while sequester is on."

""It is the definition of arrogance to penalize parents with new taxes just because their children want to exercise their right to vote in the community they live in.”

North Carolina Republicans have filed a bill that would penalize parents of college students who vote in the town where they go to college. Students would still be allowed to register to vote in their college town—but if they did, their parents would lose a tax deduction of up to $2,500. The same bill would also force people to have their car registered and be registered to vote in the same place, again targeting college students who are likely to register their cars in their hometowns but vote where they attend college.Hall is either incredibly optimistic or being disingenuous there, because of course Republicans are desperate to limit voting for partisan gain. College students lean Democratic in their voting, so Republicans will happily screw their parents to take aim at the student vote in two ways, by making it harder for students to vote on election day and more likely that they'll have to fill out absentee ballots, and by making it harder for advocacy groups and candidates to turn out student voters by organizing on college campuses. There's no question that's what's going on here.

Naturally, the provisions targeting college students are accompanied by a package of your typical other Republican voter suppression tactics like limiting early voting days and prohibiting same-day registration."

Jerry Brown’s controversial plan to shift money from rich schools to poor ones, an ominous sign as he works to win support for the idea from skeptical lawmakers and the state’s powerful teachers unions.

A new USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll found that 50% of respondents agreed with such a move, to help school districts that serve low-income children and English-language learners.

But a significant minority, 39%, opposed the plan, which is embedded in the governor’s budget blueprint and is the centerpiece of his education agenda. Brown has described his bid as “a classic case of justice to unequals.”

Support broke along ethnic and socioeconomic lines, with 67% of Latinos backing the proposal, compared with 42% of whites.

Voters solidly endorsed a separate Brown proposal to give school districts more control over the state funds they receive, with 59% in favor. Only 41% approved of a legislative effort to make it easier for local governments to raise more education money through parcel taxes — a priority for many Democratic lawmakers.

In the past, Democrats and their allies in teachers unions have resisted upending the way schools are funded. Brown’s most contentious proposal this year would give all districts a base grant, with extra funding for each student who is low-income, struggling with English or in foster care.

“Our future depends not on across-the-board funding, but in disproportionately funding those schools that have disproportionate challenges,” he said as he unveiled his plan in January.

With race and class at its core, the proposal could open a thorny debate.

“The challenge for the governor here is to make a case that this is not a divisive issue but a rising-tide-lifts-all-boats” proposal, said Drew Lieberman of the Democratic polling firm Greenberg Quinlan Rosner, which conducted the survey in conjunction with the Republican company American Viewpoint.

Lisa Andrews, a Latina from Fresno, approves of the plan. The 47-year-old Democrat grew up in a small Central Valley farming community where her elementary school classmates struggled with English skills.

“If you’re going to set tax money aside, then give it to those who would benefit the most from it,” she said. “You have to be able to speak English and learn your grammar first, because the other classes are useless if you’re not on equal ground” with other students.

On the other side of the issue, Dave Kanevsky, a pollster for American Viewpoint, described the governor’s plan as “class warfare applied to schools” because it is framed “in terms of taking from one and giving to another.”

Respondent Debra Sexton, 57, a Democrat and retired photographer from Corona, expressed a similar view. She said the idea of giving more money to poor schools at the expense of wealthier ones was fundamentally unfair, particularly to high-performing campuses.

“I don’t think those schools should be punished because a lesser school isn’t making the grade,” she said.

Brown’s proposal to give districts more spending flexibility would eliminate dozens of state requirements for specific programs, such as vocational training and summer school, and instead allocate more money to districts with no strings attached.

“Nobody knows better than the local school district,” said Johnnie White, a 35-year-old Democrat and cashier from Venice. “It’s tough for somebody in Sacramento to say what a kid needs in South L.A. or Hawthorne.”

Forty-nine percent of respondents opposed legislation that would ask voters to change the state Constitution to lower the threshold for passage of parcel taxes, from two-thirds to 55% of the vote. State Sen. Mark Leno (D-San Francisco), the measure’s author, has touted it as a way to give school districts the power to offset potential losses under Brown’s funding plan.

But poll participants were not in the mood for more taxes, after an election in which billions of dollars in new levies were approved to help stave off education cuts. The Democratic and unaffiliated voters who supported Brown’s tax-hike proposal in big numbers last November were lukewarm on a parcel-tax change. Republicans were firmly opposed.

“There’s enough money there,” said Ron Simington, 40, a Republican military contractor from Ramona. “I think it really comes down to mismanagement. The money just needs to be dealt with properly.”

Since 2000, when voters lowered the vote threshold for local bonds to fund school construction, the passage rate for those measures increased dramatically. Less than half of the successful measures secured the two-thirds vote that was previously required.

The Next Generation Science Standards, which were released Tuesday after development by 26 states and several national scientific organizations, recommend that educators for the first time identify climate change as a core concept and stress the relationship between that change and human activity.

“Human activities, such as the release of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels, are major factors in the current rise in Earth’s mean surface temperature (global warming),” according to the elementary school standards, which are not federally mandated and will be adopted on a state-by-state basis.

“This is a major undertaking, but one that should result in students with greater ability to reason critically in an increasingly complex world."" — Kelly McGrath, Pearson

The process to implement the new guidelines — the first time in nearly 15 years to change the science K-12 education nationwide — could take years in some cases, but some of the nation’s major education publishers have already taken notice.

Kelly McGrath, a science editor at Pearson, one of the so-called “big three” education publishers alongside McGraw-Hill Education and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, said its materials will need revision to “reflect the depth of coverage” in the new guidelines.

“With the implementation of the Next Generation Science Standards, we will need to revise our coverage of climate change and many other science core ideas, to reflect the depth of coverage in the new standards and the shift to focus on scientific practices,” McGrath wrote in an email to FoxNews.com. “In a digital learning environment, we’ll have greater capacity to deliver materials that meet the news standards, and teachers and students will benefit from the personalization capabilities that digital provides.”

For example, one of the new middle school science standards recommends that teacher ask questions to “clarify evidence” of the factors that have caused the rise in global temperatures throughout the past century.

“In order for students to demonstrate their understanding of this performance expectation, we will need to incorporate new experiences into our curriculum materials,” McGrath’s email continued. “Our materials will need to provide access to multiple examples of the evidence, as well as give students and teacher the support to know how to ask clarifying questions about this topic.”

Teachers will also need support to determine what successful demonstration of that expectation might look like, McGrath said.

“This is a major undertaking, but one that should result in students with greater ability to reason critically in an increasingly complex world,” McGrath’s email concluded.

Officials at McGraw-Hill Education, meanwhile, told FoxNews.com the company will wait to see which states adopt the guidelines before revising their materials.

“At McGraw-Hill Education, we work closely with educators to develop products that meet the needs of our customers,” vice president of product marketing Lisa O’Masta wrote in an email. “One common need of our customers is for materials that align to state or national education standards. Our current science offerings for the K-12 market are tightly aligned to address the existing National Science Education Standards and individual state standards. In the weeks and months ahead, we will be paying close attention to the adoption of the Next Generation Science Standards by states across the country. Our development of new products will focus on a deep alignment to the standards that states choose to adopt.”

At Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, materials are currently being reviewed for ""alignment"" with the new standards, according to Leigh Ann Garcia, HMH's director of product management and strategy for grades 6-12 in math and K-12 in science.

“We are currently reviewing HMH programs for their alignment with NGSS and will make the necessary revisions to support NGSS implementation,"" Garcia wrote FoxNews.com.

The new guidelines, which are based on a framework by the National Research Council, were released at a critical juncture, as jobs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) are expected to grow by 17 percent from 2008 to 2018, compared to just 9.8 percent for non-STEM jobs. Despite those figures, only 8 percent of college graduates enter the workforce with a STEM degree, according to the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation.

Frank Niepold, climate education coordinator for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Climate Program Office, said the key underlying effort behind the new guidelines is to make students “really deeply understand” key topics like climate change, physical science and biological evolution rather than mere memorization.

“We’re really not getting mastery, that’s the fundamental drive here,” Niepold told FoxNews.com. “And the reality is that this a very positive improvement to the standards, there’s no way around that It’s a very sizeable improvement.”

Asked about potential blowback to standards regarding climate change, Niepold said there was nothing in the 93-page document that wasn’t “well-established” by science. Others, however, said the very presence of climate change instruction in classrooms will create controversy.

Neal McCluskey, associate director of the Center for Educational Freedom at the Cato Institute, said climate change is undeniably a “very hard” topic to handle delicately.

“It’s something that’s very hard to strike a balance on,” McCluskey told FoxNews.com. “There’s nothing wrong with talking about climate change in science classrooms, but this opens up the huge possibility that interpretations of climate change or analysis that a lot of people disagree with will still be taught. The degree to which human beings are impacting the climate and how bad that impact may be is controversial.”

Some state Department of Education offices, including those in Pennsylvania and Florida, told FoxNews.com that no meetings have been scheduled in connection to the new standards. In California, the state Board of Education is expected to vote on them in December. In Kansas, it’s believed they’ll be voted upon as early as this summer and educators in Colorado will conduct a “thoughtful and sequenced” review of them following the adoption of new science standards there in 2009. Texas, meanwhile, has indicated they will not adopt the guidelines.

Regardless of if and when they’re adopted, Richard Hull, executive director of the Text and Academic Authors Association, said he welcomed the new guidelines and downplayed the potential impact of politically-divisive topics like climate change and evolution.

“The influence of political and religious views on evaluators and adopters in state education departments should be minimized by these new standards.,” Hull wrote FoxNews.com. “Students who are educated in accordance with them will have a far better chance for success in college courses and in competition on the employment market than those steeped in creationism design, new earth theory, and other alternative accounts.”"

Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz.), was intern Daniel Hernandez Jr., who helped save his congresswoman's life. Later that year, he continued his public service when he was elected to the school board for the Sunnyside Unified School District, which covers southern Tucson and adjacent areas in Pima County.

Now, however, Hernandez is facing not only a recall campaign, but an anonymous anti-gay smear campaign as well.

On one side are the two opponents of superintendent Manuel Isquierdo -- including Hernandez. On the other side are the superintendent's supporters, who include board president Louie Gonzales. Hernandez and fellow board member Buck Crouch voted against extending Isquierdo's contract in June, after news broke about his financial and legal issues.

Community members launched a recall effort against Gonzales and another Isquierdo supporter, Bobby Garcia, a month ago. Last week, supporters of Gonzales began a retaliatory recall effort against Hernandez and Crouch.

But flyers being passed around to constituents, first reported by Right Wing Watch, go after Hernandez for being gay and for supporting gun control measures.

""Put a REAL Man on the Sunnyside Board,"" reads one flyer, with a picture of Hernandez speaking at an Equality Forum event. ""Daniel Hernandez is LGBT. We need someone who will support Sports and cares about our kids. We don't need someone who hates our values. RECALL Daniel Hernandez TODAY.""

The second flyer claims that Hernandez ""cares about only one things [sic] taking your guns away.""

Hernandez told The Huffington Post several parents had alerted him to the flyers, which were being distributed outside at least five of the 23 schools in the district.

""I've had a target on my back from my fellow board members for awhile because I don't go with the flow, and if something doesn't sound right or make sense, I call them out on it,"" Hernandez said.

Hernandez said he first heard the ""real man"" attack during his 2011 campaign, when he ran against Garcia, who was voted onto the board in a subsequent election.

The Hernandez recall campaign is being run by Marcos Castro, the campaign manager for Gonzales.

Castro told The Huffington Post he had nothing to do with the Hernandez flyers, although he received one at his house.

""I don't have nothing to do with it,"" he said.

Multiple requests to the office of the Sunnyside School Board to speak with Gonzales were not returned.

Hernandez's opponents need to collect 1,300 signatures by Dec. 14 to get the recall vote on the ballot.

""My governing board president has started the recall process on me, with the people who are his friends and closest allies in the community. I'm not overly concerned they're going to get the 1,300 signatures, but just the negative tone and nature of the way they're doing it has been really bothersome and upsetting,"" said Hernandez.

""It's disheartening that this is where we are in 2013, that people think it's okay to put out these kinds of flyers about anybody,"" he added.

UPDATE: Aug. 27 -- Gonzales told The Huffington Post that he was not at all involved in the flyers and does not support anti-gay attacks. He added that he believed Hernandez and his allies were actually the ones behind them, in a subterfuge attempt to make his opponents look bigoted.

""He's trying to turn this whole thing around,"" said Gonzales, adding, ""We're not anti-gay or gun control by any means.""

Gonzales said he supported the superintendent because he believed he should be judged strictly on his performance in the schools, regardless of his financial and legal issues.

""I think Mr. Hernandez may be a bit immature and young, and he's using all the resources ... and doing that, and it's kind of embarrassing,"" he said.

Hernandez later replied that he wasn't surprised his opponents are denying a role in creating the flyers, stating, ""If they truly have nothing to do with it, I ask that they renounce these attacks, drop this sham of an election and attend sensitivity training.""

Also on Tuesday afternoon, Giffords tweeted in support of Hernandez:

Michelle Obama pays her respects to the family of Hadiya Pendleton, 15, who was fatally wounded in a random shooting just days after performing in inauguration events.

She didn’t say anything, but she didn’t have to.

First lady Michelle Obama, simply by filing into a church pew on Chicago’s South Side on Saturday and mourning the killing of a smiling 15-year-old girl she had never met, spotlighted the everyday gun and gang violence plaguing the nation’s cities.

“Genocide,” one eulogist called it, lamenting that guns had “become part of our wardrobe.” Another exhorted the politicians in the pews, “Don’t give us lip service.”

The Rev. Michael Pfleger vowed, “We must become the interrupters of funeral processions seeking to bury our future.”

Since being gunned down in Chicago a week after performing with the King College Prep high school’s majorette team during President Obama’s second inaugural festivities, Hadiya Pendleton has become a national symbol for the innocence lost to senseless shootings.

A photo of a letter President Obama wrote to Pendleton's parents, as printed in the glossy obituary booklets handed out at the funeral. The text reads: ""Dear Cleopatra and Nathaniel, Michelle and I just wanted you to know how heartbroken we are to have heard about Hadiya’s passing. We know that no words from us can soothe the pain, but rest assured that we are praying for you, and that we will continue to work as hard as we can to end this senseless violence. God Bless, Barack Obama” (Philip Rucker)

Pendleton’s killing resonated far beyond the South Side to the White House, where the Obamas drew parallels between Pendleton and their own daughters.

The first lady, who met privately with Pendleton’s family and about 30 of her classmates, did not speak at the funeral, which lasted four hours. But her appearance carried heavy political overtones, coming as the president is pressuring Congress to enact tougher gun laws.

Obama sat quietly as Pendleton was remembered as an honors student and majorette who loved Fig Newtons and lip gloss and aspired to major in pharmacology or journalism in college. She wanted to go to Harvard.

One after another, Pendleton’s teary-eyed classmates recalled their friend’s contagious smile and soft, baby voice. “She tried to tell a scary story, but no one could take her seriously,” one said.

During the inauguration, another classmate recalled, Pendleton wandered around the nation’s capital so much that she began sweating even in the chilly weather.

A week later, a gunman opened fire on Pendleton and about a dozen other teenagers while they were hanging out at a park after school. Police said Pendleton was an innocent victim likely caught in the crossfire of a gang fight.

For the Obamas, Pendleton’s death on Jan. 29 hit home. She went to school only a mile from the Obama family home. The Obamas thought about their daughters, Malia, 14, and Sasha, 11, said Valerie Jarrett, a senior White House adviser and close friend of the Obamas.

“It’s personal for us,” Jarrett, who accompanied Michelle Obama to the funeral, said in an interview. “The first lady and I grew up in Chicago. It could have been our daughters. So, as residents of Chicago, residents of the South Side, our heart just goes out to her family. . . . We may not have known her, but she’s a part of our family, too.”

David Axelrod, a longtime adviser to President Obama and also a Chicagoan, said in an interview that Pendleton’s death was “a very sobering thing” to the president, who has grappled with this city’s gun violence epidemic since he represented a South Side district in the Illinois State Senate.

“She put a memorable, recognizable face on what is a grim, stubborn, dismaying problem,” Axelrod said of Pendleton.

President Obama did not travel here with his wife, but the back of a glossy funeral program included a handwritten note from him to Pendleton’s parents, Nathaniel Anthony Pendleton and Cleopatra Cowley-Pendleton.

“Michelle and I just wanted you to know how heartbroken we are to have heard about Hadiya’s passing,” he wrote. “We know that no words from us can soothe the pain, but rest assured that we are praying for you, and that we will continue to work as hard as we can to end this senseless violence. God Bless, Barack Obama.”

In Washington, Obama is urging passage of universal background checks for all gun buyers and bans on assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines. He was spurred to action by the Dec. 14 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., where a gunman killed 20 children and six adults.

But many more people are killed on street corners in cities like Chicago and Philadelphia, something Obama often notes in his speeches about gun violence.

“There have been so many tragic deaths around the country and oftentimes the individual deaths don’t get the attention that maybe an Aurora or a Newtown gets, but the impact it has on the family is just as devastating,” Jarrett said.

Pendleton was among more than 40 people who were killed in Chicago last month alone, making it the deadliest January here in a decade.

“All those lives that were ignored, she speaks for,” Damon Stewart, Pendleton’s godfather, said in his eulogy. “She’s a representative of people across the nation who lost their lives.”

Steve Crozier, 44, a Pendleton family friend, said in an interview that elected officials should be doing more to stop the killings.

“There’s got to be a war against these guns on our streets,” Crozier said. “People say the country is too steeped in guns, but the country was steeped in slavery, too. You’ve got to have the same commitment to getting these guns off the streets.”

Although Michelle Obama did not take the pulpit, she repeatedly was referenced by others who did. “Our first lady of the United States is so gracious — and from her heart she cares,” said Pastor Courtney C. Maxwell, who officiated.

The audience of roughly 1,000 mourners held hands, sang along and swayed during a rousing rendition of “We Shall Overcome.”

Education Secretary Arne Duncan, a former Chicago Public Schools chief, sat with Jarrett and the first lady. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn, both Democrats, also attended, as did the Rev. Jesse Jackson.

To Pendleton’s mother, known as Cleo, the show of dignitaries was at times overwhelming. “You kind of don’t know how to act,” she confessed.

Her remarks ranged from the jovial — “If I knew how to dance, I would. . . . We’ve got the first lady as a mother in the house” — to the serious. Of raising Hadiya, she said, “I kept her busy so she wouldn’t run into the element. I had her thinking from the time she could speak.”

As soft organ music played, members of the immediate family received communion. Floral arrangements were carried out and Pendleton’s casket was readied for burial.

At day’s end, a repast was held at the South Shore Cultural Center. On an October day 21 years earlier, Barack and Michelle Obama had their wedding reception there."

(Appeal document)

The father of a 7-year-old suspended from his Anne Arundel County school for nibbling his breakfast pastry into the shape of a gun filed a formal appeal Thursday, asking that the second-grader’s school records be wiped clean of the offense.

“The chewed pastry was not capable of harming anybody, even if thrown,” said the appeal, addressed to Anne Arundel Superintendent Kevin M. Maxwell and Park Elementary School Principal Sandy Blondell. “It could not fire any missile whatsoever.”

The case, which attracted national attention, came 11 weeks after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., which left 20 children and six staff members dead. In the massacre’s aftermath, sensitivities have been heightened about security and guns, even imaginary ones.

In recent weeks, children have been suspended from school for pointing their fingers like guns and, in one case, for talking about shooting a Hello Kitty gun that blows bubbles. In several cases, the offenses were described in harsh terms — one as a “terroristic threat” — and officials agreed, after appeals, to clear students’ permanent records.

In the Anne Arundel case, the son of William “B.J.” Welch was suspended March 1 for two days after chewing his breakfast bar, akin to a Pop-Tart, and yelling, “Look I made a gun,” according to the appeal. He aimed the pastry at students in a hallway and those at nearby desks, the appeal said.

“It was harmless,” Welch said. “It was a danish.”

After the suspension, Welch asked that his son’s record be wiped clean of words such as “gun,” which he worried could be damaging as the boy grows up. But school officials turned him down. In recent days, he hired lawyer Robin Ficker, who has handled three other recent suspensions of young children accused of similar actions.

In the appeal, Ficker wrote that the boy was accused of classroom disruption, although it was during a breakfast period with no teaching. The child’s classmates were eating the same breakfast bars and recognized “the pastry as a pastry and not a gun,” the appeal said.

The shape that touched off so much trouble, the appeal argues, is similar in appearance to puzzle pieces of states such as Idaho, Florida and Oklahoma, which it said are “available in every second grade classroom in the state of Maryland.”

The filing included photos of chewed Pop-Tarts and the three states.

Anne Arundel schools spokesman Bob Mosier said that the district had not received the appeal as of late Thursday afternoon and that he could not comment on the case because of confidentiality laws. Anne Arundel, he said, uses a discipline system with six tiers, and suspension is not an option until an offense reaches Level 3.

The appeal says that the second-grader’s offense March 1 was a “Level 3 violation” and that the school said the boy was seeking “peer attention” and “power control.” But Ficker argues in the appeal it was the “worst possible interpretation. . . . He was simply playing, as all kids his age do.”

Welch said in an interview that he remains hopeful about getting his son’s record cleared. “I don’t think he’ll be making any more food weapons,” Welch said.

Last week, a Maryland lawmaker introduced a bill that would forbid suspensions of young children for imaginary guns, pictures of guns or objects that resemble a gun but serve another purpose.

State Sen. J.B. Jennings (R-Baltimore County) said that he hopes school boards would act reasonably on their own but that too many cases suggested otherwise. The pastry suspension was “one of the last straws,” he said.

Jennings acknowledged that he was not hearing the school’s side of every story but said he was “looking for common sense in the classroom.”

“I think these are kids playing around — these are boys being boys,” Jennings said. “They watch cartoons. They are kids.”"
http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-05-18/news/ct-met-illinois-legislature-0519-20130518_1_illinois-senate-carry-bill-raoul,2013-05-18 00:00:00,"['Rafael Guerrero', 'Chicago Tribune Reporter']",Illinois concealed carry bill stalls,"— The push to pass a more restrictive concealed carry measure stalled late last week as support began to drop off before a key vote in the Illinois Senate.

The legislation represents the latest attempt to address a federal appeals court order setting a June 9 deadline for Illinois to fashion a new law that would allow citizens to carry concealed weapons in public. Illinois is the only state in the nation that does not have some form of concealed carry law on the books.

Shortly after the proposal won approval in a Senate committee Thursday, opponents turned up the heat.

""For a day at least, the extremists have prevailed,"" said Sen. Kwame Raoul, the South Side Democrat who sponsored the proposal and hoped to call it for a vote in the full Senate on Friday.

""My interest was to try to negotiate, to create something that balanced the interests of the goal of the Second Amendment as it's been interpreted by the courts and preserving, as my top priority, public safety,"" Raoul said.

Gun debates divide legislators along regional rather than political party lines, with Downstate lawmakers opposed to restrictions on gun rights, those from Chicago supportive of tighter control and suburban counterparts split.

The lineup against the Raoul legislation is long. The National Rifle Association weighed in heavily against the bill, and hundreds of people filed committee witness slips as opponents.

The Raoul bill spells out who can carry concealed handguns and where they can carry them. It also gives Chicago a chance to launch its own investigation into applicants who want permits to carry weapons in public in the city along with a separate permit for the rest of the state.

In the House, Speaker Michael Madigan has worked on a separate version after both a restrictive New York-styled concealed weapons bill and a less-restrictive, NRA-backed bill failed. Madigan has made it clear to some lawmakers, including senators, that a better bill may be under development in the House. That could have tempered support for Raoul's bill.

Madigan spokesman Steve Brown said he knew some rank-and-file lawmakers had reached out to senators about the Raoul legislation but was ""not aware"" of Madigan making efforts to peel off support.

Rep. Brandon Phelps, the leading gun rights voice in the House, said there is ""no way"" Raoul's bill could pass his chamber. Phelps indicated that discussions include creating a review board that would weigh appeals over objections that local law enforcement officials would lodge against permit applicants as potential threats to themselves or the public.

Lower school age

The Senate approved a measure Friday to lower the age children would be required to attend school from 7 to 6. Supporters say it would put Illinois in line with other states that already place children in classrooms at a younger age.

Under the measure, children who turn 6 years old on or before Sept. 1 each year would be required to enroll in kindergarten. For Chicago schools, the change would go into effect for the school year that starts this fall. For other school districts, it would not go into effect until July 2014. Children who are home-schooled are exempt. The bill now moves to the House, where a similar attempt passed last month.

Sponsoring Sen. Kimberly Lightford, D-Maywood, said children cannot be expected to excel, much less keep up, if they start school at 7 when students in other states are already grades ahead. She pointed to a Tribune report that found nearly 18 percent of Chicago kindergartners and first-graders were chronic truants during the 2010-11 school year.

Opponents argued that parents should have the final say on when their kids are ready for school and said costs in small school districts could be prohibitive.

Calls for firing

More than a dozen African-American and Latino senators notified Senate President John Cullerton and Gov. Pat Quinn that they opposed the governor's reappointment of former state Rep. Julie Hamos as director of the Department of Healthcare and Family Services.

""Director Hamos has demonstrated her priority to care for the poor and the institutions they rely on is secondary to simply cutting the budget regardless of the consequences,"" said a letter signed by Chicago Democratic Sens. Martin Sandoval and Donne Trotter.

Standing behind Hamos, a Quinn spokesman hailed her as a ""dedicated public servant"" who last year led her agency through the ""challenging process of saving the state's Medicaid system from collapse"" and who is now leading the effort to implement President Barack Obama's signature Affordable Care Act in Illinois.

Brown OKs funds to confiscate guns from criminals, mentally ill","SACRAMENTO -- Gov. Jerry Brown on Wednesday signed legislation aimed at taking handguns and assault rifles away from 20,000 Californians who acquired them legally but have since been disqualified from ownership because of a criminal conviction or serious mental illness.

The measure, the first of several gun-related bills to reach the governor, allocates $24 million in surplus funds to hire dozens of additional special agents to tackle a backlog of 40,000 weapons in the hands of people not allowed to possess firearms.

“This bipartisan bill makes our communities safer by giving law enforcement the resources they need to get guns out of the hands of potentially dangerous individuals,” said Evan Westrup, a spokesman for the governor.

The state operates a database that cross-references a list of gun owners with those disqualified later from owning guns. But, budget cuts have prevented the state Department of Justice from keeping up with the growing number of people on the list.

State Sen. Mark Leno (D-San Francisco) introduced SB 140, which takes the money from fees paid when people buy guns and allocates it to a three-year campaign to take guns from those ineligible to have them.

“We know for the safety of our communities that these people should not possess guns, and our reinvestment in this tracking program gives us the opportunity to confiscate them,” Leno said in a statement.

The measure was opposed by Sam Paredes, executive director of Gun Owners of California, who said it should be paid for by the state general fund.

“Going after criminals is a good thing, but the way they are paying for it is grossly unfair,” Paredes said. “They are putting the entire burden on the back of law-abiding gun purchasers.”

The measure, supported by state Atty. Gen. Kamala Harris, is one of more than a dozen gun-control bills introduced in the California Legislature following the massacre of 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut.

“California is leading the nation in a common-sense effort to protect public safety by taking guns away from dangerous, violent individuals who are prohibited by law from owning them,” Harris said.

http://news.yahoo.com/michelle-obama-hard-choices-needed-guns-224216023.html,,[],Michelle Obama: 'hard choices' needed on guns,"CHICAGO (AP) — Michelle Obama says people worried about youth gun violence have to do more than simply tell children they care about the problem and then wind up ""going to these funerals and mourning with these kids when there's still work to do.""

""They're looking to us to make the hard choices for them,"" the first lady said Thursday. She suggested there are better ways for her to help than becoming publicly involved in Congress' debate over gun laws that the president seeks.

Providing more creative outlets for children can help, she said in an interview with reporters who accompanied her on a three-city tour for the third anniversary of ""Let's Move,"" the anti-obesity program

""Kids need to be engaged, not just intellectually. They need more than just to do well on test scores. They need to have something else in life to look forward to,"" the first lady said, adding that opportunities to draw, sing, dance, act and play a sport can help them channel negative energy in a more positive direction.

On a two-day trip to highlight her national campaign to combat childhood obesity, Mrs. Obama changed out of a dark-colored business suit and into a coral-and-black workout outfit to jump up and down with thousands of Chicago middle school students who were brought to the McCormick Place convention center for what amounted to one very large aerobics class.

Mrs. Obama had announced a new public-private partnership, called ""Let's Move Active Schools,"" to help schools find low- or no-cost ways to help students get the recommended hour of daily exercise. The line-up included such star athletes as Bo Jackson and Colin Kaepernick, as well as Olympians Dominique Dawes, Gabby Douglas, Serena Williams, Allyson Felix and Ashton Eaton.

She took a few minutes to talk seriously with the kids before she joined the fun, urging them to do their homework and make good life choices. She recalled her upbringing in a Chicago family of four that wasn't rich and having to share a bedroom with her older brother.

Story continues

""If you guys remember just one thing from our time today, it's this: Although I am the first lady of the United States of America ... I am no different from you,"" she said.

Mrs. Obama hinted in the interview with reporters she'll do more to encourage schools and other organizations to provide opportunities for children in a time of declining budgets.

""More and more of our schools are having to eliminate the things that give kids passion and a reason to be in school,"" she said. Mrs. Obama added that kids are sharp enough to know when teachers, public officials others are just talking the talk.

""We have to stop telling our kids that we care. They're looking to us to make the hard choices for them,"" she said. ""And going to these funerals and mourning with these kids when there's still work to do that we haven't done, it can be frustrating.""

Mrs. Obama came home to Chicago earlier this month to attend the funeral of 15-year-old Hadiya Pendleton, who was killed by gunfire near the Obama home after returning from performing for President Barack Obama's inauguration. Pendleton's parents later sat with the first lady for Obama's president's State of the Union address.

A month after the December slaying of 20 elementary school pupils in Connecticut, Obama asked Congress to send him legislation banning assault-style weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines, and requiring criminal background checks for all gun purchases.

Congress has held hearings on the issue, but lawmakers have not taken any action on gun legislation.

Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio announced the controversial plan in the wake of the Newtown, Conn., school shooting that left 27 people dead, including the gunman and 20 first-graders.

The exercise took place Saturday at a closed school site in suburban Fountain Hills, outside Phoenix, where sheriff's SWAT members acted as shooters and teenagers played the part of students during mock scenarios involving up to three gunmen.

Seagal, best known for his roles in movies such as ""Above the Law"" and ""Under Siege,"" planned to lead training on hand-to-hand defense tactics, among other techniques, drawing from his expertise in martial arts, according to a sheriff's office news release.

Arpaio's office didn't respond to requests for comment Friday and Saturday, and Seagal representatives also did not return telephone messages from The Associated Press.

When faced with criticism in January about the school posse plan, Arpaio snapped back, ""Why would people complain about my posse being in front of schools to act as prevention?""

He boldly announced the plan on the grounds of an elementary school, saying at the time he wanted the patrols publicized.

""I want everyone to know about it for the deterrence effect,"" Arpaio said, adding that no taxpayer money would be spent on the patrols and volunteers will be supervised over the radio or telephone byar about the initiative.

""A lot of people sit around and watch these things happen, watch key signs and no one wants to do anything about it,"" she said when Arpaio announced the plan. ""Nobody wants conflict, nobody wants to be out in the limelight. And he doesn't care. He wants to do the right thing.""

Andrew Sanchez, however, a town council member in Guadalupe, said he wants nothing to do with posse members patrolling schools in his community, which spends about $1.2 million annually for Maricopa County sheriff's patrols.

""We are paying him to have certified deputies here, not to bring a circus and not to use our town as a political platform,"" Sanchez has said.

The volunteers, dressed in uniforms and driving patrol vehicles, some authorized to carry guns after training, won't go onto school grounds unless they spot danger, but will instead patrol around the facilities, Arpaio said.

Seagal is already a volunteer posse member in Maricopa County and has been deputized with sheriff's offices in New Mexico, Texas and Louisiana, where a film crew followed the actor on ride-alongs with Jefferson Parish sheriff's deputies for the reality TV show ""Steven Seagal: Lawman.""

Arpaio says other notable people also have joined his more than 3,000-strong volunteer armed posse, including ""The Incredible Hulk"" star Lou Ferrigno and actor Peter Lupus of TV's ""Mission: Impossible.""

(CNN) —

President Barack Obama on Tuesday unveiled a $100 million initiative to unlock the “enormous mystery” of the human brain in hopes of boosting the understanding and treatment of brain disorders.

“What if computers could respond to our thoughts? Or language barriers could come tumbling down? Or if millions of Americans were suddenly finding new jobs in these fields – jobs we haven’t even dreamt up yet because we chose to invest in this project? That is the future we are imagining. That is what we are hoping for,” the president said in an event in the East Room of the White House.

The initiative, dubbed Brain Research Through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies, or BRAIN, “aims to help researchers find new ways to treat, cure, and even prevent brain disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease, epilepsy, and traumatic brain injury,” the White House said in a release issued in advance of the event.

“There is this enormous mystery waiting to be unlocked,” Obama said, “and the BRAIN Initiative will change that by giving scientists the tools they need to get a dynamic picture of the brain in action and better understand how we think and how we learn and how we remember. And that knowledge could be – will be – transformative.”

Obama said he will seek the $100 million funding in the budget he sends to Congress next week. In an environment where both parties are seeking significant spending cuts, the expenditure faces an uncertain reception.

In his remarks, Obama said the funding would be in line with a promise he made earlier this year to increase levels of research.

In his State of the Union address in February, he said, “If we want to make the best products, we also have to invest in the best ideas,” and alluded to scientists “mapping the human brain to unlock the answers to Alzheimer’s.”

The money to study the brain would support research by the National Institutes of Health, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and the National Science Foundation.

The research would involve both federal research agencies and private partners.

A major goal is to reveal “how individual brain cells and complex neural circuits interact at the speed of thought,” the White House said.

Brain map seeks to unlock mysteries of the mind

“Our ultimate objective is a deep understanding of the human brain and its understanding,” said Arati Prabhakar, director of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, in a conference call with reporters.

In the same call, National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins said that “advances in tech which are coming along very quickly make it possible to take a look at what’s happening in the brain,” and the research “leads us to believe we can accomplish something very dramatic.”

The hope is that these new technologies will lead to insights into how the brain processes information and how it is linked to behavior.

“We aim through this ambitious project to try to unravel these mysteries,” Collins said."

But when Kaiser Permanente — which insures 45,000 public workers here — proposed another hike for 2014, San Francisco’s Health Service System teamed up with labor unions to say “no more.”

In a rare show of unity, they are demanding that Kaiser craft an alternative proposal, one that caps profits, links rates to the use of services and provides for more transparency. That means explaining whether rising costs are a result of potentially avoidable complications, such as hospital infections, and breaking down just what the city is paying for in a ballooning category known as “other medical services/integrated care management.”

The showdown introduces local political muscle into the national push, under the Affordable Care Act, to make the industry more responsive to consumers.

“It’s a huge … opportunity,” said Sally Covington of the Oakland-based Community Campaigns for Quality Care, a nonprofit that has guided unions nationwide to press health plans for accountability and is working with the San Francisco labor coalition.

“What we’re seeing unfold here … is very unusual,” she said. “We do not know of any other instance where these kinds of forces have been realigned in this manner.”

Final contracts must be approved by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, which is watching the negotiations closely. So is Mayor Ed Lee, who a spokeswoman said was confident that the parties would “work toward a proposal that will serve our employees and protect the fiscal health of the city.”

In a statement, a Kaiser Permanente spokeswoman said the 2014 proposal was “fair and competitive,” adding that the organization would continue to meet with city representatives “to explain our renewal pricing and cost structure.”

For years, city administrators and labor leaders bristled at the rate hikes. Then they joined forces.

“If you are going to get people healthier, it has to translate into a reduction in cost for employers, employees and taxpayers,” said Rebecca Rhine, executive director of the Municipal Executives Assn. and part of a coalition of labor groups pushing for change. “We began talking about how they all fit together.”

When health service system Deputy Director Lisa Ghotbi analyzed the data, she found that overall, Kaiser’s San Francisco members have been using fewer services because of the enrollment of families with young children, who tend to have fewer health problems.

Yet while their use of hospital, doctor and prescription services has trended down by as much as 16% since 2011, plan costs had risen by 11%. (Kaiser proposed a 5.5% rate hike for next year.)

And although hospitalizations had dropped by more than a third over the last seven years, Ghotbi said, charges in that category had risen by nearly 90%.

City workers’ families have been cared for by Kaiser for 64 years, “and we certainly value the quality of care,” she said. “This has nothing to do with that. It really has to do with pricing practices.... We have concern that there is a lot of profit being made off the public employers.”

Ghotbi’s department previously structured its contract with Blue Shield, which covers 40,000 city workers, to include “accountable care organizations” of partnered medical groups and hospitals. She said the result has been improved quality of care — and no rate increases for the last two years. The company also pledged to cap its profits at 2%.

At a health system board meeting earlier this month, Ghotbi asked Kaiser for a 4% cap. Between 2010 and 2012, she said, Kaiser took in $87 million more from members here than it cost to serve them, a 15% profit that outpaces its overall margin of 5%.

Wendy Sack, vice president of underwriting for Kaiser, responded that its pricing structure was “put together to compete in the marketplace” and was not directly tied to utilization of services. Hospital patients are sicker overall, she said, and more surgeries are performed on an outpatient basis.

Commissioners called her answers “confusing” and directed Kaiser officials to return for further discussion at a board meeting Thursday.

“You have to come forward with much better explanations for those fees,” health service Commissioner Jean Fraser told Sack. “You’re losing a PR battle.”

In response to an inquiry from The Times, a Kaiser spokeswoman later said that the organization stands apart from competitors because it is fully integrated — with its own hospitals, medical groups and so on. That means “other medical services” and “integrated care management” — which account for 29% of the company’s proposed 2014 premium proposal — include services that other healthcare plans either don’t provide or bill for separately. Examples include injections given during medical visits, secure email communication with doctors, health education classes and disease management.

“It is absolutely untrue to suggest that these categories are used for any purpose other than to classify and account for tangible services delivered to members,” Gerri Ginsburg, director of communications, said in a statement

Ginsburg also noted that as a not-for-profit organization, Kaiser’s “margin” is needed for “investments in new hospitals, medical offices, equipment and technology.”

Brent Fulton, a healthcare market expert at UC Berkeley, said the public pressure on Kaiser was an interesting development, but that the company — which long has underpriced competitors — probably had the negotiating advantage.

“It’s like going to Wal-Mart and saying, ‘You’re making too much profit,’ ” he said. “Wal-Mart will say, ‘OK, so go shop someplace else.’ ”

Still, as a “large employer, with so many customers,” San Francisco is well-positioned to press for change, said Supervisor Mark Farrell, who also is a health system commissioner.

“You’re starting to see it at the federal level, you’re starting to see it at the state level, and I’m certainly going to push for it at the Board of Supervisors here at the city,” he said.

http://news.yahoo.com/obama-orders-us-review-aid-egypt-230407887.html,,[],Obama orders US to review aid to Egypt,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama urged Egypt's military Wednesday to hand back control to a democratic, civilian government without delay, but stopped short of calling the ouster of President Mohammed Morsi a coup.

In a carefully worded statement, Obama said he was ""deeply concerned"" by the military's move to topple Morsi's government and suspend Egypt's constitution. He said he was ordering the U.S. government to assess what the military's actions meant for U.S. foreign aid to Egypt.

Under U.S. law, the government must suspend foreign aid to any nation whose elected leader is ousted in a coup d'etat. The U.S. provides $1.5 billion a year to Egypt in military and economic assistance that is considered a critical U.S. national security priority.

""I now call on the Egyptian military to move quickly and responsibly to return full authority back to a democratically elected civilian government as soon as possible through an inclusive and transparent process, and to avoid any arbitrary arrests of President Morsi and his supporters,"" Obama said.

The U.S. wasn't taking sides in the conflict, committing itself only to democracy and respect for the rule of law, Obama said.

With the threat of further unrest roiling Egypt, the State Department ordered all nonessential U.S. diplomats and the families of all American embassy personnel to leave the country.

Hours earlier, Egyptian armed forces ousted Morsi, an Islamist and Egypt's first democratically elected president, after just a year in power. The military installed a temporary civilian government, suspended the constitution and called for new elections.

Morsi denounced his ouster as a ""full coup"" as millions of his critics erupted in delirious scenes of joy in Egyptian cities after the army chief made the announcement on television.

Obama huddled in the White House Situation Room on Wednesday afternoon with Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, Attorney General Eric Holder and his new national security adviser, former U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice. In his statement after the meeting, Obama said he expected the military to protect the rights of Egypt's men and women to due process and peaceful assembly. He reaffirmed his call for a democratic Egypt that involves participation from secular and religious parties alike.

Story continues

""The voices of all those who have protested peacefully must be heard, including those who welcomed today's developments, and those who have supported President Morsi,"" Obama said, urging all sides to refrain from violence.

Egyptian military leaders have assured the Obama administration that they were not interested in long-term rule following their toppling of Morsi. They appointed a government of civilian technocrats to temporarily run the country in an apparent bid to forestall potential U.S. sanctions, American officials said Wednesday.

If it is deemed that any country's democratically elected leader is deposed by the military, the U.S. must cut off aid. But the administration can take time to make the legal determination about whether Morsi's ouster constituted a coup, and Obama appeared Wednesday to be treading cautiously.

But on Capitol Hill, some lawmakers were preparing next steps. Sen. Patrick Leahy, who heads the Appropriations panel that oversees foreign aid, said he hoped Egypt's military would make good on its vow to return power to the people, but that in the meantime, U.S. law was clear about what should happen.

""My committee also will review future aid to the Egyptian government as we wait for a clearer picture,"" said Leahy, D-Vt.

In conversations with Hagel and Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, senior Egyptian army officers pledged to put a civilian government in place quickly — if not immediately — after removing Morsi from power, the U.S. officials said. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak by name about the private conversations that occurred over the past week.

The officials also said the Egyptian military pledged to take steps to ensure the safety of Americans in Egypt, including the embassy in Cairo and the consulate in Alexandria.

The State Department earlier Wednesday said it had been disappointed with Morsi's response to opposition protesters demanding his ouster, saying the Muslim Brotherhood leader had not presented any plans to address their legitimate concerns when he addressed the nation in a televised speech late Tuesday.

""Last night was an opportunity for him to propose new steps, which he ... did not,"" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said.

Pollak'],Media Ignore Obama's Catholic School Gaffe in Ireland,"The mainstream media in the United States have ignored comments made by President Barack Obama during his a speech in Northern Ireland this week in which he described religious education as a source of conflict.

The president’s comments have sparked widespread controversy and criticism in the Irish media, as well as in Catholic media in the U.S., but the mainstream media have ignored Obama’s contentious remarks.

Obama, who attended an elite private high school, told an audience in Belfast on Monday [emphasis added]:

Because issues like segregated schools and housing, lack of jobs and opportunity — symbols of history that are a source of pride for some and pain for others — these are not tangential to peace; they’re essential to it. If towns remain divided — if Catholics have their schools and buildings, and Protestants have theirs — if we can’t see ourselves in one another, if fear or resentment are allowed to harden, that encourages division. It discourages cooperation.

Catholic media have interpreted the remarks as an attack on religious education itself, and Catholic education in particular. The mainstream media, which seized on every remark made by Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney during his 2012 international trip as a near-disqualifying “gaffe,” have been entirely silent.

While gaffes are usually defined as extemporaneous, off-the-cuff errors or poorly judged statements, Obama’s remarks were planned in advance. The “gaffe” in Obama’s Belfast remarks lies in the fact that Obama did not consider the sensitivities of his audience–or that he inadvertently revealed his own anti-religious prejudice.

To travel to a city troubled by conflict, and to then insult the members of at least one of the two communities, is not only a gaffe, but a serious diplomatic error.

Unless, of course, the speaker is President Barack Obama."

GAO says no action taken on lab safety recommendations from 2009

USDA inspector general found significant violations of bioterror lab regulations went undetected

Key members of Congress call the issues %22troubling%2C%22 and say more oversight is needed

The United States is at increased risk for accidents at laboratories conducting research on potential bioterror germs, such as anthrax, because federal officials have failed to develop national standards for lab design, construction and operation, according to a report to be released Monday by the Government Accountability Office. The GAO called for the standards more than three years ago.

Meanwhile, another recent government audit has found significant failures by federal officials to detect security and safety violations during inspections of bioterror labs. The undetected issues included the transfer of anthrax and plague to an unauthorized facility, and allowing workers at multiple research facilities to remain on the job with expired security risk assessments.

""As a result, there is increased risk of the misuse of select agents and the potential for serious security violations going undetected,"" says the November2012 report by inspector general auditors at the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Security at bioterror labs has been an issue of particular concern since the 2001 anthrax letter attacks that killed five and sickened 17; a scientist at an Army biodefense lab was later implicated.

USDA inspection program officials disputed many of the auditors' findings, called the report's language ""unduly alarming,"" and refused to adopt many of the auditors' recommendations, the report says.

Officials in USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service declined to be interviewed. In a statement issued Friday, spokeswoman Lyndsay Cole said that in January the inspection program agreed to take actions to address all of the auditors' concerns. Cole said ""our inspections are effective at identifying deficiencies.""

The USDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) share responsibility for inspecting numerous individual labs at about 350 government, academic and commercial organizations registered to work with dangerous germs and toxins that have bioterror potential.

The USDA was put in charge of inspecting labs operated by the CDC last summer, in the wake of USA TODAY's reports about safety and security problems at CDC labs in Atlanta.

U.S. Rep. Fred Upton, chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, called the USDA inspector general's findings ""very troubling"" and said they show the need for oversight. He said the committee will be investigating.

""The inadequate and lax inspection practices of USDA raise additional concerns about their ability and independence to conduct effective inspections of CDC's labs to ensure safety,"" said Upton, R-Mich.

U.S. Rep. Henry Waxman of California, the committee's ranking Democrat, said: ""It is troubling that safety and security risks that were identified years ago have still not been fixed, and that the USDA IG has identified additional new vulnerabilities.""

Safety experts also expressed concerns.

Najmedin Meshkati, an engineering professor at the University of Southern California, said the USDA lab inspection program ""may be suffering from a serious safety-culture problem,"" based on his quick review of the audit report.

Richard Ebright, a biosafety expert at Rutgers university in New Jersey, said the repeated failures by USDA inspectors to detect problems is ""significant"" and it ""erodes confidence"" that regulations are being effectively monitored and enforced. Ebright noted that the USDA ""rebuffed"" auditors' recommendations. ""This is one of the most striking parts of the report,"" he said.

CDC officials declined to be interviewed or to discuss audits of their inspection program. In a statement, the CDC said: ""The record stands for itself,"" noting that the agency has performed more than 1,500 inspections over the past 10 years. ""The public should be confident that the critical research and development work to treat and prevent disease associated with select agents in the U.S. is done in a safe and secure manner.""

The USDA generally oversees about 50 organizations with labs that work with pathogens that primarily pose a risk to livestock and crops, and the CDC has primary responsibility for inspecting those at about 300 entities that work with germs that are dangerous to people.

It's unclear what government auditors have found recently in similar audits of the effectiveness of CDC's inspection program. The CDC is audited by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services inspector general, which is still processing USA TODAY's Freedom of Information Act request for the reports.

Incidents involving bioterror agents are rare, according to a CDC report last year in the journal Applied Biosafety. Between 2004 and 2010, there were no reports of thefts and only one confirmed loss, which occurred during the shipment of a fungus that can cause a type of pneumonia called Valley Fever. An FBI investigation of the lost fungus package concluded it was ""apparently destroyed during processing at a commercial shipping facility,"" the CDC researchers' article said.

The CDC report said there were 11 laboratory-acquired infections among 639 potential release incidents reported to the agency during those years among more than 10,000 people with approved access at organizations working with ""select agents,"" the government's term for germs and toxins that have the potential to be used as bioweapons. None of the infections was fatal or involved the disease spreading to others.

USA TODAY reported last month that the HHS inspector general has repeatedly cited the CDC for safety and security problems in the operation of its own labs in Atlanta and Fort Collins, Colo., including failing to secure potential bioterror agents and not properly training employees who work with them. At the time of those reports, issued in 2008 through 2010, the CDC was responsible for inspecting its own labs.

CDC officials have said nobody has been endangered by the lapses because their labs have redundant layers of safety and security to protect employees and the public. When issues arise, they are fixed immediately, the agency says.

Other incidents have also caused concern, including power outages at CDC labs in Atlanta in 2007 and 2008. In 2007, a leaky drainage system was suspected in the release of foot-and-mouth disease virus — a highly infectious livestock disease that can have significant economic consequences — from a vaccine research facility in the United Kingdom and an outbreak on nearby farms, according to the GAO, the investigative arm of Congress.

In 2009, the GAO examined the potential risks posed by the proliferation of ""high-containment labs"" experimenting with dangerous germs, including bioterror agents, in the wake of the 2001 terrorist attacks and increased biodefense funding. The labs' research focuses on such things as developing treatments, vaccines, diagnostic tests and other countermeasures. The GAO concluded that a national oversight strategy was needed, including a periodic assessment of the nation's need for the labs. The report also said national construction, operation and maintenance standards were needed.

But federal security and science officials in the Executive Office of the President have not acted on the recommendations, the GAO said in its new report scheduled to be released Monday. ""There is still no one agency or group that knows the nation's need for all U.S. high-containment laboratories,"" the report said, noting that budget constraints make the need for a national strategy and prioritization ""more critical today than 3years ago.""

The GAO said it remains concerned that there continue to be no national standards for lab design, construction and operation. ""This will make it difficult to be able to assess and guarantee safety,"" the report said.

According to the report, officials in the president's Office of Science and Technology Policy disagreed with the GAO's conclusion that there is an increased risk associated with the increased number of labs and said several actions have been taken since 2009 to strengthen lab security, including the creation of new regulations and committees focused on managing risks. White House officials did not respond to USA TODAY's requests for interviews or comment.

Upton said the lack of action is ""not acceptable"" and that the ""GAO recommendations merit action and engagement by the administration."""

Cardozo Law School, decided to bestow this year’s International Advocate for Peace award on former President Jimmy Carter, they sought to honor his decades as a mediator and humanitarian. But in the process, they ignited a sizable conflict of their own.

That is because Cardozo is a part of Yeshiva University, an Orthodox Jewish institution where support for the state of Israel runs high. And among supporters of Israel, there are few figures more controversial than Mr. Carter, who has repeatedly criticized Israeli policy toward Palestinians and described their circumstances as apartheid.

A group called the Coalition of Concerned Cardozo Alumni constructed a Web site, shameoncardozo.com, and posted a letter declaring the group’s outrage to the law school’s board of overseers. “Jimmy Carter is anathema to the aspirations of the Jewish people and the survival of the State of Israel,” the letter read in part. “Yeshiva University and Cardozo should not give a platform to his slander.” That outrage quickly ricocheted around supporters and critics of Israel, and even made headlines in the Middle East.

Richard M. Joel, the president of Yeshiva University, issued a statement explaining that the journal is run by students, and that it was they, not the university’s administrators, who chose the recipient of the award. However the event plays out, it casts a light on Cardozo’s unusual position as a secular law school within a religious university — one whose mission is in part to “bring wisdom to life by combining the finest contemporary academic education with the timeless teachings of Torah.”"

Pennsylvania state Rep. Stephen Bloom (R) is under fire after seeking cosponsors for legislation that critics say would allow creationism to be taught in the classroom. Bloom denies such claims, saying the bill would spur intellectual debate by allowing K-12 students in public schools to question scientific theories like evolution and climate change, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer.

“With free discourse in the classroom under threat, I will soon be introducing a bill to preserve academic freedom in Pennsylvania’s schools,” Bloom said in a memo. “Efforts to squelch and stifle free critical inquiry in the classroom have too frequently arisen, often in the context of the teaching and debate of controversial scientific theories and paradigms.”

In the memo, sent Aug. 1, Bloom began soliciting fellow politicians to cosponsor the bill, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported.

""In the real world, outside of academia, scientific theory is up for all kinds of argument,"" Bloom said of the bill, which has not been written. ""I don't think it's right to exclude any particular kind of argument prima facie. If a student wants to discuss a criticism, he or she should be able to,"" reports the Philadelphia Inquirer.

Bloom told a local ABC affiliate that he did not intend to insert religion into the classroom, but rather to expand students’ academic freedoms.

""The free exchange of ideas was being quelled by these very strict speech codes in school,"" said Bloom. ""And, so for me ... it's just something from the heart.""

Still, the idea of Bloom’s bill already has prompted opposition from the American Civil Liberties Union in Pennsylvania.

Andy Hoover, legislative director for the Pennsylvania branch of the ACLU, said that it would be difficult to ensure that scientific debates regarding evolution would not veer into religious territory.

""We do think that ultimately some teacher somewhere or students ... will bring religious doctrine into public school classrooms,"" he told a local ABC affiliate.

States like Louisiana and Tennessee currently have similar academic freedom laws in place. At the same time, comparable bills in states like Colorado and Indiana recently failed to pass."

Later, the top aide would participate in a postelection forum with Obama’s campaign manager. He told me (albeit, like a few people I spoke to, under the condition that he not be identified criticizing his party), “I remember thinking, when Jim Messina was going over the specifics of how they broke down and targeted the electorate: ‘I can’t play this game. I have to play a different game, so that I don’t look like an idiot in front of all these people.’ ”

But the problem for the G.O.P. extends well beyond its flawed candidate and his flawed operation. The unnerving truth, which the Red Edge team and other younger conservatives worry that their leaders have yet to appreciate, is that the Republican Party’s technological deficiencies barely begin to explain why the G.O.P. has lost the popular vote in five of the last six presidential elections. The party brand — which is to say, its message and its messengers — has become practically abhorrent to emerging demographic groups like Latinos and African-Americans, not to mention an entire generation of young voters. As one of the party’s most highly respected strategists told me: “It ought to concern people that the most Republican part of the electorate under Ronald Reagan were 18-to-29-year-olds. And today, people I know who are under 40 are embarrassed to say they’re Republicans. They’re embarrassed! They get harassed for it, the same way we used to give liberals a hard time.”

It was not long after the election that elder statesmen of the G.O.P. began offering assurances that all would soon be right. But younger Republicans were not buying it. On Dec. 6, Moffatt addressed an audience of party digital specialists at the R.N.C.’s Capitol Hill Club. Moffatt spoke confidently about how, among other things, the Romney digital team had pretty much all the same tools the Obama campaign possessed. Bret Jacobson was shocked when he read about Moffatt’s claim the next day. “That’s like saying, ‘This Potemkin village will bring us all prosperity!’ ” Jacobson told me. “There’s something to be said for putting on a happy face — except when it makes you sound like Baghdad Bob.”

A few days after the Moffatt gathering, the R.N.C.’s chairman, Reince Priebus, announced that the committee would conduct a wide-ranging investigation — called the Growth and Opportunity Project — into the ways the party was going astray. To guide the investigation were familiar names, like the former Bush White House press secretary Ari Fleischer, the longtime Florida operative Sally Bradshaw and the R.N.C. veteran Henry Barbour. Erik Telford, the 28-year-old founder of the RightOnline bloggers’ convention, told me that he found himself wondering aloud: “Do you want an aggressive investigation from people who’ve built their careers on asking skeptical questions? Or do you want a report from people who are symptomatic of what’s gone wrong?”

Equally galling to younger Republicans was the op-ed Stuart Stevens wrote in The Washington Post on Nov. 28. In it, Romney’s top strategist struck an unrepentant tone, proudly noting that the candidate “carried the majority of middle-class voters” and that the party therefore “must be doing something right.” From her office near the Capitol, Kristen Soltis Anderson, a 28-year-old G.O.P. pollster, tried not to come unglued. “But you didn’t win the election,” she told me she thought at the time. “I’m really glad you scored that touchdown in the third quarter, I am — but you lost the game!”

Anderson is a fantasy-football fanatic, with the rat-a-tat argumentative cadence that gives her away as a former high-school debater. Upon graduating from college, she became the lead singer of the Frustrations, a rock-ska group that folded, as only a D.C.-based band could, when one member decided to attend law school and another needed more time to study for the bar exam. Anderson, for her part, is now a pollster and vice president of the Winston Group. Like the Red Edge partners and virtually every other young Republican with whom I spoke, she regards herself as a socially tolerant, limited-government fiscal conservative. (Today Republicans of all age groups strenuously avoid describing themselves as “moderate,” a term that the far right has made radioactive.) Camera-ready and compulsively perky — she has twice appeared on Bill Maher’s ”Real Time” panel as a token conservative — she nonetheless lapses into despondency when talking about her party’s current state of denial. During one of the postelection panels, Anderson heard a journalist talk about his interviews with Romney staff members who had hoped to build a winning coalition of white voters. “That just stunned me,” she told me one afternoon over coffee. “I thought: Did you not see the census? Because there was one! And it had some pretty big news — like that America’s biggest growing population is the Latino community! Surprise, surprise! How have we not grasped that this is going to be really important?”

One afternoon last month, I flew with Anderson to Columbus, Ohio, to watch her conduct two focus groups. The first consisted of 10 single, middle-class women in their 20s; the second, of 10 20-something men who were either jobless or employed but seeking better work. All of them voted for Obama but did not identify themselves as committed Democrats and were sufficiently ambivalent about the president’s performance that Anderson deemed them within reach of the Republicans. Each group sat around a large conference table with the pollster, while I viewed the proceedings from behind a panel of one-way glass."

The nation's most revered civil rights law emerged from a Supreme Court oral argument in critical condition Wednesday, putting existing remedies to voting discrimination in the South and some other states in danger of being declared unconstitutional.

The conservative justices who hold a slim majority on the court expressed grave doubts that the landmark law can remain intact when its most powerful section is based on a formula devised by Congress nearly a half-century ago.

Should the court rule 5-4 this spring against Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, which requires all or parts of 16 states to clear all voting changes with the federal government, it would silence a weapon used as recently as last year to beat back photo ID laws, redistricting plans and restrictions on early voting.

It also would free Southern states from the burden of federal oversight every time they move a polling place — something Justice Anthony Kennedy, the court's perennial swing vote, likened to being ""under the trusteeship of the United States government.""

The balancing act between states' rights and federal oversight permeated the 77-minute session inside the packed courtroom, where the justices engaged in a sometimes pointed debate about racism and what Justice Antonin Scalia, the court's senior member, called ""racial entitlements.""

Although the South of former Alabama governor George Wallace and the Ku Klux Klan engaged in virulent forms of discrimination, including poll taxes and literacy tests, even liberal justices acknowledged a far different picture today. That put the Obama administration and civil rights advocates on the defensive.

""Is it the government's submission that the citizens in the South are more racist than the citizens in the North?"" Chief Justice John Roberts asked Solicitor General Donald Verrilli, who defended what he called Congress' ""cautious"" reauthorization of the law in 2006.

Probing questions from Roberts and Kennedy made it appear that the die was cast for Section 5. Roberts went so far as to note that Massachusetts now has the worst black turnout in elections compared with whites — and Mississippi, the best.

The voting rights case is sandwiched between several other civil rights cases in a Supreme Court term that could become even more consequential than the previous one, when the court upheld Obama's health care law by the slimmest of margins and shakiest of reasons.

The justices have heard and are on the verge of deciding a case challenging the use of racial preferences in college admissions, a widespread practice among both private and public universities. And next month, they will hear challenges to California's ban on same-sex marriage and a federal law denying benefits to legally married gay and lesbian couples.

If the law falls ...

""It's easy to go broke guessing on the outcome of any Supreme Court argument,"" said Edward Blum, director of the Project on Fair Representation, which solicited the challenge to the law. But he said the questions from Roberts and others ""highlighted the justices' skepticism about the differences in discrimination between the covered and non-covered jurisdictions. Those differences simply don't exist any longer.""

A ruling against the Voting Rights Act would toss the ball back to Congress, which could try to update a coverage formula based on 1964 data that captures Alabama but not Arkansas, Mississippi but not Massachusetts, Texas but not Tennessee. Few observers, however, expect lawmakers to pick and choose among states and municipalities, even if they could overcome political inertia.

""People in the field would be putting pressure on Congress to do something about it,"" said Jon Greenbaum, legal director for the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. ""But we also know that, generally speaking, it's hard to pass any legislation through Congress these days.""

The dramatic argument played out inside a packed courtroom that included such civil rights leaders as Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton and Rep. John Lewis, who led some of the voting rights marches of the 1960s. Outside, hundreds of civil rights activists demonstrated with signs reading, ""Protect My Vote.""

Even before the argument ended, President Obama and congressional leaders of both parties were unveiling a statue of civil rights icon Rosa Parks across the street in the Capitol.

The court's four liberal justices put up a ringing defense of the law and its coverage formula, which remains based on voting patterns and discriminatory practices from 1964. Despite its age, Justice Elena Kagan said, ""the formula seems to be working pretty well"" by targeting states and jurisdictions where lawsuits charging voting discrimination have the greatest success.

That point was emphasized by Debo Adegbile, special counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, who defended the law in court. Through a series of statistics, he said, his side sought to prove that ""discrimination in those places is more persistent and adaptive.""

The remainder of the Voting Rights Act isn't challenged in Shelby County v. Holder, the case from Alabama that came before the high court Wednesday. Regardless of the justices' decision this spring, the law still will provide for legal challenges to voting changes deemed discriminatory in any state.

Those challenges are costly and time-consuming, while Section 5 puts the burden of proof on states and municipalities. Still, Kennedy said, ""it's not clear to me that there's that much difference"" between the two fixes — an indication he might be willing to let Section 5 expire.

The provision faced two major challenges — that its treatment of the South is outdated in light of racial progress there, and that the targeted states and municipalities no longer are substantially different from other parts of the country, where changes in voting practices occasionally include racial or ethnic overtones.

Kennedy said Congress engaged in ""reverse engineering"" in 2006 by reauthorizing a law with a formula that singles out particular states and municipalities. Citing other laws whose usefulness eventually passed, Kennedy simply said, ""Times change.""

Even in 2009, when the court unanimously upheld the law, Roberts warned that ""things have changed in the South"" and the pre-clearance requirements and coverage formula ""raise serious constitutional questions.""

That formula, unchanged for more than 40 years, is based on discriminatory practices and voter registration or turnout data from 1964.

Under that formula, Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia emerged with what those states now consider a scarlet letter. The law was reauthorized in 1970, 1975, 1982 and 2006 with only minor changes — most recently by votes of 98-0 in the Senate and 390-33 in the House.

Bert Rein, the lawyer representing Shelby County, Ala., argued that ""Congress cannot arbitrarily pick out states. Congress has to treat each state with equal dignity.""

A 'racial entitlement'

Scalia contended that the lopsided votes reveal only that lawmakers cannot vote against a law universally hailed as having reduced racial discrimination in the last half of the 20th century. That, he said, is ""a phenomenon that is called perpetuation of racial entitlement.""

""This is not the kind of a question you can leave to Congress,"" he said.

But the court's four liberal justices defended Congress and said the formula singling out mostly Southern states continues to guard against new forms of voting discrimination.

""Of course this is aimed at states,"" Justice Stephen Breyer said. ""What do you think the Civil War was about?""

The current court took its first bite into the law in 2009, ruling that a Texas water district — and any municipality, for that matter — could bail out of Section 5 by demonstrating 10 years of good behavior. More than 200 municipalities have done so since the law's inception. But the court punted on the broader question of its constitutionality.

""The historic accomplishments of the Voting Rights Act are undeniable,"" Roberts wrote for the court, citing voter registration and turnout levels and ""unprecedented"" numbers of minority elected officials.

Justice Clarence Thomas, the court's lone black member who sat customarily silent on Wednesday, made his dissatisfaction with the law known at the time.

""The extensive pattern of discrimination that led the court to previously uphold Section 5 ... no longer exists,"" he wrote in partial dissent. ""There is no evidence that public officials stand ready, if given the chance, to again engage in concerted acts of violence, terror and subterfuge in order to keep minorities from voting.""

Last year's election cycle, while lacking in violence and terrorism, did feature what civil rights groups said were efforts at electoral subterfuge. In Texas, Florida and South Carolina, the Voting Rights Act helped block photo ID laws, redistricting maps and limits on early voting that could have disadvantaged minorities.

But Shelby County Attorney Frank Ellis said after the court session that the South truly has changed and deserves to be treated the same as the rest of the nation.

""It is our hope that the court will recognize the great strides Shelby County and the other covered jurisdictions have made during the last 40 years in providing equal electoral opportunities for minorities,"" Ellis said.

http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/26/us/supreme-court-ruling.html,2013-06-26 00:00:00,['Adam Liptak'],Supreme Court Invalidates Key Part of Voting Rights Act,"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Tuesday effectively struck down the heart of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 by a 5-to-4 vote, freeing nine states, mostly in the South, to change their election laws without advance federal approval.

The court divided along ideological lines, and the two sides drew sharply different lessons from the history of the civil rights movement and the nation’s progress in rooting out racial discrimination in voting. At the core of the disagreement was whether racial minorities continued to face barriers to voting in states with a history of discrimination.

“Our country has changed,” Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote for the majority. “While any racial discrimination in voting is too much, Congress must ensure that the legislation it passes to remedy that problem speaks to current conditions.”

The decision will have immediate practical consequences. Texas announced shortly after the decision that a voter identification law that had been blocked would go into effect immediately, and that redistricting maps there would no longer need federal approval. Changes in voting procedures in the places that had been covered by the law, including ones concerning restrictions on early voting, will now be subject only to after-the-fact litigation."

Dionne: Holder fights back on voting rights,"Attorney General Eric Holder has opened what will be an epic battle over whether our country will remain committed to equal rights at the ballot box. In a display of egregious judicial activism in late June, the conservative majority on the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act. Holder made clear last week he intends to fight back.

The struggle will begin in Texas, but it won’t end there. “We cannot allow the slow unraveling of the progress that so many, throughout history, have sacrificed so much to achieve,” Holder told the National Urban League’s annual conference.

He wasn’t exaggerating the stakes. From the moment the Supreme Court threw out Section 4 of the act, which subjected the voting laws in states and jurisdictions with a history of discrimination to Justice Department scrutiny, conservative legislators in those places gleefully signaled their intention to pass laws to make it harder to vote. In addition, Texas reimposed a redistricting map that a federal court had already ruled was discriminatory.

These hasty moves were unseemly but entirely predictable, proving that Chief Justice John Roberts’s opinion in the case will become a Magna Carta for voter suppression. Without having to worry about “pre-clearance” from the Justice Department, legislators can go about their business of making it more difficult for voters who would throw them out of office to reach the polls — and of drawing racially gerrymandered districts that prolong their tenure. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg understood a logic here that escaped Roberts. “A governing political coalition,” she wrote in her dissent, “has an incentive to prevent changes in the existing balance of voting power.”

This in turn means that when a political party fares poorly with minority voters, it will try to turn them away from the polling booths. That’s what segregationist Southern Democrats did in the past. Many Republican-controlled legislatures are doing it now.

Holder announced he was using Section 3, a different part of the Voting Rights Act that was left standing, to ask a federal court to re-subject Texas to pre-clearance. It is a less efficient way to achieve what the pre-gutted act allowed automatically, but it is the best that can be done for now. It would be better still if Congress reinstated a revised version of Section 4. In the meantime, the hope is to limit the damage of the high court’s folly — and perhaps give other states pause before they rush into new discriminatory schemes.

“This is the department’s first action to protect voting rights following the [Supreme Court] decision, but it will not be our last,” Holder declared. His department is likely to move this week against the Texas voter-identification law and eventually to go to court against other states that pass comparable statutes.

To get a sense of how bad these laws are, consider the bill, which should be called the Omnibus Voter Suppression Act of 2013, that Republicans recently rushed through both houses of North Carolina’s legislature. It reads like a parody written for Stephen Colbert’s show with its cornucopia of provisions that would make it as hard as possible for African Americans, Latinos and young people to vote.

As the Charlotte Observer reported, it shortens the early voting period, eliminates the opportunity to register and vote on the same day during that time, and ends preregistration for teenagers 16 to 17. The bill also prevents counties from extending voting hours when lines are long — which they will be with the cutback on early voting days. It not only requires photo identification but also narrows the list of what’s acceptable, eliminating college IDs, for example.

Oh, yes, and remember the old civic tradition of using all avenues to encourage people to register to vote, a favorite cause of that famously revolutionary group, the League of Women Voters? This bill would ban paid voter registration drives.

Throughout the world, our country proclaims its commitment to equal rights and broad democratic participation. We seem to be abandoning those ideals at home. You have to wonder what this will do to our witness on behalf of democracy.

It won’t shock you to learn that after Holder made his announcement, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas condemned the Obama administration for showing an “utter contempt for our country’s system of checks and balances.”

Actually, what Holder’s move shows is an utter contempt for efforts to deprive our fellow Americans of their right to cast a meaningful ballot. It is a contempt that all of us should feel.

What the court got inarguably correct was that times have changed since the signature act of the civil rights era was passed in 1965. In the Southern states and the other jurisdictions whose voting practices were put under authority of the federal government, black Americans are no longer blatantly barred from exercising their constitutional right to cast a ballot to choose their leaders. In fact, blacks are holding more elected offices and voting in greater numbers than ever.

Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and the conservative majority on the court reasoned that because the situation had changed so dramatically, there was no longer a justifiable need for the U.S. Justice Department to hold veto power over the way local and state officials in the affected jurisdictions set their rules for voting. To do so would be to discriminate against those states and localities.

What the court majority failed to recognize, or simply ignored, was what the court’s minority of liberals pointed out: There is discrimination at work, but it is not the state and local officials who are the victims of that discrimination; it is still minority voters.

It is a different type of discrimination, and it may be popping up in different places. Before 1965, black voters were kept from voting in many areas of the South and elsewhere simply because of the color of their skin — racism in its purest form. What is happening today is that black voters are having their influence on elections suppressed, not strictly because they are black, but because of the way black people vote: They are overwhelmingly Democrats.

As became evident during the 2012 election campaign, Republican officials in numerous states — not just in the South, but in states such as Ohio and Pennsylvania as well — tried to employ various means to discourage blacks and Latinos from voting. New identification requirements were instituted, voting hours and days were curtailed and polling places in minority communities were hard to find, fewer in number and inadequately staffed.

A signature scene of the election was the picture of long lines stretching away from polls in black communities where voters had to wait hour after hour for their chance to vote. Such shamefully long lines were not in evidence in white neighborhoods — not because fewer white people were voting, but because whites were provided more places to vote.

Prior to all of that in states such as Texas, Republican legislatures passed redistricting plans with lines drawn to limit the influence of black and Latino voters and ensure a system that favors white Republican candidates.

All of this may not be pure racism, but it is certainly politically motivated discrimination. Thanks to the court decision, the federal government has lost one big weapon to fight such discrimination. And thanks to the way certain states and localities have manipulated voting rules and district lines, we have a U.S. House controlled by Republicans who have a vested interest in making sure no new voting rights measure ever becomes law."

On Thursday, members of Respect Arizona and Citizens for a Better Arizona -- who launched the recall effort against Arpaio -- failed to gather the necessary 335,000 valid voter signatures by the 5 p.m. deadline. The aim was to force a recall election.

Activists behind the recall effort would not say how many signatures they were short. Randy Parraz, president of Citizens for Better Arizona, only said the two groups had collected close to 300,000 signatures.

Arpaio, reelected in November, blasted the group in a prepared statement.

“After months of name calling, after the disparaging effigies and theatrics … this latest recall effort has failed,” Arpaio said. “This effort failed because the good people of Maricopa County, whom I’m honored to serve, rejected the wrongheaded idea of overturning an election.”

The groups had struggled to raise funds necessary to hire paid signature gatherers — key to these sort of efforts. Instead, the groups relied heavily on volunteers to gather signatures against the six-term sheriff who is something of an institution in Arizona’s largest county.

Parraz, who led a successful recall against state Senate President Russell Pearce two years ago, said Thursday’s setback wouldn’t stop Arpaio’s critics.

“This fight is not over,” Parraz said.

The groups gained momentum after a federal judge ruled Friday that the immigration enforcement policies employed by Arpaio violated the Constitution.

Judge Judge G. Murray Snow found that Arpaio’s deputies used racial profiling when they detained people they suspected of residing in the country illegally.

The 142-page ruling came as part of a lawsuit brought on behalf of Latino plaintiffs who accused the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office of using race as a major factor in initiating immigration enforcement stops.

Arpaio has promised to appeal the ruling.

Parraz said the movement was “vindicated” by Snow’s ruling and plans to put pressure on the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors not to fund Arpaio’s appeal.

The “We the People Amendment” is being introduced by Representative Rick Nolan (DFL-Minnesota) and Representative Mark Pocan (D-Wisconsin). http://WeThePeopleAmendment.org How much different was our politics the day before Citizen’s United and the day after? How different would the outcome of the 2012 elections be absent Citizen’s United? It would not be very different. There are two reasons this is likely the case. The first is that each side uses the same rules to maximize their political dollars and diverging interests are currently relatively equal. The second is that there is a point of diminishing returns. After TV, Radio, print, and online ads are saturated in a relatively balanced manner from both sides, they become simply fog to the average American citizen, and no longer has influence. At that point ideology is the driving factor. For several elections, this country has been voting as a center left country and it continues to vote that way. What is the concern then? The concern is the same; the corrosive effect money has on our politics. Favors are owed to those big donors on both sides of the aisle. Moreover, big donors usually find a way to have their foot in every door and as such donate to each side. The Citizens United case in effect equates money and speech. Since we have freedom of speech, it effectively removed the government’s authority to regulate unlimited political contributions. There is only one solution to this corruption, a constitutional amendment that specifically decouples money from speech and removes corporate personhood. This will ensure that while free speech is maintained, the use of money in politics can be regulated. Moreover it will remove the ability of corporate entities of any kind (corporations, non-profits, unions, etc.) from claiming free speech rights and other rights of living breathing human beings. Many organizations are already working on constitutional amendments purported to solve the problem. Most solely concentrate on the overturning of ""Citizens United"" or codifying that money is not speech. Again the question must be asked, what is the difference pre and post Citizens United. The organization Move to Amend (http://movetoamend.org) is the only one currently working on an all-encompassing amendment that will solve the corruption, once and for all as it covers both the decoupling of money and speech, as well as removing corporate personhood. Move to Amend, by means of its over 160 affiliates have already gotten resolutions passed at the city, county, and state levels. Following the grassroots method of building awareness through the resolution process is likely the most effective way of generating popular support for real change in our electoral and political process. This is how the process of real change begins. It is the engagement of the grassroots and electoral politics."
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jonathan-weiler/chief-justice-roberts-and_b_3503768.html,2013-06-26 12:08:33-04:00,"['Director Of Undergraduate Studies In Global Studies', 'Unc Chapel Hill']",Chief Justice Roberts and the Right-Wing Majority's True Colors,"When John Roberts came before the Senate in 2005 for confirmation as Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, many scribes penned encomiums to this undeniably conservative, but seemingly eminently reasonable and restrained judge. Writing in the New Yorker, Hendrick Hertzberg expressed concerns about Roberts views once he reached the high court. But he also allowed that Roberts was ""not, it appears, a hater; nor is he even a particularly rigid ideologue. Unlike Justices Scalia and Thomas, Roberts does not project a sense of resentful beleaguerment.""

Roberts, of course, worked assiduously to cultivate that image, famously insisting during his opening remarks before the Senate that he was merely an umpire calling balls and strikes and enforcing the rules of the game, not making them up. Then-Senator Biden did point out to Roberts that different umps had different strike zones and it was fair to ask Roberts a little bit about what his was. Roberts, an evidently highly intelligent and polished man, sailed through those hearings.

All of this, mind you, was obvious BS even at the time, to anyone paying attention. As I wrote during the confirmation hearings:

""Roberts' career is characterized not so much by a generalized fealty to judicial restraint, but to a highly selective version thereof, one that consistently favors powerful interests over the less advantaged and that appears consistently to advance the preferred conservative agenda of the day. According to [a report by the Alliance for Justice]: ""one can discern that Judge Roberts holds a troublingly limited view of the federal government's authority to enact key worker, civil rights and environmental safeguards and a similarly troublingly narrow view of the vital role of our courts and our government play in safeguarding our individual rights, especially civil and women's rights....these views, taken together, could produce a government with less power to protect ordinary people and give ordinary people less power to protect themselves from abuse by government and other powerful interests.""

This is, of course, precisely who Roberts has turned out to be. In order to arrive at yesterday's opinion, which the seasoned legal observer Paul Campos described as a ""travesty... of basic legal reasoning,"" Roberts had to create a new legal doctrine out of whole cloth. The Chief Justice insisted that the portions of the Voting Rights Act struck down yesterday violated the ""fundamental principle of equal sovereignty of the states."" The eminent jurist Richard Posner responded by saying ""this is a principle of constitutional law of which I have never heard"" because, in fact, ""there is no such principle.""

In fact, the toner cartridge was barely dry on Roberts' execrable opinion yesterday when several states announced that previously blocked voter suppression laws would go into force immediately, including in Texas -- where hundreds of thousands of voters might now be adversely affected -- and Mississippi.

Writing in the Nation, Ari Berman rightly denounced the Court's right-wing majority in a post yesterday titled, ""What the Supreme Court doesn't understand about the Voting Rights Act."" And in the piece itself, Berman quoted from Justice Ginsburg's dissent -- ""The sad irony of today's decision lies in its utter failure to grasp why the VRA has proven so effective."" The sentiments are understandable -- and in Ginsburg's case, perhaps professionally prudent -- but the premises are wrong. The right-wing majority understands precisely how the VRA has been effective. That is why they gutted it. There is no misunderstanding, no well-intentioned but misguided application of the law. They are neither dumb nor naïve. They are merely without conscience. When Chief Justice Roberts extolled the progress of the past fifty years in justifying his decision to try to undermine that progress, the irony should have been lost on no one, since the conservative movement has worked ceaselessly to try to roll back and reverse that progress. (Remember Trent Lott, former Senate Majority leader, lamenting in 2002 how much better things would have been if Strom Thurmond's vision of a segregated America had prevailed?)

As Adam Serwer wrote yesterday, Roberts has worked hard to avoid being painted with that brush. Serwer reminded readers that during oral arguments in February in the Shelby v. Holder case -- the one the Court ruled on -- Scalia blurted out that the Voting Rights Act represented the ""perpetuation of racial entitlement."" One needs to step back for a moment to appreciate just how extraordinary and revealing that statement was. Roberts himself appears to have been a determined opponent of the VRA since he was a young lawyer in the Reagan Justice Department in the early 1980s (so much for his claim that the long passage of time now provides a justification for gutting the law). But Roberts doesn't project an air of ""resentful beleaguerment."" And just as it's become a favored trick of the contemporary right to pretend to admire Martin Luther King while trying to undermine everything he stood for, so the clever and cunning Roberts knew enough in his Shelby opinion to pretend to extol the virtues of a law he has long wanted to bury. He's tried to put a ""moderate"" face on what has been a consistently extremist agenda, but it's that agenda, including rolling back civil rights protections to the maximum possible extent -- that animates Roberts and his cronies' jurisprudence (and see Rick Hasen's discussion about why Roberts thought it might be politically prudent to hold off on killing affirmative action for the time being). Emily Bazelon, in Slate, described Roberts as a ""stealth conservative"" who has successfully concealed his political agenda. That gig should have been up before he ever reached the high court.

But yesterday should have removed the last shred of doubt. Roberts is a Stepford judge -- the tip of the spear of the conservative movement's three decade long march through the judiciary -- a robotic ideologue ceaselessly committed to undermining legal protections for the vulnerable while further stacking the deck in favor of the already-powerful. There's no principle here -- no respect for judicial restraint, or original intent or limited government or any of the other nonsense by which right-wingers try to defend their judicial ""philosophy."" Only a remorseless attack on common decency for the sake of enriching and empowering their ideological allies."

The group is connected to Hollywood actress Eva Longoria, a longtime supporter of President Barack Obama’s political campaigns.

Gold notes that the Soros adviser and a network of about 30 other left-wing “donors, fundraisers and union leaders” met on Friday to develop “a strategy to make the [immigration] issue central in next year’s midterm elections if Congress does not pass a bill, identifying 10 House Republicans who would be vulnerable to pressure from Latino constituents.”

“The meeting was attended by officials from several labor unions, including the National Education Association and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, as well as representatives of deep-pocketed backers of liberal causes, including a political adviser to billionaire George Soros,” Gold added.

The 10 Republicans they are targeting are Reps. Jeff Denham (R-CA), Buck McKeon (R-CA), Gary Miller (R-CA), David Valadao (R-CA), Daniel Webster (R-FL), Mike Coffman (R-CO), Scott Tipton (R-CA), Joe Heck (R-NV), Steve Pearce (R-NM), and Randy Weber (R-TX). These representatives are largely split on immigration efforts.

Pearce, for instance, does not support the Senate’s “Gang of Eight” bill or anything like it. “You can’t get control of the borders if you tell people you can come here illegally and you can work until you work your way to the front of the line,” Pearce said in an interview with the New York Times‘ Ashley Parker in August. “The whole world would want to do it that way. Who would want to wait and do it properly?”

Weber, who represents the district of former Rep. Ron Paul (R-TX), spoke at an anti-amnesty rally on Capitol Hill in June alongside Reps. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) and Steve King (R-TX). “The president has the authority to secure our border,” Weber said at the event. “He should do it today. In fact he should have done it yesterday.”

Denham, on the other hand, supports amnesty, at one point issuing verbal support for the Senate bill but backtracking after immense pressure from conservatives and constituents over the course of August. Since the congressional recess, Denham has come out to publicly endorse House Democrats’ amnesty plan, which was introduced by House Minority Leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) earlier this month. Denham has also publicly claimed that House Speaker John Boehner promised that in the next “month or so” there would be a vote on immigration legislation in the House of Representatives.

Boehner spokesman Michael Steel has not confirmed or denied these claims.

The group of left-wing donors that Soros’ top political aide attended was borne out of a fundraising committee called the Futuro Fund, which raised more than $30 million for Obama’s re-election campaing. “Led by actress Eva Longoria, Puerto Rico lawyer Andres Lopez and San Antonio businessman Henry R. Muñoz III, the fund represented the most robust demonstration yet of the Latino community’s ability to amass cash for U.S. political campaigns,” Gold wrote.

Cristobal Alex, a former program officer at the Ford Foundation, left his position there to lead the Latino Victory Project as the new group’s president. “What we want to do with the Latino Victory Project is build political power in the Latino community, so that the faces of Latinos are reflected not just in every level of government but in the policies that drive the country forward,” Alex said.

Moving forward, the Post noted, the group will agree to spend anywhere from $1 million to $2 million per target district. “The effort will begin in coming weeks with a campaign aimed at persuading the lawmakers to back an immigration measure this year,” Gold wrote. “If that fails, the group plans to run a barrage of radio and TV ads against them next year.”

The AFL-CIO’s immigration campaign manager, Tom Snyder, said each of these GOP lawmakers has a target on their backs. “There was agreement in the room that if we don’t see action in the House, we know who we’re going after,” Snyder said. “There’s a realization that we have to get back to basics. We’re at the point where if you don’t act, we’re going to have to make you pay at the ballot box.”

Amalia Perea Mahoney, a Chicago-area art gallery owner who the Los Angeles Times reported raked in between $200,000 and $500,000 for Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign, said the group is “all very united” in its purpose. “I think it’s a pivotal moment,” she said. Mahoney is also an Obama appointee to an federal arts board.

Soros has spent $100 million since 1997 backing what his Open Society Foundation calls “immigrant rights” groups and projects. Some of those projects, like Soros’ National Immigration Forum-backed Evangelical Immigration Table (EIT), were meant to create the illusion of grassroots support for amnesty where there was none. Recent polling data released by NumbersUSA, conducted by Pulse Opinion Research, shows that Evangelical Republican likely voters disagree with the push for amnesty despite the Soros group’s claims there is grassroots support among Evangelicals for the policy.

Recently, Rep. Raul Labrador (R-ID), a supporter of immigration reform, withdrew from the House’s version of the Senate’s “Gang of Eight” and announced his public opposition to negotiating with Obama and the Senate on immigration, saying such negotiations would be “crazy” for House GOP leadership to enter into. Labrador said House GOP leadership would not be smart to deal with these people because they are trying to “destroy” the Republican Party."

Because they use the national voter registration form which states must accept, Kobach is working on a unique loophole: file that form, and you can only vote for Senate/House races, you must file a separate form if you want to vote for Governor, State Assembly, your city offices, etc.



Rep. Jim Ward, D-Wichita, an opponent of the proof-of-citizenship law, said he received confirmation from the Department of Legislative Research this week that Kobach is moving forward with the plan to limit voters who follow federal registration rules to voting only in federal elections.



Separately, a memo to all the state’s county election officials outlines procedures for identifying and tracking voters who use the federal form and creating a separate category for them in voting databases.

“This means you should take note when a federal form comes to your office and keep a list of the names of individuals who submit them … Whichever form a person uses, if an applicant does not submit a U.S. citizenship document, you must follow up and request one.” Voters who fill out the state form and don’t submit the citizenship proof have their voting privileges suspended until they do. At present about 17,500 voters are “in suspense.” Kobach, Bryant’s boss, confirmed he’s planning for elections with different ballots for different voters, depending on whether they register under federal or state rules. He said it’s “merely a contingency plan” in case he loses a lawsuit seeking to make federal officials adopt Kansas rules for voters in Kansas.

Kobach’s legal analysis of the decision is that it applies to federal elections only. “The federal government doesn’t have the authority to tell Kansas what to do in Kansas elections,” he said. That, too, will probably have to be decided by a court.

But maybe that isn't enough. Maybe voter confusion and multiple sets of ballots might also help defeat your opponents.Kobach kicks off with a great response of why this is all a good idea:See here! You can't tell us what to do! We set our own rules, we can shut out voters however we please!

The ACLU has countered if Kobach continues on this path they will begin a lawsuit in November.

For Kansans, this is just one more reason to try and make real change in this state...

Update: Thank You For making this hit the top of the Rec list. I wish this was a happier issue, but I'm glad that it gains attention. Kris Kobach has written a lot of legislation, from Arizona's immigration bill and now Kansas and soon Arizona's voting acts, which will be mirrors of each other. There has to be a real effort to change some outcomes in Kansas.. if not, Kansas will be the shining light for those who wish to oppress and deny the vote. I'd prefer my state not be the beacon that showed the way to taint elections and curtail the rights of so many."

His Latest Book Is', 'Code Red', 'How Progressives', 'Moderates Can Unite To Save Our Country.']",E.J. Dionne: Holder fights back on voting rights,"Attorney General Eric Holder has opened what will be an epic battle over whether our country will remain committed to equal rights at the ballot box. In a display of egregious judicial activism in late June, the conservative majority on the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act. Holder made clear last week he intends to fight back.

The struggle will begin in Texas, but it won’t end there. “We cannot allow the slow unraveling of the progress that so many, throughout history, have sacrificed so much to achieve,” Holder told the National Urban League’s annual conference.

He wasn’t exaggerating the stakes. From the moment the Supreme Court threw out Section 4 of the act, which subjected the voting laws in states and jurisdictions with a history of discrimination to Justice Department scrutiny, conservative legislators in those places gleefully signaled their intention to pass laws to make it harder to vote. In addition, Texas reimposed a redistricting map that a federal court had already ruled was discriminatory.

These hasty moves were unseemly but entirely predictable, proving that Chief Justice John Roberts’s opinion in the case will become a Magna Carta for voter suppression. Without having to worry about “pre-clearance” from the Justice Department, legislators can go about their business of making it more difficult for voters who would throw them out of office to reach the polls — and of drawing racially gerrymandered districts that prolong their tenure. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg understood a logic here that escaped Roberts. “A governing political coalition,” she wrote in her dissent, “has an incentive to prevent changes in the existing balance of voting power.”

This in turn means that when a political party fares poorly with minority voters, it will try to turn them away from the polling booths. That’s what segregationist Southern Democrats did in the past. Many Republican-controlled legislatures are doing it now.

Holder announced he was using Section 3, a different part of the Voting Rights Act that was left standing, to ask a federal court to re-subject Texas to pre-clearance. It is a less efficient way to achieve what the pre-gutted act allowed automatically, but it is the best that can be done for now. It would be better still if Congress reinstated a revised version of Section 4. In the meantime, the hope is to limit the damage of the high court’s folly — and perhaps give other states pause before they rush into new discriminatory schemes.

“This is the department’s first action to protect voting rights following the [Supreme Court] decision, but it will not be our last,” Holder declared. His department is likely to move this week against the Texas voter-identification law and eventually to go to court against other states that pass comparable statutes.

To get a sense of how bad these laws are, consider the bill, which should be called the Omnibus Voter Suppression Act of 2013, that Republicans recently rushed through both houses of North Carolina’s legislature. It reads like a parody written for Stephen Colbert’s show with its cornucopia of provisions that would make it as hard as possible for African Americans, Latinos and young people to vote.

As the Charlotte Observer reported, it shortens the early voting period, eliminates the opportunity to register and vote on the same day during that time, and ends preregistration for teenagers 16 to 17. The bill also prevents counties from extending voting hours when lines are long — which they will be with the cutback on early voting days. It not only requires photo identification but also narrows the list of what’s acceptable, eliminating college IDs, for example.

Oh, yes, and remember the old civic tradition of using all avenues to encourage people to register to vote, a favorite cause of that famously revolutionary group, the League of Women Voters? This bill would ban paid voter registration drives.

Throughout the world, our country proclaims its commitment to equal rights and broad democratic participation. We seem to be abandoning those ideals at home. You have to wonder what this will do to our witness on behalf of democracy.

It won’t shock you to learn that after Holder made his announcement, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas condemned the Obama administration for showing an “utter contempt for our country’s system of checks and balances.”

Actually, what Holder’s move shows is an utter contempt for efforts to deprive our fellow Americans of their right to cast a meaningful ballot. It is a contempt that all of us should feel.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/24/arpaio-racial-profiling_n_3333907.html,2013-05-24 00:00:00,[],"Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio Racially Profiled Latinos, Federal Judge Rules","PHOENIX, May 24 (Reuters) - Arizona lawman Joe Arpaio violated the constitutional rights of Latino drivers in his crackdown on illegal immigration, a federal judge found on Friday, and ordered him to stop using race as a factor in law enforcement decisions.

The ruling against the Maricopa County sheriff came in response to a class-action lawsuit brought by Hispanic drivers that tested whether police can target illegal immigrants without racially profiling U.S. citizens and legal residents of Hispanic origin.

U.S. District Court Judge Murray Snow ruled that the sheriff's policies violated the drivers' constitutional rights and ordered Arpaio's office to cease using race or ancestry as a grounds to stop, detain or hold occupants of vehicles - some of them in crime sweeps dubbed ""saturation patrols.""

""The great weight of the evidence is that all types of saturation patrols at issue in this case incorporated race as a consideration into their operations,"" Snow said in a written ruling.

He added that race had factored into which vehicles the deputies decided to stop, and into who they decided to investigate for immigration violations.

The lawsuit contended that Arpaio, who styles himself ""America's toughest sheriff,"" and his officers violated the constitutional rights of both U.S. citizens and legal immigrants alike in their zeal to crack down on people they believe to be in the country illegally.

The ruling came days after a U.S. Senate panel approved a landmark comprehensive immigration legislation that would usher in the biggest changes in immigration policy in a generation if passed by Congress.

The bill would put 11 million immigrants without legal status on a 13-year path to citizenship while further strengthening security along the porous southwestern border with Mexico.

Arpaio declined comment on the ruling. A sheriff's spokesman referred a request for comment to attorney Tim Casey, who said he was reading the ruling and had no immediate comment.

'ILLEGAL AND PLAIN UN-AMERICAN'

Cecillia Wang, director of the American Civil Liberties Union Immigrants' Rights Project and plaintiffs' counsel, called the judge's ruling ""an important victory that will resound far beyond Maricopa County.""

""Singling people out for traffic stops and detentions simply because they're Latino is illegal and just plain un-American,"" Wang said after the ruling was made public.

""Let this be a warning to anyone who hides behind a badge to wage their own private campaign against Latinos or immigrants that there is no exception in the Constitution for violating people's rights in immigration enforcement.""

During testimony in the non-jury trial last year, Arpaio said he was against racial profiling and denied his office arrested people because of the color of their skin.

The sheriff, who won re-election to a sixth term in November, has been a lightning rod for controversy over his aggressive enforcement of immigration laws in the state, which borders Mexico, as well as an investigation into the validity of President Barack Obama's U.S. birth certificate.

The lawsuit was brought against Arpaio and his office on behalf of five Hispanic drivers who said they had been stopped by deputies because of their ethnicity.

The plaintiffs, which include the Somos America immigrants' rights coalition and all Latino drivers stopped by the sheriff's office since 2007, were seeking corrective action but not monetary damages.

Arpaio has been the subject of other probes and lawsuits. In August, the U.S. Attorney's Office in Arizona said it had closed a criminal investigation into accusations of financial misconduct by Arpaio, and it declined to bring charges.

A separate U.S. Justice Department investigation and lawsuit relating to accusations of civil rights abuses by Arpaio's office is ongoing.

Arizona has been at the heart of a bitter national debate over immigration since Republican Governor Jan Brewer signed a 2010 crackdown on illegal immigration.

The federal government challenged the crackdown in court and said the U.S. Constitution gives it sole authority over immigration policy. The U.S. Supreme Court, however, has allowed to stand the part of the law permitting police to question people they stop about their immigration status.

1. Eliminate the Appalachian State University (ASU) early one-stop voting site.

2. Force all early voting into one location hard to access by students, faculty, and staff at ASU.

3. Outlaw any verbal public comment at Board meetings and require that written comments be screened to ensure they were ""pertinent"" and communicated without cussing or libel.

4. Require that the 27-year Elections Board Director, a woman totally on the straight up and beloved by the entire county, not be allowed to meet with anyone in her office without supervision.

5. Mandate that anyone calling into the local BOE office have their names recorded.

6. Move the ""New River"" precinct (a heavily populated precinct in and around the town of Boone) out into the very corner of the precinct into a virtually unknown location and as far away from municipal voters as possible.

7. Combine three Boone precincts into one Super Precinct consisting of 9,300 voters and 35 parking spaces. Oh. And away as far as possible from ASU.

The crowd of 60 plus (considerable for our little Town) was pissed as hell. We're talking screaming, yelling, booing, ""shame on you,"" ""what are you trying to hide,"".... At one point one of the Republican meatheads threatened to have the public arrested. The response from the crowd was an immediate ""bring it on."" Here's the initial local press account.

If you've got an hour, grab a cup of coffee (or a beer and an sandwich) and check out the video from the rest of the meeting. It's. worth. every. inch. of. your. time. But I can't embed it.

Now let's face it. A lot of small county Democratic parties would just give it all up right then and there. Afterall, what good would an appeal to the State Board of Elections do? That Board, appointed by Governor McCrory (in other words Art Pope) is also controlled by right-wingers, bent on not just drowning state progressives, but chopping them off at the head first.

Unfortunately for them our local Democratic Party just by nature ain't so inclined to go quietly into that good night. And before they can chop off our heads, we're determined to drag them to shore for all to see.

We've put 24/7 into fighting back against all odds, and while we know that in the end we are unlikely to be able to overturn the local Board's decision, we are still at it. The lone Democrat on the Board, Kathleen Campbell, has put in a petition to the state. The NAACP is now looking into our fight, and Common Cause has formally urged Governor McCrory to get involved. After all, he said earlier this week that it was wrong for partisan politics to be a factor in selecting precincts. The Mayor of Boone has written a scathing letter to the Chairman of the State Board of Elections.

We're bringing the evil into the light anywhere and everywhere.

And thanks to Rachel Maddow for putting our fight on the national map.

Jan Brewer has lost again.

Gov. Jan Brewer has lost again.

In a 7-2 decision announced Monday morning , the Supreme Court of the United States has rejected the state of Arizona's efforts to add a proof of citizenship requirement to voter registration forms. The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (a/k/a ""The Motor Voter Law"") requires States to “accept and use” a uniform federal form to register voters for federal elections, and the Court now holds that states cannot graft additional requirements onto that form, which only requires that voters affirm that they are citizens.

Justice Scalia—yes, him—wrote the decision of the court, a majority consisting of everyone other than Justices Thomas and Alito. It relies on the Elections Clause of the Constitution (Art. I, §4, cl. 1), which provides that while states have preliminary control over federal elections, Congress can supersede the states' choices:

The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations, except as to the places of chusing Senators.

When Congress legislates with respect to the “Times, Places and Manner” of holding congressional elections, it necessarily displaces some element of a pre-existing legal regime erected by the States. Because the power the Elections Clause confers is none other than the power to preempt, the reasonable assumption is that the statutory text accurately communicates the scope of Congress’s preemptive intent. Moreover, the federalism concerns underlying the presumption in the Supremacy Clause context are somewhat weaker here. Unlike the States’ “historic police powers,” the States’ role in regulating congressional elections—while weighty and worthy of respect—has always existed subject to the express qualification that it “terminates according to federal law.” In sum, there is no compelling reason not to read Elections Clause legislation simply to mean what it says. We conclude that the fairest reading of the statute is that a state-imposed requirement of evidence of citizenship not required by the Federal Form is “inconsistent with” the NVRA’s mandate that States “accept and use” the Federal Form. If this reading prevails, the Elections Clause requires that Arizona’s rule give way.

And, basically, the Court holds that when the NVRA says the states must ""accept and use"" the federal form, it must accept and use them as sufficient to register voters:The majority notes that the state may use information in its possession to refuse to register a voter, but it cannot require the voter to show her papers first. At most, Arizona can ask the federal Elections Assistance Commission (EAC) for permission to amend its form, as Louisiana did in 2012 to require applicants who lack a Louisiana driver’s license, ID card, or Social Security number to attach additional documentation (such as a utility bill) to the completed Federal Form.

The justices voted 7-2 to throw out Arizona's voter-approved requirement that prospective voters document their U.S. citizenship in order to use a registration form produced under the federal ""Motor Voter"" voter registration law.

Federal law ""precludes Arizona from requiring a federal form applicant to submit information beyond that required by the form itself,"" Justice Antonia Scalia wrote for the court's majority.

The court was considering the legality of Arizona's requirement that prospective voters document their U.S. citizenship in order to use a registration form produced under the federal ""motor voter"" registration law. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said that the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, which doesn't require such documentation, trumps Arizona's Proposition 200 passed in 2004.

Arizona appealed that decision to the Supreme Court.

More On This... Immigration enforcement director resigning after 4 years on the job

""Today's decision sends a strong message that states cannot block their citizens from registering to vote by superimposing burdensome paperwork requirements on top of federal law,"" said Nina Perales, vice president of litigation for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund and lead counsel for the voters who challenged Proposition 200.

""The Supreme Court has affirmed that all U.S. citizens have the right to register to vote using the national postcard, regardless of the state in which they live,"" she said.

The case focuses on Arizona, which has tangled frequently with the federal government over immigration issues involving the Mexican border. But it has broader implications because four other states -- Alabama, Georgia, Kansas and Tennessee -- have similar requirements, and 12 other states are contemplating such legislation.

Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito dissented from the court's ruling.

The Constitution ""authorizes states to determine the qualifications of voters in federal elections, which necessarily includes the related power to determine whether those qualifications are satisfied,"" Thomas said in his dissent.

Opponents of Arizona's law see it as an attack on vulnerable voter groups such as minorities, immigrants and the elderly. They say they've counted more than 31,000 potentially legal voters in Arizona who easily could have registered before Proposition 200 but were blocked initially by the law in the 20 months after it passed in 2004. They say about 20 percent of those thwarted were Latino.

Barbara Arnwine, president and executive director of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, called the decision a victory. ""The court has reaffirmed the essential American right to register to vote for federal election without the burdens of state voter suppression measures,"" she said.

But Arizona officials say they should be able to pass laws to stop illegal immigrants and other noncitizens from getting on their voting rolls. The Arizona voting law was part of a package that also denied some government benefits to illegal immigrants and required Arizonans to show identification before voting.

The federal ""motor voter"" law, enacted in 1993 to expand voter registration, requires states to offer voter registration when a resident applies for a driver's license or certain benefits. Another provision of that law -- the one at issue before the court -- requires states to allow would-be voters to fill out mail-in registration cards and swear they are citizens under penalty of perjury, but it doesn't require them to show proof. Under Proposition 200, Arizona officials require an Arizona driver's license issued after 1996, a U.S. birth certificate, a passport or other similar document, or the state will reject the federal registration application form.

While the court was clear in stating that states cannot add additional identification requirements to the federal forms on their own, it was also clear that the same actions can be taken by state governments if they get the approval of the federal government and the federal courts.

Arizona can ask the federal government to include the extra documents as a state-specific requirement, Scalia said, and take any decision made by the government on that request back to court. Other states have already done so, Scalia said.

The Election Assistance Commission ""recently approved a state-specific instruction for Louisiana requiring applicants who lack a Louisiana driver's license, ID card or Social Security number to attach additional documentation to the completed federal form,"" Scalia said.

Wendy Davis Republican Gov. Rick Perry is expected to sign the bill Critics of the measure say it would shut down most abortion clinics in Texas

Watch Candy Crowley’s exclusive interview with Gov. Rick Perry Sunday 9 a.m. ET on State of the Union

(CNN) —

A bill that places new restrictions on abortion passed the Texas Senate on Friday after days of debate that galvanized activists nationwide.

It was the second attempt by the measure’s supporters to pass the bill in the Senate – it originally failed to gain approval because of a filibuster by Democratic Sen. Wendy Davis.

The Senate voted 19 to 11 to approve the restrictions.

Republican Gov. Rick Perry, who supports the new abortion laws, called the state Legislature back into a second special session to continue consideration of the bill, which passed the Texas House on Wednesday.

The measure bans abortions past 20 weeks of gestation, mandates abortion clinics become ambulatory surgical centers, tightens usage guidelines for the drug RU486 and requires doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic at which they’re providing such services.

Opinion: It’s the real Texans who count

Critics of the measure say it would shut down most abortion clinics in Texas – denying access to many in rural communities – and force women to seek dangerous back-alley abortions.

The Republican legislators who support it say the bill isn’t about banning abortions, but rather about protecting women’s health.

The special session was marked by loud protests and high-profile voices from both sides of the abortion debate.

Taking a swipe at former Republican Sen. Rick Santorum, who came to Austin to support the bill, Democratic Sen. Kirk Watson made a final appeal to the Republicans to vote no, asking them to: “Take this chance to stop, take this chance to think, take this chance to stop listening to the partisans and failed presidential candidates.”

Cowboy Rick Perry will ride again - in 2016

However, for supporters of the bill such as Sen. Jane Nelson, the bill’s measures are long overdue.

“There is a clear choice in this vote tonight,” she said. “Do we keep the lax standards, do we forgo safeguards, do we ignore the evidence that at 20 weeks we have a child who can feel? Or do we choose life?”

The roars of the crowd in the rotunda were audible throughout the Senate debate and at one point, abortion rights protesters disrupted the proceedings in the Senate gallery. One protester, singing quietly to the chamber, chained herself to a railing in the gallery and brought the session to a brief halt.

The bill makes its way to Perry, who will sign it into law.

“Today the Texas Legislature took its final step in our historic effort to protect life,” Perry said after the bill’s passage. “This legislation builds on the strong and unwavering commitment we have made to defend life and protect women’s health. I am proud of our lawmakers and citizens who tirelessly defended our smallest and most vulnerable Texans and future Texans.”

Planned Parenthood, a leading reproductive health provider, decried the passage and called on voters to throw out the politicians who voted for it.

“If you are angry about what happened in Texas tonight – and what’s happening in other states all around the country – there is something you can do about it,” spokeswoman Dawn Laguens said. “Register to vote, and vote for candidates who will protect women’s access to health care.”

Council on Tuesday backed an hourly rate of $11.50 (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)

The D.C. Council unanimously endorsed an $11.50-an-hour minimum wage for the nation’s capital Tuesday, completing a rare act of regional cooperation with the Maryland suburbs and setting up a stark contrast with the $7.25 federal minimum wage.

By coordinating with lawmakers in Montgomery and Prince George’s counties, which approved similar measures last month, the council put the three localities on the cusp of creating a contiguous region with 2.5 million residents and a minimum wage higher than any of the 50 states. Virginia requires employers to pay the federal rate.

The D.C. Council must hold a final vote on the rate-increase measure and send it to Mayor Vincent C. Gray (D), probably early next year. But with all 13 council members pledging their support, the final vote appeared to be a formality and likely wide enough to override a veto by Gray, who repeated Tuesday that he would prefer a smaller increase — to $10 an hour.

After Gray announced Monday that he would seek a second term, the high-profile minimum-wage vote set the stage for a day of intense political theater in and around the council chambers on Pennsylvania Avenue.

The votes needed to pass the measure had been a foregone conclusion for days, but with four council members running for mayor and five more seeking reelection to the council next year, the suspense rested on who would claim credit.

The council’s appetite for a minimum-wage increase was whetted this fall when the mayor vetoed a bill that would have required Wal-Mart and other large retailers with District stores to pay a 50 percent premium over the city’s current minimum wage of $8.25.

Council member Tommy Wells (D-Ward 6), a mayoral candidate who has been working to burnish his credentials with business leaders, cast a decisive no-vote against the Wal-Mart bill in September. He said at the time that it would create an unfair playing field for companies and help only low-paid Wal-Mart workers. Wells was among the first to introduce legislation for a minimum-wage increase, and his bill for $10.25 — though not the one that ultimately passed — was the first to attract a majority of the council’s support.

“I had the leadership to get nine votes. . . . I led the first bill to show I could get this done,” Wells told reporters outside the council chamber Monday morning. “I promised I’d get this done, and I’m getting it done today.”

Council member Vincent B. Orange (D-At Large), another candidate for mayor, leads the committee that worked out a compromise among what became four bills to raise the minimum wage, including his own to set a top rate of $12.50 per hour. Orange used his own bill as the vehicle for the final vote.

“This is legislation introduced by me,” Orange said from the dais, adding that unlike Gray’s vote against the Wal-Mart bill in the fall, his ability to forge agreement amounted to a first step toward “not leaving people behind” in the wave of economic development and prosperity sweeping the city.

Before the vote, D.C. Council member Muriel Bowser (D-Ward 4) congratulated a group of union workers and advocates for the poor from the steps of the John A. Wilson Building. But Bowser, who voted against the “living-wage” bill that applied only to large retailers, was heckled by a supporter of that bill.

The Rev. Graylan Hagler, senior minister of Plymouth Congregational United Church of Christ in Northeast and a longtime supporter of Gray’s who publicly split with the mayor over his Wal-Mart vote, said he was not surprised to see a unanimous vote.

“They are all running, and this is an attempt to make things square. . . . They realized where the numbers are,” Hagler said. “Voters are right now really sensitive if you’re always kowtowing to business interests and don’t seem to have the same level of concern for those of us who live in the neighborhood — it’s reprehensible.”

Prince George’s and Montgomery counties passed similar measures last week, raising the minimum in four increments by 2017.

The D.C. measure would go two steps further: It would ramp up the city’s wage to $11.50 a year earlier, in 2016. After that, it would be indexed to inflation.

The bill would give it one of the highest minimum wages of any major U.S. city.

The council also voted unanimously to back a related measure Tuesday: requiring employers to give tipped workers five days of accrued sick time. The measure closes a loophole in city employment law that advocates said had left workers susceptible to being fired for calling in sick a single time. Council members said the paid sick days would not only protect workers but also keep patrons of restaurants from eating food handled by sick employees."

Blow'],Diversity and the Political Right - The New York Times,"Many on the political right simply can’t get this diversity thing right — and I deeply doubt that they want to. Theirs is a bone-deep contempt for otherness, a congenital belief in the superiority-inferiority binary, a circle-the-wagons, zero-sum view of progress, prosperity and power.

This became apparent yet again Wednesday when it was revealed that one of the co-authors of a much maligned Heritage Foundation “study” about “The Fiscal Cost of Unlawful Immigrants and Amnesty to the U.S. Taxpayer,” Jason Richwine, had written a Ph.D. dissertation at Harvard in 2009 titled “IQ and Immigration Policy.”

Dylan Matthews of The Washington Post summarized Richwine’s dissertation thusly:

“Richwine’s dissertation asserts that there are deep-set differentials in intelligence between races. While it’s clear he thinks it is partly due to genetics — ‘the totality of the evidence suggests a genetic component to group differences in I.Q.’ — he argues the most important thing is that the differences in group I.Q.s are persistent, for whatever reason. He writes, ‘No one knows whether Hispanics will ever reach I.Q. parity with whites, but the prediction that new Hispanic immigrants will have low-I.Q. children and grandchildren is difficult to argue against.’ ”

Matthews continues:

“He does caution against referring to it as I.Q.-based selection, saying that using the term ‘skill-based’ would ‘blunt the negative reaction.’ ”"

Yes, this image perfectly encapsulates the current government shutdown, in which a fringe band of GOP representatives in the House have effectively held the federal government hostage (with the help of the GOP's spineless leadership).

However, this image also perfectly encapsulates, unintentionally, the extent to which our elected officials truly represent America's citizenry today. For as mainstream pundits yap about which monuments might close, the wealth gap between those who have, and those who have not, is larger than it's ever been.

New Yorkers with two jobs are increasingly becoming homeless. Metropolises are becoming income distribution wastelands. Things are getting worse for so many.

And today, a small collection of lawmakers is focused on shutting down the government, rather than ensure it functions for those who need it most.

The majority is not ruling. In so many ways.

You're an average voter in Pennsylvania. The night before Election Day, your wallet goes missing, leaving you without immediate access to any of the identification you'll need to vote at your local precinct the following morning. This would be a problem under <a href=""http://www.ncsl.org/legislatures-elections/elections/voter-id.aspx#PA"" target=""_hplink"">Pennsylvania's proposed photo ID law</a>, since <a href=""https://www.huffpost.com/entry/pennsylvania-voter-id-ruling_n_1919187"" target=""_hplink"">blocked by a state judge</a>. While many people in this situation may have backup forms of identification, <a href=""https://www.huffpost.com/entry/pennsylvania-voter-id-law_n_1652469"" target=""_hplink"">studies have shown</a> that a significant percentage of would-be voters don't. The state's safeguard against the immediate disenfranchisement of people in this situation would be a provisional ballot cast on the day of the election. But this doesn't mean your vote counts, yet. Anyone who casts a provisional ballot is required to ""appear in person at the county board of elections"" within six days of the vote to provide proof that their ballot was valid. If you're able to take time away from your job to do this, the process still requires a would-be voter to either show up with valid ID -- a replacement driver's license <a href=""http://www.dmv.state.pa.us/fees/index.shtml"" target=""_hplink"">would cost $36</a> and considerable time -- or to sign an affirmation that you are indigent and not able to afford the fees associated with acquiring a photo ID. Even if you make a rapid and somewhat expensive turnaround to get a replacement ID -- or alternatively swear under oath that you are too poor to pay for such a document -- there is no guarantee that your vote will end up counting. Many elections are largely decided before provisional voters have a chance to verify their validity, which could serve to discouraging them from following up with election officials or leave them effectively disenfranchised. In 2008, <a href=""http://www.eac.gov/assets/1/Documents/2008 Election Administration and Voting Survey EAVS Report.pdf"" target=""_hplink"">only 61.8 percent</a> of all provisional ballots cast were fully counted. If strict photo ID measures were implemented, however, the number of provisional ballots submitted would likely increase, as would the requirements for voters hoping to make them count. <em>(Photo: AP)</em>"

A lawsuit filed by Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R) and Arizona Secretary of State Ken Bennett (R) asks that the United States Election Assistance Commission include state-specific requirements for proof of citizenship on all federal voter registration forms in the two states, the Kansas City Star reported.

In June, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled Arizona's law allowing proof of citizenship requirements on state forms unconstitutional since federal forms did not require it. But the court also said that states with proof of citizenship requirements could ask the federal government to note those requirements on federal registration forms distributed in their states.

The recent lawsuit comes days after the American Civil Liberties Union told Kobach that it intended to sue him over the state requirement, citing 15,000 voter registrations being held up due to lack of proof. But Kobach said his suit could preempt the ACLU suit since it addresses the ACLU's concerns, the Topeka Capitol-Journal reports.

Doug Bonney, the legal director for the ACLU of Kansas and Western Missouri, told The Huffington Post that Kobach and Bennett's lawsuit was expected. At the same time, Bonney said he disagrees with Kobach's analysis that this will end his group's lawsuit to overturn the Kansas law.

Bonney said that citizens are not able to register to vote because they cannot display proof of citizenship or because of bureaucratic issues. He said laws requiring people to attest to being citizens when registering to vote have worked well to prevent fraud.

""There is no proof of people fraudulently registering to vote,"" Bonney said. ""For scores of years, the attestation requirement has been perfectly find. This law makes it difficult for those who are citizens to vote because they cannot get properly registered.""

Kobach, a tea party favorite who has written controversial immigration laws in Arizona and Alabama, said that the citizenship proof is needed. ""Every time an alien votes, it effectively cancels out the vote of a U.S. citizen,"" Kobach said at the press conference on Wednesday.

Opponents of the citizenship requirement told The Huffington Post that the suit is ""fear mongering"" and unnecessary. Former Kansas state Rep. Ann Mah (D-Topeka), Kobach's most vocal critic, said that she is not surprised by the suit. At the same time she stressed that every voter fraud investigation in Kansas has turned up minimal cases in the last decade. She said the real problem is the 15,000 voter registrations being held up.

""There is no evidence out there at all,"" Mah told HuffPost. ""Why do we have 15,000 Americans who can't vote because of the hoops they have to jump through?""

She said that since most voters register at state motor vehicle offices, which are not equipped to process birth certificates to meet the state law, voters would need to also visit an election office to complete the process.

Arizona state House Minority Leader Chad Campbell (D-Phoenix) told HuffPost that he believes this is a way for Bennett to draw tea party votes for his 2014 Republican gubernatorial primary. Campbell, who is seeking the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, agreed with Mah that there is no voter fraud in the state.

""We've gone down this road time and time again, we hear about all this supposed fraud from the tea party all the time,"" he said. ""Every analysis shows there is no voter fraud taking place. It is political grandstanding and fear mongering from the tea party movement."""

Both were financed with independent donations not controlled by the candidates.

Villaraigosa, who has not made an endorsement in the race, said a TV ad from the super PAC Lots of People Who Support Eric Garcetti falsely portrayed Greuel as a supporter of Proposition 187, the 1994 state ballot measure that sought to deny illegal immigrants access to public education and other services.

“That commercial is out of line, out of step with a diverse city and has no room in politics,” he said.

Villaraigosa also assailed a Spanish-language commercial financed by a Greuel backer for making “outrageous claims” about Garcetti’s ancestry. The mayor said it wrongly linked Garcetti with Sheriff Joe Arpaio, the Arizona law enforcement official who has supported crackdowns on illegal immigrants.

“I know Eric Garcetti. Eric Garcetti does not support the policies of self-deportation or the policies of Sheriff Joe Arpaio,” Villaraigosa said.

The mayor’s comments came as Garcetti sought to energize Democratic voters by campaigning with one of President Obama’s top advisors, David Axelrod, an apparent effort to counter Greuel’s endorsement by former President Clinton. Clinton, a hugely popular figure among Democrats, has appeared with Greuel and been featured in ads supporting her candidacy.

Obama has stayed neutral in the race between two Democrats. But at an Eastside rally, Axelrod underscored Garcetti’s ties to the current president. He recalled meeting Garcetti on a cold day in Iowa, where the young councilman had gone to support Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign.

“Eric has become a tremendous ally for the president,” the former White House advisor said, noting that Garcetti promoted Obama’s healthcare and immigration reform agenda around the country. He credited Garcetti with leading a revival of the Hollywood, Echo Park and Silver Lake communities. “The best record of job growth in L.A. city,” he said.

Garcetti had hoped that Axelrod would be the focus of the day. But he found himself starting the day by defending his opponents’ record against the television ad created by the super PAC supporting his election.

“During the anti-immigrant era of Pete Wilson, Wendy Greuel was a Republican,” the ad says, and seeks to tie Greuel to Proposition 187.

Rick Jacobs, co-chairman of the independent group airing the ad, said he would not remove the anti-Greuel spot because it is accurate. “Wendy Greuel was a Republican for not one, not two but 13 years. She was a Republican when Pete Wilson ran for governor and won. Had he not won in 1990, there would not have been a Prop. 187,” Jacobs said. Greuel said she did not vote for Wilson in the 1990 gubernatorial election.

Garcetti denounced the ad on Twitter, stating: “I trust Wendy Greuel when she says she was not for Prop. 187. I hope everybody inside and outside the campaigns will act responsibly.”

Greuel said that wasn’t enough. She criticized Garcetti for refusing to join her request for all groups to halt all negative ads. “He said no, and I can see why,” Greuel said after speaking to the Sherman Oaks Chamber of Commerce. “Because … we’ve seen in the last few days that they’re trying to mislead the public, particularly in the Latino community.”

Greuel, for her part, faced questions about another independent ad directed at Latinos, which questions Garcetti’s loyalty to Latinos and shows him sneering while surrounded by flames. Dr. Feliciano Serrano, who paid for the ad, did not return a call seeking comment.

Backers of Garcetti said that it is Greuel’s supporters who have misled the Latino community by sending mailers in Spanish and English, saying that she will enact an increase in the minimum wage from $8 to $15 per hour. The Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, which has put $560,000 into a super PAC supporting Greuel and other candidates, has targeted Latino voters with the minimum wage message.

At the Sherman Oaks meeting, Greuel again took time to correct the record, saying she only supports a $15 hourly wage for workers in large hotels.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/02/north-carolina-voter-intimidation_n_3695657.html,2013-08-02 00:00:00,[],"North Carolina Voter ID Law Could Lead To Increased Voter Intimidation, Harassment, Election Officials Fear","In the run-up to the 2012 presidential election, reports of harassment and intimidation at the polls were so rampant in North Carolina that the state's top election official was obliged to send a memo to his employees reminding them that they could call police if necessary.



Now, as North Carolina's governor prepares to sign one of the most restrictive election bills in the nation, civil-rights advocates and election officials in the state expect to see a rise in what they call voter intimidation.



The law, which North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory is expected to sign any day, would allow political parties to send 10 roving ""observers"" from precinct to precinct on voting days, and it would authorize citizens to challenge the legality of votes cast in the county where the challenger lives. (Under the current law, you can only challenge a vote cast by someone living in your precinct.)



Supporters contend that the law will help observers catch people in the act of fraud, but critics point out that evidence of this type of fraud is scarce. They insist that the real goal is to intimidate Democratic-leaning black voters, some of whom may remember the threats and assaults that swept the South in the late 1960s, after the 1965 Voting Rights Act toppled the official barriers blacks had faced at the polls.



""In my mind, the only reason the change is occurring is to have a harmful impact on eligible voters who are trying to exercise their constitutional right,"" said Bob Phillips, the director of Common Cause North Carolina, a progressive group.

""We have hundreds of precincts located in all the communities across our state, and now you're going to be introducing outside observers who are not residents of those precincts and who are really are up to, in my opinion, intimidation.""



In addition to boosting the presence of poll observers, the law would require every voter to display specific forms of government-issued identification, which minorities and low-income people disproportionately lack. It would also cut back on the hours allotted for early voting, prohibit people from registering on the same day that they vote, and cancel a popular program to register high-school students -- practices that have boosted electoral participation among young and black voters and may have helped President Barack Obama carry the state in 2008.

The state’s Republican-dominated Legislature passed the law in July, despite scant evidence of voter impersonation fraud in North Carolina (or in any other state). In a statement, Phil Berger, the leader of the State Senate, said the bill ""restores clarity, transparency and confidence in the voting process. It curtails the questions of voter fraud by folks on both sides of the aisle and helps ensure every candidate wins or loses on his or her own merits.""

In recent years, more than 30 states around the country have passed laws requiring voters to show ID. North Carolina would become one of at least three states to allow behavior by poll watchers or poll observers that could threaten voting rights, according to a report by the progressive groups Demos and Common Cause.

Even among the voter laws in other states, North Carolina’s stands apart. Mainstream election experts have panned the proposal, calling it the most sweeping anti-voter law in the country.

For Jay Delancy, though, it doesn't go far enough. Delancy, a retired Air Force office and the head of a group called the Voter Integrity Project of North Carolina, is one of the state’s best-known activists in the campaign against fraud and a proponent of even stricter election rules, like ending early voting altogether. Last year, he repeatedly challenged the validity of the state's voter rolls, at one point claiming that nearly 30,000 registered North Carolina's voters were actually names of deceased people.



A state investigation eventually undermined this claim, and Delancy now admits that concerns about counting dead people as voters are ""greatly exaggerated."" But he remains adamant that voter fraud is pervasive, and although he has little evidence to back this up, he hopes the new rules will make it easier for groups like his to catch people cheating at the polls.

He plans to train people to act as observers, a strategy modeled on True the Vote, a national tea party-affiliated organization that has stirred up controversy by sending observers into African-American districts in recent years. ""We need to safeguard the ballot box, just like banks,"" Delancy says.



According to one state election official, however, the expected influx of observers could have the opposite effect.



""You're going to have more observers than you have actual workers,"" said Gary Sims, deputy director of the Wake County Board of Elections. ""Some of our polling places are very small. I don't know how we're going to fit 15, 16 people in there. We're not going to have enough poll workers to make sure observers are following the law.""

During last year’s early voting period, there were reports of official poll observers and campaign workers interrogating and harassing voters, hovering over them as they voted and getting into shouting matches with each other. The state board of elections sent out a memo reminding employees that they were obliged to “prevent and stop improper practices and attempts to obstruct, intimidate, or interfere with any person in registering or voting.”

Now that job could get harder, election officials say. Some worry that the increased presence of observers could overwhelm poll workers, contributing to long lines and effectively discouraging people from voting.



""How do you police people?"" asked Sims. ""We're not in the police business.""



If the bill is signed, Delancy and his allies in North Carolina will owe its success in part to the United States Supreme Court’s decision in June on the Voting Rights Act, which cleared the way for North Carolina and other Southern states to pass restrictive voter laws that the federal government could have previously prohibited. In the landmark case, a 5-4 majority ruled that areas with histories of extensive discrimination, including 40 counties in North Carolina, no longer needed to submit their electoral policies to the federal government for approval.



In the majority opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts argued that the South has changed so dramatically since the Voting Rights Act was passed almost half a century ago that the need for special federal oversight has been eliminated. Civil-rights advocates tend to agree that things have improved since the ‘60s. Yet they see the furor over voter fraud as a thinly veiled attempt to roll back those changes.

""What we've seen recently are efforts by Republicans in largely non-white communities to go in and systematically challenge ballots,"" said Kareem Crayton, a law professor at the University of North Carolina. ""Maybe people in these communities aren't familiar with the process of voting, or aren't entirely clear what their rights are, and in the face of people telling them ‘if you vote illegally or inconsistently with the rules you can be challenged in court under a felony conviction’, that can be intimidating.""



In a recent interview, Delancy dismissed the suggestion that his crusade against fraud and the voter-suppression tactics of the Jim Crow era are in any way alike.

No one in today’s North Carolina needs to worry about “dogs and fire hoses and all that,” he said. “It's laughable.”

Then he corrected himself: “It's really not laughable. It's tragic. I think in the end, as I tell every black activists who will dare to have a civil conversation with me, we are not who you say we are. What I care about is open and honest elections.”"

(CNN) —

How can the leader of the Republican Party – the political party that claims to be so concerned about our freedoms – want to limit freedom of the press?

It’s shocking, but that’s exactly what Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus wants to do. Why? Because Priebus is outraged that NBC and CNN are developing TV projects about Hillary Clinton, scheduled to air in 2015.

Apparently, Priebus thinks most Americans have never heard of this Hillary Clinton person. Consequently, he fears that these TV shows could make her a household name – almost as well-known as say, Bill Clinton.

So what did he do? He sent threatening letters to the heads of NBC and CNN, informing them that “if you have not agreed to pull this programming prior to the start of the RNC’s summer meeting on August 14, I will seek a binding vote of the RNC stating that the committee will neither partner with you in 2016 primary debates nor sanction primary debates which you sponsor.”

Bottom line: Priebus is telling media outlets that if they broadcast content that the Republican Party does not like, it will freeze those networks out of the 2016 GOP presidential debates.

Dean Obeidallah

This is the same Priebus who wrote an article denouncing President Barack Obama for what Priebus called his attack on American freedoms. And it was Priebus who, during the 2012 presidential election, predicted that if Obama were re-elected, he would destroy our “way of life in America” and that “Mitt Romney has to win for liberty and freedom.”

Let’s make one thing very clear: The RNC is not just another run-of-the-mill organization threatening a boycott over media content. The RNC includes elected officials from across the nation, from governors to state officials to hundreds of members of Congress.

Will the next threat be that the RNC will block interviews with Republican officials if it objects to a newspaper, website or network’s content? Or will some outlets be subject to greater fines for Federal Communications Commission violations or be kept from offering input on proposed federal regulations that affect the media?

We cannot allow the freedom of our media to be politicized. If the Democratic National Committee had issued a similar threat to any media outlet planning to air a TV special about New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, I would be adamantly opposing its conduct as well. This is truly something that should unite all media outlets – from MSNBC to Fox News and everyone in between.

Unfortunately, it appears that not everyone in the media sees it this way.

On Monday night, Sean Hannity welcomed Priebus on his Fox News show and applauded his proposal. And Priebus – in a candid moment – made it clear it was time for the Republican Party to “stand up to networks not in the business of promoting our party and not in the business of promoting our candidates.” In essence, Priebus wants every media outlet to be like Fox News or suffer the consequences.

CNN, NBC move forward on Hillary Clinton projects

As the late Justice Hugo Black noted in one of the most famous U.S. Supreme Court decisions on freedom of the press, “the Founding Fathers gave the free press the protection it must have to fulfill its essential role in our democracy. The press was to serve the governed, not the governors.”

NBC and CNN should not buckle to the RNC’s attempt to silence content if it does not approve. In fact, they should produce even more Hillary Clinton programs – maybe a reality show, “Keeping Up With the Clintons,” or a series simply called “Hillary!”

And Fox News is, of course, free to air “Dancing With the Marco Rubios.”

If ever an issue should unite Republicans, Democrats and independents, it’s this one. We need to make it clear to Priebus that political parties must not try to limit the freedom of our media. Such a proposal is not only dangerously wrong, it’s an affront to the very spirit of our Constitution.

The Justice Department said it would file paperwork to become a co-plaintiff in an existing lawsuit brought by civil rights groups and Texas lawmakers against a Texas redistricting plan. Separately, the department said, it filed a new lawsuit over a state law requiring voters to show photo identification.

In both cases, the administration is asking federal judges to rule that Texas has discriminated against voters who are members of a minority group, and to reimpose on Texas a requirement that it seek “pre-clearance” from the federal government before making any changes to election rules. In June, the Supreme Court removed the requirement by striking down part of the Voting Rights Act.

“Today’s action marks another step forward in the Justice Department’s continuing effort to protect the voting rights of all eligible Americans,” Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said in a statement, adding, “This represents the department’s latest action to protect voting rights, but it will not be our last.”"

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/01/13/Powell-vein-of-intolerance,2013-01-13 00:00:00,['Ben Shapiro'],Powell: GOP 'Looks Down on Minorities',"This morning, former Secretary of State Gen. Colin Powell appeared on NBC’s Meet the Press to discuss the nomination of former Senator Chuck Hagel (R-NE) to Secretary of Defense. During the discussion, David Gregory asked the liberal Powell, nominally a Republican but a longtime supporter of President Barack Obama, about the Republican Party. “I’m struck when you talk about Republicans as they. I know you insist despite voting for President Obama twice now that you’re still a Republican. But as– as I go through your record on some social issues and even foreign policy issues, I challenge you a little bit to say on what basis are you still a Republican? Do you feel like this Republican Party has left you or have you left it?”

Now, this is a half-decent question, given that Powell has been quite liberal on the issues for years now. But Powell’s answer wasn’t that he differed from Republicans on the issues. Instead, he went directly to the most common liberal meme these days in defending a radical left president: Republicans are racist. It’s a bully tactic that has become all the rage these days – Republicans don’t oppose Obama on policy, and they don’t have a good rationale for standing against liberalism. It’s just that they secretly hate black people.

Here’s what he said:

I think the Republican Party right now is having an identity problem. And I’m still a Republican. I’m a Republican who grew up along with George Bush XLI. I grew up with Ronald Reagan, Cap Weinberger, Frank Carlucci, that Republican Party, the Republican Party of Dick Lugar and John Tower. But in recent years, there’s been a significant shift to the right and we have seen what that shift has produced, two losing presidential campaigns.

So far, this is a typical leftist talking point. The Republican Party has not moved to the right. In fact, it has moved in rather extreme ways to the left, given its spending record and establishment opposition to the Tea Party. Ronald Reagan was significantly more conservative than George W. Bush. But this was prelude to Powell’s real agenda: labeling Republicans closet bigots.

I think what the Republican Party needs to do now is take a very hard look at itself and understand that the country has changed. The country is changing demographically. And if the Republican Party does not change along with that demographic, they’re going to be in trouble. And so, when we see that in one more generation, the minorities of America, African-Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans will be the majority of the country, you can’t go around saying we don’t want to have a solid immigration policy. We’re going to dismiss the 47 percent. We are going to make it hard for these minorities to vote as they did in the last election. What did that produce? The court struck most of that down and most importantly, it caused people to turn out and stand in line because these Republicans were trying to keep us from voting. There’s also a dark– a dark vein of intolerance in some parts of the Party. What I do mean by that? I mean by that is they still sort of look down on minorities. How can I evidence that? When I see a former governor say that the president is shuckin’ and jivin’, that’s a racial era slave term. When I see another former governor after the president’s first debate where he didn’t do very well, says that the president was lazy. He didn’t say he was slow, he was tired, he didn’t do well, he said he was lazy. Now, it may not mean anything to most Americans but to those of us who are African-Americans, the second word is shiftless and then there’s a third word that goes along with it. Birther, the whole Birther Movement. Why do senior Republican leaders tolerate this kind of discussion within the Party? I think the Party has to take a look at itself. It has to take a look at its responsibilities for health care. It has to take a look at immigration. It has to take a look at those less fortunate than us. The Party has gathered unto itself a reputation that it is the party of the rich. It is the party of lower taxes. But there are a lot of people who are lower down the food chain, the economic chain, who are also paying lots of taxes relative to their income and they need help. We need more education work being done in this country. We need a solid immigration policy. We have to look at climate change. There are a lot of things that the American people are expecting and the Republican Party, as they get ready for the next election, really has to focus on some of these issues and not ignore them. Everybody wants to talk about who’s going to be the candidate. You better think first about what’s the party they’re actually going to represent. If it’s just going to represent the far right-wing of the political spectrum, I think the Party is in difficulty. I’m a moderate but I’m still a Republican, that’s how I was raised. And until I voted for Mister Obama twice, I had voted for seven straight Republican presidents.

Notice the subtle linkage there: Republicans oppose global warming, immigration reform of the type leftists want, redistribution of income, not out of principle, but out of hatred of those with a different skin color. This is despicable. And it is a lie. Powell’s statements are outrageous. His statements about “shuckin’ and jivin'”? He’s referring to former Gov. Sarah Palin (R-AL), who wrote this about President Obama’s feckless foreign policy on Benghazi:

Why the lies? Why the cover up? Why the dissembling about the cause of the murder of our ambassador on the anniversary of the worst terrorist attacks on American soil? We deserve answers to this. President Obama’s shuck and jive shtick with these Benghazi lies must end.

Is that racist? Of course not. But Powell labels it racist because it serves his political ends.

Is the word “lazy” racist? If so, half the media hates white folks, because presidents going back to Dwight D. Eisenhower have routinely been labeled lazy.

As for the birthers, nobody in the mainstream of the Republican Party has ever given credibility to them. Only in Colin Powell’s opportunistic mind is the GOP linked with birtherism.

What’s more, Powell is the last person on earth who should be making this claim. He says that he voted for President Obama twice because he’s a moderate Republican whose party has left him. That’s nonsense. In 2008, Republicans ran the most moderate Republican in history in Sen. John McCain (R-AZ). And Powell voted against him. Why? Let Powell, circa 2009, explain:

And I spoke at length with John McCain about his campaign and I watched Mr. Obama and his campaign. And at the end, I cannot say I was totally colorblind. But at the end, I convinced myself, based on the facts as I saw it, that he was the better choice for this time in our nation’s history.

It is Colin Powell and his perspective that are underlaced with a vein of intolerance. Powell should know better than anyone that the GOP has no such vein – after all, the GOP discussed the possibility of him running for president on its ticket for years. No, this is about liberal bullying and thuggery – claiming that anyone who opposes leftist policies does so out of racism rather than political differences. And it’s vile.

Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) said Sunday that if Republicans want any real shot at taking back the White House, they must support a pathway to citizenship as part of immigration reform.

During an appearance on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" Menendez pointed to polls and a demographic shift in the last election as proof that the public broadly supports immigration reform, something he said Republicans will have to accept if they want to succeed as a party.

""I would tell my Republican colleagues, both in the House and the Senate, that the road to the White House comes through a road with a pathway to legalization,"" said Menendez. ""Without it, there will never be a road to the White House for the Republican Party.""

The New Jersey Democrat is a member of the so-called gang of eight, a bipartisan group of senators leading the charge in pushing an immigration reform bill across the finish line. Menendez predicted their bill would get the 60 votes needed to advance in the Senate -- and put House leaders under significant pressure to act.

""When we hit 60 votes, which we will, I have no doubt that other people will want to be on the right side of history,"" Menendez said. ""That will send a very strong message to the House.""

Appearing on another show Sunday, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) echoed Menendez's view that Republicans need to embrace immigration reform and predicted the bill will pick up far more than the 60 votes needed to move it forward.

""I think we’re going to get plus-70 votes; I’ve never been more optimistic about it,” Graham said on NBC's “Meet the Press.”

Graham said his party has ""deep bench"" of candidates for the 2016 presidential election, but emphasized that passage of immigration reform is still necessary in order to win that race.

“If we don’t pass immigration reform, if we don’t get it off the table in a reasonable, practical way, it doesn’t matter who you run in 2016,” Graham said. “We’re in a demographic death spiral as a party, and the only way we can get back in good graces with the Hispanic community, in my view, is [to] pass comprehensive immigration reform.”

Lawsuit is latest round in battle over voting rights

Supreme Court ruling left door open for new state laws

Federal officials%2C civil rights groups fighting back

WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration went to court Thursday to block Texas' tough new voter ID law, implemented after the Supreme Court in June struck down a key provision of the 1965 Voting Rights Act.

The Justice Department complaint, filed in federal court, represents the latest step in a legal as well as legislative battle between Republican state lawmakers seeking to tighten up voting laws and Democratic officials in Washington who favor more lenient access to the polls.

At the same time, the department is joining a separate legal challenge to Texas' congressional and legislative redistricting plans.

The Supreme Court's ruling struck down the formula used by the Voting Rights Act to determine which states and municipalities had to clear all voting changes with the federal government. Since then, states from Texas to North Carolina have moved to pass and implement new restrictions.

The latest actions follow Attorney General Eric Holder's warning last month that his department would use remaining provisions of the Voting Rights Act to take action against states that adopted discriminatory voting laws.

""We will not allow the Supreme Court's recent decision to be interpreted as open season for states to pursue measures that suppress voting rights,"" Holder said Thursday. ""We will keep fighting aggressively to prevent voter disenfranchisement. ... This represents the department's latest action to protect voting rights, but it will not be our last.""

Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott reacted sharply to the latest attack on the state's election laws, which he called ""the cynical politics of race.""

""Voter IDs have nothing to do with race, and they are free to anyone who needs one,"" Abbott said. ""Eric Holder's outrageous claim that voter ID is a racist plot to disenfranchise minority voters is gutter politics and is offensive to the overwhelming majority of Texans of all races who support this ballot integrity measure.""

The Texas law requires government-issued photo identification before voting. Among the permissible forms is a concealed handgun license; student IDs are not allowed.

About 20 states have photo-ID laws on the books or are in the process of implementing them. Officials in those states argue the laws are necessary to stop potential voter fraud. Opponents say they discriminate against minorities, seniors, students and others less likely to possess the required identification.

The federal complaints charge that the Texas law is intended to deny or abridge the voting rights of racial or ethnic minorities. It asks the court to place Texas once again under the Voting Rights Act's preclearance requirement. The Supreme Court's ruling effectively left no states or municipalities under that requirement.

Texas Sen. John Cornyn, a former state attorney general, accused Holder of trying to score ""cheap political points.""

""Facts mean little to a politicized Justice Department bent on inserting itself into the sovereign affairs of Texas and a lame-duck administration trying to turn our state blue,"" the Republican senator said.

Holder's actions were hailed by civil rights groups. ""Texas has a deeply disturbing history of brazenly suppressing the votes and voting strength of black and Latino voters,"" said Sherrilyn Ifill, president of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. ""The voter ID law in Texas is a solution in search of a problem. A Texas voter is more likely to be struck by lightning than to see someone attempt to vote fraudulently at the polls.""

In Texas, state Rep. Trey Martinez Fischer, chairman of the Mexican American Legislative Caucus, said the new push by the Justice Department should prompt state Attorney General Greg Abbott to ""cease his campaign against the Voting Rights Act and take this as an opportunity to work for and with the Latino community."""
http://news.yahoo.com/dhs-freed-over-2-000-immigrants-since-february-085455718.html,,[],"DHS freed over 2,000 immigrants since February.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Homeland Security Department released from its jails more than 2,000 illegal immigrants facing deportation in recent weeks due to looming budget cuts and planned to release 3,000 more during March, The Associated Press has learned.

The newly disclosed figures, cited in internal budget documents reviewed by the AP, are significantly higher than the ""few hundred"" illegal immigrants the Obama administration acknowledged this week had been released under the budget-savings process.

The government documents show that Immigrations and Customs Enforcement released roughly 1,000 illegal immigrants from its jails around the U.S. each week since at least Feb. 15. The agency's field offices have reported more than 2,000 immigrants released before intense criticism this week led to a temporary shutdown of the plan, according to the documents.

The states where immigrants were released include Arizona, California, Georgia and Texas.

The White House has said it was not consulted about the releases, and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano has acknowledged they occurred in a manner she regrets.

White House spokesman Jay Carney on Wednesday said the government had released ""a few hundred"" of the roughly 30,000 illegal immigrants held in federal detention pending deportation proceedings. Carney said the immigrants released were ""low-risk, noncriminal detainees,"" and the decision was made by career ICE officials.

As of last week, the agency held an average daily population of 30,733 in its jails. The internal budget documents reviewed by the AP show the Obama administration had intended to reduce those figures to 25,748 by March 31.

The White House did not comment immediately Friday on the higher number of immigrants released.

ICE spokesman Brian Hale said Friday the numbers of immigration detainees fluctuate daily, but he reiterated only several hundred illegal immigrants had been released. ""Beyond that normal movement, and as fiscal uncertainty remains over the continuing resolution and possible sequestration, ICE reviewed its detained population to ensure detention levels stay within ICE's current budget and placed several hundred individuals on methods of supervision less costly than detention,"" Hale said in a statement. ""At this point, we don't anticipate additional releases, but that could change.""

Story continues

The immigrants who were released still eventually face deportation and are required to appear for upcoming court hearings. But they are no longer confined in immigration jails, where advocacy experts say they cost about $164 per day per person. Immigrants who are granted supervised release — with conditions that can include mandatory check-ins, home visits and GPS devices — cost the government from 30 cents to $14 a day, according to the National Immigration Forum, a group that advocates on behalf of immigrants.

The release of thousands from immigration jails is consistent with Napolitano's early warnings on Monday — hours before anyone knew publicly that any illegal immigrants had been released — that the pending, automatic budget cuts known as the sequester would limit the government's ability to maintain enough detention center beds for at least 34,000 immigrants.

""We're doing our very best to minimize the impacts of sequester, but there's only so much I can do,"" Napolitano said Monday. ""You know, I'm supposed to have 34,000 detention beds for immigration. How do I pay for those?""

Late Thursday, after intense criticism over what the administration acknowledged was the release this week of several hundred immigrants, Napolitano told ABC News that she had been surprised to learn about the action.

""Detainee populations and how that is managed back and forth is really handled by career officials in the field,"" Napolitano told ABC. ""Do I wish that this all hadn't been done all of a sudden and so that people weren't surprised by it? Of course.""

The announcement that a few hundred illegal immigrants were being released was among the most significant and direct implications described so far by the automatic budget cuts. Republicans in Congress quickly criticized the decision and pressed the Homeland Security Department for details, including the number of illegal immigrants released and the nature of any criminal charges they were facing as part of the deportation process.

""Simply blaming budget reductions as a means to turn a blind eye toward the national security of the American people is a dangerous plan, and one that calls into question the department's preparations for sequestration,"" wrote two Republican lawmakers, Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa and Rep. Bob Goodlatte of Virginia, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.

Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., who sits on the Senate panel that oversees the Department of Homeland Security, harshly criticized the administration for downplaying the number of immigrants released, adding the revelation ""makes it less and less possible for lawmakers to have productive negotiations with the White House over a comprehensive immigration bill.""

The senior Homeland Security Department official in charge of arresting and deporting illegal immigrants announced his retirement to his staff on Tuesday, the same day the administration first openly confirmed the release of what it called several hundred immigrants. The executive associate director over ICE enforcement and removal operations, Gary Mead, told his staff he was leaving his job with mixed emotions. A career law enforcement officer, Mead will leave at the end of April.

After AP reported on Mead's retirement, ICE spokeswoman Gillian Christensen said his decision was not related to criticism over the jail releases and said Mead had notified the agency's senior leaders ""several weeks ago"" that he intended to leave. She also called AP's reporting about Mead's departure ""inaccurate and misleading."" On Thursday, ICE corrected her statement to say that Mead has notified his bosses ""more than a week ago,"" not several weeks ago.

The later government statement also criticized AP's reporting as ""ill-informed, inaccurate information"" and complained that AP had failed to contact the agency before publishing what it called a ""misguided headline,"" although the AP had noted its unsuccessful efforts to contact Mead directly by telephone and email.

(CNN) - Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Tuesday her prayers are with Trayvon Martin's family and ""every family who loves someone who is lost to violence.""

Addressing the Delta Sigma Theta sorority convention in Washington, Clinton told the crowd, ""No mother, no father should ever have to fear for their child walking down a street in the United States of America.""



Clinton, who's widely considered a potential 2016 presidential contender, addressed the largely-African American audience just days after a Florida jury acquitted George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Martin, 17.

The jury's decision sparked protests across the country, while many groups, including the NAACP, ramped up pressure on the Justice Department to press federal civil rights charges against Zimmerman.

At the top of her speech Tuesday, Clinton briefly addressed Martin's death and the recent trial - a story that has loomed large over the convention.

""In a week that I know has brought heartache - deep, painful heartache to many across our country - the solidarity and the solace you find here is all the more important,"" she said.

Attorney General Eric Holder addressed the same convention on Monday, calling Martin's death a ""tragic, unnecessary shooting"" and vowing that the Justice Department with ""follow the facts of the law"" as it continues to investigate the incident.

For her part, Clinton encouraged the sorority, the nation's single largest African-American women's organization, to ""move forward.""

""As we move forward, as we must, I hope this sisterhood will continue to be a force for justice and understanding,"" she said.

Tuesday's appearance marked the latest in Clinton's busy speech circuit. Since retiring as secretary of state at the beginning of 2013, the former first lady and U.S. senator from New York has made numerous paid and non-paid speeches across the country, fueling further speculation that she's gearing up for a presidential bid.

She also addressed the Supreme Court's recent decision that effectively ruled key parts of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 as invalid. The high court left it up to a divided Congress to revise the law, so that it's constitutional in the minds of a majority of justices.

While many Republicans praised the decision - saying it allowed some states to navigate more freely around outdated rules - many Democrats and civil rights leaders argue the ruling threatens voting rights for minorities in states with a history of discrimination.

Clinton urged the sorority women to pressure Congress to rewrite the law so that those key parts are deemed constitutional.

""I want to make sure that in the next election and the next election and the next and every one after that, people line up to vote and they vote regardless of those who may not want to count their vote or acknowledge their right to vote,"" she said, drawing heavy applause.

The conservative host went on to discuss that the reason why amnesty is essential to the liberal agenda is because abortion has, since Roe v. Wade in 1973, wiped out millions of potential taxpayers. The Democrat Party, Limbaugh said, has turned to amnesty as a means to ensure a “permanent underclass” in order to continue its image as the party of big government entitlements.

Limbaugh said:

Folks, let me tell you the way Washington thinks, in many ways, but this is one way they think. They need money. The US government needs money. We are hopelessly in debt. The tax increases that are coming are already over the top. Washington knows, much of official Washington knows that they’ve gone beyond the point here, taxation, because the impact on economic growth and productivity and creativity has now been stifled. I mean, the tax rates are such that real creation of wealth, real opportunity for prosperity is diminishing left and right. They’ve got to come up with money. And they know this: If you use the popularly accepted figure of 1.3 million abortions a year, go back to Roe vs. Wade 1973, 52 million taxpayers haven’t been born, is the way Washington looks at it. They don’t look at it morally. They don’t look at it in any kind of cultural way or any kind of cultural impact. They just say we’re 52 million people short. We have 52 million fewer people paying taxes. We gotta replace ’em. Hello amnesty. The Democrat Party needs a permanent underclass in order to keep themselves alive as Santa Claus, to keep winning elections and stay in power.

“I think that the number of abortions themselves…culturally, in terms of the sanctity of life, how that’s crumbled, I think it’s almost at the root of everything,” Limbaugh went on to say. “And if it’s not at the root of everything, it’s clearly had a profound impact on our culture, our society, and our politics, I think in ways that people don’t even stop to consider.”

Limbaugh discussed the fact that House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi refused to answer the Weekly Standard‘s question on Thursday about the morality of late-term abortion.

“And, by the way, that’s it, she wasn’t gonna talk any more about it because she is a devout Catholic,” Limbaugh said. “She has six kids, and it isn’t about politics, and she’s not gonna discuss it anymore, she said, because the interviewer was taking it in the direction of politics, and abortion isn’t politics. Abortion is sacred ground, she said. It is the sacrament of liberalism, is what it is.”"

Andrew M. Cuomo on Tuesday unveiled his long-promised Women’s Equality Act, a 10-point plan whose controversial final element, which includes codifying federal abortion rights into state law, could determine the fate of various other antidiscrimination provisions included in the bill.

The governor has made the proposal a central part of his plan to reclaim New York’s progressive mantle, and cement his own reputation as a defender of women’s rights, something that could be critical to any presidential bid. But the legislation’s prospects were unclear in the State Senate, which is currently controlled by a coalition of independent Democrats who support abortion rights and Republicans who generally oppose abortion.

On Tuesday, Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, sounded cautiously optimistic about the bill’s chances. “We do not have any assurances,” he said in a news conference attended by about two dozen representatives of women’s groups. “But the language of this bill, I believe, this is a bill that can and should pass.”

But Senator Dean G. Skelos of Long Island, the Senate Republican leader, does not plan to consent to bring the abortion portion of the act up for a vote, according to his spokeswoman, Kelly Cummings, though she added that Republicans felt they would come to agreement on all other nine parts of Mr. Cuomo’s plan."

(CNN) —

This week, House Speaker John Boehner announced that the House will not consider immigration reform this year. Despite growing numbers and increasing political influence of the nation’s Latino population, the House leadership has chosen to show it disrespect. How shameful.

Here is some context: Last year, 409,849 human beings – mothers, fathers, sons and daughters – were torn from their families and deported. Millions have been exploited, forced to live in unrelenting fear of workplace raids and criminalized as they seek a fair pathway to citizenship. An entire generation of immigrants, the majority of whom are immigrants of color, are relegated to second-class status.

Sadly, many of the same corporations that build the country’s correctional facilities also build and run prison-like immigrant detention facilities. Since the Illegal Immigration Reform Act and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, which cuts off long-standing policies of pardoning eligible immigrants who were at one point undocumented, and since 9/11, even the path to legality and recognition as human beings with equal rights has become an illusion.

The breakdown of our democratic values does not end there. The path to equal representation in our democracy — our fundamental right to vote — must also be urgently addressed. On June 25, the Supreme Court struck down the formula of the Voting Rights Act needed for the federal government to protect rights in states with long histories of discrimination. Just two hours after the decision, Texas announced it would reinstate its strict voter ID law. This law had already been struck down by the Justice Department as discriminatory against Latinos and African Americans – groups significantly less likely to have the limited forms of government-issued photo ID required under the law.

Florida has followed suit by purging its voting rolls, ensnaring former immigrants who are now citizens despite the lack of measurable non-citizen voter fraud. Under the purge procedure, Florida’s immigrant communities may be at risk of getting hit with letters questioning their citizenship status, hearing dates, requirements to show their papers and the costs of replacing lost documents. The state renewed this intimidating attempt to scare off communities of naturalized citizens, despite having settled a discrimination claim brought over a similar purge in 2012 by Advancement Project, Latino Justice, other national voting rights groups, and Florida-based Latino and Haitian American community groups.

In state after state across the country, voter ID and other “show me your papers to vote” laws, laws that disparately impact immigrants of color, are being pursued at an alarming rate.

Given our nation’s long history of racial discrimination, it is perhaps not surprising that there is a great backlash against inclusion and equality as the face of our nation changes and the immigrant population grows dramatically. Restrictions on voting rights based on race have been going on since formerly enslaved black Americans first became “citizens” and eligible to vote. But disenfranchisement is not the American way. True democracy is impossible if millions have no road map to become citizens, and if those who are citizens have their voting rights challenged at every turn.

For a true and just democracy, we must dismantle any ethnic and racial barriers to citizenship and voting rights. Only when each person, regardless of race or ethnicity, is allowed to equally participate will our fundamental notions of citizenship and democracy – and indeed, the American dream – be realized.

Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) said Sunday that if Republicans want any real shot at taking back the White House, they must support a pathway to citizenship as part of immigration reform.

During an appearance on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" Menendez pointed to polls and a demographic shift in the last election as proof that the public broadly supports immigration reform, something he said Republicans will have to accept if they want to succeed as a party.

""I would tell my Republican colleagues, both in the House and the Senate, that the road to the White House comes through a road with a pathway to legalization,"" said Menendez. ""Without it, there will never be a road to the White House for the Republican Party.""

The New Jersey Democrat is a member of the so-called gang of eight, a bipartisan group of senators leading the charge in pushing an immigration reform bill across the finish line. Menendez predicted their bill would get the 60 votes needed to advance in the Senate -- and put House leaders under significant pressure to act.

""When we hit 60 votes, which we will, I have no doubt that other people will want to be on the right side of history,"" Menendez said. ""That will send a very strong message to the House.""

Appearing on another show Sunday, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) echoed Menendez's view that Republicans need to embrace immigration reform and predicted the bill will pick up far more than the 60 votes needed to move it forward.

""I think we’re going to get plus-70 votes; I’ve never been more optimistic about it,” Graham said on NBC's “Meet the Press.”

Graham said his party has ""deep bench"" of candidates for the 2016 presidential election, but emphasized that passage of immigration reform is still necessary in order to win that race.

“If we don’t pass immigration reform, if we don’t get it off the table in a reasonable, practical way, it doesn’t matter who you run in 2016,” Graham said. “We’re in a demographic death spiral as a party, and the only way we can get back in good graces with the Hispanic community, in my view, is [to] pass comprehensive immigration reform.”

This post has been updated to include comments made by Lindsey Graham."

The historic vote, 57-35, allows the amendment to be referred to North Dakota citizens for a vote.

According to SCR 4009, “the inalienable right to life of every human being at any stage of development must be recognized and protected.”

Heraldonline.com reports that the amendment was written to ensure that both mother and baby are treated as medical patients, that medical care is not inhibited, and that fertility treatments are not banned.

LifeSiteNews.com reports that every major pro-life organization in North Dakota has supported SCR 4009.

“The North Dakota legislature has taken historic strides to protect every human being in the state, paving the way for human rights nationwide,” said Keith Mason, president of Personhood USA.

Mason added:

This amendment strikes the balance of accomplishing more for the unborn than any other amendment the nation has ever seen, while protecting pregnant women and their right to true medical care. We applaud the North Dakota House and Senate for their willingness to protect all of the people in their state.

“The North Dakota personhood amendment takes the pro-life plank of the GOP platform and puts it into practice,” said Gualberto Garcia Jones, J.D., legal analyst for Personhood USA. “Furthermore, it allows the legislature the needed flexibility to implement the specific protections of the right to life through future legislation.”

The state House also passed two other pro-life bills, one that demands that abortion doctors have admitting privileges to hospitals (SB 2305), and another that places a ban on abortions past 20 weeks and also bans taxpayer funding from going to organizations that provide abortions (SB 2368).

Last week, the state legislature also passed a “heartbeat bill,” which could ban abortions as early as six weeks, and a ban on abortions for genetic conditions such as Down’s Syndrome.

The bills will now go to Gov. Jack Dalrymple (R) for his signature. Paul Maloney, executive director of North Dakota Right to Life told LifeSiteNews.com that his group has “always had faith” in Dalrymple and expects him to sign the bills.

“I’m extremely proud of my state for the statement that they’ve made to the country,” Maloney said. “I guess it’s in the hands of the courts.” Maloney’s statement referenced the reality that the bills will almost certainly be subject to legal challenges.

“We applaud North Dakota for defending life,” said Concerned Women for America CEO and President Penny Nance. “The bills in North Dakota protect the lives of the most innocent Americans, those without a voice, in the womb.”

Nance added, “Hopefully these bills will start a national discussion about what life is and our duty as a civil society to protect it. It starts in the states.”"

San Francisco (CNN) - Seeking to move his domestic agenda away from the disappointments of health care reform, President Obama made another pitch for an immigration overhaul Monday, calling on lawmakers to restart an effort that stalled over the summer.

But even as he made his pitch at a recreation center serving mainly Chinese-Americans in San Francisco, Obama was loudly interrupted by a group who says the President's not doing enough to end deportations of undocumented immigrants.



Ju Hong, a 24-year-old student at San Francisco State, told Obama his family couldn't see each other because of the nation's immigration laws - and that Obama wasn't doing enough by himself to change the rules.

""You have the power to stop deportation,"" Ju said as a chant of ""stop deportation"" grew behind where the President was standing.

Later, Ju told reporters he was ""disappointed"" in the blame the President placed on Republicans, instead saying Obama could help reunite his family by executive order.

Obama, who told Secret Service agents to allow the protesters to remain inside the event area, took sharp aim at Congressional Republicans during his remarks for what he said was an unwillingness to ""catch up with the rest of the country"" on immigration changes.

After waving off the Secret Service, Obama said, ""I respect the passion of these young people because they feel deeply about the concerns for their families.

""Now what you need to know, when I'm speaking as President of the United States and I come to this community. If in fact I could solve all these problems without passing laws in Congress, then I would do so.""

""But we're also a nation of laws. That's part of our tradition,"" Obama continued.

""And so the easy way out is to try to yell and pretend like I can do something by violating our laws. And what I'm proposing is the harder path, which is to use our democratic processes to achieve the same goal that you want to achieve. But it won't be as easy as just shouting. It requires us lobbying and getting it done.""

Obama rebutted the protesters' claims he could end deportation alone, saying he needed Congress on board to fully repair a flawed system. In 2012, Obama did end deportations for certain young immigrants who were brought to the United States by their parents.

Immigration reform is ""within our grasp, if we can convince folks in Washington to just do what needs to be done,"" Obama said, pointing to a measure passed by the Senate earlier this year that garnered bipartisan support.

That Senate measure, passed by a large majority in June, included an eventual pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants that hinged upon strict new border security provisions. The bill, the work of a Senate gang of four Democrats and four Republicans, earned strong backing from the White House but wasn't taken up in the House, where some conservatives allege the citizenship clause amounts to amnesty for immigrants in the U.S. illegally.

Republican leaders in the House have said they'll take up individual immigration measures instead of the comprehensive legislation the White House says it prefers. Obama last week told a group of business chiefs he would be open to some piecemeal measures, as long as they change the aspects of the nation's immigration system that he's pushing for.

""It's not smart,"" Obama said of the current laws. ""It's not fair. It doesn't make sense. And we have kicked this can down the road long enough.""

In political terms, immigration reform is generally regarded as an issue that can help bolster a candidate or party among the growing U.S. Latino population; Republicans' interest in the issue of late is seen as a response to the GOP's disastrous showing among Latinos in the 2012 presidential election.

But in areas of the West Coast like San Francisco and Seattle, Asian Americans form a larger demographic bloc. The site of Obama's speech Monday, the Betty Ong Chinese Recreation Center, serves the city's historic Chinatown - the oldest such concentration of Chinese immigrants in North America. The building is named for a flight attendant who lost her life on 9/11.

Comprehensive immigration reform would be a major legislative win for the president, who has struggled to see his top agenda items passed by a divided legislature. The signature law of his first term, the Affordable Care Act, passed on party lines when the House of Representatives was still controlled by Democrats. Today that law is mired in technological problems with its exchange website, HealthCare.gov, as well as a constant barrage of criticism from Republicans on its policy details.

The President's immigration message came amid a three-day fundraising blitz for Obama, which took him to Seattle on Sunday, San Francisco on Monday and Los Angeles on Tuesday. Immigration reform is widely popular among Democrats, as well as some of Obama's Silicon Valley donors, who have long lamented federal rules that bar them from hiring top talent trained in the United States but without the ability to work here. To underscore that point, the President was introduced Monday by Geetha Vallabhaneni, who after waiting twelve years for a green card went on to found Luminix, a software firm."
http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2013/02/los-angeles-mayor-campaign-lapd-manhunt-dorner-investigation.html,,[],Dorner manhunt: Mayoral candidates want probe of ex-cop's claims about LAPD,"Candidates for mayor of Los Angeles called Saturday for an investigation of allegations of LAPD racism that were made by a fugitive former police officer who is suspected of killing three people this week.

Several said an investigation of the full circumstances surrounding the Police Department’s handling of fugitive Christopher Jordan Dorner was warranted. They spoke in response to a question on the matter at a candidates forum at Crenshaw High School.

The department announced Saturday evening that it would reopen its investigation into its firing of Dorner, which apparently prompted his vengeful rampage.

“Any allegations of racism and discrimination ought to be investigated within the LAPD, no matter where they come from,” candidate Kevin James, an entertainment lawyer, told an audience that filled the school library. James, the first to field the question, said nothing about the vast regional manhunt underway to capture Dorner.

“If you’ve got someone that will step up, and talk about the problems, talk about the inequality, talk about the discrimination, admit it, like people in public office are so afraid to do, then you can change it,” James said.

City Councilman Eric Garcetti said trouble with racism among officers had diminished in recent years. “That doesn’t mean that it’s a perfect department or that things can’t get worse,” he said. He promised to ensure “an internal investigation on this,” but did not define its scope. As for Dorner’s alleged killings, Garcetti concluded, “We have to make sure that justice is served there too.”

City Councilwoman Jan Perry urged the crowd not to lose focus on the risk that Dorner poses “to all of us, regardless of our race or ethnicity.”

“Yes, there should be a review and a public analysis of what happened in this particular case,” said Perry, the only African American candidate on stage at the forum. “Because it may be what you call a teachable moment about changing your protocols in dealing with individuals who may have manifestations of stress…or mental health issues that were never properly or adequately addressed. And then they pop out 10 or 15 years later in a manner like this.”

A fourth candidate, Emanuel Pleitez, a former technology company executive, recalled growing up on the Eastside, saying police had stopped him and his friends for no reason when he was growing up. “I know a lot of people that grew up with a deep hatred for LAPD,” he said.

“It’s a serious thing in our communities, and that needs to be addressed. Now yes, LAPD has taken strides in the right direction, but absolutely, there’s more to be done.”

One of the top candidates, City Controller Wendy Greuel, did not attend the forum. A spokeswoman said Greuel had a previous engagement, but supported the LAPD's reopening of the Dorner disciplinary case.

A report filed Friday by the Los Angeles Police Protective League showed the union has spent $305,000 on independent TV advertising for Greuel. As a result of spending by the police union and other big-money donors waging an independent campaign on Greuel’s behalf, the city Ethics Commission announced Saturday that it was lifting the $2.8-million spending cap that previously applied to mayoral candidates who accept city matching funds.

Removal of the cap was required by law once total independent spending for a mayoral candidate in the public matching program exceeded $309,000. For now, the only candidates in next month's primary with more than $2.8 million to spend are Garcetti, who has collected $3.7 million, and Greuel, who has raised $3.6 million.

http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/26/us/supreme-court-ruling.html,2013-06-26 00:00:00,['Adam Liptak'],Supreme Court Invalidates Key Part of Voting Rights Act,"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Tuesday effectively struck down the heart of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 by a 5-to-4 vote, freeing nine states, mostly in the South, to change their election laws without advance federal approval.

The court divided along ideological lines, and the two sides drew sharply different lessons from the history of the civil rights movement and the nation’s progress in rooting out racial discrimination in voting. At the core of the disagreement was whether racial minorities continued to face barriers to voting in states with a history of discrimination.

“Our country has changed,” Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote for the majority. “While any racial discrimination in voting is too much, Congress must ensure that the legislation it passes to remedy that problem speaks to current conditions.”

The decision will have immediate practical consequences. Texas announced shortly after the decision that a voter identification law that had been blocked would go into effect immediately, and that redistricting maps there would no longer need federal approval. Changes in voting procedures in the places that had been covered by the law, including ones concerning restrictions on early voting, will now be subject only to after-the-fact litigation."
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/05/10/irs-apologizes-for-targeting-conservative-groups/,2013-05-10 00:00:00,[],"Tea Party groups, Republicans slam IRS for flagging conservative groups","Tea Party leaders refused to accept an apology from the IRS Friday in which the agency acknowledged that it inappropriately flagged conservative groups for additional review during the 2012 election to see if they were violating their tax-exempt status.

Jenny Beth Martin, national coordinator for Tea Party Patriots, said she wants to see resignations over what she called the ""disturbing, illegal and outrageous abuse of government power.""

Republican lawmakers also seized on the acknowledgment, after having complained about the suspected harassment more than a year ago. Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell called for a ""government-wide review"" to assure ""these thuggish practices"" are not in use elsewhere. House Republican Leader Eric Cantor later said the House would investigate.

Reaction was swift and harsh after Lois Lerner, who heads the IRS division that oversees tax-exempt groups, acknowledged the issue at a conference Friday sponsored by the American Bar Association.

She confirmed that organizations were singled out because they included the words ""tea party"" or ""patriot"" in their applications for tax-exempt status.

In some cases, groups were asked for their list of donors, she said.

""That was wrong. That was absolutely incorrect, it was insensitive and it was inappropriate,"" Lerner said. ""The IRS would like to apologize for that.""

Lerner said the practice was initiated by low-level workers in Cincinnati and was not motivated by political bias. After her talk, she told The Associated Press that no high-level IRS officials knew about the practice. She did not say when they found out.

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney later said the agency's inspector general was investigating, calling the agents' actions ""inappropriate"" and saying ""there needs to be action taken"" if wrongdoing is found.

As conservatives condemned the IRS for the additional scrutiny, IRS officials after the conference tried to offer a fuller explanation of what happened.

The IRS put out a written statement saying protocol was changed at the Cincinnati office in response to the rising number of applications for 501(c)(4) groups. This classification grants tax-exempt status to social welfare groups. Unlike other charitable groups, these organizations are allowed to participate in political activities but their primary activity must be social welfare.

The agents tried to ""centralize work"" in response to the applications, the IRS said, leading to problems the agency claims have since been fixed.

""Mistakes were made initially, but they were in no way due to any political or partisan rationale. We fixed the situation last year and have made significant progress in moving the centralized cases through our system,"" the IRS said.

On a hastily arranged conference call Friday, Lerner said that the staffers who flagged those groups did so as ""short-hand"" to deal with the ""great number"" of cases in the system.

She acknowledged that some of the letters sent were ""far too broad"" and that asking for donors is ""generally not what we do.""

""We made some mistakes, some people didn't use good judgment,"" she said, while claiming the reviews were not partisan.

During the conference earlier Friday, Lerner said the number of groups filing for the tax-exempt status more than doubled from 2010 to 2012, to more than 3,400. To handle the influx, the IRS centralized its review of these applications in the office in Cincinnati. As part of the review, staffers look for signs that groups are participating in political activity. If so, IRS agents take a closer look to make sure that politics isn't the group's primary activity, Lerner said.

In all, about 300 groups were singled out for additional review, Lerner said. Of those, about a quarter were singled out because they had ""tea party"" or ""patriot"" somewhere in their applications. Lerner said 150 of the cases have been closed and no group had its tax-exempt status revoked, though some withdrew their applications.

Many conservative groups complained during the election that they were being harassed by the IRS. They accused the agency of frustrating their attempts to become tax exempt by sending them lengthy, intrusive questionnaires.

The forms, which the groups made available at the time, sought information about group members' political activities, including details of their postings on social networking websites and about family members.

Groups shared some of those forms with FoxNews.com back in February 2012, when the complaints first surfaced. In letters sent from IRS offices in Cincinnati, chapters including the Waco (Texas) Tea Party and the Ohio Liberty Council were asked to provide a list of donors, identify volunteers, financial support for and relationships with political candidates and parties, and even printed copies of their Facebook pages.

""Some of what they (the IRS) asked was reasonable, but there were some requests on there that were strange,"" Toby Marie Walker, president of the Waco Tea Party, told FoxNews.com last year.

A dozen Republican senators wrote to the IRS in March 2012 expressing concerns about various accounts that the IRS inquiries were ""perceived to be excessive.""

IRS Commissioner Douglas Shulman told Congress in March 2012 that the IRS was not targeting groups based on their political views.

""There's absolutely no targeting. This is the kind of back and forth that happens to people"" who apply for tax-exempt status, Shulman told a House Ways and Means subcommittee.

On Friday, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said he's ""glad"" to see the IRS apologize but said it's not good enough.

""We need to have ironclad guarantees from the IRS that it will adopt significant protocols to ensure this kind of harassment of groups that have a constitutional right to express their own views never happens again,"" he said, adding that he would be discussing the matter with the IRS commissioner.

Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., said ""the fact that Americans were targeted by the IRS because of their political beliefs is unconscionable.""

I'm guessing that it means white people don't have children unless they can afford to raise them...just a guess!

I have never seen a good answer to the following question: Why were the immigration laws changed in 1965 to favor Third World citizens, Asians and New world latinos while penalizing the ""old tribes"" from Europe, especially considering that this country's heritage is Eurocentric? Was this Teddy Kennedy and his Irish mafia's way to get back at the Brits? The country club set's distaste for those of us with Slavic backgrounds? Just wondering.

Who is surprised? For many years we have provided welfare for baby mommas and increased the black numbers and allowed Mexicans that make it across the border and Cubans who make it across the beach the same welfare for reproducing and thus increasing brown numbers. There always were more people of color than those of us whites on a worldwide basis. We were blessed by the Judeo Christian belief system that hard work and good morals would always triumph. And if not we had all the guns. Politicians have long been aware of this. Last year the child was born that in 18 years will tip the scale to majority voters of color. Then white folk will come to understand the true meaning of living in a minority world.

egardless of the demographics, if the GOP would simply try to do this: Stop our out-of-control, big government, Unconstitutional welfare/warfare/police state. That means:

1. No more Federal welfare or ""entitlements"". Phase them all out & let the States take them over or modify them, if they want.

2. Recall the troops from 800+ bases in 120+ nations around the world. No more wars not officially declared by Congress.

3. Repeal the Patriot Act & NDAA & eliminate Homeland Security. Stop the NSA information gathering on innocent Americans. Give us back our Bill of Rights.

4. Balance the budget asap, return to Constitutional money (gold/silver) & get rid of the Federal Reserve.

It's unbelievably frustrating to hear the same, tired claim that demographics will doom the GOP. That's completely wrong. It's poor communication that's dooming the GOP. The GOP is the only major party that supports free market policies. And free market policies are THE means to empowerment. Any other system inevitably leads to more poverty. TEACH PEOPLE THIS FACT AND THEY WILL VOTE FOR YOU. I started a Facebook page a few weeks ago called Unbiased America that is trying to do just that. I do my best to bring people from all sides of the political spectrum in to discuss ideas and policies the childish demagoguery and name-calling that usually happens when the left and right get together.

Brown people are so irresponsible! Then again, maybe voting for a party that is trying to expand economic opportunity, rather than restrict it to the top one percent, could help in that regard. Just a guess!The Irish are a ""new tribe"" from Asia?The Judeo Christian belief system includes a militarized enforcement clause?If only Republicans adopted Ron Paul's platform, they'd win, just like Ron Paul did!Seven percent of America's growth in 2012 came from white people. A total of 93 percent came from Asians, African Americans and Latinos. If I was a racist conservatives, I'd be frustrated too.

But speaking of ""poor communication that's dooming the GOP"":



I went to a top 20 university and have an advanced degree-- I GET your points. But lower aptitude American blacks and Hispanics want free stuff. They have PERNICIOUS social pathologies-- they drop out of school and get pregnant at prodigious rates...hearing about how the educated and game can do well in a free market of competition means NOTHING to them. Multiple theories of free republics say that they are doomed to fail because the Left will simply demagogue with promised freebies.

As usual, Mr. Buchanan has hit the nail on the head. 50 years from now, America as we know it will not exist. It will have been replaced by a polyglot of blacks, browns, yellows, and a few whites, who will be fortunate if they can survive, much less thrive, in the new environment. I grieve for my grand-son, who will have to cope with that situation.

""If only they weren't so stupid compared to us whites"" sure is great communication! If only Republicans were able to discuss the issue so freely, they wouldn't be so doomed.Hmm, Scandinavia is out, all those socialists. Germany has too many brown-skinned Turks. France has too many Africans. And French things.

I'm thinking Russia is your grandchild's last hope.



White liberals think that by breeding out whites and continuing to bar them from immigrating to this country, they will remain as the great white lords of the land... LOL. Reality and history says different. With years of heavy third world legal immigration and millions of illegals with birthright citizenship, the balance may have tipped to the point of no return. The entire world should be fearful. No more will there be the once great USA to turn to in time of trouble. ""Diversity"" has increased the welfare state to the point of collapse. We knew the end was near when history was re-written and national pride was labeled ""offensive"" while foreign ""pride"" praised. No unity, no country.

Diversity didn't work for the Balkan nations and it isn't working here. It's a deliberate way to bring down this country to the level of the third world.

That ""diversity is strength"" is just a gimmick schtick con job of the Left...deep down, those who love guvment KNOW that some ethnic groups will inexorably flock to guvment dependence, and the Left THRIVES on cultivating same. ILLEGAL aliens ARE undocumented democrats! Asians almost never resort to welfare services, but Hispanics and blacks FLOCK to them. Factor in I.Q./aptitude and social pathology problems (proclivities to crimes, gangs, dropouts, teen and illegitimate pregnancies, neighborhood/barrio blight), and you see substantial correlations by ethnicity. Europe is REELING WITH REGRET for having imported Islamists 'just to do our work for us."" Very soon, the imported populations will predominate. They are not lower aptitude, BUT their culture and religion are noxious and pernicious.

Guess it could be worse but I don't see how. I always thought the election and re-election of Obama would bring nothing good and everything bad for America. But it was actually something much more tragic. It was the beginning of the end of a once great country.

And more not easy answers include to stop feeding them [Latinos] literally. We need to stop giving them so much money in social welfare benefits. If they can survive on their own then fine. If they starve to death, then it will reduce the surplus population as Scrooge would say and i do not have a problem with that at all. When you keep feeding stray animals they reproduce a lot more and become totally dependent and bring their friends. That is what we have been doing in this country and it needs to stop. That will help take care of this issue.

And this has been the plan all along. No other coutries/continents besides Europe and America have been shamed and criticized into committing national suicide by letting in people from third world countries and of all different races in the name of multiculturalism and diversity. These are perverted Western ideas. Japan is for the Japanese, China for the Chinese, Korea for the Koreans, Africa for the Africans and so on. Only the US and Europe are for any third world vermin that wants to come here.

100% of white growth in 2012 came from immigration. Actually, more than 100 percent, since more white people died in America than were born. So yeah, white liberals need to be better at keeping those European immigrants out. STAT!You know who else was into white supremacism? Yeah,guy. Did that work?Asians vote more Democratic than Latinos. But the stereotypes say they're good at math, so all's good with those guys!Everything was white but now there are more brown people. Somehow, I suspect you'll find a way to soldier on.I'm old enough to remember when conservatives actually tried to win elections.Interesting theory. So ... you're Native American?"

USA TODAY

WASHINGTON – A bitterly divided Supreme Court drove a stake through the heart of the landmark Voting Rights Act Tuesday, striking down a coverage formula that Congress has used to monitor states with a history of discrimination.

Declaring that ""our country has changed in the past 50 years,"" Chief Justice John Roberts and the court's four other conservatives said the 1965 law cannot be enforced unless Congress updates it to account for a half-century of civil rights advances.

The court's 5-4 ruling in the case from Alabama frees states and municipalities with a history of racial discrimination from having to clear changes in voting procedures with the federal government. That restriction has applied to nine states and parts of six others, mostly in the South.

""Coverage today is based on decades-old data and eradicated practices,"" Roberts said. ""Our country has changed, and while any racial discrimination in voting is too much, Congress must ensure that the legislation it passes to remedy that problem speaks to current conditions,"" he wrote.

The decision came in the second of two major cases involving race to come before the high court this term. In the other, decided Monday, the court reaffirmed that affirmative action is constitutional but instructed lower-court judges to look far more critically at whether universities can prove their use of racial preferences is the only way to achieve a diverse student body.

Tuesday's opinion did not invalidate the Voting Rights Act's ""preclearance"" requirement outright. Instead, Roberts said Congress failed to account for broad changes in the nation's civil rights landscape since it first laid out its method for determining which states and counties would be covered. That failure, Roberts wrote, left the court ""with no choice"" but to invalidate Section 4 of the law, which spells out which states face that additional scrutiny.

President Obama swiftly condemned the decision and called on Congress to work around it.

""For nearly 50 years, the Voting Rights Act – enacted and repeatedly renewed by wide bipartisan majorities in Congress – has helped secure the right to vote for millions of Americans,"" Obama said. ""Today's decision invalidating one of its core provisions upsets decades of well-established practices that help make sure voting is fair, especially in places where voting discrimination has been historically prevalent.""

Attorney General Eric Holder said the decision is ""a serious setback for voting rights."" Other parts of the voting law ""cannot totally fill the void left by today's Supreme Court ruling,"" he said.

The decision leaves Congress an opening to reinstate federal oversight: Lawmakers are free to come up with a new formula ""based on current conditions"" to salvage the federal oversight requirement, Roberts wrote.

But on Capitol Hill, even Democrats who support the Voting Rights Act said passing new legislation was a very long shot at best. Lawmakers are divided and frequently stalemated over issues ranging from taxes to immigration to a routine farm bill.

""Make no mistake about it, this is a back door way to gut the Voting Rights Act,"" Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said. ""As long as Republicans have a majority in the House and Democrats don't have 60 votes in the Senate, there will be no preclearance.""

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, in a lengthy dissent tracing the history of recent voting discrimination, said Congress already had more than enough justification for singling out some states and not others.

""Recognizing that large progress has been made, Congress determined, based on a voluminous record, that the scourge of discrimination was not yet extir­pated,"" she wrote. ""In my judgment, the Court errs egregiously by overriding Congress' decision.""

The decision met with swift condemnation from civil rights advocates, who accused the court's conservatives of destroying a law that has been responsible for helping to stamp out discrimination at the ballot box.

""The Supreme Court has effectively gutted one of the nation's most important and effective civil rights laws,"" said Jon Greenbaum, chief counsel for the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. ""Minority voters in places with a record of discrimination are now at greater risk of being disenfranchised than they have been in decades.""

Roberts, joined by justices Antonin Scalia, Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas and Anthony Kennedy, said federal election oversight is a deep and unusual intrusion into states' normal ability to manage their own affairs, justified only by pervasive voting discrimination when the law was enacted. He said that Congress had not adequately justified singling out the same states for extra scrutiny.

State officials through the Deep South hailed the decision.

""The Supreme Court today rightly recognized that Alabama and other covered jurisdictions could not be treated unequally based on things that happened decades ago,"" said Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange.

""This is a victory for all voters, as all states can now act equally, without some having to ask for permission or being required to jump through the extraordinary hoops demanded by federal bureaucracy,"" South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson said.

Justice Clarence Thomas, the court's lone African American, wrote in a separate opinion that he was willing to go farther and completely invalidate the Voting Rights Act's preclearance requirement, known as Section 5. The court's narrower decision, he said, ""needlessly prolongs the demise of that provision.""

The Voting Rights Act was passed by Congress and signed by President Lyndon Johnson -- with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. standing near -- in the wake of the violence and bloodshed that marked the 1950s and 1960s throughout the South.

It outlawed the types of voting practices that were common in many states, such as poll taxes and literacy tests, and set up legal and regulatory processes to overturn them.

The steel spine of the law was Section 5, which required certain states and municipalities to get federal permission before making changes in voting practices. Before it was invalidated on Tuesday, Section 4 of the law laid out which parts of the country would be subject to that requirement.

Under a formula devised to capture those states, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia, along with Arizona and Alaska, emerged with what they now consider a scarlet letter. The law was reauthorized in 1970, 1975, 1982 and 2006 with only minor changes.

But the Supreme Court's majority finally lost patience with lawmakers who had refused to update the list of states and municipalities deemed discriminatory, despite wholesale gains in the South by blacks and other minority voters and elected officials.

The ruling tosses the ball back to Congress, which could try to update a coverage formula based on 1972 data. Few observers, however, expect lawmakers to pick and choose among states and municipalities, even if they could overcome political inertia.

The court's conservatives, led by Roberts, had signaled their intentions during oral arguments in February. They expressed disdain for a geographic formula last updated in 1972 that forces most of the Deep South -- but also certain municipalities from Florida to Alaska -- to check even the relocation of polling places with the Department of Justice.

Justice Anthony Kennedy, the court's perennial swing vote, likened the states' plight to being ""under the trusteeship of the United States government."" Justice Antonin Scalia drew gasps inside the courtroom when he referred disdainfully to ""racial entitlements.""

And Roberts had long ago signaled his impatience with laws that give minorities a leg up on whites. In a 2007 decision on public school integration, he famously declared: ""The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.""

Roberts and the court had punted on the issue four years ago, ruling that a Texas water district — and any municipality, for that matter — could get out from under Section 5 by demonstrating 10 years of good behavior. More than 200 municipalities have done so since the law's inception.

Even then, however, Roberts had warned that ""things have changed in the South"" and the pre-clearance requirements and coverage formula ""raise serious constitutional questions.""

The new case came to the court with two lower court strikes against Shelby County's challenge. In the most recent decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled last year that the coverage formula ""is not perfect, but the fit was hardly perfect in 1965.""

The Obama administration warned the court not to mess with Congress' legislative authority. ""Invidious racial discrimination is the most pernicious form of governmental discrimination prohibited by the Constitution,"" the government's brief said. That puts Congress ""at the zenith of its constitutional authority.""

Civil rights advocates and the court's left-leaning justices noted that the provision was used as recently as last year to beat back photo ID laws, redistricting plans and restrictions on early voting. Without it, they said, states could resume discriminatory practices.

But opponents of the law argued that the types of state and local election laws that continue to draw fire today ""exist to a greater degree outside those covered jurisdictions than they do inside the jurisdictions,"" said Edward Blum, director of the Project on Fair Representation, who helped initiate Shelby County's lawsuit.

Both sides agree that progress has been made: Black voter turnout topped white turnout in last year's presidential election and was strongest in some of the Southern states subjected to the strictest oversight under the Voting Rights Act.

Minorities also have been elected to local offices in record numbers, thanks to the creation of so-called ""majority-minority"" districts. In 1965, the 11 states of the Old Confederacy, stretching from Virginia to Texas, had a total of three black state legislators. By 2009, the number had grown to 321, or 18% of the total, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

But over the same period, Southern legislatures that were overwhelmingly Democratic in 1965 have turned Republican. Today, the GOP controls both houses of the legislatures in all 11 states.

In recent years, the number of objections by the Justice Department to states' voting changes has declined dramatically. In 1976, there were 64 objections, including 30 in Texas alone. In recent years, the number dropped to five or less. While there were 10 objections last year, this year has produced only one.

Meanwhile, the number of municipalities that have ""bailed out"" of Section 5 by maintaining a clean record on voting rights for 10 years has risen. From 1998 to 2008, only Virginia municipalities were excused from federal oversight. In the last three years, they were joined by several in California, Texas, Alabama, and the entire state of New Hampshire.

The law's defenders say Section 5 prevented Texas, Florida and South Carolina from enacting new voting restrictions in 2012. This year, they say, it stands as a bulwark against similar discrimination. In Beaumont, Texas, a school board election was canceled to prevent white candidates from running unopposed in three majority-black districts. In North Carolina, lawmakers have proposed new restrictions on voter identification, registration and early voting.

The remainder of the Voting Rights Act wasn't challenged in the case. The law still will provide for legal challenges to voting changes deemed discriminatory in any state. But those after-the-fact challenges can be costly and time-consuming.

WASHINGTON, June 4 (Reuters) - Tea Party and other conservative groups delivered an emotional plea for Washington to rein in government overreach on Tuesday as they told lawmakers about how the Internal Revenue Service targeted them with relentless paperwork and intrusive questions when they sought tax-exempt status.

The House Ways and Means Committee invited a collection of groups to speak about their experiences as details continue to emerge about how and why IRS officials in a Cincinnati, Ohio, field office began targeting conservative groups for extra scrutiny.

""This was not an accident. This is a willful act of intimidation intended to discourage a point of view,"" said Becky Gerritson, president of a Tea Party group in Wetumpka, Alabama.

She tearfully described how she and her husband had to seek legal counsel when confronted with questionnaires about their donors, communications with legislators and their voter education activities.

""I'm not interested in scoring political points. I want to protect and preserve the America I grew up in,"" Gerritson said.

Multiple congressional committees and the Department of Justice have opened probes into the matter, which has become a distraction as President Barack Obama pursues an aggressive second-term agenda.

They are trying to determine if the IRS had a political agenda in subjecting these groups to extra scrutiny, or if workers in the tax-exempt division chose partisan criteria as a way to cope with a flood of applications starting in 2010.

Current and former officials have defended IRS employees by saying they were given a challenging task of determining the level of political activity among 501(c)4 groups. Those social welfare groups are eligible for tax-exempt status as long as their activities are not primarily political.

Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle on Tuesday condemned the IRS and pledged to find out who was responsible for the targeting and what their motivation was.

""We have found a cancer someplace in Cincinnati...and we have to find out what caused this,"" Democrat Representative Charles Rangel of New York said during the hearing.

The leaders of Tea Party and religious groups said they were harassed by IRS officials and said the demanding questionnaires reflected an intolerance for their views.

Coalition for Life of Iowa president Sue Martinek recounted how an IRS employee asked that her group, which opposes abortion rights, agree in writing not to picket the abortion provider Planned Parenthood.

""We had done nothing wrong. We had not indicated that we would do anything but peaceably assemble and hold up signs like 'Stop abortion' and 'Pray to end abortion,'"" she said.

Democrat Jim McDermott, while expressing outrage at the IRS mismanagement, challenged some of the groups' assertions that they were repressed by the IRS's treatment. He said the groups were seeking a tax exemption and the IRS had to ask questions.

""None of your organizations were kept from organizing or silenced. We are talking about whether or not the American public will subsidize your work,"" said McDermott. ""Each of your groups is highly political."" (Reporting By Kim Dixon, writing by Karey Van Hall; Editing by Claudia Parsons)"

Court%27s conservative%2C liberal justices line up on opposite sides

1965 statute%27s requirements for Southern states in jeopardy

Decision by June could uphold or toss out key provision

The nation's most revered civil rights law emerged from a Supreme Court oral argument in critical condition Wednesday, putting existing remedies to voting discrimination in the South and some other states in danger of being declared unconstitutional.

The conservative justices who hold a slim majority on the court expressed grave doubts that the landmark law can remain intact when its most powerful section is based on a formula devised by Congress nearly a half-century ago.

Should the court rule 5-4 this spring against Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, which requires all or parts of 16 states to clear all voting changes with the federal government, it would silence a weapon used as recently as last year to beat back photo ID laws, redistricting plans and restrictions on early voting.

It also would free Southern states from the burden of federal oversight every time they move a polling place — something Justice Anthony Kennedy, the court's perennial swing vote, likened to being ""under the trusteeship of the United States government.""

The balancing act between states' rights and federal oversight permeated the 77-minute session inside the packed courtroom, where the justices engaged in a sometimes pointed debate about racism and what Justice Antonin Scalia, the court's senior member, called ""racial entitlements.""

Although the South of former Alabama governor George Wallace and the Ku Klux Klan engaged in virulent forms of discrimination, including poll taxes and literacy tests, even liberal justices acknowledged a far different picture today. That put the Obama administration and civil rights advocates on the defensive.

""Is it the government's submission that the citizens in the South are more racist than the citizens in the North?"" Chief Justice John Roberts asked Solicitor General Donald Verrilli, who defended what he called Congress' ""cautious"" reauthorization of the law in 2006.

Probing questions from Roberts and Kennedy made it appear that the die was cast for Section 5. Roberts went so far as to note that Massachusetts now has the worst black turnout in elections compared with whites — and Mississippi, the best.

The voting rights case is sandwiched between several other civil rights cases in a Supreme Court term that could become even more consequential than the previous one, when the court upheld Obama's health care law by the slimmest of margins and shakiest of reasons.

The justices have heard and are on the verge of deciding a case challenging the use of racial preferences in college admissions, a widespread practice among both private and public universities. And next month, they will hear challenges to California's ban on same-sex marriage and a federal law denying benefits to legally married gay and lesbian couples.

If the law falls ...

""It's easy to go broke guessing on the outcome of any Supreme Court argument,"" said Edward Blum, director of the Project on Fair Representation, which solicited the challenge to the law. But he said the questions from Roberts and others ""highlighted the justices' skepticism about the differences in discrimination between the covered and non-covered jurisdictions. Those differences simply don't exist any longer.""

A ruling against the Voting Rights Act would toss the ball back to Congress, which could try to update a coverage formula based on 1964 data that captures Alabama but not Arkansas, Mississippi but not Massachusetts, Texas but not Tennessee. Few observers, however, expect lawmakers to pick and choose among states and municipalities, even if they could overcome political inertia.

""People in the field would be putting pressure on Congress to do something about it,"" said Jon Greenbaum, legal director for the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. ""But we also know that, generally speaking, it's hard to pass any legislation through Congress these days.""

The dramatic argument played out inside a packed courtroom that included such civil rights leaders as Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton and Rep. John Lewis, who led some of the voting rights marches of the 1960s. Outside, hundreds of civil rights activists demonstrated with signs reading, ""Protect My Vote.""

Even before the argument ended, President Obama and congressional leaders of both parties were unveiling a statue of civil rights icon Rosa Parks across the street in the Capitol.

The court's four liberal justices put up a ringing defense of the law and its coverage formula, which remains based on voting patterns and discriminatory practices from 1964. Despite its age, Justice Elena Kagan said, ""the formula seems to be working pretty well"" by targeting states and jurisdictions where lawsuits charging voting discrimination have the greatest success.

That point was emphasized by Debo Adegbile, special counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, who defended the law in court. Through a series of statistics, he said, his side sought to prove that ""discrimination in those places is more persistent and adaptive.""

The remainder of the Voting Rights Act isn't challenged in Shelby County v. Holder, the case from Alabama that came before the high court Wednesday. Regardless of the justices' decision this spring, the law still will provide for legal challenges to voting changes deemed discriminatory in any state.

Those challenges are costly and time-consuming, while Section 5 puts the burden of proof on states and municipalities. Still, Kennedy said, ""it's not clear to me that there's that much difference"" between the two fixes — an indication he might be willing to let Section 5 expire.

The provision faced two major challenges — that its treatment of the South is outdated in light of racial progress there, and that the targeted states and municipalities no longer are substantially different from other parts of the country, where changes in voting practices occasionally include racial or ethnic overtones.

Kennedy said Congress engaged in ""reverse engineering"" in 2006 by reauthorizing a law with a formula that singles out particular states and municipalities. Citing other laws whose usefulness eventually passed, Kennedy simply said, ""Times change.""

Even in 2009, when the court unanimously upheld the law, Roberts warned that ""things have changed in the South"" and the pre-clearance requirements and coverage formula ""raise serious constitutional questions.""

That formula, unchanged for more than 40 years, is based on discriminatory practices and voter registration or turnout data from 1964.

Under that formula, Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia emerged with what those states now consider a scarlet letter. The law was reauthorized in 1970, 1975, 1982 and 2006 with only minor changes — most recently by votes of 98-0 in the Senate and 390-33 in the House.

Bert Rein, the lawyer representing Shelby County, Ala., argued that ""Congress cannot arbitrarily pick out states. Congress has to treat each state with equal dignity.""

A 'racial entitlement'

Scalia contended that the lopsided votes reveal only that lawmakers cannot vote against a law universally hailed as having reduced racial discrimination in the last half of the 20th century. That, he said, is ""a phenomenon that is called perpetuation of racial entitlement.""

""This is not the kind of a question you can leave to Congress,"" he said.

But the court's four liberal justices defended Congress and said the formula singling out mostly Southern states continues to guard against new forms of voting discrimination.

""Of course this is aimed at states,"" Justice Stephen Breyer said. ""What do you think the Civil War was about?""

The current court took its first bite into the law in 2009, ruling that a Texas water district — and any municipality, for that matter — could bail out of Section 5 by demonstrating 10 years of good behavior. More than 200 municipalities have done so since the law's inception. But the court punted on the broader question of its constitutionality.

""The historic accomplishments of the Voting Rights Act are undeniable,"" Roberts wrote for the court, citing voter registration and turnout levels and ""unprecedented"" numbers of minority elected officials.

Justice Clarence Thomas, the court's lone black member who sat customarily silent on Wednesday, made his dissatisfaction with the law known at the time.

""The extensive pattern of discrimination that led the court to previously uphold Section 5 ... no longer exists,"" he wrote in partial dissent. ""There is no evidence that public officials stand ready, if given the chance, to again engage in concerted acts of violence, terror and subterfuge in order to keep minorities from voting.""

Last year's election cycle, while lacking in violence and terrorism, did feature what civil rights groups said were efforts at electoral subterfuge. In Texas, Florida and South Carolina, the Voting Rights Act helped block photo ID laws, redistricting maps and limits on early voting that could have disadvantaged minorities.

But Shelby County Attorney Frank Ellis said after the court session that the South truly has changed and deserves to be treated the same as the rest of the nation.

""It is our hope that the court will recognize the great strides Shelby County and the other covered jurisdictions have made during the last 40 years in providing equal electoral opportunities for minorities,"" Ellis said.

Much of the scene was familiar: the yellow flags, the banners protesting tyranny and socialism, the demands to impeach President Obama and to repeal Obamacare. But there was a new target of the conservatives’ ire: Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and his “amnesty” plan for illegal immigrants. The loathing of this onetime darling of the movement — Rubio rode the tea party wave to office in 2010 — could be seen in the homemade signs on the East Lawn of the Capitol proclaiming, “Rubio RINO” (Republican In Name Only) and “Rubio Lies, Americans Die.” Rubio antagonism became a main theme of the event, held by Republican Reps. Steve King (Iowa), Louie Gohmert (Tex.), Michele Bachmann (Minn.) and other opponents of the bipartisan Senate immigration legislation that Rubio negotiated.

The lawmakers called to the microphone the Heritage Foundation’s Robert Rector, who delivered a sustained rebuke of the turncoat. “Marco Rubio,” he charged, “has not read his own bill.”

A chorus of boos rose from the crowd of several hundred.

Rector mocked the claim that the legislation wouldn’t cost taxpayers money.

“Liars! Liars!” the crowd replied.

“Senator Rubio says that [illegal immigrants] are going to have to pay a penalty, ’cause this bill is tough,” Rector said, derisively.

“Boo! Liar! Liar!”

“The thing I find most offensive of all is Senator Rubio’s staff saying that we need to have more low-skill immigrants because American workers can’t cut it,” Rector went on.

“That’s a lie! Lies! Boo!”

Rector asked rhetorically how many undocumented immigrants would receive government benefits. “How about seven, Senator Rubio, 7 million illegal immigrants?”

“Primary Rubio!” somebody in the crowd shouted.

The speed with which the tea party turned on Rubio is stunning, beginning earlier this year with complaints from conservative commentators and now open mockery at a Capitol Hill rally. House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) declared this week that the House won’t take up an immigration bill that doesn’t have majority support in the Republican caucus, which means the “Gang of Eight” Senate bill that Rubio sponsored wouldn’t get a vote.

The immigration event was essentially a bid by the lawmakers to hijack the crowd of about 1,000 (respectable, if a faint echo of the 2009 and 2010 crowds) that was already assembling at the Capitol on Wednesday for a tea party rally against the IRS on the other side of the building. Calling their event a rally might have been too obvious a theft, so the lawmakers staged an all-day “press conference” (which had the benefit of less-stringent permitting requirements).

This was a news conference unlike any other. It ran from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. (with a two-hour break to minimize overlap with the other rally), began with a prayer, included chants of “USA! USA!” and featured politicians holding babies onstage. In the audience, a sea of homemade signs announced “Legalized = Invasion” and “The Melting Pot Floweth Over” and “Exporting Illegals = Importing Jobs for Americans” and “God Will Take Care of Them There: Close the Borders.”

The few reporters who did pose questions during the extravaganza were cheered or booed based on their employers: an extended ovation for a reporter from the conservative Breitbart News Web site, jeers for Lisa Desjardins of CNN and cascading boos for a Huffington Post reporter.

The gimmick was a big draw, luring so many from the IRS protest that Capitol Police complained of a crowding problem for the supposed news conference. Gohmert rallied opposition to Boehner, saying the speaker’s assurances to conservatives on immigration leave room for “a betrayal.”

“Get rid of him!” people shouted from the crowd.

Bachmann further stirred up the activists by telling them that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) is accelerating a vote on the legislation because of “falling support for the Gang of Eight immigration reform bill.”

But the press-conference format, and the shortage of reporters willing to play along, created an open-mike situation. A man claiming to be from the Pittsburgh tea party asked about “the illegal people” and whether the government could find out “who they’re calling back in their home countries and to whom they’re sending money, American money.”

Heritage’s Rector fielded that question. “I regard my vote as something like a property right,” he said, “and when you give it out willy-nilly and freely to people whose claim on that property right is that they broke our laws, I feel deeply insulted. And I say, ‘You stole from me!’ ”

The cheers that followed could be heard clearly on the Senate side of the Capitol.

The New York Times reported that a letter is going out to ""hundreds"" of top donors in New York, asking them to cut off contributions to the four Democrats who voted against the bill, which failed in the Senate earlier this year. The letters target Sens. Heidi Heitkamp (N.D.), Mark Pryor (Ark.), Mark Begich (Alaska) and Max Baucus (Mont.). Pryor and Begich are up for reelection in 2014.

What effect the letter by the Republican-turned-independent mayor may have on Democratic donors is not yet clear. But it is another effort by Bloomberg to attach a political cost to voting against gun legislation -- something that the National Rifle Association has long done on the opposite side of the issue. It also marks an escalation between Bloomberg and national Democrats, who have worried that targeting vulnerable members of the party could backfire and lead to Republicans winning.

That worry has not deterred Bloomberg, whose group, Mayors Against Illegal Guns, spent $350,000 on an ad asking Pryor to reconsider his ""no"" vote on background checks. The Arkansas senator called the spot ""disgusting.""

The mayor brushed off the notion that his attack would lead to electing Republicans less in favor of his plan. ""The NRA has defined how you go about getting something done,"" he said on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe."" Wednesday. ""You say ... I know your opponent may be worse. This is the issue. We're judging you, not judging your opponent. We'll deal with your opponent at a different time. We want you to vote this way. This is what's right for the country."""
http://news.yahoo.com/marco-rubio-takes-heat-from-conservatives-over-immigration-push--200115263.html,,[],Marco Rubio heckled by conservatives over immigration push,"ORLANDO, Fla. – A small but loud group booed and heckled Florida Sen. Marco Rubio while he tried to give a speech at a conservative conference here Friday, a sign that his support for a bipartisan immigration bill has hurt him within some elements of the Republican Party.

“No Amnesty!” several people shouted when Rubio walked to the lectern at the Defending the American Dream Summit, an annual gathering of Republicans and conservatives organized by the advocacy group Americans for Prosperity.

Rubio was elected to the Senate in 2010 with support from the tea party, but he has been the target of fury on the right since he joined Democrats in championing an immigration bill that includes a pathway to citizenship for immigrants living in the country illegally. Rubio is considered a possible Republican presidential contender, but his work on the immigration bill has hurt his image with some conservative voters within the party.

The heckling at the conference subsided after he began to speak, but some in the audience continued to shout throughout the address and booed him when he finished. Despite the rough reception from some, Rubio did receive applause from most of the audience of about 1,500, who offered him several standing ovations.

Since the Senate passed the immigration bill in June, Rubio has largely avoided discussing the immigration issue, choosing instead to emphasize issues that resonate with that conservative base.

Rubio did not mention immigration in his Friday speech, but he re-upped his vow not to support a government spending bill if it includes funds for the 2010 federal health care law, and said he would vote against a measure to raise the debt limit unless it came with a balanced budget amendment.

“I will not vote for a short-term budget that spends one single cent on Obamacare,"" Rubio said to loud applause.

His efforts to defund Obamacare at all costs and others could help put him back in conservative good graces, but based on the attitude of activists here, the former tea party darling has much work to do."
"http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/editorials/la-ed-voting-20130804,0,1055547.story",2013-08-04 07:00:00,[],The voting rights disaster,"It has been less than six weeks since the Supreme Court struck down a key provision of the Voting Rights Act, the landmark law that for five decades has protected this country’s most basic democratic right. But it is already clear that the decision was a disaster.

FOR THE RECORD:

Voting rights: An Aug. 4 editorial said the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was enacted to address overt forms of racial discrimination such as literacy tests and grandfather clauses. Grandfather clauses, which exempted some white voters from literacy tests and poll taxes, were ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court 50 years earlier.



Freed of the obligation to seek federal approval before making changes in their election practices, some states have moved to introduce or restore policies that will make it harder for racial minorities to vote or will dilute their political influence. Meanwhile, as any student of contemporary politics could have predicted, a divided Congress shows no sign of moving quickly to adopt a new formula for federal “pre-clearance” of state election changes that would meet the Supreme Court’s requirements.

Although the Voting Rights Act prohibits racial discrimination in voting nationwide, only some states, mostly in the South, had been required to obtain advance approval from the U.S. Department of Justice or a federal judge before they changed their election practices. The problem with that, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said, was that the formula for deciding which states had to “pre-clear” changes was rooted in data from the 1960s and ‘70s and didn’t reflect “current conditions,” notably dramatic increases in minority turnout in Southern states.

Roberts had a point. When Congress was considering an extension of the pre-clearance system in the early 2000s, it could have started from scratch, scrutinizing evidence of voting discrimination and minority turnout in all 50 states before devising a new formula. Instead, Congress focused on whether pre-clearance was still necessary in states that were guilty of egregious misconduct at the time the Voting Rights Act was enacted in 1965. It concluded that pre-clearance had been highly successful in blocking or forestalling discriminatory actions.

Extending the old coverage formula made it easier for representatives and senators, including those from the South, to support reauthorization of pre-clearance. In that sense, the decision to retain the formula was a political one, but it was also well within Congress’ authority under the Constitution to enforce the 14th and 15th Amendments, which guarantee equal protection of the laws and prohibit racial discrimination in voting. The court was wrong to substitute its judgment for that of Congress. And Roberts demonstrated naivete at best in blithely suggesting that Congress could easily revise the pre-clearance requirement to reflect “current conditions.”

To its credit, the Obama Justice Department is now pursuing an ingenious strategy in an effort to re-establish pre-clearance under an obscure section of the Voting Rights Act not affected by the court’s decision. That section allows federal judges to “bail in” a state for pre-clearance if it is found to have passed voting laws that are intentionally discriminatory. Invoking that section of the law, Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. has joined in a challenge to a Texas redistricting map that critics say discriminates against Latino voters. If that strategy proves successful, Texas — and potentially other states — would have to seek advance federal approval of other changes, including requirements that voters produce photo IDs at polling places. (Only hours after the Supreme Court’s decision, Texas officials announced that they would enforce a strict photo ID requirement that been blocked by a court.) One problem with the “bail in” strategy is that while other parts of the Voting Rights Act prohibit practices that have a discriminatory effect, states can be bailed in to pre-clearance only if they have been guilty of racial discrimination by intent.

Even as he announced the new strategy, Holder acknowledged that it was “no substitute for legislation that will fill the void left by the Supreme Court’s decision.” It’s not clear that Congress could rise above partisan and regional divisions to approve a new formula for determining which states must seek pre-clearance of election changes. Republicans are likely to be averse to re-establishing pre-clearance for the same reason they have been enthusiastic about photo ID requirements: Minorities tend to vote Democratic. Indeed, GOP support for a variety of measures that reduce minority turnout may be motivated less by racism than by a quest for partisan advantage. But that doesn’t make them any less odious.

It might seem quixotic, but supporters of voting rights should continue to press both parties in Congress to revisit the Voting Rights Act in light of the high court’s decision. It is worth exploring whether the notion of “covered” states should give way to a nationwide system requiring pre-clearance whenever a court is convinced a state has adopted laws or procedures that have the effect of discriminating against minorities.

Finally, Congress might want to specifically address the issue of photo ID. There is ample evidence that such identification requirements disproportionately inconvenience not only racial minorities but poor, elderly and younger voters as well. On the other hand, photo ID requirements are popular not only in previously “covered” states but throughout the country, and the Supreme Court in 2008 upheld an Indiana photo ID law against a constitutional challenge. It would be consistent with Congress’ responsibility under the 14th and 15th Amendments to enact legislation requiring states that insist on photo IDs to make them free and easy to obtain.

Although it was originally enacted to address overt forms of racial discrimination such as literacy tests and grandfather clauses, the Voting Rights Act and its pre-clearance provisions also have prevented states from engaging in subtler forms of discrimination such as the drawing of district lines that prevent minority voters from electing representatives of their choice. The result has been the increase in minority political participation that (ironically) the Supreme Court cited in striking down the law’s coverage formula. Congress must not allow that progress to be reversed."

Needless to say, we need to stop their radical agendas before they go any farther.

Three bribery schemes emerged from the investigation%2C FBI says

U.S. attorney blames plot on %27show-me-the-money culture%27

Suspects were arrested Tuesday

ALBANY, N.Y. — Prosecutors charged four New York politicians, including a leading Democrat in the state Senate, and two political operatives with a wide-ranging scheme to influence the state's politics, including the New York City mayoral race, with bribes, land swaps and insider deals, according to a criminal complaint filed Tuesday.

Prosecutors accused state Sen. Malcolm Smith, a seven-term Queens Democrat, of organizing bribes as he attempted to force his way on the Republican ticket for the 2013 New York City mayoral race last year. He was one of six people charged as part of three bribery schemes that emerged from an undercover FBI investigation.

""Today's charges demonstrate, once again, that a show-me-the-money culture seems to pervade every level of New York government,"" U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said. ""The complaint describes an unappetizing smorgasbord of graft and greed.""

Also charged in the plot were New York City Councilman Dan Halloran, Bronx GOP Chairman Joseph Savino, Queens GOP Chairman Vincent Tabone, Spring Valley Mayor Noramie Jasmin and Deputy Mayor Joseph Desmaret.

Smith, once the first African-American majority leader of the state Senate, is a key member of the coalition of Republicans and Democrats that control the chamber. His spokesman said Smith would be cleared of wrongdoing.

""(Smith) will be vindicated when the all the facts in the case are revealed,"" Todd Shapiro said in a statement.

All six defendants were arrested Tuesday morning and were to be arraigned in White Plains federal court before U.S. Magistrate Judge Lisa Margaret Smith.

Smith, a Democrat, needed approval from at least three of New York City's five GOP leaders to run as a Republican in the mayoral race.

An FBI undercover agent who posed as a wealthy real estate developer and another person identified in court papers as a ""cooperating witness"" allegedly observed Smith offer tens of thousands of dollars to Tabone and Savino for their support. Halloran allegedly accepted $20,500 to set up key meetings, court papers say. The cooperating witness, who pleaded guilty March 11 to unspecified charges, assisted investigators to get a more lenient sentence, the FBI said.

Smith and Halloran, a former police officer, were both recorded on wire taps. In one recording, Smith allegedly says he wants to ""close the deal"" with the borough GOP leaders. In another recording, Halloran purportedly explains how money controlled New York politics.

""That's politics. That's politics. It's all about how much,"" Halloran said, according to the criminal complaint. ""And that's our politicians in New York. They're all like that, all like that, and they get like that because of the drive that the money does for everything else. You can't do anything without (expletive) money.""

At a meeting Feb. 8 at a hotel in Manhattan, Halloran allegedly told the undercover FBI agent that Savino, the Bronx Republican chairman, wanted $25,000 for his support, and Tabone, the Queens party chairman, wanted $25,000 up front and another $25,000 after he signed the papers to put Smith on the ballot, court papers say. At another meeting, Smith allegedly suggested structuring the payments as retainers for legal and accounting services, court papers say.

Savino allegedly accepted $15,000 for the undercover FBI agent at a Manhattan restaurant on Valentine's Day, court papers say. The same day, Tabone accepted $25,000 from the undercover agent.

Prosecutors charged Smith with conspiracy to bribe, wire fraud and extortion. Tabone, Savino and Halloran are charged with conspiracy and wire fraud. Jasmin and Desmaret are charged with mail fraud.

Jasmin and Desmaret are accused of agreeing to sell land belonging to the Village of Spring Valley to a real estate developer in exchange for money and a stake in the ownership of the project. Jasmin allegedly promised to vote for transferring the land in exchange for an ownership stake in the project and gave the cooperating witness $600 to set up a holding company under a relatives name to hide the transaction, court papers say. Desmaret allegedly accepted about $10,000 in cash bribes, the complaint says.

Bharara, who has targeted a number of state lawmakers as part of high-profile corruption cases, said New Yorkers should ""demand more"" from their government.

""Any time you have a situation that happens again and again and again and it happens to people that should know better … then something is broken in the system,"" Bharara said.

Inquiry, With Eye on White House","WASHINGTON — Congressional Republicans, not resting with the Internal Revenue Service scandal, are moving to broaden the matter to an array of tax malfeasances and “intimidation tactics” they hope will ensnare the White House.

Republican charges range from clearly questionable actions to seemingly specious allegations, and they grow by the day. On Friday, lawmakers sought to tie the I.R.S. matter to the carrying out of President Obama’s health care law, which will rely heavily on the agency. Whether they succeed holds significant ramifications for Mr. Obama, who will soon know if he is dealing with a late spring thunderstorm that may soon blow over or a consuming squall that will leave lasting damage.

Representative Dave Camp, Republican of Michigan, the usually mild-mannered chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, set the tone Friday at Congress’s first hearing on the targeting of conservative groups by the I.R.S., laying out details, from the alleged threatening of donors to conservative nonprofit groups to the leaking of confidential I.R.S. documents.

In that context, he said, the screening of Tea Party groups for special scrutiny was not the scandal itself but “just the latest example of a culture of cover-ups — and political intimidation — in this administration.”"

The heart of President Barack Obama’s speech Tuesday was the same focus on jobs and middle-class economic uncertainty that’s driven every State of the Union of his presidency.

But that was far from the only ground he covered.

The president reeled off a laundry list of small-bore proposals: He called on Congress to hike the minimum wage to $9 an hour and invest $50 billion on rebuilding roads and bridges. He proposed universal preschool for 4-year-olds and linking some federal grant decisions to research schools on their ability to keep tuition costs in check. And he urged Congress to put his full gun control agenda up for a vote.

5 things we learned from the State of the Union

Nearly every idea in his speech had a couple of things in common: Virtually all of them are core Democratic priorities presented in language that delighted the base. None of them were shoot-for-the moon ambitious. They were either old ideas repackaged or markedly modest new ones. And few if any of them are likely to become a reality under the current Congress.

State of the Union: More same old, same old

In a sharp contrast to his first address to Congress four years ago, the president paid lip service to bipartisanship, but he made clear that it was a luxury, not a driving priority. He invited Republicans to join him in a bipartisan effort… to back the Democratic policy vision.

If the speech came across more like a wish list than an action plan with a good chance of making it past the House, that’s because it was. Just laying the exhaustive string of liberal policy priorities seemed to be the point – a companion to the ideological offensive in his inauguration speech.

The top priority Tuesday wasn’t necessarily jobs, or guns, or climate change, or voting rights. It was the sum of all those parts, a liberal vision that Obama clearly hopes will nudge the country in that direction.

What Obama said

“It is our unfinished task to restore the basic bargain that built this country – the idea that if you work hard and meet your responsibilities, you can get ahead,” the president said. “It is our unfinished task to make sure that this government works on behalf of the many, and not just the few.”

The framing in Tuesday’s speech was designed to help the president score two wins: in the long term, a progressive legacy, and in the short run, an advantage in the budget battles and debt ceiling drama.

With the GOP laying responsibility for a looming sequester at the White House door, the president pointed to Republicans’ emphasis on the need for entitlement reform as proof that they’re laying the burden for deficit reduction on cops and teachers and seniors instead of “the wealthiest and most powerful.”

“Deficit reduction alone is not an economic plan,” he said. “A growing economy that creates good, middle-class jobs – that must be the North Star that guides our efforts.”

Obama dares Congress to get the job done

It’s a message designed to resonate with working-class voters, and the Republican Party’s standard-bearer for the evening, Sen. Marco Rubio, countered with a mirror-image appeal to the same demographic.

“Mr. President, I still live in the same working-class neighborhood I grew up in. My neighbors aren’t millionaires. They’re retirees who depend on Social Security and Medicare,” Rubio said. “I don’t oppose your plans because I want to protect the rich. I oppose your plans because I want to protect my neighbors.”

Rubio says Obama would hurt the middle class

The approach was much the same as the president’s, an ideological vision unweighted by grand, ambitious plans to make it a reality.

In fact, for an exhaustive speech, Obama’s State of the Union was notably short on some key specifics.

The White House has so far brushed off calls for a price tag for the proposals in Tuesday’s speech, promising a full accounting when the president sends his next budget to Congress. But in the end, the policy details may be less important than the political timing. The White House and congressional Republicans remain locked in a brutal message war over the sequester, now just over two weeks away.

Detroit Free Press

In March%2C Kwame Kilpatrick was convicted on 24 of 30 counts of extortion%2C racketeering%2C bribery

Under sentencing guidelines%2C former mayor could have faced up to life in prison

Prosecutors had argued he deserved stiff sentence because he never thought he did anything wrong

DETROIT — Seven months after the historic conviction of Detroit's former mayor on wide-ranging public corruption charges, Kwame Kilpatrick was sentenced Thursday to 28 years in prison for running what the government called a money-making racket out of City Hall.

Kilpatrick had steered millions to himself, family and friends while an impoverished Detroit hobbled along, prosecutors said.

""The government has asked for a sentence of 28 years,"" U.S. District Judge Nancy Edmunds said. ""I believe that is in fact what his sentence should be."" The defense had requested a 15-year sentence.

Kilpatrick, 43, was found guilty March 11 on 24 of 30 counts of corruption, including five counts of extortion, racketeering, bribery and several mail, wire and tax fraud charges. On three counts he was found not guilty, and on the remaining three no verdict was reached.

In this case, the overarching issue is that public officials are responsible to the citizenry, Edmunds said.

""One thing is certain,"" she said. ""It was the citizens of Detroit who suffered.""

Edmunds said Kilpatrick took bribes, misused nonprofit funds and ""used his power as mayor ... to steer an astounding amount of business"" to his friend and co-defendant, Bobby Ferguson, who also was convicted on charges of running a racket out of the mayor's office.

Text messages and witnesses bolstered allegations that Kilpatrick's relationship with Ferguson — whom the government has called the key player in the pair's extortion scheme — was at the heart of the criminal activity. Federal prosecutors are seeking a maximum 28-year prison sentence for Ferguson, whose sentencing is Friday.

Edmunds said she will recommend Kilpatrick be sent to a prison in Texas, where his family lives, and told Kilpatrick that he can appeal. Restitution will be determined later, and a hearing will happen within 90 days.

The judge said Kilpatrick lived the high life, hosting lavish parties, accepting cash tributes and loading the city's payroll with friends and family.

Despite a speech in court Thursday in which the former mayor spoke in a soft voice, asked for a fair sentence and said he accepted responsibility, Edmunds said Kilpatrick largely has shown little remorse. Kilpatrick's defense team had wanted Edmunds to consider Kilpatrick's accomplishments as mayor.

""He chose to waste his talents on personal aggrandizement and enrichment,"" Edmunds said. ""We lost transparency. We lost accountability. ... That way of business is over. We're done.""

Detroit's present mayor, David Bing, echoed that sentiment.

""I'm glad that this negative chapter in Detroit's history has finally come to an end,"" he said in a statement. ""Today's sentencing sends a strong message to everyone in public office. As we move forward with Detroit's transformation, honesty, transparency, and integrity in city leadership will be paramount.""

After the sentencing, U.S. Attorney Barbara McQuade said the judge sent a powerful message: ""The people of Detroit will not tolerate this abuse of power.""

The involvement of city officials and others compounded the seriousness of Kilpatrick's crimes, Edmunds said. Thirty-four others, including Kilpatrick's father, have been convicted in this public corruption case.

Kilpatrick said in court that he respects the justice system and the jury's verdict though he disagrees with it. Kilpatrick admitted he lied about having an affair with his former chief of staff, Christine Beatty. He also said he was sorry to those he let down — including his wife, children and parents. They were not in court.

""I want the city to heal,"" he said. ""I want the city to prosper. I want the city to be great in the end. I want the city to have the same feeling it did in 2006 when the Super Bowl was here. ... Everybody felt like this was their town.""

Margaret Raben, one of Kilpatrick's lawyers, had objected earlier Thursday to a $9.6 million calculation that the federal government estimates Kilpatrick's conspiracy cost the city. That's how much the government said Ferguson made in illegal profits stemming from crooked contracts that Kilpatrick helped steer his way.

Raben argued that sources for the figure are unsubstantiated and that Kilpatrick's sentencing guidelines exceed what someone else might get for a violent crime.

After going through each of the contracts that were illegal, Edmunds took $5 million off the total, saying she would calculate the sentence based on a figure of $4.6 million. She had discretion to decide what she considered appropriate punishment, and Kilpatrick could have received as much as life in prison, according to sentencing guidelines.

Before the sentencing, Harold Gurewitz, another Kilpatrick lawyer, said the sentence that the government advocated — 28 years in prison at a minimum — ""goes beyond what's necessary.""

He said publicity in the case has made Kilpatrick a scapegoat for the past 50 years of the city's sins.

Gurewitz highlighted other cases where public officials got lesser sentences, including former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, who was sentenced to serve 14 years in prison on corruption convictions in 2011.

Speaking Thursday in court, Kilpatrick said all he ever wanted to be was Detroit's mayor. Before taking office in 2001, the Democrat had served in Michigan's House of Representatives. He is the son of former U.S. Rep. Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick, D-Mich.

But months into his mayoral job, Kilpatrick said he hated it. He said managing a city ""is the hardest thing you can imagine."" Yet he ran for a second term, resigning only when he was forced to, on Sept. 27, 2008.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Chutkow called the Kilpatrick case one of the most significant cases of public corruption in the country.

While Kilpatrick was mayor, Ferguson received more than $127 million in contracts, according to the government. Of that, at least $76 million in contracts were obtained illegally through the pair's extortion scheme, which involved elbowing competing contractors out of deals and shaking down others to cut Ferguson in on their contracts.

""He was responsible for a lot of the buildings in and around here downtown even before Mr. Kilpatrick became mayor,"" Ferguson's lawyer, Mike Rataj, said of his client. ""He employed people. They contributed to the economy. He took care of people. He fed poor people. And we hope that the judge takes all that into consideration tomorrow.""

What's next

• Friday: Kwame Kilpatrick's co-defendent and long-time friend, Bobby Ferguson will be sentenced at 10 a.m. on nine convictions including racketeering, bribery and extortion. Prosecutors have asked for a maximum 28-year sentence; the defense wants 10 years.

• Oct. 17: Kilpatrick's father, Bernard Kilpatrick, will be sentenced at 2 p.m. on a single tax charge. He faces up to three years in prison.

Unscheduled sentencings

• Derrick Miller was Kilpatrick's former right-hand man and co-defendant who testified against the former mayor at trial. Miller pleaded guilty to bribery and tax evasion. He faces up to 10 years in prison but likely will receive a shorter sentence because of his co-operation.

• Victor Mercado, former head of the city water department, pleaded guilty to conspiracy and steering contracts to Ferguson. He faces up to 18 months in prison and a $100,000 fine."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/08/14/NY-Times-Clinton-Foundation-Rife-With-Cronyism,2013-08-14 00:00:00,['Wynton Hall'],NY Times: Clinton Foundation Rife with Cronyism,"On Wednesday, the New York Times ran a blistering investigative report revealing the Clinton Foundation as a nonprofit rife with crony capitalist conflicts of interest and multi-million dollar deficits despite raking in at least $492 million from 1997 to 2007.

In 2007 and 2008, the Clinton Foundation, which is soon to be renamed the “Bill, Hillary, & Chelsea Clinton Foundation,” ran a $40 million deficit. Last year, it ran a deficit of over $8 million despite the Foundation and two subsidiaries generating $214 million in revenues.

Hillary Clinton plans to relocate her offices to the Foundation’s Manhattan headquarters in the weeks to come. Former White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said Clinton planned to use the Foundation as a “launching pad into 2016,” a reference to her potential presidential run.

The nexus between Clinton Foundation donors, foreign governments, and corporate interests has long been a concern to government watchdog groups. As of 2008, the Clinton Foundation raised at least $46 million from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Brunei, Oman, and other foreign governments–the very governments Secretary of State Hillary Clinton eventually negotiated with. Wealthy foreign investors, like Saudi businessman Nasser Al-Rashid and Indian politician Amar Singh gave at least $1 million each.

Previous news accounts have chronicled how Clinton Foundation donors have profited. In 2004, New York developer Robert Congel donated $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation. Shortly thereafter, Sen. Hillary Clinton reportedly helped the developer bag millions in federal assistance for his mall project. Congel and Hillary Clinton’s spokesperson denied any crony pay-to-play connection.

The New York Times says the cronyism and conflicts have reached critical mass. “The Clinton Foundation had become a sprawling concern, supervised by a rotating board of old Clinton hands, vulnerable to distraction and threatened by conflicts of interest,” reports the Times. “It ran multimillion-dollar deficits for several years, despite vast amounts of money flowing in.”

Despite the apparent fiscal mismanagement, well-connected Clinton allies appear to be doing quite well. In 2009, Douglas Band, whom Clinton insiders describe as a “kind of surrogate son to Mr. Clinton,” co-founded Teneo, a consultancy that has since hired Hillary Clinton confidante and disgraced mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner spouse Huma Abedin. As the Times explains:

Mr. Band poached executives from Wall Street, recruited other Clinton aides to join as employees or advisers and set up shop in a Midtown office formerly belonging to one of the country’s top hedge funds….Teneo worked on retainer, charging monthly fees as high as $250,000, according to current and former clients. The firm recruited clients who were also Clinton Foundation donors while Mr. Band and Mr. Kelly encourage4d others to become new foundation donors….Some Clinton aides and foundation employees began to wonder where the foundation ended and Teneo began.

Among Teneo’s earliest clients was now-defunct MF Global, run by disgraced Obama bundler Jon S. Corzine.

The Times says Chelsea Clinton “became increasingly concerned” that Band and Teneo’s outside business were negatively impacting the Foundation.

Now, the Times says Hillary, Bill, and Chelsea Clinton are gearing up for a $250 million fundraising push as Hillary prepares to use the Foundation “as a base for her to home in on issues and build up a stable of trusted staff members who could form the core of a political campaign.”"

New York (CNN) – The now-immortalized final moment of Anthony Weiner's failed New York mayoral campaign was the candidate's middle finger directed at a reporter curbside as his car drove away Tuesday night.

CNN affiliate NY-1 captured Weiner flipping the bird on video as the candidate departed his primary election night party after delivering his concession speech, punctuating the end of his bizarre campaign and an odd evening.



Press, Weiner security scuffle. Reporter: ""These are the type of people you surround yourself w/, who push us?"" Cue: pic.twitter.com/TAKCKz88xc — Lindsey Christ (@LindseyChrist) September 11, 2013

If that wasn't enough drama, Weiner had trouble getting into his event as Sydney Leathers, the woman at the center of the sexting controversy that began the unraveling of his mayoral campaign, had shown up outside in what she admitted was a blatant play for media attention. Weiner's problem was there was only one entrance to Connolly's Pub and Restaurant, the election night headquarters for his campaign.

""I'm here to celebrate. I think he needs some sex therapy,"" explained Leathers, who is now embracing a career in the porn industry.

In Weiner's final days, more curiosity than serious candidate

Dressed in a skintight, red dress and platform black pumps, Leathers got what she was looking for as some of the press inside headed outside to interview the newly minted porn star. For about 30 minutes, it was a media frenzy outside. Leathers stuck around for several hours hoping Weiner would show up, even heading inside to the bar to drink a glass of white wine with a male friend.

""We went to his campaign headquarters today first, and he decided to rearrange his schedule because apparently he doesn't think he can handle confronting me or me being in his presence so I felt like it was only appropriate to make one last stop,"" she said.

She was right that campaign staff didn't want a scene out front as they spent a long time figuring out how to choreograph Weiner's arrival. When the candidate finally showed just before 11 p.m., he quickly bolted into a next door McDonald's restaurant. The press corps and Leathers gave chase – yes, this really happened – security pulled a blocking maneuver as Weiner ducked through a door that connected Connolly's and the Mickey D's.

Despite the antics, Weiner made no mention of the spectacle outside during his concession speech. But his mood may have been reflected by his departing gesture.

Ronald S. Calderon (D-Montebello).

Assistant U.S. Atty. Douglas M. Miller surfaced in the Calderon case Friday when he issued a letter at the request of Sen. Kevin de Leon (D-Los Angeles), who has been subpoenaed in the case, indicating that De Leon is not the target of the investigation.

“Please accept this letter as confirmation that, at this time, Kevin de Leon is viewed as a witness in this Office’s ongoing investigation,” said the letter from Miller and Assistant U.S. Atty. Mack Jenkins that was addressed to an attorney for De Leon..

The two prosecutors are part of the Public Corruption and Civil Rights Section of the U.S. Attorney’s office in Los Angeles.

“The assessment that he is a witness, as opposed to a subject or a target, is based on the information we have obtained to date,” the letter said. “Of course, this assessment could change in the event that new and different information regarding your client comes to our attention.”

De Leon requested the letter after his name appeared in a sealed FBI affidavit as someone Calderon tried to influence on legislation on worker’s compensation laws to benefit a man who had allegedly paid bribes to Calderon. The affidavit was released this week by Al Jazeera America, triggering a federal investigation into the leak of a sealed document.

Miller has had to deal with leaks before.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office last year decided against filing criminal charges against Armstrong after the cyclist’s attorneys alleged in court papers that government sources had leaked confidential grand jury information “with the transparent agenda of publicly smearing Armstrong and aggrandizing the government’s investigation.”

Miller also led the U.S. attorney’s 2004 probe into who leaked confidential grand jury testimony concerning former San Francisco Giants slugger Barry Bonds and other baseball players in the BALCO doping case. That investigation resulted in a private attorney being sentenced to prison for leaking the documents.

Reached by telephone Friday, Miller declined to discuss the Calderon case or his role in it.

Pollak'],Top 10 Questions Journalists Won't Ask President Obama at Press Conference,"President Barack Obama rarely makes himself available to the mainstream media. They adore him anyway. At rare press conferences, such as the one scheduled for noon Friday at the White House, they lob softball questions or accept his evasive, meandering answers, rarely pressing him for clarity, much less truth. But there are many questions that the president ought to answer, yet which he is unlikely to face at all.

10. In 2008 you promised not to “do an end-run around Congress” with signing statements. Yet you have used signing statements and you have taken executive actions to circumvent Congress on immigration and other issues. Recently, you decided the employer mandate will not be enforced on October 1. Yet that date is stipulated by law. Doesn’t the Obamacare delay violate your powers under the Constitution?

9. Last week we learned that dozens of CIA personnel were in Benghazi at the time of the attack, and that there may be ongoing efforts to suppress information about what actually happened. In October 2012, you said that you issued three directives when you learned of the attack, yet these have never been seen. What did you actually do during the Benghazi attack, and why weren’t you more actively involved?

8. Last month, IRS officials testified to Congress that IRS Chief Counsel William J. Wilkins, whom you appointed, was directly involved in reviewing applications for non-profit status by Tea Party groups. He also met with you in April 2012, prior to issuing new “Be on the Lookout” (BOLO) criteria for evaluating such applications. What was your personal knowledge of the IRS scrutiny of conservative groups?

7. Recently your administration launched a new round of peace negotiations between Israel and Palestinian leaders. Israel had repeatedly said that it would negotiate without preconditions, but Palestinian leaders would not. Your administration, through Secretary of State John Kerry, pressed Israel to release 104 terrorists from Israeli jails. Was there a single new concession you demanded from Palestinians?

6. You have publicly dressed down the U.S. military on the issue of sexual assault. In the 2012 campaign, you were very involved in specific controversies, even calling Sandra Fluke, for example. Yet you have refused to say anything about the conduct of a fellow Democrat, Mayor Bob Filner of San Diego, who refuses to resign. Aren’t you setting a bad example on sexual assault, as commander-in-chief, in the Filner case?

5. Edward Snowden has continued to reveal new information about the National Security Agency’s abilities to gather information about Americans’ private communications. Leaving aside the question of whether the government should have that power, or whether you have broken past promises on civil liberties, the fact that these leaks happened at all is striking. Why is Gen. Keith Alexander still the head of the NSA?

4. Recently you announced that you were canceling a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, over the Snowden issue and gay rights. Yet last month, even after Putin indicated he might offer Snowden asylum, you were still offering drastic cuts in America’s nuclear arsenal. It looks like the “reset” with Russia is a failure, after so many concessions. Isn’t it time to stop offering new cuts to U.S. nuclear weapons?

3. You are backing the Senate immigration bill, which passed because Democrats agreed to include border security measures. Regardless of whether those measures are sufficient, they depend on a commitment to enforce the law as written. Yet you have refused to enforce existing immigration laws, even imposing a so-called “Dream Act” by fiat. Why should Americans trust you to enforce a new immigration law?

2. You campaigned on the promise to fight the Taliban in Afghanistan. Yet you have helped the Taliban open a new office in Qatar, complicating relations with President Hamid Karzai, and recently suggested that there could be a “zero option” in Afghanistan. Meanwhile, as the U.S. withdraws, Al Qaeda is on the offensive across the region, and might return. Are we not repeating the mistakes of the past in Afghanistan?

1. You are about to head into a new round of budget negotiations. Some Republicans leaders have suggested that they are willing to offer concessions on the budget sequester if you commit to entitlement reform. You have spoken in theory about making some cuts but have never presented a plan, on paper, and have rejected all suggestions, even the Simpson-Bowles commission. Where is your plan to reform entitlements?

Bonus question: Last month, you spoke at length about how the African-American community views the death of Trayvon Martin case. You also asked people to respect the decision of the jury. Yet your Department of Justice is still aggressively investigating George Zimmerman, who is living in hiding, though all previous investigations showed no racial bias. Aren’t you violating Zimmerman’s civil rights?

UPDATE – Additional bonus question (from the comments): When you signed the Affordable Care Act, it included the Grassley amendment, subjecting members of Congress and their staff to the same rules as everyone else. Yet this week you signed off on special subsidies for members of Congress and their staff. Given your focus on inequality, how do you justify giving Congress Obamacare subsidies?

UPDATE 2 – Another bonus question (via Twitter): There is no longer any doubt that Nidal Hasan was motivated by radical Islamist beliefs. In May, you actually acknowledged for the first time that the Ft. Hood attack was an act of “Islamic jihad.” Yet your administration still considers is “workplace violence,” which denies victims certain benefits. Isn’t it time to declare the Ft. Hood shootings a terrorist act?"

Summers, forced out of contention for the Federal Reserve chairmanship by liberal Democratic opponents who thought he was too close to Wall Street.

Though brilliant, the Harvard economist has nonetheless ticked off too many people in his long and brash career, not only on policy grounds but also because of his famously caustic personality. Note to future careerists: Niceness counts.

Nor should you pity President Obama, who reportedly favored Summers. The president is reaping what he sowed. He started the unseemly squabble among Democrats by awkwardly announcing that the current chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, had “already stayed a lot longer than he wanted or he was supposed to.”

That was in June, when Bernanke was still in the middle of a second four-year term to which Obama had appointed him and had not yet publicized his own intentions.

Obama defended Summers in closed-door meetings with congressional Democrats but never mustered the gumption to nominate him and bring his party into line.

No, the real victims here are the Federal Reserve and its chairmanship, both of which are supposed to be above politics but have been dragged deep into the same political muck that stains every other institution in this polarized capital. The question is how much Fed independence, actual and perceived, has been harmed, and for how long.

Of course, the Fed has never been completely apolitical. President Richard Nixon pushed his handpicked Republican Fed chairman, Arthur Burns , to engineer a boom for his 1972 reelection campaign. The 1978 Humphrey-Hawkins Act, passed by a Democratic Congress and signed by Democratic President Jimmy Carter, put the Fed in charge of value-laden (i.e., political) trade-offs by requiring it to minimize both inflation and unemployment.

Meanwhile, the Fed’s role as a financial regulator has grown, subjecting it to constant lobbying from interest groups and their allies in Congress.

In 2010, Republicans mounted an unjustified but successful partisan attack on Obama’s nomination of Peter Diamond to be one of the Fed’s seven governors.

Still, the Fed managed to avoid undue politicization. Chairman is the key job, and all chairmen since August 1979 — Paul A. Volcker, Alan H. Greenspan and Bernanke — served at least part of their tenure after being reappointed by a president of the opposite party.

In all that time, the closest Senate confirmation vote was 70 to 30 in favor of Bernanke’s reappointment in 2010.

Now Summers’s withdrawal under fire suggests the Fed’s top position may be subject not only to fierce wrangling between the parties but within them. He never got a hearing, just a lot of flak about what he or his competitor, Janet Yellen, mightdo in office.

Supposedly Summers would have unduly tightened monetary policy, perhaps even more than the bond-buying “taper” Bernanke is already weighing. Says who? Last I checked, Summers hadn’t tipped his hand about monetary policy and was waging an op-ed campaign for greater infrastructure spending, out of concern for jobs.

Critics blame Summers not just for being abrasive (fair enough) but also for supporting financial deregulation as President Bill Clinton’s Treasury secretary, which allegedly led to economic meltdown years later. Worse, Summers never admitted the mistake or apologized for it, as Michael Hirsh emphasized in a National Journal rendition of the critics’ arguments. Ergo, Summers would still be pro-Wall Street now.

I did not know that atoning for policy judgments that were made in good faith, but can be questioned in hindsight, was a precondition for the Fed chairmanship. If it were, Bernanke would have been disqualified due to his backing of low-interest-rate policies at the Fed under Greenspan — which many blame for the housing bubble.

In early 2007, Bernanke declared that the subprime mortgage crash was “likely to be contained.” Whoops.

Still, as chairman, Bernanke’s been good to great. Probably that’s because he’s a first-rate economist who doesn’t ruminate on the past but judges the issues before him according to the best available data — a description that also fits Summers, and Yellen, for that matter.

The Summers fight was a power struggle, not a serious policy debate. Progressives were determined to roll the White House and, inexplicably, the White House let them.

Neither side seemed too concerned about the political independence of an institution whose essential attribute is a capacity to resist demands for easy money, if necessary — parties and elections be damned.

As two distinguished Harvard economists put it in a 1993 paper: “Insulating monetary policy from the political process . . . helps enforce the low inflation equilibrium. Without some degree of political independence, it would be impossible to appoint a central banker more inflation averse than a majority of the voters, which is a socially desirable goal.”

Their names? Alberto Alesina and Lawrence H. Summers.

Will Obama suffer the ‘second-term curse’?

Recent events suggest that the 44th president may not be immune to the phenomenon that historians call the “second-term curse.”

Not four months after his ambitious inaugural address, President Obama finds himself struggling to move his legislative agenda through an unbudging Congress.

And over the past week, two flaring controversies — one over his administration’s handling of the killing of the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans in Libya, the other over Internal Revenue Service employees targeting tea party groups for special scrutiny — have dominated the discussion in Washington.

It is far from clear how big a political liability either will turn out to be.

At a minimum, they represent diversions working against a president who is keenly aware of how little time he has left to achieve big things. And they are a test of the insular Obama team’s skill at keeping its footing in an environment of hyperpartisan politics and hair-trigger media.

On Friday, for instance, news of the IRS admission and developments surrounding the Benghazi attack turned White House press secretary Jay Carney’s daily briefing into a feeding frenzy and drowned out coverage of a speech that Obama was giving that day on the implementation of the health-care law that stands as his biggest achievement.

“After the election, the president said he was familiar with the literature on second-term difficulties,” said presidential historian Michael Beschloss. “We scholars may be about to see whether knowledge of that history can help a president when they begin to strike.”

“What we’ve seen in the past week reignites the question scholars ask about problematic second terms,” Beschloss added. “Is it mainly a coincidence that every president of the past 80 years has had a hard time after getting reelected? Or is it somehow baked into the structure of a second-term presidency that some combination of serious troubles is going to happen?”

White House officials acknowledge that the history of modern second-term presidencies is a sobering one, replete with scandal and failure.

But they insist that they have seen nothing to suggest that Obama will fall into the traps that have ensnared so many of his predecessors: nothing that rivals the Watergate investigation that drove Richard M. Nixon out of office in 1974, the Iran-contra scandal that nearly derailed Ronald Reagan’s presidency in 1986,or the impeachment of Bill Clinton in 1998.

The current furor will serve only to make Obama’s opponents look bad, they predict.

“Partisan investigations by the Republicans have been a part of daily life around here since the Republicans took over the House in 2011. Every time they jump up and down and scream, ‘Watergate,’ they end with egg on their face,” said White House senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer. “I don’t see this as a second-term phenomenon. It’s just life with the GOP in charge.”

But even some of Obama’s allies worry privately that his difficulties may be made worse by his lack of deep relationships on Capitol Hill, notwithstanding his round of dinners with members lately. His congressional liaison, Miguel Rodriguez, came to the job virtually unknown by lawmakers. The president himself has a tendency to hunker down with a tight circle of loyalists.

“I don’t think he has adequate people questioning him on these things,” said one close Obama ally and Washington veteran. He agreed to speak frankly on the condition that he not be identified.

Obama’s aides remain optimistic about his ability to rack up major achievements, starting with the successful implementation of the health-care law enacted during his first term and including the passage of a comprehensive overhaul of the immigration system.

“From the president on down, we all understand that controversies and distractions are going to arise,” said White House communications director Jennifer Palmieri. “But we try to keep a good sense of understanding the difference between what people care about and what is just politics.”

The current political culture “creates more froth around these controversies, but what is the impact?” added Palmieri, a Clinton White House veteran. “Things definitely move quickly now and go away faster than they used to.”

It is true that the president’s adversaries are already predicting the most dire consequences, particularly from the questions that have arisen over the administration’s forthrightness in its response to the Benghazi attack.

“I believe that before it’s all over, this president will not fill out his full term,” former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee predicted on his radio show. “As bad as Watergate was because it broke the trust between the president and the people, no one died. This is more serious because four Americans did in fact die. And President Obama has yet to explain why did they die.”

Sen. James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.) has labeled the Benghazi case “the most serious and most egregious coverup in American history.”

“We may be starting to use the I-word before too long,” Inhofe told conservative talk radio host Rusty Humphries, referring to the possibility of impeachment.

But the unease is no longer confined to the right, particularly after three State Department officials appeared before Congress last week and criticized administration actions before, during and after the Sept. 11 attacks in Libya. E-mails from that chaotic period that have come to light through media reports in recent days suggest there was furious infighting among various agencies over the talking points presented as the administration’s first explanation of the events.

“There is no evidence the White House is hiding the truth about what occurred in Benghazi,” journalist David Corn wrote in left-leaning Mother Jones magazine. “But the White House has indeed been caught not telling the full story.”

Meanwhile, the IRS’s admission that it singled out tea party groups for special scrutiny in deciding whether to grant tax-exempt status has confirmed accusations by some of those organizations that they were treated improperly.

The agency insists that decision was made by low-level career employees in its Cincinnati office and was not done for political purposes. But the revelation set off an outcry over what Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) called “thuggish practices.”

An inspector general’s report set to be released this week says senior IRS officials knew that agents were giving special attention to conservative groups in 2011, nine months before then-commissioner Douglas H. Shulman told Congress that the agency was not doing so.

“Benghazi and the IRS, each one taken in isolation is in the ankle-biting category,” said historian David Kennedy. “But if you add up enough ducks, they can peck you to death. It’s a sea of trouble.”

Chris Lehane, one of the “masters of disaster” who ran the damage-control operation in the Clinton White House, said Obama’s staff has failed to follow some basic rules for dealing with a potential scandal: avoid putting out a narrative that will not be sustained by the facts and get in front of damaging information by making it public before your adversaries do.

For instance, “if they had put those [Benghazi] e-mails out on their own terms, they would have gotten a little more of the benefit of the doubt,” Lehane said. “There’s no question that if they had basically applied the fundamentals of crisis management, they would be in a different situation today.”

But with the attack happening less than two months before voters went to the polls last year, “they may have made the decision that it was better to win the presidential election and deal with the fallout on the other side,” Lehane said.

History suggests that rocky terrain lay ahead on that other side.

“Every second-term president, at least since Eisenhower with the U-2 [spy plane shot down in Soviet airspace] has somehow gone into a ditch,” said Ken Duberstein, who was White House chief of staff during Reagan’s second term.

“The suggestions that Obama is in a deep ditch are probably premature,” Duberstein added. “But when you get in a ditch, you need to stop digging. You need to put down the shovel.”

Alejandro Mayorkas, tapped for the No. 2 position at the Department of Homeland Security, and others are facing an inspector general probe over allegations they helped a company with ties to Virginia Gov.-elect Terry McAuliffe secure visas for investors. Adding to the controversy, The Washington Times reported overnight that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid reached out to Mayorkas to help speed along visas for foreign investors of a politically connected casino hotel in Las Vegas.

But the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on Wednesday voted 9-0 to advance his nomination to the full Senate -- with all Republicans sitting out and voting ""present.""

Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., top Republican on the Senate panel, called the vote ""virtually without precedent."" He had urged lawmakers to wait until ""all the facts"" are available.

""If we confirm Mr. Mayorkas under a cloud, we haven't helped him, we haven't helped the Department of Homeland Security,"" he said.

""I'm deeply disappointed,"" Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said after the vote.

But Democrats defended the nominee, suggesting his name was being dragged through the mud.

""It is discouraging to see someone with such an extraordinary record of service being held up for no apparent reason,"" Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., said.

Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., the committee chairman, called him an ""exceptional candidate"" and the controversy surrounding him ""unfair.""

The nominee currently heads U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. In that role, he has come under criticism for his handling of the EB-5 program, which allows foreigners investing at least a half-million dollars in a U.S. project to seek a special visa.

The Times report, citing internal government documents, claimed the Obama administration expedited visa applications for about two dozen foreign investors for a Las Vegas casino hotel after pressure from Reid and his staff.

Reid, who represents Nevada, reportedly reached out to Mayorkas, setting in motion a process that ultimately granted expedited status to the investor visas for the SLS Hotel, formerly known as the Sahara Casino.

One email, cited by the Times, showed a USCIS official relaying how Reid's intervention created a heated situation in the agency.

""This one is going to be a major headache for us all because Sen. Reid's office/staff is pushing hard and I just had a long yelling match on the phone,"" the official wrote in a December 2012 email.

Reid's office, without denying the report, defended his actions. ""Senator Reid has supported and will continue to support the SLS Las Vegas project in any way he can,"" the statement said. ""Sen. Reid believes it is his job to do all he can to promote economic growth and development in the state, and he makes no apologies for helping to bring jobs to Nevada.""

The Times said the decision to overturn a prior, normally non-appealable visa decision ultimately benefited several companies whose executives have been heavy Democratic donors.

Coburn, citing the ongoing IG investigation into the program itself, noted the accusations are merely ""allegations,"" but said they could raise questions about Mayorkas' ""fitness for public service."""

Sure. But Nixonian? Please.,"Matthew Dallek is an associate academic director at the University of California Washington Center and the author of “The Right Moment: Ronald Reagan’s First Victory and the Decisive Turning Point in American Politics.”

When a reporter asked Jay Carney this past week how his boss felt about the comparisons he was drawing to one Richard M. Nixon, the White House press secretary shot back: “I don’t have a reaction from President Obama. I can tell you that the people who make those kind of comparisons need to check their history.”

Actually, if Carney checked his history, he’d realize that the “Nixonian” accusation has been a rite of passage for presidents over the past four decades, particularly in their second terms. Critics have routinely charged that presidents’ conduct has demeaned the office, reaching levels of malfeasance not seen since, of course, Watergate.

And with the disputes over the deadly attack in Benghazi, Libya, the targeting of tea party groups by the IRS and the Justice Department’s secret gathering of Associated Press phone records, the Nixon comparisons are rife.

“Do these people not remember the Nixon administration?” asked NBC’s senior investigative correspondent, Lisa Myers. “I’ve never seen anything quite like this, except in the past during the Nixon years,” said Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah). And BuzzFeed’s Ben Smith captured the moment with his post featuring Obama’s and Nixon’s faces morphing into one another in an endless loop of guilt by association.

The White House deserves some of the blame for the mess it’s in, but let’s be clear: The comparisons to Nixon are hyperbolic. Watergate, with its unique depth of criminality, remains a scandal unlike any other in modern times, and the echoes today reveal far more about the culture of Washington than about the supposed similarity between Obama’s troubles and Nixon’s crimes.

The 44th president has plenty of company in the he’s-as-bad-as-Nixon club. Ronald Reagan biographer Lou Cannon, recounting the Iran-contra scandal during the Gipper’s second term, asked: “What did the president know and when did he know it? This had been the central issue in the Watergate scandal and it became and remains a principal unanswered question of the Iran-contra affair.”

President Bill Clinton had several “gates” attached to his woes: Travelgate, Filegate, Lewinskygate. House Republicans, armed with Watergate comparisons, voted to impeach Clinton over his affair with Monica Lewinsky, insisting that the president’s sexual relationship with a White House intern and his misleading testimony rivaled Nixon’s abuses of power. (In a bit of trivia, Lewinsky was living in the Watergate complex at the height of her scandal.)

President George W. Bush had Watergate analogies hurled his way so often in his second term that the charge almost became banal. John Dean, Nixon’s counsel during Watergate, who subsequently became a liberal voice, wrote a book about Bush titled “Worse Than Watergate,” accusing the president of obstructing the investigation into the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks with “tactics not unlike those used by the Nixon White House.”

None of these comparisons holds up. Nixon had an “enemies list.” He directed a cover-up to shield his White House from blame for the break-in and theft of documents at the Democratic National Committee headquarters. Nixon, asking aides to pull “dirty tricks,” was involved in thwarting FBI and congressional investigations into Watergate. He even ordered aides to burglarize the Brookings Institution.

Obama’s secrecy on issues from drone strikes to (until recently) Benghazi talking points is disappointing for a president who promised the most open administration in history, but it hardly rises to Nixonian levels. Indeed, Obama seems about as open on internal White House and administration matters as his recent predecessors — which is to say, not much. Even so, the broad forces now undercutting him have also harmed past presidents. The so-called scandals, and the “Nixonian” charge, are not without consequences.

With their party on a presidential losing streak, Republicans in Congress are seizing any opportunity to damage the White House by pumping up its missteps, big or small, into Watergate-like proportions. Such tactics are hardly unique to the GOP, of course; Democrats took a similar approach toward Bush on issues such as Sept. 11 investigations, weapons of mass destruction and the abuse of prisoners at Abu Ghraib in Iraq.

At congressional hearings, Republicans have called witnesses who push the notion of an administration cover-up of the Benghazi debacle. Obama has fired the acting IRS commissioner, but we should brace for more hearings on the IRS as well as the Associated Press phone records.

On all these fronts, the Obama administration has made matters worse for itself. It initially failed to give a straightforward account of its response to the Benghazi attack, which killed four Americans. The Justice Department’s seizure of AP phone records is an affront to civil liberties. And news that the IRS targeted tea party and other anti-big-government groups for special scrutiny — actions that the president has called “inexcusable” — only strengthens the perception on the right that Obama’s government has become a leviathan. Carney’s efforts to distance the White House from the Justice Department, the IRS and, to a lesser extent, the CIA and the State Department give the impression of a bureaucracy run amok.

But none of this even come close to Watergate. There are far more apt and instructive analogies.

If anything, the tragedy in Benghazi recalls Reagan’s failed effort to tame Lebanon’s civil war — resulting in the suicide truck bombing that killed 241 Marines and other U.S. troops in 1983 — and Clinton’s disastrous military operation in Somalia, where 18 U.S. soldiers and hundreds of Somalis died in the Battle of Mogadishu. During Gerald Ford’s presidency, a Palestinian separatist group killed the U.S. ambassador to Lebanon, Francis Meloy, and his economic adviser, Robert Waring, and sniper fire killed Ambassador Rodger Davies in Cyprus.

Putting U.S. soldiers, spies and diplomats into civil wars or politically volatile situations in weak states is a fraught and sometimes deadly enterprise. The kind of limited military and diplomatic actions that Reagan, Clinton and Obama took in Beirut, Mogadishu and Benghazi, respectively, all failed because of flawed strategies and inadequate security precautions. These parallels, more than any Nixonian cover-up, are most salient to the Benghazi debacle.

The IRS developments bring to mind past government intrusions, such as when a State Department official in the George H.W. Bush administration searched Bill Clinton’s passport files in 1992, or in 2008, when State Department employees also searched the passport records of Obama, Hillary Rodham Clintonand John McCain. In all these instances, mid-level officials invaded politicians’ privacy and singled them out for scrutiny. (In all of them, the White House appeared to have no involvement.)

The Justice Department’s secret collection of AP phone records is the most revelatory of Obama’s three so-called scandals. During the Cold War, presidents of both parties agreed, more often than not, that the United States must use diplomacy, economic aid and military intervention to stop the spread of communism. But the unfolding AP saga is the latest example of how, in the post-9/11 world, Democratic and Republican presidents have arrived at a different consensus: National security trumps civil liberties.

The Justice Department’s actions are an extension of efforts by the George W. Bush administration to hound journalists in pursuit of the sources of leaks of classified information. Bush’s attempts to find out who leaked information on warrantless wiretaps presaged Obama’s. On guarding national secrets, the current administration has displayed far more continuity with Bush’s than most of Obama’s supporters would have imagined on Inauguration Day in 2009.

Indeed, what we know of the Associated Press saga bolsters the evidence that this administration’s anti-leaking efforts are more zealous than Bush’s. The previous administration threatened to prosecute reporters for espionage, but, according to a Bloomberg News report, this Justice Department has actually prosecuted more officials for leaking than all prior administrations combined.

Nixon’s paranoia and vengefulness defined his White House. He abused his power to silence his opponents and Vietnam War critics, and win reelection. But the Obama White House’s penchant for secrecy and its hostility toward the media should be seen in the context of the blinkered attitudes that recent administrations have displayed toward domestic detractors. Clinton, Bush and Obama surrounded themselves with loyalists and cultivated a bunker mind-set, battling a legion of critics eager for any hint of scandal to take the president down. (It’s an understandable mind-set when members of the press hype up any hint of scandal, turning minor stumbles into mini-Watergates.)

Obama seems to have cultivated within his administration a broad disdain for conservatives and for the tea party in particular, which may help explain why mid-level IRS employees put a bullseye on these groups; a frustration with congressional Republicans that has bred the kind of antagonism to opponents seen in Clinton’s and Bush’s White Houses; and suspicion of much of the news media.

Such attitudes may bear a surface resemblance to Nixon’s secrecy and belligerence — but in truth they are found deep in all modern White Houses. Even Obama, who vowed to change politics in his 2008 run, has been no less susceptible to them than any of his predecessors.

It’s hard to imagine the next White House team — whether under Hillary Clinton, Jeb Bush or someone else — behaving very differently.

Who knows? Because, for all 54 instances, there were only three Congressional hearings, or bleh. But young William thought our study needed more study.



BILL O'REILLY (5/9/2013): When you study the study, you find that many of the cited attacks occurred in Iraq, during the war.

Eight out of 54! How is that ""many""? I mean, by that math, you, Bill O'Reilly, have many viewers who are not bedridden and cathetera... catheterized. Catheterized, I said cathedralized.

And by the way, I'm pretty sure attacking diplomatic targets in Iraq still counts as an attack. But here's where my friend, he just got mean!



BILL O'REILLY (5/9/2013): Jon Stewart apparently got his information from the far-left websites Media Matters and the DailyKos.

(audience laughter)

Do you see DailyKos or Media Matters in there? It's mostly side boob related sites and a little ESPN.

Actually, we did get our info straight from the University of Maryland's National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism, an outfit so reliable, it was even cited last week by a certain FoxNews.com. So, boom. By the way, that website could use a side boob section.

All right, listen. But here's the thing. Why bother? Why bother fighting, O'Reilly? It doesn't matter. It doesn't even make sense to argue with him, because facts don't matter to that side. In their paranoid fever dreams, the State Department and the CIA changing talking points is irrefutable evidence Obama left people to die so that he could swing Ohio, despite there being no shred of evidence to validate their full-blown right-wing persecution victimization complex.



SCOTT PELLEY (5/10/2013): The Internal Revenue Service admitted today that some of its employees targeted conservative political groups for extra scrutiny, in violation of its own policy, and despite its earlier denials.

NANCY CORDES, CBS (5/13/2013): In the spring of 2010, just as the Tea Party movement was gaining steam, a group of IRS specialists were told to focus on organizations with ""political sounding names"" seeking tax-exempt status.

NANCY CORDES, CBS (5/13/2013): Groups with names like ""We the People"" or ""Take Back the Country"".

NANCY CORDES, CBS (5/13/2013): Specialists were told to ""be on the lookout for Tea Party applications"", along with groups whose mission was to ""educate about the Constitution"".

And while the tax-exempt status that all political groups get is kind of bullshit, it's bullshit that should at least be granted fairly and equitably, spread around evenly, if you will. So unlike much of the Benghazi inquiry, this seems like a genuine scandal. So explanation please, let's say from the individual who oversees tax-exempt organizations for the IRS.



LOIS LERNER, IRS DIRECTOR OF EXEMPT ORGANIZATIONS (5/10/2013): They used names like Tea Party or Patriots, and they selected cases simply because the application had those names in the title. That was wrong. The IRS would like to apologize for that.

And since we're talking about this, you know how on my taxes I put down that I have a farm? Actually, I had a salad. So... sorry.

But don't worry, it gets funnier!



5/10/2013: LOIS LERNER, IRS DIRECTOR OF EXEMPT ORGANIZATIONS: I said that about a quarter of the cases that were selected for full developments had either Tea Party or Patriot in their name. TOM COSTELLO, NBC NEWS: OK. Sorry. Thank you for the clarification. But that would be a quarter of the 300 then, so we are talking 75 or so? LOIS LERNER, IRS DIRECTOR OF EXEMPT ORGANIZATIONS: That's correct. Is that a quarter? That's correct. Thank you. I'm not good at math.

That's a good one! Lady who works at the place that calculates people's taxes.

Well, congratulations, President Barack Obama. Conspiracy theorists, who generally can survive in anaerobic environments, have just had an algae bloom dropped on their fucking heads. Thus removing the last arrow in your pro-governance quiver. Skepticism about your opponents. Gun control. Why can't we have background checks?



SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TX (4/17/2013): I believe it would put us inexorably on the path to a national gun registry.

SCOTT PELLEY (5/10/2013): The Internal Revenue Service admitted today that some of its employees targeted conservative political groups.

This has, in one seismic moment, shifted the burden of proof from the tinfoil-behatted to the government. The VA claims backlog and the bounced checks foreclosure clusterfuck had already given government competence fetishists fits. (tries saying that again) Government competence fetishists fits.

And now this. In a few short weeks, you've managed to show that when the government wants to do good things, your managerial competence falls somewhere between David Brent, and a cat chasing a laser pointer. But when government wants to flex its more malevolent muscles, YOU'RE FUCKING IRON MAN!!

You know what? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm overreacting. I still believe, I really do, that good government has the power to improve people's lives, and that the people have the power to restrain its excesses. I forget that sometimes, and I'm sorry. It's gonna be OK, and form of government is bigger than just these issues. This storm will pass. It's just... (listens to earpiece) Really? Right now?

(CNN) - While the Internal Revenue Service maintains it was not focusing on conservative groups out of political bias, Sen. Rand Paul claimed Sunday there was a ""written policy"" floating around the agency that said IRS officials were ""targeting people who were opposed to the president.""

""And when that comes forward, we need to know who wrote the policy and who approved the policy,"" the Republican senator from Kentucky said on CNN's ""State of the Union.""



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

Pressed for more precise details about the memo he was referring to, Paul said he hasn't seen such a policy statement but has heard about it.

""Well, we keep hearing the reports and we have several specifically worded items saying who was being targeted. In fact, one of the bullet points says those who are critical of the president. So I don't know if that comes from a policy, but that's what's being reported in the press and reported orally,"" he told CNN's chief political correspondent Candy Crowley. ""I haven't seen a policy statement, but I think we need to see that.""

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell also said the IRS targeting was an example of the administration punishing its opponents.

""There is a culture of intimidation throughout the administration,"" he said Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press.""

While he admitted that all the facts were not yet known, he argued an attitude of ""government knows best” seems to permeate.

""The nanny state is here to tell us all what to do and if you start criticizing, you get targeted,"" he said.

Appearing before a congressional committee Friday, IRS officials said a large increase in workload, rather than deliberate targeting, led to ""foolish mistakes"" and the political discrimination cited by the inspector general's report last week.

Numerous conservative groups said they faced heavy scrutiny and lengthy questionnaires in the past few years as they attempted to get tax-exempt status. The IRS admitted earlier this month it made mistakes, saying its office in Ohio that processed tax-exempt applications began singling out groups whose names included ""tea party"" and ""patriot"" for further review.

The actions have spurred criticism from both parties in Congress and President Barack Obama. A new CNN/ORC International survey released Sunday indicated that 71% of Americans find the targeting unacceptable.

Two IRS officials have announced they'll leave their posts, and more current and former IRS higher-ups are slated to appear for congressional hearings this week.

But Paul argued more people needed to be let go, saying the Obama administration didn't do enough in disciplining officials after the terror attack against a U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya, in September.

""Why does Benghazi go on? No one was ever fired. So people made tragic errors - no one's accepting responsibility and no one was fired,"" he said.

Four State Department officials, however, were disciplined in December, with one resigning and three being placed on administrative leave and relieved of their duties. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton repeatedly said she accepts ultimate responsibility for the safety and security of U.S. diplomats abroad.

Paul, however, stood by his charge that Clinton demonstrated a ""dereliction of duty"" by not reading diplomatic cables requesting more security at the Benghazi post.

""She should have resigned and accepted blame for it,"" he said Sunday.

A potential 2016 contender for the Republican presidential nomination, Paul has taken his attacks against Clinton on the road in battleground states. He plans to make a trip to New Hampshire, the first-in-the-nation primary state, on Monday.

Asked if he was politicizing the controversy, Paul said he brings up the topic ""in every state and every stop because I think it's pretty important for her to accept blame for not providing security.""

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/01/31/Menendez-Prostitution-Scandal-Donor-Melgens-Political-Contributions,2013-01-31 00:00:00,['Matthew Boyle'],Menendez Prostitution Scandal: Donor Melgen's Political Contributions Exploded After IRS Filed Tax Lien,"Ophthalmologist and Democratic political donor Dr. Salomon Melgen may have tried to buy cover from the IRS for the $11.1 million he owes in back taxes from 2006 to present, Breitbart News has learned. Melgen may have intended to court politicians with political donations and prostitutes with the hopes that they would help him wipe his IRS slate clean.

Melgen was a political donor from as far back as the early 1990s. According to Federal Election Commission records published on the Center for Responsive Politics website OpenSecrets.org, Melgen made his first political donation to a young first-term Democratic U.S. Congressman: Bob Menendez. After that $500 donation, Melgen’s friendship with Menendez developed further (the two were reportedly close before Menendez first took office).

Meanwhile, Melgen and his wife Flor started making more political donations to Menendez and other politicians and groups. As the years went by, the donations grew in size. Melgen became a regular on the political circuit. He hosted fundraisers for candidates and became close with the Clinton family throughout the 1990s. Salomon and Flor Melgen donated $2,000 total to President Bill Clinton’s 1996 re-election campaign, after having given $3,000 to Hillary Clinton’s brother–Hugh Rodham–for his failed 1994 U.S. Senate bid out of Florida.

The donations continued to grow in size and quantity before Melgen began facing tax problems with the IRS in July 2002. The Free Beacon reports that the IRS filed a federal tax lien against Melgen for about $1.3 million then for unpaid taxes dating back to 1999, and that lien was released in November 2002.

Melgen continued supporting Democratic politicians from Florida and some other higher-profile Democrats around the country. He and his wife supported now-former Sens. Chris Dodd and Bob Graham, and Sens. Tom Harkin Chuck Schumer and Bill Nelson. He threw some cash to then House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt (who reared Nancy Pelosi in House politics in the early 2000s after he lost the House Majority to Newt Gingrich in the 1994 elections.

After that original tax lien was wiped away–at this time, the details of why the lien was removed are unclear–all was going well for Melgen until, in 2008, he got slapped with another lien. According to the Free Beacon, the IRS charges in that lien that Melgen owed $6.2 million in back taxes dating to 1998. That second lien was lifted in August 2011.

It was in the middle of these first two liens–around the beginning of 2006–that Melgen ramped up his political activity. Until then, from that first donation to Menendez in 1993, Melgen and his wife Flor had donated a total of $88,360 to political candidates and groups. Save for two anomalies–a $250 donation to former Florida Republican Rep. Mark Foley, who resigned after his own sex scandal hit him, and a $1,000 donation his wife Flor gave to George H.W. Bush in the early 1990s–Melgen and his family didn’t donate to Republicans.

From the beginning of 2006 to present, Melgen almost quadrupled his political donation activity of the previous decade or longer. In the past seven years, he, his wife, and his daughter Melissa–who is the marketing director for her father’s eye clinic company–donated a total of $324,600 to political figures and groups. Like before, most of that went to Democrats.

According to a current Dominican Republic government official this reporter interviewed while writing for The Daily Caller before joining Breitbart News, Melgen allegedly began hosting sex parties replete with “sex, hookers and drinking.” Menendez allegedly attended these parties. While the senator and his staff deny prostitution parties took place at the villa or that Menendez participated in them–even though two prostitutes have alleged, in an interview with this reporter who broke the original story while at The Daily Caller, that they were paid to have sex with Menendez–Menendez’s staff admitted the senator flew to the Dominican on Melgen’s private plane on three occasions and told NBC News’ Michael Isikoff that Menendez stays at Melgen’s villa while there about twice a year.

The Dominican official told this reporter Menendez has allegedly been attending these sex parties at Melgen’s villa “for at least the past three years, probably longer.”

Back in the United States, Melgen continued increasing his political profile as a donor. In 2011, he expanded his reach outside the Democratic Party to begin funding two prominent Hispanic Republicans’ political efforts. He and his wife pushed Florida Republican Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. Over the course of 2011 and 2012, the Melgens donated $10,000 to Diaz-Balart and $9,800 to Ros-Lehtinen–a powerful congresswoman who at the time chaired the House Foreign Relations Committee.

As these sex parties allegedly continued in the Dominican, and Melgen continued building his political profile with bigger and bigger donations to higher and higher profile politicians–all while flying his private jet around–the doctor’s tax problems went from bad to worse. The Free Beacon reports that in May 2011 Melgen was hit with another IRS tax lien, this one for $11.1 million in unpaid taxes dating back to 2006. The previous $6.2 million lien was still in effect for another few months before the IRS released it in August 2011–meaning the doctor had $17.3 million in liens against him at that point.

The $11.1 million lien remains in place to this day. But in April 2011, one month before the IRS filed this additional lien for $11.1 million, and four months before the earlier $6.2 million IRS lien was released, the doctor and journalist Emilio Sanchez founded Hispanic media company VOXXI. Sanchez is the CEO.

“At VOXXI, we aim to fill a void in the mainstream media by delivering great journalism and telling captivating stories that educate, engage and entertain, all with a Hispanic touch and enriched by the power of social media,” VOXXI said in its mission statement. “We will defend the role of Hispanics in this nation by providing a news platform where Latinos can be heard and respected. As an independent voice, VOXXI fosters an open and dynamic dialogue, empowering our community to act and react on current events and trends.”

Documents filed with Florida’s Secretary of State’s office show Melgen is listed as the managing member of La Vox LLC, the limited liability company that owns VOXXI.

A few months later, at the Newseum in Washington, D.C., Melgen and Sanchez threw a bash celebrating VOXXI’s launch. Photos published online from the event show attendees other than Melgen and Sanchez include: Menendez, Diaz-Balart and Ros-Lehtinen, among many other politicians.

In a phone interview with Breitbart News on Thursday, Sanchez said the Menendez-Melgen story had nothing to do with his website. “There is no relationship between VOXXI and the Dr. Salomon Melgen–Senator Robert Menendez story,” he said. “We don’t have to make a statement.”

When asked if Melgen owned 100 percent of La Vox LLC or had a controlling interest in the company, Sanchez responded: “I don’t have to give you financial information on the company.”

Sanchez also said an earlier report from LatinoRebels.com that his company would be releasing a statement on the scandal was “not true,” and that his company won’t release a statement.

Through a spokeswoman, Diaz-Balart refused to comment to Breitbart News when asked for details on his connections to Melgen. A spokesperson for Ros-Lehtinen has not returned several requests for comment.

About two months after that event was Easter week. That week is the timeframe in which two women from the Dominican Republic alleged, in an interview with this reporter, they were under-paid to have sex with Menendez; they claim they were promised $500 each but say they only received $100 apiece.

Shortly after that Easter-week incident, a tipster who goes by the name “Peter Williams” alerted the George Soros-funded Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), which began investigating. CREW alerted ABC News reporter Rhonda Schwartz, who also started investigating but for reasons unknown never ran a story, and the FBI.

FBI Special Agent Regino Chavez launched an inquiry into the prostitution angle of this scandal as it relates to Menendez and Melgen as early as August 1, 2012, emails show. In September 2012, Chavez emailed “Williams” to tell him that the FBI had been able to “confirm most of” the information he was providing on that front and that the FBI “know[s] that you are providing accurate information.”

As Schwartz never continued to not run a story on the matter and CREW didn’t publish anything either–while the FBI worked its will–this reporter got wind of the allegations floating around there. Early on November 1, 2012, this reporter broke the story in The Daily Caller.

A couple weeks ago, the emails between “Williams” and the FBI’s Chavez surfaced, as did many more details.

Over the ensuing months since the story first broke, ABC News has not run a story. While guest-hosting ABC’s Sunday news show “This Week,” the network’s foreign affairs correspondent Martha Raddatz had Menendez on for six minutes and chose not to ask about the FBI inquiry. Media coverage elsewhere has been scant as well.

Melgen’s personal media company has ignored the story, something a VOXXI spokeswoman told Breitbart News has been a decision made by leadership. “It was an editorial decision,” VOXXI spokeswoman Julissa Bonfante said when asked why the outlet didn’t cover it.

Washington (CNN) - It was a sideshow, but a compelling sideshow nonetheless.

The main act was Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's at times angry, at times emotional testimony on Wednesday at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's hearing on the September terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, that killed the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans.

But presidential politics was another storyline, thanks to three of the participants who might be harboring 2016 ambitions.

Clinton, the outgoing secretary of state, faces constant pressure from fellow Democrats to make another bid for her party's presidential nomination, even though she's said over and over that another run for the White House is not in the cards for her.

The other two were Republican Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Rand Paul of Kentucky. Both were elected in 2010 with strong support from the tea party. Paul has publicly stated that he's considering a bid for the 2016 GOP nomination. Rubio has not been as expressive, but is considered someone who also has White House ambitions.

The two senators were polar opposites in their questioning of Clinton during the hearing, which may say something about both men's possible strategies towards 2016.

Rubio went first, stating, ""We all wish that this had never happened so this hearing would never have to happen. But we're glad to see you here and wish you all the best,"" before asking, ""One of the things that I'm interested in exploring with you is how information flows within the State Department and in particular in hindsight looking forward how we can prevent some of this happening.""

Clinton was gracious in her answer, saying up front that, ""I appreciate your kind words. And I reiterate my taking responsibility.""

While understated, Rubio's three questions probed whether Clinton had inquired into security for U.S. diplomats in Libya in the year leading up to the attacks.

Paul didn't so much question Clinton as confront her.

""I'm glad that you're accepting responsibility. I think ultimately with your leaving you accept the culpability for the worst tragedy since 9/11. And I really mean that,"" declared Paul, adding that, ""Had I been president at the time and I found that you did not read the cables from Benghazi, you did not read the cables from Ambassador Stevens, I would have relieved you from your post. I think it's inexcusable.""

While Republican Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin asked tough questions, Paul's comments stood out.

But when he finally asked a question, it was whether the U.S. was involved in the transfer of weapons from Libya to Turkey.

Clinton appeared almost bemused by the question, saying: ""To Turkey? I'll have to take the question to the record. No one ever raised that with me.""

So which strategy was more effective?

""Rand Paul will never have to worry about winning a general election for president of the United States,"" said Republican strategist and CNN contributor Alex Castellanos. ""Even though it might make the entire party look unreasonable, he can attack Democrats until the libertarians in the GOP base foam at the mouth and it is all to his advantage.""

""Marco Rubio has a different and more serious hand of cards to play. He may not only compete in a general election, he may lead the nation someday. He has to demonstrate that he is a potential president and not a partisan politician. If you want to be president, you have to act like someone who could represent the entire nation,"" added Castellanos, who served as a media strategist for seven presidential campaigns and who co-founded Purple Strategies, a bipartisan public affairs firm.

Another GOP strategist, who asked to remain anonymous so he could speak more freely, said that each senator had a different mission: ""This is a classic case of the tortoise and the hare, with Marco Rubio more concerned about gaining traction than garnering headlines, as Paul's questioning is sure to do.""

Republican strategist Ron Bonjean says that Clinton's poll numbers may be behind Rubio's strategy.

""Senator Rubio understands that Hillary Clinton has very high ratings and the Benghazi crisis has not damaged her image or credibility among American voters. For a 2016 general election, Rubio must get back the lost share of female voters from the last election, so why not let other Senators such as Rand Paul and John McCain go after her?"" asks Bonjean, who served as a top adviser to Republican leaders in the House and Senate before co-founding a public affairs firm.

Clinton did come to the hearing equipped with some very high public opinion numbers.

According to a new ABC News/Washington Post poll released Wednesday morning, just a few hours before the outgoing secretary of state testified in front of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in the morning and before the House Foreign Affairs Committee in the afternoon, two-thirds of Americans said they have a favorable impression of Clinton, while just over one in four saying they have a unfavorable impression.

An NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey released last week indicated that nearly seven in ten approved of the job Clinton was doing as America's top diplomat, with just a quarter of the public saying they disapproved.

But both surveys pointed to a partisan divide, with nearly all Democrats and two thirds of independents, but only a minority of Republicans, giving Clinton a thumbs up. But that partisan divide is not nearly as wide as it is in polling of President Barack Obama.

In the end, all three possible 2016 candidates got something out of this hearing.

Could this 2013 hearing about a terrorist attack in 2012 be one of the opening acts in the 2016 election? And will we see clips from the hearing in 2016 campaign commercials?

Is Proud to Announce an Expansion,"“Look, I am not going to take any clients that conflict with OFA. What I want to do with my work is just work with people and causes that I believe in. And OFA will be the most important thing that I do.”

-- Jim Messina, campaign manager to President Obama, talking to Politico for an article rolling out his new firm.

So, the president is not disbanding his campaign, and in fact will be continuing to raise money for what was a billion-dollar effort last year. Big donors will reportedly be able to get face time with the president for helping finance the ongoing effort.

Now we learn that the president’s campaign manager will be keeping his position at OFA, previously known as Organizing for America and Obama for America, now called Organizing for Action, but taking on other like-minded clients.

The sitting president will have a permanent, personal, well-funded campaign arm that peddles access to the commander in chief and deploys those funds to help the president win ongoing political fights ahead of the midterm elections. And now, the campaign manager will be able to open up side ventures with corporations, campaigns and groups who he believes share the president’s aims.

What could possibly go wrong?

This evolving story about access, influence, the permanency of campaigning and the diminished role of the president as a dealmaker in Washington is fascinating in many ways. But two things stand out: What it says about the bias of the political press and what it says about the failure of the U.S. campaign finance system.

Imagine, if in 2005, Karl Rove, George W. Bush’s top strategist, or Ken Mehlman, his re-election campaign manager, had announced that rather than disbanding the campaign, it would be kept alive in perpetuity. Renamed Better County instead of Bush/Cheney, the new entity would help the president pressure Congress to allow private Social Security accounts, school choice, domestic oil drilling and a host of other favored topics of the re-elected president.

When oil CEOs, conservative activists, Wall Street investment moguls and others showed up with checks to fund the enterprise, lured by the promise of face-time with the president, how would those articles have looked?

When Rove or Mehlman announced that they would also be working directly with Halliburton, the NRA, the Christian Coalition and pro-Iraq war groups would a Politico write-up sound the same as it did for the launch of Messina Inc.?

When Hollywood, big bankers, big labor, green energy subsidy seekers, technology firms and other Democratic stalwarts drop checks on Obama and hire Messina will it sound the same as if Bush Inc. had done the same with traditional Republican funders?

“Partnering with stakeholders” or “Selling influence?” The answer depends on what you think of the aims of those doing the partnering or buying.

It is seemingly inconceivable to many in the political press that to a big chunk of the electorate the green, gun controlling, union organizing, Big Gulp banning, insurance mandating, bank bail-outing side of things is just as scary as the war, oil and investment side of things was to John Kerry supporters post-election. That’s because most of the reporters were Kerry supporters.

Bush, of course, didn’t do anything like what Obama is doing now and mostly played by the post-Watergate rules that steered politics in America for a generation. Rove stayed in the White House and Mehlman went over to run the Republican National Committee. Both men were trying to do the same thing for the president as Messina is now: win policy fights and Midterm elections. But Rove and Mehlman were doing it inside the confines of ethics and campaign fundraising rules, oftentimes ineffective or cockamamie but always tricky to navigate.

Mehlman, especially, had to deal with those rules but he also had to worry about what all of the members of the Republican National Committee and all of the Republican office holders wanted. He was Bush’s man at the RNC, but he was still at the RNC.

Messina has a constituency of one: Barack Obama, who not coincidentally, is the product Messina is selling. Obama is blowing off the Democratic National Committee, which will have to do the work of surviving midterm elections with little help from the incumbent president. And donors who want the biggest bang for the buck will quickly realize that it's better to be able to write unlimited checks for direct access than fuss with all those annoying old campaign laws. As the Clintons and Al Gore learned, those rules may seem toothless but can still deliver an unwelcome bite.

[pullquote]

The funniest part of the Politico write-up is the assurances that Messina will not be a lobbyist. Why on earth would anyone serious about peddling influence register as a lobbyist?

Registering as a lobbyist is required for those folks who trudge through Capitol corridors working on minutiae in legislation. It’s required to meet congressional ethics rules. But to pedal access to the president and access to his political machine? No registration required. Never has been.

Registering as a lobbyist would be stupid since it would force the administration to again crawfish on access to lobbyists. Unregistered, Messina will be free to float between the funders and the president without any icky labels or ethics troubles.

But the Politico article on the Messina rollout still assures readers that he will not become a lobbyist. Phew.

Whether this new arrangement will work at anything other than enriching Messina and helping Democratic donors stay plugged in is an open question. Will a permanent campaign based on community organizing principles deliver policy victories and an all-Democratic Congress for Obama or will Americans quickly tire of a lame-duck president who keep saying the same things? Time will tell.

What is clear, though, is that the campaign finance and ethics rules that politicians have been gaming so artfully since the late 1970s are kaput.

The reporters murmuring their admiration for the bold innovations of Obama and Messina in shucking the rules and refusing access to the press ought to bear that in mind as they consider the future. Now broken, the old rules will not be resurrected. What comes after this will be more egregious.

And how would they feel if the next bold innovator is a President Rubio or a President Paul and the “stakeholders” are Wayne LaPierre, Rex Tillerson and David Koch? And what if that same Republican president declined to answer questions on the subject saying he preferred to Tweet his opinions rather than be interviewed?

Excusing behaviors in presidents they like and trust paves the way for even worse conduct from those they dislike and distrust. Having taken a pass on Democratic misbehavior it will be impossible to raise the alarm when the Republicans come back around.

And Now, A Word From Charles

“And what all of this is about creating enough revenue, increasing American taxation, so he can have an entitlement state in Europe which requires the European levels of taxation. He is not interested in debt or cutting or deficits. He wants to spend because he wants expanded state. That is what all of this is about.”

Blow'],"It’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World - The New York Times","The truly anti-war-inclined, many of them true liberals, are so exhausted by our current and recent forays that they can’t even fathom another.

And they have real concerns. Would a United States military action be legal without a United Nations resolution? How do we ensure that dropping bombs won’t be tantamount to whacking the hornets’ nest, setting in motion painful repercussions that we cannot foresee? What to make of this Goldilocks bombing strategy of not-too-little, not-too-much but just enough? How is such a thing calibrated? And why bomb at all if we plan to leave Bashar Assad in power?

This genuine anti-war-in-Syria crowd finds itself in the odd company of the pro-war-on-Obama crowd. The latter will never be satisfied with anything this president does or how he does it. The president’s very presence irritates like a rock in a shoe.

For many of these folks, everything is a bargaining chip and all roads lead to Benghazi.

On Sunday, Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican, said:

“One of the problems with all of this focus on Syria is it’s missing the ball from what we should be focused on, which is the grave threat from radical Islamic terrorism. I mean, just this week is the one-year anniversary of the attack on Benghazi.”

With Benghazi, Republicans are like a dog with a bone.

So into this crazy, mixed-up world of odd alliances steps the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, with a proposal — whether serious or not only time will tell — to defuse the situation by creating an even odder alliance: the Russians persuade the Syrians to declare and surrender their chemical weapons to international monitors in order to prevent American military action.

Under this new deal, we’d all be partners of a sort, working toward a common goal. And ironically, such a deal will most likely require boots on the ground in order to guard weapons inspectors and secure weapons, something that President Obama promised wouldn’t happen if Congress gave him authorization to bomb."

Though Hull did not specifically name IRS Chief Counsel William J. Wilkins as the person who ordered him to send Tea Party group applications to his office “for further review,” Hull’s testimony brought the Obama political appointee to the forefront in the ever expanding scandal.

On July 18, Hull testified that in March 2011 Judy Kindell, a senior technical advisor to Lois Lerner, then the head of the IRS tax exempt division, “told me to forward my recommendations [concerning the approval of Tea Party group applications for tax exempt status] to the Office of Chief Counsel for their review.”

Hull was asked if Ms. Kindell agreed with his earlier recommendations that the IRS had sufficient information at that time to make a determination on the Tea Party groups applications for tax-exempt status.

“She did not say whether she agreed or not. She said it should go to chief counsel,” Hull told the committee.

On Tuesday the connection between Wilkins and the White House was strengthened when several media outlets reported that Wilkins met with the President at the White House on April 23, 2012, just two days before the IRS issued a revised set of BOLO (“Be on the lookout”) instructions to IRS agents reviewing tax-exempt applications that appear to target Tea Party groups for more stringent review standards.

Also on Tuesday, True the Vote, a Tea Party group that focuses on preventing voter fraud and was one of the groups subjected to IRS targeting, announced that it is suing Mr. Wilkins, adding him to the list of defendants in the lawsuit it filed against the IRS in May of this year.

Wilkins, a graduate of Yale University and Harvard Law School, has been a partner with Wilmer, Cutler, Pickering, Hale, and Door (also known as WilmerHale), the prestigious Washington, D.C. law firm, since 1988. According to Federal Election Commission records, Mr. Wilkins has donated generously to political candidates over the years, most of them affiliated with the Democratic Party. In 2008 he represented Reverend Jeremiah Wright’s Chicago church, the one which President Obama attended for twenty years, on a pro bono basis before the IRS. President Obama named him Chief Counsel at the IRS in April, 2009.

Helderman', 'Reporter Focusing On Political Enterprise Stories', 'July', 'Rosalind Helderman Is A Political Enterprise', 'Investigations Reporter For The Washington Post. She Joined The Post In']",Virginia Democrat to Gov. McDonnell: Explain gifts or resign,"A Democratic state senator on Tuesday called on Virginia Gov. Robert F. McDonnell (R) to detail and return all gifts given to members of his family by a prominent donor — or resign from office.

State Sen. J. Chapman Petersen (Fairfax) became the first elected official in either party to raise the possibility that the governor should resign over the gifts.

In a letter to the governor, Petersen wrote that revelations about gifts provided by dietary supplement manufacturer Jonnie R. Williams Sr. gave “the strong impression that your family was materially and systematically benefited by this person and his company.”

“In return, it appears you allowed this person to use the Governor’s Mansion and the Governor’s Office for the purpose of giving unique credibility to his company,” Petersen wrote in the letter. “That is unacceptable.”

Petersen wrote that if the governor can’t explain or deny the reports or return the items, he would “humbly suggest” that McDonnell step down.

Tucker Martin, a spokesman for the governor, called the letter “blatantly political” and “not unexpected,” citing a blog post from Petersen questioning why Democrats did not joke about the Williams situation at a major annual fundraiser Saturday.

Petersen’s call comes as anxiety has deepened in Richmond over the growing controversy, which has sparked state and federal investigations.

One Republican lawmaker said Tuesday that there is now “concern” among his colleagues about the effectiveness of McDonnell for the rest of his term. Another Republican said GOP legislators are “appalled.” Both lawmakers spoke on the condition of anonymity so that they could speak freely about the governor.

“It’s just embarrassing,” the GOP lawmaker said. “Why wouldn’t they be jumping up and down about this?” the Republican said of Democrats. “Every time I see something new on this, I just think, ‘You have got to be kidding me.’ ”

But those sentiments are being expressed among Republicans only quietly, to avoid deepening the governor’s troubles.

And Democrats have been virtually silent about McDonnell, even as they have hammered Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli II, the GOP nominee for governor, over his ties to the same donor.

A spokesman for the state Democratic Party, Brian Coy, did not directly address whether party leaders agreed with Petersen’s call, instead indicating that McDonnell should “address questions and cooperate with the two ongoing investigations.”

A spokesman for Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic candidate for governor, noted that McAuliffe has called for a ban on gifts valued at more than $100 but also declined to join Petersen’s effort.

“There are ongoing investigations that will provide concrete facts and evidence so that Virginians know exactly what happened,” spokesman Josh Schwerin said.

Williams paid $15,000 for the catering at the 2011 wedding of McDonnell’s daughter. Authorities are also investigating whether Williams provided tens of thousands of dollars in additional payments to members of the McDonnell family, as well as gifts of high-end clothing, according to people familiar with the inquiry.

One of those gifts was a $6,500 Rolex watch for the governor that had been solicited from Williams by first lady Maureen McDonnell, those people have said. The governor wore the watch in a January 2012 interview with the Richmond Times Dispatch and told the newspaper that it was a gift from his wife.

He did not disclose the catering, he has said, because it was a wedding present to his daughter. He has not addressed other gifts from Williams, including the additional money, clothes or the Rolex.

McDonnell has said he has been diligent in his annual financial disclosures of gifts he received, but he has repeatedly refused to publicly outline all of the gifts Williams gave to Maureen McDonnell or other members of his family.

He has said he is constrained in what he can say on the topic because of the investigations.

“As an attorney, certainly Senator Petersen understands this office’s not discussing the details of matters pending in the legal process,” Martin said in a statement Tuesday. “And, as a legislator, certainly, Senator Petersen is aware that Virginia’s disclosure requirements do not pertain to the families of elected officials.”

The gifts came as the McDonnells took steps to promote Star Scientific and its product, a non-FDA-approved anti-inflammatory called Anatabloc.

On Aug. 1, 2011, Williams met with a top policy adviser for the Department of Health and Human Resources to pitch his product, at a meeting organized by Maureen McDonnell.

The first couple allowed the company to use the governor’s mansion for a luncheon marking the launch of the product in August 2011.

The governor has characterized those efforts as part of a broad campaign to boost state business and said the company got no special benefits, including economic incentive grants or state contracts, from his administration.

According to state law, McDonnell must disclose all gifts to him worth more than $50. But he does not have to disclose gifts to immediate family members or gifts received from family or “personal friends.”

He has said he has known Williams for four or five years and considers him a “family friend.”

Since taking office in 2010, McDonnell has disclosed receiving $9,650 in personal gifts — including private plane rides and a summer lake house vacation — from Williams and Star Scientific.

Petersen said in an interview that he decided to write the letter because he was disturbed by what he termed the “deafening silence” from the political establishment about the revelations.

“I’m not saying it’s legal or it’s illegal. I’m saying it’s unacceptable,” he said."

N.Y. attorney general is suing Trump and his business school for %2440M

Trump says Schneiderman tried to leverage campaign contributions Ivanka

%27Wild accusations%2C%27 says Schneiderman spokesman

ALBANY, N.Y. — Celebrity developer Donald Trump has filed two ethics complaints against state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, accusing him of misconduct.

Trump says the Democratic attorney general solicited campaign donations from Trump's daughter even as Schneiderman's office was investigating the real estate mogul's ""Trump University,"" according to the complaints.

Schneiderman hasn't solicited Trump for a campaign contribution since he took office in January 2011, according to a spokesman. And while Schneiderman says he met socially with Ivanka Trump and her husband, neither is an official of Trump University, and anyone who contributes must certify he or she has no matters under investigation by the attorney general's office, the spokesman said.

In August, Schneiderman sued Trump and his business school for $40 million. Schneiderman said the school engaged in persistent fraud and illegal and deceptive conduct and violated federal consumer protection law. In a conflict that was nasty from the start, Schneiderman said then that, ""No one, no matter how rich or famous they are, has a right to scam hard-working New Yorkers.""

Trump, who is considering a run for governor as a Republican, filed complaints this month with two state ethics panels, the Joint Commission on Public Ethics and the state Moreland Commission to Investigate Public Corruption. Schneiderman has appointees and staff working for the Moreland Commission and deputized many of its commissioners. The commission is charged with uncovering ""pay-to-play"" corruption involving campaign contributions and official state action throughout state government.

""We consider and review all communications that are submitted to the commission,"" Moreland spokeswoman Michelle Duffy said. ""However, we do not discuss potential or ongoing investigations.""

Neither she nor John Milgrim of the Joint Commission on Public Ethics, New York's ethics and lobbying board, would comment on any action their panel is taking as a result of the complaints.

Trump's attorney in the ethics case, former state lobbying regulator David Grandeau, said Schneiderman tried to use his leverage while running an investigation to wring out more campaign contributions from Trump's daughter, Ivanka.

""It's pay-or-pray fundraising tactics,"" Grandeau said.

""Donald Trump and his associates will say and do anything to avoid talking about the facts in this case,"" Schneiderman spokesman Matt Mittenthal said. ""His wild accusations, outlandish conspiracy theories and outright distortions will not distract Attorney General Schneiderman from pursuing justice for the students victimized by Mr. Trump and his scam university."""

Over Memorial Day weekend that all changed.

It is fairly obvious that the media used the three-day weekend to gather themselves, talk to the White House, and coordinate talking points with one another. The result of this coordination has been apparent in the words “overreach,” “McCarthyism,” “disarray,” and “no GOP agenda” — all being uttered simultaneously across media platforms that are supposed to compete, not coordinate, with one another.

The idea is for the media to revert to form. Rather than seek the truth, the media will go back to attacking those seeking the truth. Obama’s approval rating is going down, his left-wing agenda and legacy are in jeopardy, and the bleeding must be stopped.

Another piece of coordination between media and Democrats reared its ugly head today in the most expected of places: Politico. No one takes more glee in savaging private citizens who dare not support Obama than Obama’s bullying thugs at Politico.

During Tuesday’s testimony, Congressional Democrats attacked the private citizens brought before them to tell their individual horror stories. The witnesses were Tea Party groups and other conservative groups put through months of paralyzing harassment by an IRS that had intentionally singled them out based on their political beliefs.

Democrats, however, did not care about the fact that these groups had been targeted, and they kept insinuating that these groups deserved the IRS scrutiny due to their political activity.

Well, that is not the point and everyone knows it. Had the IRS put the same number of left-leaning groups through the same hyper-scrutiny as they did right-leaning groups, none of this would be happening. There would be no scandal.

But the idea here is to change the subject from the fact that the IRS singled out Obama’s political foes for paralyzing scrutiny in the run-up to Obama’s re-election campaign, to the supposed abuse of a tax exempt status by conservative political groups.

The thinking goes that if Democrats can make the Tea Party look like tax cheats it will take the heat off of Obama and further damage his opponents.

Well, right on cue, Politico arrives this morning like the cavalry with an appallingly dishonest (but expected) piece of reporting that falls right in line with what Congressional Democrats did yesterday. It is as pure a piece of coordination and left-wing propaganda as you will ever read.

And this is the only kind of investigative reporting Politico ever does. Imagine if Politico poured these same resources into investigating the IRS’s connections to the White House or the shaping of the IRS talking points by the State Department.

But today’s Politico piece is all about changing the subject. All it looks at is the political activity of yesterday’s Tea Party witnesses in order to make a case that they deserved scrutiny from the IRS.

The Politico piece, however, intentionally ignores the fact that this is not the point of the scandal. The point is that these groups were singled out for harassment by their own government.

The Politico piece intentionally ignores and chooses not to report on all the political activity of tax-exempt left-leaning groups (like Obama’s Organizing for America) — groups approved by the IRS, that are every bit as political as those on the right who were paralyzed by lengthy and intrusive questionnaires and threats of perjury-those who had their information leaked to the media.

Working directly with the Democrats, Politico is now putting in overtime to desperately steer subject away from and distract from partisan horrors committed by the IRS.

The actual crime is no longer the story, according to Politico. No, the story is that the victims had it coming.

Va. Democrats will remove racy posters used to drive turnout on college campuses

By Ben Pershing,

Sex sells. Even in governor’s races.

That appears to be what the Democratic Party of Virginia was thinking when it distributed racy posters to college campuses, looking to educate students about Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli II’s (R) support for the commonwealth’s controversial anti-sodomy law.

As was first reported by the Hampton Roads TV station WAVY, two posters spotted last weekend at Norfolk State University say “Ken Cuccinelli wants to make oral sex a felony” and urge students to vote Nov. 5. One poster says, “Get your head in the game,” while another says, “Don’t let Election Day go down without you.”

Both posters say at the bottom that they were paid for by “Education Votes, a project of the Democratic Party of Virginia.” They were distributed to other campuses around the state, too, but DPV spokesman Brian Coy said the party has had a change of heart.

“While we feel Virginians deserve to know the truth about Ken Cuccinelli’s extreme social agenda, we apologize to those who were offended,” Coy said. “We’re working to remove these posters from the campuses in question and they will not be used again.”

Garren Shipley, a spokesman for the Republican Party of Virginia, called the posters “par for the course” for Virginia Democrats.

“Not only does it repeat this thoroughly-debunked Terry McAuliffe falsehood,” Shipley said, “but it manages to do it in an even more crass and tasteless way than before. ... Mailers and posters like this are what you get when your candidates have no record to run on. The Democratic Party of Virginia should be ashamed. But they’re probably not.”

The posters are a reference to Virginia’s “crimes against nature” law, which bans oral and anal sex. The U.S Supreme Court ruled in 2003 that laws which criminalize sexual activity between consenting adults are unconstitutional. Based on that decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit ruled this year that Virginia’s statute was unconstitutional.

Cuccinelli has defended the anti-sodomy law as an important tool for prosecuting child predators and appealed that decision. But the U.S. Supreme Court said two weeks ago that it would not hear Cuccinelli’s final appeal. McAuliffe, Cuccinelli’s opponent in the governor’s race, has called for the law to be updated to comport with the 2003 Supreme Court ruling.

Trial lasted 5 months

His father%2C contractor friend also convicted of some charges

Each defendant could receive up to 20 years in prison

DETROIT — Former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick took off his suit coat, tie, belt and jewelry. He handed his belongings to his mother and crossed his hands behind his back so federal agents could handcuff him.

It was a humiliating ending to a case that prosecutors said was about ""breathtaking corruption.""

A federal jury convicted Kilpatrick, his longtime contractor friend Bobby Ferguson and his father Bernard Kilpatrick on a combined 34 charges. Among the most serious: extortion, bribery and racketeering, which the defense referred to as the government's ""nuclear bomb."" The jury deliberated for 14 days.

The verdict marked a landslide victory for the federal government, which turned its radar gun onto Kilpatrick about a decade ago after a homeless shelter operator donated money to the Kilpatrick Civic Fund in exchange for a political favor.

That donation, which was first disclosed by the Detroit Free Press, triggered an IRS investigation that transformed into a broader probe of widespread corruption throughout City Hall that has ensnared more than 30 convictions.

""Kwame Kilpatrick didn't lead the city, he looted the city,"" U.S. Attorney Barbara McQuade said at a news conference, flanked by the prosecutors who tried the case and the federal agents who investigated it.

Kwame Kilpatrick was found guilty of 24 of 30 counts. Ferguson, who also was led away in handcuffs, was convicted on nine of 11 counts. Bernard Kilpatrick was convicted on just one of four counts: filing false taxes. The jury acquitted him on two other counts and deadlocked on the most serious charge: racketeering.

The government built its case against the Kilpatricks and Ferguson through secret surveillance videos, wiretaps and cooperating witnesses — several of them Kilpatrick's closest friends and aides, who earlier pleaded guilty to various crimes and agreed to testify. Perhaps most compellingly, the government also used text messages from the defendants as evidence stitching together the crimes.

It worked.

After five months of testimony from 90 witnesses, the panel of eight women and four men concluded that Kwame Kilpatrick and Ferguson engaged in a pattern of racketeering that lasted for years. But the panel could not unanimously agree that Bernard Kilpatrick was part of this criminal enterprise, which originally included five defendants.

Ex-city water department director Victor Mercado pleaded guilty to conspiracy during trial. The fifth defendant, former Kwame Kilpatrick right-hand man Derrick Miller, cut a deal before trial and testified against the remaining three. Both await sentencing.

Bernard Kilpatrick, who faces up to three years in prison and remains free pending sentencing, was overcome with emotion after the verdicts were read. In the courtroom, he sobbed as he hugged his son, who smiled and kept saying, ""It's OK, Pops. It's OK.""

Kilpatrick and Ferguson each face up to 20 years in prison but could get more, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office. This far outweighs the punishment he received for his unrelated crimes in the scandal involving sexually explicit text messages and an affair with an aide, triggering his eventual resignation in 2008 and imprisonment.

Kilpatrick shook his head at times as the verdicts were read Monday, at one point mouthing, ""Oh my gosh."" He appeared stunned as he left the courtroom and declined to comment.

Kilpatrick's wife, Carlita Kilpatrick, and his three sons were not in the courtroom. But his mother, former U.S. Rep. Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick, sat alongside friends and other relatives who cried as they watched Kilpatrick and Ferguson leave the courtroom in handcuffs.

""Love you, baby. We love you,"" one woman shouted as Kilpatrick was led away.

""Stay strong,"" Kilpatrick responded, later turning his head and adding: ""No doubt. No fear.""

The woman shouted back: ""None.""



'An important day'

For McQuade, Monday's verdict was long overdue.

She echoed the theme that prosecutors hammered away repeatedly at trial: that the case was about greed.

""Kwame Kilpatrick stole money from the people of Detroit. And while Kwame Kilpatrick enjoyed a lavish lifestyle, he watched the quality of life erode for the people of Detroit,"" McQuade said. ""The mayor cheated the system.""

He did that, McQuade said, with the help of Ferguson, who secured $127 million worth of contracts while his friend was mayor of Michigan's largest city — the bulk of it illegally.

""Our community has spoken,"" McQuade said. ""Our community has said you can't cheat the city and get away with it.""

Detroit FBI chief Robert Foley said Monday was ""an important day for justice and an important day for the city of Detroit.""

Promise of appeal

The defendants were defiant up to the end.

Kilpatrick's lawyer James Thomas said they will appeal, and Kilpatrick maintains his innocence.

""He is definitely going to pursue that with every ounce of his being,"" he said. ""I would expect that the judge is going to sentence him to a very difficult time. If that is the case, would you expect him to not do anything?""

Ferguson also proclaimed his innocence Monday and remained upbeat.

Coming out of the courthouse after the verdicts were announced, he said: ""God is good.""

Minority contractor Craig Davis Sr., owner of Craig's Carpentry, said he was glad to see a guilty verdict.

""I am extremely glad that the people voiced their concerns about this and that the prosecutors came forth and found this is a legitimate case, and that the jurors after months and months of deliberation decided their fate, and their fate was guilty,"" he said.

When Bernard Kilpatrick was asked whether the jury got it wrong, he said: ""Absolutely.""

Michael Rataj, Ferguson's attorney, said he was surprised by the verdict and is considering an appeal.

""Anytime you put your heart and soul into something like we did with this, you're disappointed,"" he said. ""You never really prepare yourself for this. I'm definitely shocked by the verdict.""

Straight to jail

In most white-collar crime trials, defendants are allowed to remain free on bond until they are sentenced.

After the verdicts were announced, the prosecution argued Kwame Kilpatrick and Ferguson should be locked up immediately.

The government argued Kilpatrick has repeatedly ignored court orders, lied about and hidden assets in his state case and violated his parole conditions stemming from the text message scandal. Kilpatrick also has access to cash, the government argued, stressing he can't be trusted not to flee.

Attorneys for Kilpatrick and Ferguson argued they should remain free on bond pending their sentencing and said they weren't a flight risk.

U.S. District Judge Nancy Edmunds, who said it was the defendants' burden to prove they can be trusted to remain free on bond, concluded Kilpatrick hadn't proven that. She concluded the same for Ferguson, who has a 2005 felony conviction for pistol-whipping an employee and, the government says, was later found in possession of guns when he wasn't supposed to have them.

""I think this is a close call,"" Edmunds said after hearing arguments from both sides. Still, she ordered that both men be locked up pending their official sentencing dates, which have not yet been determined.

All about the evidence

The jury — a diverse panel of eight women and four men — agreed to meet with reporters to discuss their verdict, but kept their identities secret.

The jury included five African Americans, one Hispanic female and six whites.

Nearly all who spoke said it came down to the evidence.

""We looked at the evidence as a whole — no one piece sealed the deal,"" said juror No. 9, an African-American male who knew very little about Kilpatrick's legal troubles before the trial started.

The jurors said they came up with a tentative decision Friday, but told the judge they wanted to sleep on it over the weekend.

One juror, an African-American woman who voted twice for Kilpatrick, said she was disappointed by what she learned at trial.

""I saw a lot that really, really turned my stomach,"" the woman said. ""There was never any anger. Disappointment is all that I feel.""

'That's justice'

Witnesses during the trial told of Kwame Kilpatrick's lavish lifestyle — complete with luxury vacations, custom-made suits and golf outings — despite being at the helm of a city so broke it's now on the verge of a state-appointed emergency financial manager to right its finances.

In some cases, longtime friends testified they handed cash to Kilpatrick in envelopes.

Tonya Wells, 50, of Detroit went to the detention hearing

because she said she wanted to see for herself that Kilpatrick would be locked up.

""That's justice. He doesn't deserve to go home. He took money from the citizens of Detroit under false pretenses for his own profit,"" she said as she left the courthouse. ""I'm disgusted.""

Patty Murray, are hiding their budget from their Republican colleagues, Breitbart News has learned exclusively. Murray did share her budget plan with her Democratic colleagues on Tuesday.

The budget is scheduled for markup on Wednesday morning in committee, and senators are only expected to read opening statements at the hearing. It will not be until later on Wednesday that Republicans will be allowed to read the full budget proposal.

House Budget Committee chairman Rep. Paul Ryan, on the other hand, shared his budget with his Democratic colleagues ahead of its release. It is unclear why Murray will not show the budget to Republicans ahead of the Wednesday morning markup hearing. A Murray spokesman has not immediately returned Breitbart News’ request for comment.

A Senate Republican aide told Breitbart News it is possible Senate Democrats will not share their budget ahead of its public release with their colleagues across the aisle because it embarrasses them.

“I think it speaks volumes about Senate Democrats’ fear of the American people that they must hide their plan until they’ve first had a chance to mislead the media about it,” the Senate GOP aide said in an email. “If they had courage and confidence their plan would be popular, they would have been on the Sunday shows and holding press conferences bragging about it, as did Chairman Ryan. Instead, it’s leaks and crickets.”

What is known about Murray’s budget is already proving problematic for the Democrats. The Hill reports the budget includes $1 trillion in tax hikes; Murray claims it contains about $1.85 trillion in deficit reduction between spending cuts and tax hikes. Murray’s budget also voids sequester cuts for the next nine years.

The Hill‘s Erik Wasson notes that “once the sequester cuts are turned off, Murray’s budget appears to reduce deficits by about $800 billion, using the Congressional Budget Office’s baseline.” He adds that Murray’s budget “does not contain net spending cuts with the sequester turned off.”

The Murray budget, according to Wasson, also includes “reconciliation instructions on tax reform, a move that could allow the budget, which cannot be filibustered in the Senate, to become the legislative vehicle for a tax reform bill.”

Murray is supposedly moving forward with that idea even though such a stunt is likely to spark massive Democratic Party infighting. Wasson notes that Montana Democratic Sen. Max Baucus, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, “has opposed including the instructions in the budget, arguing it would tie his hands in tax reform.”

A spokesperson for Baucus has not responded to Breitbart News’ request for comment on how he feels about Murray’s move to include tax reform reconciliation in the budget package."

The minute-long spot, posted Tuesday evening on Weiner’s campaign site, features the former congressman speaking directly to the camera about the state of his mayoral bid.



""You know, sometimes people say to me, 'This campaign is pretty rough. You may want to quit.' I know there are newspaper editors and other politicians that say, ‘Boy, I wish that guy Weiner would quit,’” the Democratic mayoral hopeful says in the spot. “You don’t know New York. You certainly don’t know me. Quit isn’t the way we roll in New York City. We fight through tough things. We are a tough city.”

The spot was released exactly one week after Weiner admitted that he continued to send sexual messages to women he met online even after he was forced out of Congress for similar online dalliances. His wife, Huma Abedin, who joined him in his other campaign ad, is not featured in his latest spot.

Weiner, who looks visibly tired in the ad, insists the race is not about him but “helping New Yorkers.”

“If someone wants to come out with something embarrassing about you in your private life, you have to talk about that for a little while,” Weiner says. “But it’s also reminded me that citizens, when they come up to ya, and they want to talk to you about a situation on their block or at their child’s school or something going on at their job site, that’s what this campaign is all about, and I’ll never forget that.""

It’s unclear if the campaign is reserving television airtime for the spot. A spokeswoman for Weiner did not respond to a request for comment."

Obama’s trust-in-government deficit

By Dan Balz,

Whatever else happens as a result of the multiple controversies that have engulfed the administration, one thing is clear: President Obama has failed to meet one of the most important goals he set out when he was first elected, which was to demonstrate that activist government could also be smart government.

Six weeks after winning the presidency in 2008, Obama reflected on the meaning of the election. He was reluctant to claim, as some others were, that his victory marked the beginning of an era in which Americans would embrace bigger government. Suspicion of command-and-control, top-down government, he said, was “a lasting legacy” of Ronald Reagan’s presidency.

So rather than portraying his first election as the end of a long period of conservative ascendancy, Obama called it “a correction to the correction.” As he put it then: “I think what you saw in this election was people saying: ‘Yes, we don’t want some big, bureaucratic, ever-expanding state. On the other hand, we don’t want a state that’s dysfunctional, that doesn’t believe in its mission, that can’t carry out some of the basic functions of government and provide service to people and be there when they’re hurting.’ ”

He then described what that meant for the government he was beginning to assemble. “What we don’t know yet is whether my administration and this next generation of leadership is going to be able to hew to a new, more pragmatic approach that is less interested in whether we have big government or small government [but is] more interested in whether we have a smart, effective government.”

What has happened since Obama laid down that challenge for his administration? More Americans favor smaller government over bigger government than when he was first elected, according to exit polls from last November. Public confidence in the federal government is as low as it has ever been, according to a Pew Research Center survey released this spring.

This weekend, four of the government’s most important agencies are beset by political controversy, management breakdowns or both: State (what happened in Benghazi, Libya), Treasury (targeting of conservative groups by the Internal Revenue Service), Justice (leak-related investigation of the Association Press) and Defense (rising numbers of sexual assaults).

Add to that the questions about Health and Human Services and its implementation of the Affordable Care Act, and it is little wonder confidence has eroded.

Enough blame to share

There are many reasons for the public’s diminished confidence in the federal government, reflecting general disapproval with the way Washington has worked during the Obama years. The president’s advisers blame Republicans for much of the gridlock and partisan infighting, and they are quick to note that Obama’s approval ratings are far higher than those of the Republicans.

Republicans do bear a considerable share of the responsibility for overall attitudes about Washington and government. Their dismal ratings are a measure of public dissatisfaction with the party generally and with House Republican efforts to thwart the president.

But Obama bears a particular responsibility for failing to do what he said he had to do, which was to convince the public that he could make the part of government that he directly controls — the executive branch — smarter, more effective and more deserving of trust.

Early in his presidency, Obama convened a meeting with a group of historians. The topic he put on the table was: What does it take to be a transformational president? Obama’s ambition to be such a figure could be seen in his first-term agenda, which included a major economic stimulus package, a bailout of the auto industry, a major financial regulatory reform package and, biggest of all, the law that is transforming the nation’s health-care industry.

But public skepticism about government put an extra burden on Obama, as it has on all activist Democratic politicians over the past three decades. To do what he wanted to do through government required building greater confidence in government. Long before the current controversies materialized, he had not been able to do that.

Defenders of his stimulus package say it prevented another depression and helped initiate a turnaround in the economy. But as the recovery sputtered and calls grew for additional stimulus, Obama did not have the political support to launch another round of government intervention because of criticisms that he had already added enormously to the deficit.

Most controversial has been his health-care initiative. Throughout the long battle to enact and then begin to implement the law, Obama’s White House has been unable to win broad public support for it, even though individual pieces are popular. Obama is still fighting to overcome distrust of government as he proceeds with the most complex change in social welfare policy since the 1960s.

Now the president is dealing with unexpected problems, each of which threatens to make the trust-in-government deficit even bigger.

Damaged, but how much?

The most corrosive of the controversies is what happened at the IRS, which singled out tea party and other conservative groups for special scrutiny in their applications for tax-exempt status. That Obama knew nothing about it does little to quell concerns that one of the most-feared units in government was operating out of control.

The multiple failures at the IRS speak of an agency that, at worst, was politically motivated in going after opponents of the president’s agenda and that, at best, showed terrible judgment, lacked vigorous oversight by its managers and misled members of Congress about what was happening.

There is much about the Justice Department’s leak investigation that isn’t known and may not be known, given that it involves national security issues and classified information. But on its face, the collection of telephone records from the Associated Press appears to be so broad that it cannot easily be explained. Because the president, rightly, cannot interfere, he is left mostly helpless in the face of this controversy.

The argument over what happened in Benghazi last Sept. 11 is mired in politics and probably will continue to be. Obama sees the investigation led by Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, as a politically inspired sideshow. Republicans see the administration’s response as a political coverup designed to protect the president and former secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton.

Putting aside the controversy over what happened to the administration’s original talking points as they evolved amid bureaucratic wrangling, what actually happened in Benghazi was a breakdown in security that reflected badly on the administration. Wherever the congressional investigation leads, the findings of the State Department’s internal investigation, which cited “systemic failures and leadership and management deficiencies,” stand as harsh criticism of what happened on Obama’s and Clinton’s watch.

The full political impact of what is unfolding now may not be clear until closer to the 2014 elections. Obama has been damaged, but how much? Republicans are on the offensive but risk overplaying their hand out of deep dislike for this president. But no matter how the electoral politics turn out, Obama’s goal of creating confidence in bigger government has taken a big hit.

Now it'll have to deal with the IRS targeting scandal potentially trailing its latest nominee for ambassador to Tanzania.

Mark Childress, deputy White House chief of staff, was announced Monday evening as President Obama's pick for the Africa post. Obama described him and several other nominees as ""dedicated and accomplished individuals.""

Childress has a lengthy and imposing resume, having served in top positions in the Justice and Health and Human Services departments, as well as in the private sector.

But Childress also was involved in the administration's behind-the-scenes strategy for disclosing the IRS scandal. His name surfaced as one of the few White House officials who were in the loop as the Treasury Department and IRS tried to figure out how to come forward with allegations that IRS officials had systematically singled out conservative groups for additional scrutiny.

Childress and others were told about the looming inspector general report by White House Counsel Kathryn Ruemmler after she was informed on April 24. Childress and his colleagues would have been told several weeks before the IRS went public with the scandal on May 10.

What happened between April 24 and May 10 is not entirely clear. At press briefings in late May, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said not only was Childress looped in by Ruemmler, but he also subsequently had discussions with the Treasury Department about how to release the information.

""This was part of just trying to find out when and under what circumstances this information would be released, made public,"" Carney said.

Carney indicated they discussed a couple possibilities -- IRS official Lois Lerner delivering a speech, or the acting commissioner addressing the issue during congressional testimony.

Neither of those two scenarios ended up happening. Instead, Lerner dropped the bombshell in response to a planted question at a Washington event on May 10. Former IRS Commissioner Steven Miller has since described the handling of the matter on May 10 -- namely, the use of a planted question -- as an ""incredibly bad idea.""

Carney said in late May that the White House did not know what led to that decision, indicating the White House was not involved.

An administration official also told FoxNews.com on Tuesday that Childress was not involved in any discussion about planting the question.

Though Republicans have questioned to what extent White House officials were aware of the targeting, no White House official to date has been implicated in the scandal. Disciplinary action has, so far, been contained to the IRS.

Obama announced Childress as his pick for ambassador to Tanzania shortly after returning from a visit to the African nation."
http://news.yahoo.com/new-book-says-hillary-clinton-nearly-replaced-biden-on-2012-ticket-235247365.html,,[],New book says Obama team considered Hillary Clinton as replacement for Biden on 2012 ticket,"A new book claims that President Barack Obama’s advisers explored the possibility of replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the president’s re-election ticket.

Excerpts from “Double Down,” by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, add to rumors going back to shortly after Democrats took an electoral beating in the 2010 midterm elections.

Obama advisers, led by then-White House chief of staff William M. Daley, reportedly conducted “extensive focus groups” and polling well into 2011. However neither Biden nor Obama were actually part of these conversations, according to the book.

For his part, Daley confirms his role, but he says it was only “due diligence” and never advanced beyond standard research.

“I was vocal about looking into a whole bunch of things, and this was one of them,” Daley told The New York Times. “You have to remember, at that point the president was in awful shape, so we were like, ‘Holy Christ, what do we do?′”

In an interview on ""CBS This Morning,"" Daley downplayed the idea.



""Not for a moment was there a serious discussion"" of dumping Biden for Clinton, but he did say it was ""looked at.""

""Anybody who would have brought this idea to the president in the Oval Office, in my opinion, probably would have been thrown out immediately,"" Daley added. The White House also issued a denial Friday morning.

Another reason the campaign probably backed off the idea: It didn't seem like it'd be a game changer in the election.



“When the research came back near the end of the year, it suggested that adding Clinton to the ticket wouldn’t materially improve Obama’s odds,” Halperin and Heilemann write in an advance copy of the book obtained by the Times. “Biden had dodged a bullet he never saw coming — and never would know anything about, if the Obamas could keep a secret.”



Though uncommon, it's not entirely unheard of for presidents to replace running mates in the second term. Thomas Jefferson was the first president to do so. Franklin Roosevelt changed vice presidents twice during his four terms in office. Richard Nixon also replaced Spiro Agnew as vice president because he resigned.



In recent years, there has been rampant speculation about new running mates during campaigns. There was much talk in the 1992 campaign about George H.W. Bush replacing Dan Quayle. And George W. Bush reportedly briefly considered replacing Dick Cheney on the 2004 ticket.

Story continues

Still, the admission represents a powerful reversal of relations between Clinton and Obama, who were bitter rivals during the 2008 Democratic presidential primary.

In fact, in another exclusive released on Thursday, Politico reporter Jonathan Allen revealed in his new book “HRC” that Obama asked Clinton to stay on as secretary of state beyond 2012 . However, Clinton rebuffed Obama’s request, saying it was time for her to take a break from public office.

Of course, no matter how much the relationship between Obama and Hillary has warmed, his relationship with Bill Clinton has reportedly remained strained.

In their book, Halperin and Heilemann report that Obama could “barely endure” spending time with the “often exhausting” ex-president, even as he realized that Clinton’s counsel was essential in Obama’s re-election effort.

The book claims that Obama and Clinton were not even able to finish a round of golf together. Afterward, when a White House aide asked how the golf game went, “Obama grimaced and replied, ‘I like him … in doses,' ” the book claims.

Biden also reportedly got under team Obama’s skin from his efforts to boost his own expected 2016 presidential run and for his impromptu announcement in support of same-sex marriage.

“We can’t have side deals,” Obama adviser David Plouffe reportedly told Biden after finding out the vice president was trying to establish future fundraising commitments from Obama campaign donors."

The televised debate came hours after release of a new poll that showed the roller coaster ride of the candidates since Weiner, who was forced to resign his congressional seat in June 2011 over a sexting scandal, entered the race in May. Weiner, who once led the Democratic field, now is in fourth place, with support from only 10% of likely Democratic primary voters, according to the Quinnipiac University poll.

Christine Quinn, the City Council speaker who was the clear front-runner until Weiner joined the race, has fallen to second place behind the city’s public advocate, Bill de Blasio, who had the support of 30% of likely voters to Quinn’s 24%. In third place was former comptroller William Thompson with 22%, and in fifth with 6% was John Liu, the current city comptroller.

In the brief opening statements at the start of the hour-long debate, the candidates all portrayed themselves as champions of the middle class — the children of teachers, social workers and immigrants who can relate to the struggles of working people trying to survive in a city where the average apartment rent is more than $3,000 a month.

“We’re living a tale of two cities,” said de Blasio, a fierce liberal who, despite his strong poll showing, did not come in for the majority of ribbing from other candidates. Instead, they focused on Quinn, for her role in extending mayoral term limits to give Michael Bloomberg his third term, and for not vowing to replace police commissioner Ray Kelly if she wins the election.

“He has become the face of an abusive … policy,” Thompson said of Kelly, who has credited the police department’s use of the tactic of stopping, questioning and frisking people in mainly minority areas with bringing down crime. Opponents say it amounts to racial profiling. A federal judge Monday ruled that the practice was violating the constitutional rights of the mainly black and Latino young men subjected to random stops and frisks and appointed an independent monitor to help usher in reforms.

Quinn insisted that her role on the City Council gave her the expertise to oversee the issues facing New York, and she said she had saved 4,100 teachers from being laid off and proved herself a friend of labor and the middle class during her tenure.

As for Kelly, Quinn said: “I think everyone on this stage agrees … he has done a terrific job.” But she said she did not support the way his department used stop-and-frisk to combat crime and vowed to reform it if elected.

Later, Quinn took one of several stabs at Weiner after he claimed the high moral ground by noting that he had apologized repeatedly for his sexting habits. Quinn, Weiner said, had not apologized for backing Bloomberg in 2008 to overturn a 1996 public vote limiting elected officials to two terms in office. That enabled Bloomberg to win his third term.

“I think it’s very clear to all New Yorkers that neither me nor anybody else on this stage should be lectured by Anthony Weiner about what we need to apologize for,” Quinn said.

All of the candidates vowed to do more to improve public schools, develop affordable housing and create jobs that pay more than minimum wage. Weiner proposed having police wear lapel cameras that would serve as watchdogs for communities distrustful of officers over the stop-and-frisk issue. De Blasio said he wanted to raise taxes for New Yorkers earning more than a half-million dollars a year.

Liu, expressing skepticism at some of his rivals’ assertions, said at one point: “Are we at a mayoral debate or the Twilight Zone?”

Each of the candidates was asked whether Weiner should quit the race, and while they did not all demand he leave, they agreed that the attention focused on his scandalous past was diverting attention from city issues.

“Please don’t ask me any more questions about him,” Liu said of Weiner, who last month admitted that he had pursued sexually charged online relationships even after quitting Congress and entering therapy to save his marriage and salvage his career.

“I don’t want to talk about Anthony,” said Thompson. “I want to talk about the future of New York.”

Only de Blasio called for Weiner to leave the race, “for the good of the city.”

“We should not be talking about one individual and their personal life. We should be talking about all 8.4 million of us,” he said.

Weiner brought up the scandals himself, in his opening statement, declaring at the outset that he had made mistakes but that voters, not his critics, should decide if they want to give him another chance.

The only light-hearted moment in the fast-moving, sometimes biting debate came in the final minutes, when the candidates were asked to reveal something about themselves that people might be surprised to learn.

“I’m not a natural redhead,” said the flame-haired Quinn, who if elected would be the first woman and the first openly gay person to lead the nation’s largest city.

Weiner disclosed that after midnight on Mondays, he plays ice hockey, “probably the only 130-pound Jewish kid in the city” to do so.

The famously low-key Thompson said that “in almost any sport I’ve ever played, I’m incredibly competitive,” while Liu revealed that he’s an avid surfer, skier and skateboarder.

De Blasio, who at 6’5” towers above the other candidates, said he had gone to high school with basketball Hall of Famer Patrick Ewing.

“He made it to the NBA, but I didn’t,” de Blasio confessed.

The five will face off in a primary on Sept. 10. If none of them wins 40% of the vote, a runoff will be held in October.

He just can't keep his emotions in check or mouth shut... Obama's racist tendency is shining bright today....

Coming from a half white man... Barry, STFU.

barry's preferred target is the Constitution, and the Constitution is incapable of self-defense. At least Trayvon attacked something capable of fighting back. That puts Trayvon one step above barry in my book.

Seriously? A more ""perfect"" union? This country is getting more divided by the day thanks to BO. All I see now are blacks running rampant looking for an excuse to loot and terrorize. GG BO for setting blacks back a couple more decades.

He isn't going to be happy until we have a full-blown race war. What an idiot. Congratulations Amerika. You elected this clown TWICE!

He wants a race war, and when Whitey finally fights back that's when DHS gets to use their shiny new toys.

Darn right he is divisive!

But a majority of the Black population is too.

Tell you what Mr. President, if you don't like our legal system, why not move to another country, and take your Racist supporters with you!

Whites aren't racist, they are tired of African Americans being slothful, violent, criminal, and milking the system because they squandered their free public education, and refused to learn to read, write, do arithmetic, and speak English.

Blacks are their own worst enemy!

John Derbyshire was fired when He warned Whites to stay away from Blacks.For those too stupid to follow his advice will find out what it is like to try and carry a cat home by his tail.

Aw what'sa matter, Obama? You didn't get all the mobs and deaths you wanted out of this verdict? Not enough looting and plundering and blood for you? It was bad enough when you tacitly called on the black community to take revenge on Zimmerman by declaring that he had murdered 'your son'. Now you're saying that Zimmerman murdered YOU - and you're silently calling on all your political lovers to go out and get even on everyone else because of your 'unjust death'. Obama - you really are a cad. I would say shame on you, but you've proven already with your greedy and wicked life that you have no shame. The sooner you are cast out of office, the better.

Repeatedly, in his own words in his own books and speeches, Obama (and most of the 96% of blacks who are Democrats) are irrational, racist, socialists who commit the majority of all crime in America in and out of government.

What do you get when a Community Organizer raised in Indonesian madrassas, tutored by Frank Marshall Davis, and mentored by Jeremiah Wright for 20 years gets reelected President? CIVIL RACE WARS 2013

Well it’s a Fact Obama is a racist no more hiding it Barry, to

all you guilt feeling libs and to all the Hispanics that voted for him enjoy

your President you are now consider White Hispanic so you get to bend over and hold your ankles like the white folks, hope and change more like racist and violence, only in a America a violent thug is honored like a hero, but only if you’re a black thug White /

Hispanics have to answer for their crimes, Race War coming soon thanks to Obama,

and the libs are so happy but the truth is you will be the first ones taken out,

Blacks don’t really like you and hardworking Whites and Hispanics hate you also Vote Racist Vote Black.

MORE LIKELY...LIAR N' CHIEF...YOU COULD HAVE BEEN HIM...HAD NOT THE NWO BILDERBERG PICKED YOU OUT OF OBSCURITY...TO PROMOTE YOU TO THE HIGHEST POSITION IN OUR LAND...THROUGH LIES AND DECEPTIONS! You have been bred to be where you are...you are a puppet of the NWO...working to take America down...and we know who you are...and what you are...a traitor to America...NOT a uniter of men...but a divider of men! The descriptive names that I have given you throughout the last (5) years denote your intent and who you are. YOU ARE...the Liar N' Chief...the Chameleon N' Chief...the FlimFlam Obamaman...the NWO Bilderberg..Obama the Bush and now just known as the 'massa' in the big house!

Yessir...we have your number and it is up in 2016!

Trayvon got what he deserved. More thugs need the get the same. Obama, you're full of $hit as a Christmas turkey.

You need to resign and go back to Indonesia and, while you're at it, take that chimpanzee of a wife with you. IMPEACH Obama...REMOVE and IMPRISON the entire cabinet and all political appointees

I'm so sick of this jacka** inserting race and himself into every situation that involves an african American-yet he's silent, you can even hear crickets chirping, if the incident involves a Caucasian.

His very statement about the outcome and aftermath being different had it been a white male is a moot point.

Had it been a white male it would have never even been covered by the national media and that's because there are no white counterparts to the tag team duo of obama and sharpton to bring up the race issue which they are so masterfully skilled at.

Like Clint Eastwood said to Spike Lee-""HE NEEDS TO SHUT HIS FACE.""

How long did it take Obama to speak out ON BEHALF of the four American heroes killed in Benghazi? What did he do to impact their deaths? Dis he have holder change nay of our laws? Did he support any protests? Short Answer: NO!

Is this country going to survive the race and socioeconomic wars this administration seems intent upon bringing on all of us? The President has clearly drawn lines in the sand with these comments, setting us up for a black against white race war. How can we have a ""more perfect union"" when the President has done this kind of race-baiting?

Let me count the times I threw up a little in my mouth when I watched that SOB give that speech. Nothing like watching a dictator try to humble himself knowing that his little plan for Zimmerman didn't work out.

Obama should have edumacated the black masses instead of blowing smoke up their bungholios... trayvon profiled Zimmerman... assaulted him... because he thought he was gay... that is testimony from Jeantel on the witness stand and in interviews on CNN and msnbs...

No surprise the black community has to ignore the facts to justify their childish and uneducated reaction to the truth.

YOU WONDER WHY THIS SCREWBALL COMES OUT WITH THIS, TILL YOU SEE THAT CONGRESS IS LOOKING INTO THE ADMINISTRATION GETTING THE BENGHAZI SURVIVORS TO SIGN A NON DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT............

MORE SMOKE FROM THIS DICKHEAD!

In your freakin' rewritten dreams! Dumb-Ø is a white African-American brought up in privilege with white Marxist grandparents who spoiled him rotten. Where does he identify with Martin? Martin's mother may be looking to profit on her son's death but she wasn't a ho like Dumb-Ø's was.

fanning the flames!!!

giving the 'black boys' the go ahead to crack some cr@ckers!!!

better watch yourselves and your families... I know I will be!

Yesterday I was saying to myself, this weekend probably wouldn't be that bad,

now I am very concerned about the animals that will be running around trying to vindicate POtuS' statements!!!!

REALLY!?!?!? You just can't let this go can you?! You've got to stir the racial pot because your presidency has been a complete and utter FAILURE!!!!! Obamacare and the auto bailout are imploding and we have to listen to this CRAP! What a POS ideologue!! What an absolute embarrassment! Undeserving of the office of the presidency, posturing to representing not the country but his particular race (or at least the one he identifies with)!! If I had a petty dictator of a president he would be Barrack Obama.

This is only a diversion so you won't think about the real problems such as the IRS and Benghazi. As long as we are bickering about Trayvon, we tend to forget about the important things

What exactly is Eliot Spitzer thinking?

We asked him. Below, edited excerpts from our interview on Sunday night:

On whether the public is ready for his return to politics:

The best I can answer is that I hope so. I will continue to ask the public’s forgiveness and simultaneously ask for another opportunity to serve. I think the five years have been important to me. I have done many and different things. I think they have been useful. I have tried to do things in the public interest.

On his vision for the often-overlooked comptroller’s office, the city’s chief financial watchdog:

One is to be the primary voice of urban policy — what works and what doesn’t work. It’s understanding that the audit power of the office is not just to figure out how many paper clips were bought and delivered, but to be the smartest, most thoughtful voice on a policy level.

On whether the public embrace of candidates like Anthony D. Weiner and Mark Sanford have encouraged his candidacy:

I have seen those, but I don’t ever draw conclusions from other races. Everyone is different.

On his daughters, and their role in his decision-making:

They are now older than they had been when I ran initially. When I first ran, one had just been born. They are 19, 20 and 23. They are in a completely different stage of life. They are mature; they are grown up. They have lived through a lot.

On his wife, Silda, and whether they are separated, as reports suggest:

Our private lives are our private lives. We do not comment on that. Yes, we are married, absolutely.

On his reputation, as attorney general of New York:

We took on battles that people thought were impossible to win. We won a lot of them. I was able to re-envision the attorney general’s office and hope to do the same for the comptroller’s office.

On his likely opponent, the Manhattan borough president, Scott M. Stringer:

Most of the time I agree with Scott. I hope Scott and I, who are friends now, are friends when this is over.

On why he would challenge a friend for office:

I believe in competitive races. I think I am qualified to be comptroller.

On public polling of city voters, which has shown little appetite for his return to office:

I have not done one stitch of polling. I have none other than the experience and data of walking down the street. I used to say to the folks that did polling for me, ‘I live in a focus group.’

After five years, the public might be willing to give me a second chance."

Website says contacts allegedly took place in Dominican Republic

FBI raided campaign donor%27s office in Florida

Allegations surfaced in e-mails described as suspect

WASHINGTON — Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey denied Wednesday that he accepted free plane trips and contact with prostitutes from a Florida eye doctor whose offices were raided by federal agents Tuesday night.

The raid, reported by The Miami Herald, targeted Salomon Melgen, a physician described by the newspaper as a prominent campaign donor to Menendez and other Democrats. The Herald said Melgen owes $11.1 million in back taxes.

The conservative Daily Caller news website quotes anonymous sources who allege Melgen provided Menendez with prostitutes — some of them underage — at his luxury home at the Casa de Campo resort in the Dominican Republic.

Menendez' office issued a statement Wednesday denying the allegations.

""Dr. Melgen has been a friend and political supporter of Sen. Menendez for many years,"" the statement read. ""Sen. Menendez has traveled on Dr. Melgen's plane on three occasions, all of which have been paid for and reported appropriately. Any allegations of engaging with prostitutes are manufactured by a politically motivated right-wing blog and are false.""

Menendez's office did not say whether the three trips were to the Dominican Republic or elsewhere. The statement also did not say how the trips were reported or how Menendez paid for them — with his own money or through his senatorial or campaign accounts.

The Associated Press reported it found no records reporting payments to Melgen or trips aboard Melgen's plane in six years' worth of office and travel-related expenses for Menendez's Senate office, or in six years' worth of campaign expenses on file with the Federal Election Commission.

FBI Special Agent James Marshall confirmed Wednesday that ""we are conducting law enforcement activity in the general vicinity"" of Metrocentre Boulevard, the location of one of Melgen's offices in West Palm Beach, Fla.

Marshall declined to comment further.

According to the Herald story, the FBI investigation is believed to focus on Melgen's finances and allegations that he provided Menendez with free trips and prostitutes. Prostitution is legal in the Dominican Republic. Menendez is divorced and has two children.

A reporter for The Daily Caller asked Menendez about the allegations on Monday as a Gannett Washington Bureau reporter was interviewing the senator about an unrelated topic.

""I'm not going to respond to the fallacious allegations of your story,"" Menendez said.

On Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada defended Menendez during a news conference, saying, ""I always consider the source,"" referring to The Daily Caller.

""All anyone here has to look at is the source where this comes from,"" he said. ""It's a source that has brought up a lot of non-issues.""

The Daily Caller first published a story about the allegations last fall, prompting Samuel Thompson, chairman of the Middlesex County, N.J., Republican Organization and a New Jersey state senator, to ask the state Senate ethics committee to investigate whether Menendez had failed to report the trips on expense reports.

It's unclear whether the ethics committee, which does not comment on current investigations, is looking into the allegations.

Thompson said Wednesday that he had not heard back from the committee.

The allegations appear to have first surfaced in April, when a tipster calling himself ""Peter Williams"" approached the Washington-based watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW).

CREW executive director Melanie Sloan said the group exchanged e-mails with Williams for several months in an attempt to confirm the allegations, but gave up when Williams refused to speak with the group by phone.

""We just had no way to know whether these things were true or not, but he had a lot of detail,"" Sloan said.

CREW forwarded the e-mails in July to the FBI, other Justice Department officials and ABC News.

On Wednesday, CREW released 56 pages of email exchanges between Williams and the group as well as a memo it sent the FBI summarizing the emails and detailing its own investigation based on them.

""While CREW has been unable to either prove or disprove that Sen. Menendez engaged in sexual conduct with underage girls in the Dominican Republic, we have been able to confirm some information provided,"" the group said, asking for ""an immediate, thorough, and fair investigation of these allegations.""

""If a top government official like Sen. Menendez – who has sworn to uphold the laws of the United States – has, in fact, engaged in the conduct alleged, he should be exposed and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,"" the group said.

Last week, e-mails that appear to have been sent between an FBI special agent, Regino Chavez, and Williams were forwarded to several media outlets. Those e-mails indicate the FBI followed up on CREW's contact with Williams, but Williams also refused to meet with FBI officials.

Chavez did not respond to a message left on his voice mail seeking comment for this story.

""I feel like we did the right thing by sending this to the FBI, but I am worried that someone may have been using us to smear a politician,"" Sloan said.

Sloan said she finds the timing of the allegations, which Williams told her date to 2008, suspect.

The allegations come as Menendez is about to become chairman of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He replaces Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., who was confirmed Tuesday as secretary of State. Menendez was re-elected last fall with 58.5% of the vote.

""There's reason to doubt the credibility of this stuff,"" Sloan said. ""There's reason to withhold judgment until we know more.""

Melgen, a registered Democrat, has made $193,350 in political contributions since 1998, including $14,200 to Menendez, according to FEC records. Menendez was chairman of the Senate Democratic Campaign Committee, which raises money for Democratic Senate candidates, from 2009 to 2011.

Weiner’s campaign for mayor of New York began with an angry Facebook message, according to the editor of a blog who has communicated with the woman involved.

Not long after Mr. Weiner resigned from Congress, the 22-year-old woman reached out to express her disappointment in him.

Mr. Weiner eventually responded and, at his urging, their exchanges veered from politics to sex within a week, as he demanded dozens of explicit photographs, said Nik Richie, the editor of The Dirty, the blog that first documented the exchanges.

“He started putting the sexual moves on her and she just went with it,” Mr. Richie said in an interview."
http://news.yahoo.com/trio-troubles-threatening-obamas-second-term-211559462.html,,[],Trio of troubles threatening Obama's second term,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama seemed to lose control of his second-term agenda even before he was sworn in, when a school massacre led him to lift gun control to the fore. Now, as he tries to pivot from a stinging defeat on that issue and push forward on others, the president finds himself rocked by multiple controversies that are demoralizing his allies, emboldening his political foes and posing huge distractions for all.

It's unclear how long he will be dogged by inquiries into last year's deadly attack in Libya, the IRS targeting of tea party groups and now the seizure of Associated Press phone records in a leak investigation. But if nothing else, these episodes give new confidence and swagger to Republicans who were discouraged by Obama's re-election and their inability to block tax hikes as part of the Jan. 1 ""fiscal cliff"" deal.

Taken together, these matters will make it harder for the administration to focus on its priorities - racking up a few more accomplishments before next year's national elections.

""It's a torrential downpour, and it's happening at the worst possible time, because the window is closing"" on opportunities to accomplish things before the 2014 campaigns, said Matt Bennett, who worked in the Clinton White House. From here on, he said, ""it's going to be very, very difficult.""

So far, there's no evidence that Obama knew about - let alone was involved in - the government actions in question. But a president usually is held accountable for his administration's actions, and Republicans now have material to fuel accusations and congressional hearings that they hope will embarrass him, erode his credibility and bolster their argument that his government is overreaching. Even some of his Democratic allies are publicly expressing dismay at the AP phone records seizure.

Obama advisers on Tuesday cast the trio of controversies as matters that flare up in an institution as complex as the U.S. government, and they questioned the impact of them. The one exception, advisers said, was the brewing scandal at the Internal Revenue Service, which they see as the issue most likely to strike a chord with Americans.

Story continues

The IRS has apologized for what it calls ""inappropriate"" targeting of conservative political groups, including tea party affiliates, that were seeking tax-exempt status in recent years. A Treasury Department inspector general's report released Tuesday concluded that ineffective management led to the targeting, and Attorney General Eric Holder said he had ordered a Justice Department investigation.

But he distanced himself from the decision to subpoena the AP records, saying he'd had no part in it, stepping aside because he had been interviewed in a government investigation into who provided information for a news story that disclosed details of a CIA operation in Yemen.

The press case sparked bipartisan outcry, with several GOP and Democratic officials questioning Holder's department's actions in the matter. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said the attorney general should resign over the issue, adding: ""Freedom of the press is an essential right in a free society.""

Connecticut Sens. Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy, both Democrats, called on the Justice Department to explain the records seizure. And Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the House's second-ranking Democratic leader, said, ""This is activity that should not have happened and must be checked from happening again.""

As the press and IRS issues boiled over Tuesday, many conservative activists stayed focused on the attack last September in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens. Republicans have spent the past eight months accusing the Obama administration of ignoring security needs before the attack, and of revising subsequent ""talking points"" to play down the role of Islamic terrorists in the assault, which occurred at the height of Obama's re-election campaign.

Hillary Rodham Clinton — the secretary of state at the time, and a possible presidential candidate in 2016 — is the target of many GOP accusations.

Despite the noisy controversies, White House advisers tamped down suggestions that Obama would make any sudden moves, such as firing top officials or shaking up his team. In a Tuesday night statement on the inspector general's IRS report, Obama said he expected those responsible to be held ""accountable"" though he did not specify what that should entail.

On all three matters, the White House Tuesday steered blame to other administration agencies. The disputed Benghazi talking points, advisers said, were chiefly the CIA's work. In discussing the IRS controversy, the White House has emphasized the agency's independent status.. And Obama's spokesman has deflected all questions about AP phone records to the Justice Department, saying that the president and his aides didn't know about the case until they read press reports Monday.

Asked why Obama couldn't simply ask the attorney general about the Justice Department subpoenas, Carney said, ""A great deal prevents the president from doing that. It would be wholly inappropriate for the president to involve himself in a criminal investigation that ... involves leaks of information from the administration.""

The White House also tried to change the narrative on Benghazi. Carney accused congressional Republicans of giving a misleading description of an email from top Obama aide Ben Rhodes in order to make it look like the White House was supportive of efforts to downplay the prospect that the Benghazi attack was an act of terror.

""They decided to fabricate portions of an email and make up portions of an email in order to fit a political narrative,"" Carney said.

White House officials said Obama plans to press his second-term agenda as planned, but the contentious issues are complicating that effort. Amid new revelations about Benghazi and the IRS, Obama's attempts last Friday to highlight the implementation of key components of the health care law - his first term's signature accomplishment - were largely ignored.

Republican consultant John Feehery says the IRS and Benghazi controversies undercut the president's argument for increasing the government's role in health care and almost everything else. They undermine the notion, he said, ""that government is trustworthy and can fix problems.""

However, the biggest item now before Congress - whether to rewrite the nation's immigration laws and provide a pathway to citizenship for millions of people here illegally - may be barely touched by the hubbub. Many Republican leaders say the GOP must embrace immigration revisions to improve the party's weak standing with Hispanic voters, a fast-growing constituency. Denying Obama a victory on immigration, they say, could do even more damage to Republicans.

On other issues, including the never-ending partisan dispute over deficit spending, the White House's preoccupation with potential scandals may give Republicans a greater sense of confidence and support.

The claim of an IRS bias against conservative groups is what worries Democrats like Bennett most. The White House counsel's office was alerted about the inspector general investigation into the IRS on April 22, but did not inform the president, officials said.

Steve McMahon, a Democratic strategist, said Republicans will try to use investigations into the IRS actions, Benghazi and possibly the AP phone records ""to run out the clock on the president's second term.""

""The political risk of running endless congressional investigations is relatively minimal compared to the risk of opposing immigration reform, gun control and some of the other issues that have broad bipartisan support,"" McMahon said.

In a telephone interview on Sunday night, Mr. Spitzer, 54, sounding restless after an unwelcome hiatus from government, said he had re-envisioned the often-overlooked office and yearned to resurrect the kind of aggressive role he played as New York State’s attorney general. He said that after consulting with his family and taking the temperature of the city’s electorate, he believed New Yorkers would be open to his candidacy. “I’m hopeful there will be forgiveness, I am asking for it,” he said.

His re-emergence comes in an era when politicians — like Representative Mark Sanford of South Carolina and the New York mayoral contender Anthony D. Weiner — have shown that public disapproval, especially over sexual misconduct, can be fleeting, and that voters seem receptive to those who seek forgiveness and redemption.

His decision startled the city’s political establishment, which is already unsettled by the rapid rise of Mr. Weiner, who also plunged into a campaign without party elders’ blessing."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Hollywood/2013/05/29/king-katzenberg-crowned-obama,2013-05-29 00:00:00,['Breitbart News'],Report: Hollywood Mogul Jeffrey Katzenberg Gave $30 Million to Re-Elect Obama,"When the subject of Hollywood and President Barack Obama comes up, most people think of the celebrities who cut videos supporting the leader’s two runs for the White House.

Others might name check movie producer Harvey Weinstein, one of Obama’s most vocal backers.

They all pale in comparison to studio mogul Jeffrey Katzenberg of DreamWorks fame, who Mother Jones dubs the Kingmaker of the Democrat party. That hardly describes Katzenberg’s impact on two presidential elections, particularly the 2012 contest.

Katzenberg gave $3.15 million to Democratic super-PACs during the 2012 cycle–almost 30 times more than his total reported giving in 2008. (There’s no telling how much he might have given to other groups that don’t disclose their donors.) He steered millions more to Priorities–his friend and business partner, Steven Spielberg, gave $1 million, for instance. He hosted numerous fundraisers for Obama and raised more for the president than anyone else in California. All told, Katzenberg gave or raised more than $30 million to reelect Obama, helping Hollywood make up for Wall Street’s plummeting financial support of the president.

Of course, all that money means Katzenberg can get a few favors done when the need arises. And when his movie studio wanted to branch out into China, all those donations came in handy.

Obama officials say they respect Katzenberg not only for his fundraising, but also because he has no specific “ask”–no ambassadorship to Switzerland, no regulatory tweak, no nights in the Lincoln Bedroom. Even so, being Hollywood’s liaison to Washington has its perks: Obama takes Katzenberg’s calls, and he and his political adviser, Andy Spahn, visited the White House almost 50 times between them during Obama’s first term. (Not all of Spahn’s visits had to do with Katzenberg.) It has also left him well positioned to advocate for his industry’s and his company’s interests in China’s booming film market.

Hollywood stars like Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis deplore the impact of unfettered cash on the political process. They even made a movie about it–The Campaign.

Will they consider a sequel targeting King Katzenberg? Don’t count on it. Money is only evil when it props up the wrong (read: right) politicians."

If he deems something important, he pounces on it. Last week he did that with gun control, signing sweeping new legislation.

He’s also ambitious. A 2016 presidential bid may be in the offing, especially if Hillary Clinton doesn’t jump in. And the national profile that he’s forging — trailblazer on gay marriage, guardian of public safety — almost surely reflects his sense of where the country is heading and what voters will and won’t reward.

How, then, are we supposed to read his romantic situation?

He’s unmarried, but has been living with the irrepressible food celebrity Sandra Lee for years now, most recently in her Westchester house. “Public concubinage” is what one Roman Catholic official once called their cohabitation, generating a flurry of articles that mentioned “living in sin.” The couple made no apologies. And they’ve never signaled any plans to wed.

That wasn’t a factor in Cuomo’s successful New York gubernatorial campaign, but whether it would be a liability in a national race is hard to say. Political strategists told me yes, no, maybe. I’m rooting for no, because that would be an affirmation that we, as a voting public, have wised up to the frequent lack of any correlation between a tableau of traditional family life and the values, character and skills it takes to govern effectively. And I’m intrigued by politicians who are writing fresh scripts and handling their personal situations in surprising ways."

Tom Coburn muses that Obama is 'perilously close' to impeachment,"That was the original theory, anyway. In practice you can also go the Ken Starr route; that had been discredited for a while due to that whole being-a-stain-on-the-nation-and-an-embarassment-to-all-concerned bit, but enough of it seems to have finally been forcibly clubbed down the memory hole, now, and the newcomers seem to have a fondness for the thing.

This isn't some Rep. NoName Bumblefuck, though, this is Sen. Tom Coburn, who we all recognize as a very important person because other important people will not stop rattling on about it, and also because Tom Coburn has considerably more than his fair share when it comes to making sure world's greatest deliberative body cannot so much as sneeze without three hearings, two secret holds and five sniffling letters to other government officials about how this or that is the greatest outrage everz, probably, maybe, if you squint just right and look at it sideways. All right, Mr. Coburn, knock us out. Tell us what the intended violation of the law might be. Tell us what level of ""incompetence"" compares to the military fiascos, anti-terrorism ball-dropping and economic catastrophe visited upon us by the last president, the one who will not be named.

No? Nothing much? Throw us a bone here, give us something to work with. Surely you didn't plan on piping up on how very close to impeachable the president's actions have been only to shrug your shoulders and say that you can't be bothered to think about it too hard or to explain why.



“My little wiggle out of that when I get that written to me is I believe that needs to be evaluated and determined but thank goodness it doesn’t have to happen in the Senate until they’ve brought charges in the House. Those are serious things but we’re in a serious time. I don’t have the legal background to know if that rises to high crimes and misdemeanor but I think they’re getting perilously close.”

Oh, you poor dumb jackass. Yes, thank goodness you don't have to worry your gargantuan head over whether or not any of what you are saying is utter bullshit, since other people will have to come up with the precise wording of the bullshit first. Thank goodness we can all just agree among our Republican selves that, shit, son, there's got to be something in there worth impeaching a sitting president for, but we don't really have to worry about it until Darrell Issa finally comes up with a crayon drawing that the rest of us can put on the Senate fridge with a straight face.

And for the record, I see absolutely nothing to indicate that we are in a serious time. All evidence suggests we are in a decidedly un-serious time. We bleat on about fake scandals, not even having the decency anymore to drop them after they have been roundly disproven. We have a Congress that ties itself in knots even over its most basic, primitive tasks, primarily because it is too preoccupied with drawing up various Obamacair is bad dumhead scribbles and launching them, giggling, over to the other branches of government. There are a very large number of very serious things happening in the world, to be sure, but to say we are in serious times implies that we might be doing jack-all about any of them, and that is the singular most prominent thing we are not doing. No matter what economic or legislative building might be on fire, we still get the same clown-driven firetruck circus act; lots of selzer, a few painful looking gimmicks with the ladder, and bucket after bucket of confetti hurled hither and tither and yon. If you are going to mutter about serious times, you need to at least take the brightly colored rubber nose off. If you are going to furrow your brow and look troubled about serious times, you ought to at least stop squeezing your rubber nose and yelling ""Honk honk, impeachment!"" at the audience.

Or not, whatever.



“Barack Obama is personal friend of mine. He became my friend in the Senate but that does not mean I agree in anyway with what he’s doing or how he’s doing it. And I quite frankly think he’s in a difficult position he’s put himself in and if it continues, I think we’re going to have another constitutional crisis in our country in terms of the presidency,” Coburn concluded.

If he continues what, precisely? Be specific. Hell, be unspecific. Is it the pursuing policies that the Republican Party does not like, is that the impeachable thing? Is it the wanting to put judges on benches, even if the other party has decided that they no longer want any judges, thank you? Is it Benghazi? Please tell me it is Benghazi. Please tell me that you are contemplating impeaching a president for allowing a terrorist attack on a foreign-based embassy, because by God, I have a list of people who need to have their names scrubbed from various buildings and freeways and aircraft carriers post haste, if that is the standard now. It can't be the IRS ""scandal,"" because even I give Tom Coburn more credit than that, and I am generally someone who suspects Tom Coburn would get his head stuck in a mailbox if he didn't have two staff members at all times keeping him from doing it. Crap, man, just write ACORN on your forehead and go with that, don't make your constituents strain their noggins on these things.

We might just write this up to pandering. Perhaps Sen. Tom Coburn is not, in fact, as addled as he comes across, and knows full well he doesn't have a shred of anything he can point to as the unforgivable crime of the current presidency, but he is just humoring a group of clearly touched-in-the-head constituents in order to make them feel good about themselves. That is, though, just as bad. We are in the position we are in precisely because Mr. Coburn's party has yet to find a constituent yet whose ideas are so ridiculous or so offensive that some thrice-elected boil will not eagerly agree with them. The president is not really an American? Run with it! The president is secretly Muslim, is secretly against America, is secretly possibly in league with Muslim terrorists? Hell, anything's possible! The president is ""packing the courts"" by nominating judges to open positions on courts? The fiend. The president used his partisan mind-waves to task the IRS with track down conservative and liberal political groups illegally masquerading as nonpartisan outlets and slightly annoy them? That is the most Nixonian thing ever, and not at all the ravings of the single most boring and least creative insane person ever born anywhere, at any time.

We have now reached the point where even conservative senators muttering about impeachment has become old hat. The level of ridiculousness has gotten so high that by God, it's actually gotten boring. It's to the point where you can look at any given video of any given speech by any given leader of the Republican tribe and just presume that it is going to be nothing more than a stream of drivel about one or 20 different conspiracy theories, a tired propping up of death panels or birth certificates or ammo hoarding or some new level of tyranny from the Bush administration that was only discovered to be tyranny now. What happens now? What happens when the clowns have been performing so long that nobody else thinks they're funny, or even interesting? Do the clowns just keep on going, keep on putting on that same show? Is there a bigger, better rubber nose in development, something that will really wow the crowds this time and save the whole bit?

“Contrary to what the mayor apparently thinks, this is not going away,” said Mr. Gloria, a Democrat. “Fewer people than ever respect him, meaning he cannot get anything done. The city has run better without him here; he should give us that opportunity permanently by resigning. The Council will continue to question him and his decisions and try to get this city back on track like San Diegans deserve.”

Since he was elected mayor last year, and for decades while he was in Congress, Mr. Filner built a reputation for liberal politics and personal abrasiveness. But there had been no public accusations like those plaguing him now. He was known to keep up a relentless public schedule, appearing on the nightly news at every opportunity. But when the accusations began, he became much less visible. While he was away, his top aide said she had the locks on his office changed to ensure he would not have access, though his office did put out a news release detailing the $120,000 in small business grants he apparently approved.

As local news reports have detailed the accusations — from the “Filner headlock,” in which the mayor gripped a woman so that she could not escape, to asking a 67-year-old part-time City Hall worker if she thought he was able to “go for eight hours straight” — the city has been the source of a stream of late-night jokes.

Mark Cafferty, executive director of San Diego Regional Economic Development Corporation, said, “Every conversation I have with people who are thinking of doing business here — whether they are in another part of the country or another part of the world even — starts and ends with the jokes from Conan O’Brien.”"

The televised debate came hours after release of a new poll that showed the roller coaster ride of the candidates since Weiner, who was forced to resign his congressional seat in June 2011 over a sexting scandal, entered the race in May. Weiner, who once led the Democratic field, now is in fourth place, with support from only 10% of likely Democratic primary voters, according to the Quinnipiac University poll.

Christine Quinn, the City Council speaker who was the clear front-runner until Weiner joined the race, has fallen to second place behind the city’s public advocate, Bill de Blasio, who had the support of 30% of likely voters to Quinn’s 24%. In third place was former comptroller William Thompson with 22%, and in fifth with 6% was John Liu, the current city comptroller.

In the brief opening statements at the start of the hour-long debate, the candidates all portrayed themselves as champions of the middle class — the children of teachers, social workers and immigrants who can relate to the struggles of working people trying to survive in a city where the average apartment rent is more than $3,000 a month.

“We’re living a tale of two cities,” said de Blasio, a fierce liberal who, despite his strong poll showing, did not come in for the majority of ribbing from other candidates. Instead, they focused on Quinn, for her role in extending mayoral term limits to give Michael Bloomberg his third term, and for not vowing to replace police commissioner Ray Kelly if she wins the election.

“He has become the face of an abusive … policy,” Thompson said of Kelly, who has credited the police department’s use of the tactic of stopping, questioning and frisking people in mainly minority areas with bringing down crime. Opponents say it amounts to racial profiling. A federal judge Monday ruled that the practice was violating the constitutional rights of the mainly black and Latino young men subjected to random stops and frisks and appointed an independent monitor to help usher in reforms.

Quinn insisted that her role on the City Council gave her the expertise to oversee the issues facing New York, and she said she had saved 4,100 teachers from being laid off and proved herself a friend of labor and the middle class during her tenure.

As for Kelly, Quinn said: “I think everyone on this stage agrees … he has done a terrific job.” But she said she did not support the way his department used stop-and-frisk to combat crime and vowed to reform it if elected.

Later, Quinn took one of several stabs at Weiner after he claimed the high moral ground by noting that he had apologized repeatedly for his sexting habits. Quinn, Weiner said, had not apologized for backing Bloomberg in 2008 to overturn a 1996 public vote limiting elected officials to two terms in office. That enabled Bloomberg to win his third term.

“I think it’s very clear to all New Yorkers that neither me nor anybody else on this stage should be lectured by Anthony Weiner about what we need to apologize for,” Quinn said.

All of the candidates vowed to do more to improve public schools, develop affordable housing and create jobs that pay more than minimum wage. Weiner proposed having police wear lapel cameras that would serve as watchdogs for communities distrustful of officers over the stop-and-frisk issue. De Blasio said he wanted to raise taxes for New Yorkers earning more than a half-million dollars a year.

Liu, expressing skepticism at some of his rivals’ assertions, said at one point: “Are we at a mayoral debate or the Twilight Zone?”

Each of the candidates was asked whether Weiner should quit the race, and while they did not all demand he leave, they agreed that the attention focused on his scandalous past was diverting attention from city issues.

“Please don’t ask me any more questions about him,” Liu said of Weiner, who last month admitted that he had pursued sexually charged online relationships even after quitting Congress and entering therapy to save his marriage and salvage his career.

“I don’t want to talk about Anthony,” said Thompson. “I want to talk about the future of New York.”

Only de Blasio called for Weiner to leave the race, “for the good of the city.”

“We should not be talking about one individual and their personal life. We should be talking about all 8.4 million of us,” he said.

Weiner brought up the scandals himself, in his opening statement, declaring at the outset that he had made mistakes but that voters, not his critics, should decide if they want to give him another chance.

The only light-hearted moment in the fast-moving, sometimes biting debate came in the final minutes, when the candidates were asked to reveal something about themselves that people might be surprised to learn.

“I’m not a natural redhead,” said the flame-haired Quinn, who if elected would be the first woman and the first openly gay person to lead the nation’s largest city.

Weiner disclosed that after midnight on Mondays, he plays ice hockey, “probably the only 130-pound Jewish kid in the city” to do so.

The famously low-key Thompson said that “in almost any sport I’ve ever played, I’m incredibly competitive,” while Liu revealed that he’s an avid surfer, skier and skateboarder.

De Blasio, who at 6’5” towers above the other candidates, said he had gone to high school with basketball Hall of Famer Patrick Ewing.

“He made it to the NBA, but I didn’t,” de Blasio confessed.

The five will face off in a primary on Sept. 10. If none of them wins 40% of the vote, a runoff will be held in October.

http://news.yahoo.com/weiner-spitzer-political-comebacks-fall-flat-074935096--politics.html,,[],"Weiner, Spitzer political comebacks fall flat","NEW YORK (AP) — Anthony Weiner's ill-fated mayoral campaign ended with a string of final embarrassments: He mustered a mere 5 percent at the ballot box. One of his sexting partners tried to crash his primary night rally. And Weiner was caught making an obscene gesture to reporters as he was driven away.

Outside a ""victory"" party where supporters mourned a disappointing fifth-place finish in the Democratic primary, cameras crowded around Sydney Leathers, the 23-year-old whose sexting with the former congressman brought his once-high-flying campaign to a screeching halt.

""Why not be here?"" Leathers asked reporters. ""I'm kind of the reason he's losing. So, might as well show up.""

Another politician with a sex scandal, Eliot Spitzer, lost the Democratic primary contest for city comptroller to Scott Stringer, the Manhattan borough president. Stringer took 52 percent of the vote to Spitzer's 48 percent.

Spitzer resigned as governor in 2008 and admitted he paid for sex with call girls. In exile, he bounced around television as a pundit. Then, just four days before the deadline, he announced he was running for comptroller.

On the final campaign day for both men, the spotlight fell heavily on Weiner. His staff sneaked him into his own event, presumably to avoid Leathers, who had camped outside his headquarters all day hoping to confront him. His wife, Huma Abedin, who stood by his side at the height of the scandal, was nowhere to be seen.

And after a concession speech in which he got choked up as he spoke of family, a scowling Weiner was caught by a photographer giving a middle-finger goodbye to reporters as he was driven away.

Leathers, who has launched a porn career since the scandal broke, said Weiner needed ""to stop being an embarrassment to the city of New York. He's going to continue this behavior. If it's not going to be me, it's going to be some other girl.""

At one point, one of Weiner's supporters scolded Leathers, saying: ""You must really be ashamed!""

Story continues

For his part, Weiner acknowledged in his concession speech that he was an ""imperfect messenger"" but also boasted of the staying power of himself and his campaign.

Weiner had been in political exile since he resigned from Congress in 2011 for sending women lewd online messages and pictures. He got into the mayor's race in May, and aside from a few dust-ups with hecklers, was largely well-received at first, holding the lead for most of June and July.

But after an obscure gossip website named The Dirty released X-rated exchanges between Weiner and Leathers that took place well after the candidate quit the House of Representatives, Weiner — and his sexting pseudonym, Carlos Danger — once again became a national punchline.

With 98 percent of precincts reporting Wednesday morning, Weiner was far behind in the city's Democratic mayoral primary. Public Advocate Bill de Blasio had 40 percent of the vote, the threshold needed to avoid triggering an automatic Oct. 1 runoff. If he cannot maintain that, he will face former city Comptroller Bill Thompson, who has 26 percent, for a potentially grueling three-week showdown, with the winner advancing to face Republican nominee Joe Lhota in the general election.

Spitzer took a steadier path to his loss. He took an early lead in the polls, but the race tightened dramatically in recent weeks as the Democratic establishment rallied around Stringer, his main opponent.

Unlike Weiner, who made a point of fielding voters' questions about his scandal, Spitzer apologized a few times and then refused to talk about it.

He largely eschewed retail campaigning — situations that could have led to awkward exchanges with voters — in favor of national TV interviews and a big television ad campaign, financed with his own millions.

But he could not avoid all mention of the scandal. The city's tabloids hounded him about the state of his marriage; Spitzer said he was still married, but his wife never appeared on the campaign trail.

""All of us should serve, participate,"" Spitzer told supporters in his concession speech. ""I intend to do so in different ways.""

At the moment, everyone is screaming about the “scandal” of the Internal Revenue Service scrutinizing conservative nonprofits before granting them tax-exempt status.

Here are the genuine scandals in this affair: Political organizations are being allowed to masquerade as charities to avoid taxes and keep their donors secret, and the IRS has allowed them to do this for years.

Advertisement

The bottom line first: The IRS hasn’t done nearly enough over the years to rein in the subversion of the tax law by political groups claiming a tax exemption that is not legally permitted for campaign activity. Nor has it enforced rules requiring that donors to those groups pay gift tax on their donations.

The organizations at issue are known as 501(c)4 groups (call them C4s for short) after the section of the tax code that applies to them. They’re nonprofit “social welfare” organizations that by law must be devoted primarily to programs broadly serving their communities, not private groups. IRS forms reveal what the agency considers to be mainstream C4s: religious groups; cultural, educational and veterans organizations, homeowners associations, volunteer fire departments. In recent years, however, overtly political groups have been claiming C4 status, which allows them to keep their donor lists secret and to avoid paying taxes on certain income.

Our lunatic campaign finance system is what turned the typical C4 from a volunteer fire department into a conduit of anonymous political cash. Big donors were given the green light to spend freely on elections by the Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United decision. That wasn’t good enough for some; they wanted to distribute their largess secretly.

C4s were there for the exploitation, and the result has been a wholesale decline of donor disclosure on the national level: As recently as 1998, nearly 100% of all donors to federal campaigns were publicly identified, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a campaign finance watchdog group. By the 2012 presidential election, that was down to 40%.

Advertisement

The beneficiaries of the C4 tax break, understandably, will employ any subterfuge to keep it. That’s what’s behind the current firestorm over disclosures that in 2010 and 2011, IRS personnel screened requests for C4 status by applicant organizations with “tea party,” “patriot” or “9/12"" in their names.

Those weren’t the only groups whose applications were selected for extra scrutiny on the reasoning that they might be devoted to more than “social welfare.” According to an IRS Inspector General report made public this week, they represented only about a third of the 298 applications selected. That was certainly too coarse a screen, and by January 2012 the IRS had scrapped those definitions. It had substituted a screen designed to capture “political action type organizations involved in limiting/expanding government, educating on the constitution and bill of rights, [and] social economic reform/movement.”

Advertisement

Conservatives contend that this is still an anti-conservative screen. It sounds perfectly neutral to me, unless someone knows of a conservative organization devoted to “expanding government,” or unless right-wing groups are supposed to have a monopoly on “social economic reform.” In any case, the inspector general found that most of the 298 selected applications indeed showed indications of “significant” political activity that might have made them ineligible for the tax exemption.

It’s about time the IRS subjected all of these outfits to scrutiny. The agency’s inaction has served the purposes of donors and political organizations on both sides of the aisle, and contributed to the explosive infection of the electoral process by big money from individuals and corporations.

Nor is Congress innocent. The lawmakers have dodged their responsibility to make the rules crystal clear. On the rare occasions when the IRS has tried gingerly to impose regulatory order, members of Congress have forced the agency to back off. There should be a rule in Washington that if you give regulators deliberately vague guidelines, you’re not allowed to protest when they try to figure out where the lines are.

Thanks to ambiguity about what it means to be “primarily” concerned with “social welfare,” political activists have reaped a bonanza for years while the IRS ignored their chicanery. And once again, now that the agency has tried to regulate, the regulated parties have blown its efforts up into a “scandal.” It’s amusing to reflect that some politicians making hay over this are the same people who contend that we don’t need more regulations, we just need to enforce the ones we have. (Examples: gun control and banking regulation.) Here’s a case where the IRS is trying to enforce regulations that Congress enacted, and it’s still somehow doing the wrong thing.

Keep that in mind when you hear politicians — and they’re not exclusively Republicans — grandstanding about how the IRS actions are “chilling” or “un-American.” It turns out that none of the “targeted” groups actually was denied C4 status. Nevertheless, says Sheila Krumholz, director of the Center for Responsive Politics. “There’s a sense of discomfort that the IRS was doing much of anything.”

The IRS wasn’t actually doing much. The biggest C4s, including one founded by GOP operative Karl Rove and another run by ex-Obama campaign staffers, got their C4 status routinely. The little guys got questionnaires.

Advertisement

C4s are curious creatures in the tax code. They’re allowed to engage in lobbying, but not (“primarily”) in campaign activity. Their donors don’t get a tax deduction, but the organizations are tax-exempt. For example, they don’t have to pay taxes on income they earn by investing donated funds. But what makes C4s especially attractive to people who want to funnel money into politics is this: They don’t have to identify their donors.

Remember the mysterious $11-million donation to the campaign for California’s anti-union Proposition 32 last November? When the state Fair Political Practices Commission punctured its anonymity, it found not one, but two 501(c)4 organizations behind it. The FPPC, which is still investigating, has already called this a case of “campaign money laundering.”

Advertisement

As of September last year, the center found, some $254 million, or 20%, of all outside spending came through C4s. The biggest C4 in the electoral arena was Crossroads GPS, an affiliate of American Crossroads, a campaign organization founded by Rove. The Obama camp’s C4 was known as Priorities USA.

The IRS was swamped by the wave. The number of groups seeking C4 status from the agency rose from 1,500 in 2010 to 3,400 last year. Meanwhile, the agency was being pulled in two directions. In February last year, seven Democratic senators complained that the IRS was too “permissive” with its rules, which judged a C4 not to be engaged “primarily” in electioneering as long as no more than 49% of its spending went to such activities. In August, 10 GOP senators warned the agency to deep-six any efforts to tighten the rules on C4s.

Advertisement

Already in 2011, an IRS disclosure that it was auditing five big donors to determine whether they owed gift taxes for donations to C4s had caused a political uproar. (The gift tax can be up to 35% of a donation in excess of $14,000 per recipient and a $5.25-million lifetime exemption, paid by the donor.) GOP lawmakers accused the IRS of “targeting constitutionally protected political speech.” As Ellen Aprill, a tax law expert at Loyola Law School, observed later that year, “at that point, the IRS threw in the towel” — even though there was little doubt that the tax levy was proper and plainly constitutional.

The danger inherent in the latest faux controversy is that the IRS will have its wings clipped before its investigation of C4s is fully fledged. Politicos and pundits are in a lather over the questions the agency put to targeted organizations to determine their social welfare bona fides — things like the identity of their board members and the amount of time and money spent on “electoral issues,” and endorsements of candidates. These facts would be pretty fundamental to determining whether an organization is political, wouldn’t you say?

Advertisement

The IRS also asked some groups for the identity of their donors. The inspector general contends that request was inappropriate. Still, if the IRS discovered that a major donor to a C4 was, say, the politically active billionaire Sheldon Adelson, wouldn’t that suggest that the group might not be a plain vanilla “homeowners association”? By the same token, when the pro-Obama C4 Priorities USA disclosed that it had five anonymous donors, one of whom contributed $1.9 million, or 84% of the total, wouldn’t it help an investigator to know who that person is?

Let’s remember that a tax exemption handed over to any group costs all of us money. It’s proper for the IRS to scrutinize applicants. The biggest laugh line uttered in this affair is that the IRS is somehow “harassing” these public-spirited organizations by asking them to justify their status. Here’s a good rule of thumb: You don’t want to get harassed by the IRS? Then don’t claim a tax exemption you may not deserve.

It’s sad.’,"SAN DIEGO--As the City Council prepares Friday to approve a mediation plan that includes Mayor Bob Filner’s resignation, his ex-fiancee has expressed not anger but sadness.

Just days before three ex-supporters went public last month with accusations of sexual harassment against Filner, Bronwyn Ingram broke off their engagement.

In an email to friends, she explained that Filner had become volatile with her and she had caught him making dates with other women.

Since then, Ingram, 48, a disability analyst with the Social Security Administration who says she shares Filner’s political agenda, has not been seen in public.

But Thursday, she appeared in Los Angeles at a news conference with attorney Gloria Allred, not to announce a lawsuit but to express her hopes that Filner’s resignation will “begin to bring closure to this painful chapter for all those involved.”

Ingram had campaigned with Filner and after his election had begun leading efforts to help the homeless. Filner referred to her as “San Diego’s first lady.” Ingram and the twice-divorced Filner were planning an October wedding.

“The platform that Bob and I campaigned on with the emphasis on empowering neighborhoods can and should move forward if that is still the will of the voters,” Ingram said.

Friday morning, Ingram appeared on “CBS This Morning” for an interview with Bill Whitaker.

“To have a Democratic mayor in a city that’s constantly run by Republicans,” she said, “was very exciting to a lot of us and we had big plans.”

She said she had not witnessed the 70-year-old Filner engaging in the abusive, harassing behavior that was alleged by 18 women in recent weeks. But she added, “I would find it hard to believe that they were all fabricating those stories.”

She was at a loss to explain Filner’s alleged misconduct. “I don’t know if it has anything to do with sex or love. I think it has to do with power and control, so of course, it feels awful, it feels horrible.”

Whitaker asked what she would tell Filner if she could speak to him.

“Why? Why did you do this?” she said. “This was not the plan. This was way off the plan. We could have done a lot. It’s sad.”

The City Council meets at 1 p.m. to consider the mediation plan sparked by a lawsuit filed by Allred on behalf of a former Filner aide.

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/06/20/Abortion-vs-IRS-The-Race-to-Ignite-the-2014-Base,2013-06-20 00:00:00,['Joel B. Pollak'],Abortion vs. IRS: Parties Race to Ignite the 2014 Base,"On Wednesday, as Tea Party activists rallied against the IRS and the Senate immigration bill on Capitol Hill, President Barack Obama’s campaign-turned-lobbying arm, Organizing for Action (OfA), emailed a warning about “threats on women’s health” in Congress. It urged its members to sign a petition against a “terrifying” decision the GOP “to stand between a woman and her doctor when it comes to her health care decisions.”

Meanwhile, for the past several weeks, Republicans have sent fundraising pitches to their donors expressing indignation over the IRS scandal, in which the agency targeted conservative groups on the basis of their names and views for additional, and excessive, scrutiny. They are seeking to capitalize on grass-roots outrage–outrage that is often equally directed at Republican leadership–as they ramp up campaign efforts for 2014.

The OfA email about abortion is a re-hash of the 2012 presidential campaign’s “war on women” theme–and is aided, once again, by the mainstream media’s eagerness to focus on conservative gaffes, to the exclusion of mistakes by the president or members of his party. In addition to the abortion issue, Democrats are seizing on controversy over sexual assault in the military to signal to female voters that they are fighting for them.

The abortion issue has, in fact, gained new poignancy–though not in a way that favors the pro-choice side. The trial and conviction of Dr. Kermit Gosnell for the gruesome murders of babies delivered at his abortion clinic was ignored by the mainstream media but inspired pro-life activists to press for legislation limiting abortions past 20 weeks–the bill that inspired the OfA email but which, curiously, it does not describe.

Democrats are clearly worried about a midterm lull–which is why they have not only found it necessary to re-ignite old issues, but to share, selectively, in conservative outrage. As the IRS scandal has unfolded, for example, Democrats have strained to argue that “progressive” and liberal non-profits were also “targeted” by the IRS. Some Democrats have also split openly with the White House over the NSA and Prism scandals.

Meanwhile, Republicans are buoyed by a sense that frustration at the Obama administration scandals will help bring millions of conservative voters back to the polls after many apparently sat out the 2012 contest. The redistricting that followed the 2010 elections will also help ensure the party holds the House. But the race for the Senate has pit the GOP establishment against the base, as have issues like immigration reform.

In that context, the IRS scandal represents a rare point of unity, which is why even those Republicans busily defending the NSA’s surveillance programs against the party’s resurgent libertarian wing are citing the IRS scandal as a legitimate grievance. The full extent of the IRS abuses is unknown, and questions remain about who ordered the targeting, and why. Yet the issue has already become part of the 2014 election lexicon.

Midterm elections typically have lower turnout than presidential elections, which is why the 2014 effort by both sides will be aimed at motivating their party’s base voters. Republicans already have a wide variety of new conservative grievances to harness; Democrats are, thus far, returning to themes that have worked in the past. In the thick of the fight, the actual issues at the core of these debates risk being hijacked or obscured."

What exactly is Eliot Spitzer thinking?

We asked him. Below, edited excerpts from our interview on Sunday night:

On whether the public is ready for his return to politics:

The best I can answer is that I hope so. I will continue to ask the public’s forgiveness and simultaneously ask for another opportunity to serve. I think the five years have been important to me. I have done many and different things. I think they have been useful. I have tried to do things in the public interest.

On his vision for the often-overlooked comptroller’s office, the city’s chief financial watchdog:

One is to be the primary voice of urban policy — what works and what doesn’t work. It’s understanding that the audit power of the office is not just to figure out how many paper clips were bought and delivered, but to be the smartest, most thoughtful voice on a policy level.

On whether the public embrace of candidates like Anthony D. Weiner and Mark Sanford have encouraged his candidacy:

I have seen those, but I don’t ever draw conclusions from other races. Everyone is different.

On his daughters, and their role in his decision-making:

They are now older than they had been when I ran initially. When I first ran, one had just been born. They are 19, 20 and 23. They are in a completely different stage of life. They are mature; they are grown up. They have lived through a lot.

On his wife, Silda, and whether they are separated, as reports suggest:

Our private lives are our private lives. We do not comment on that. Yes, we are married, absolutely.

On his reputation, as attorney general of New York:

We took on battles that people thought were impossible to win. We won a lot of them. I was able to re-envision the attorney general’s office and hope to do the same for the comptroller’s office.

On his likely opponent, the Manhattan borough president, Scott M. Stringer:

Most of the time I agree with Scott. I hope Scott and I, who are friends now, are friends when this is over.

On why he would challenge a friend for office:

I believe in competitive races. I think I am qualified to be comptroller.

On public polling of city voters, which has shown little appetite for his return to office:

I have not done one stitch of polling. I have none other than the experience and data of walking down the street. I used to say to the folks that did polling for me, ‘I live in a focus group.’

After five years, the public might be willing to give me a second chance."

Robert Menendez says the confession shows the accusations are ""false smears"" A Dominican woman says she was paid to say she had sex with the New Jersey Democrat A video of the woman first appeared on conservative website the Daily Caller The Daily Caller says the woman was not in the video

Sen. Robert Menendez slammed accusations that he had paid a Dominican woman for sex and expressed hope Tuesday that those behind the claims would be exposed in the wake of the woman’s notarized confession that she’d never even met the New Jersey Democrat.

“I hope that you will all vigorously go after who was the source and purpose as you did go after the story at the time,” he told reporters.

In a notarized statement filed in court, Nexis de los Santos Santana said she was filmed without her knowledge when she claimed that Menendez had paid her to have sex.

“I am the person in the video, that is me, and those are my words, but this statement is not true,” Santana said in the statement. “I never agreed to be recorded.”

In addition to criticism over accepting unreported plane flights and allegedly advocating on behalf of a business, Menendez was accused of partying with prostitutes in the Dominican Republic – accusations he said were “unsubstantiated.”

As he did when the claims first emerged, Menendez said Tuesday the claims are “false smears” lifted from right-wing blogs ahead of the election.

Menendez faces scrutiny over ties to Florida doctor

“Look, I don’t know more than what I have read. But I do know from the very beginning I have said that nameless, faceless, anonymous sources … from the right wing blogs took this story which was just false smears right before an election cycle, attempted to do it then, and ultimately drove it into the mainstream press,” he said. “But they were never anything other than false smears.”

The confession document was presented at a press conference Monday by lawyer Vinicio Castillo, who said Santana was recruited to make the claims against Menendez by another lawyer, Dr. Miguel Galvan.

Galvan, in a notarized confession, pins the blame on a third lawyer, who Galvan said asked him to assist in a divorce case by finding “witnesses” to claim they had sex for money with Menendez.

CNN has attempted to reach both the lawyers who allegedly recorded the escort making the claims against Menendez, but has not yet received a response.

Questions revolve around his relationship with Salomon Melgen, the Florida man who owned a plane Menendez admits having flown three times – once on official Senate business, and twice for personal reasons – to the Dominican Republic in 2010.

Melgen, his wife, Flor, and his daughter, Melissa, have been generous donors to Menendez, his fellow Democrats and related causes in recent years. Castillo is Melgen’s cousin and spokesman.

In January, Menendez paid approximately $58,500 to Melgen for the flights he took in 2010, chalking up the lapse in payment to his busy schedule.

On Tuesday, Menendez answered questions about intervening on issues on Melgen’s behalf by saying, “we raise questions all the time for a wide range of universe on public policy issues and we think that those are all legitimate.”

A law enforcement official said last week the FBI was continuing to “pursue all leads” surrounding the Menendez allegations, including the prostitution charges.

The same law enforcement source said federal agents had gone to the Dominican Republic in hopes of finding the women who claimed to have had sex with Menendez, but that the women had not yet been located.

The Daily Caller, a conservative website, originally published the video with two women claiming they had sex with Menendez for money. In an article published Tuesday, the Daily Caller said Santana was not one of the two women who were featured in the video, though Santana asserted in the notarized court document she was one of the women.

In her statement Monday, Santana said she was told she would be paid well for reading the script. Both she and Galvan requested legal protection in making their confessions.

Three bribery schemes emerged from the investigation%2C FBI says

U.S. attorney blames plot on %27show-me-the-money culture%27

Suspects were arrested Tuesday

ALBANY, N.Y. — Prosecutors charged four New York politicians, including a leading Democrat in the state Senate, and two political operatives with a wide-ranging scheme to influence the state's politics, including the New York City mayoral race, with bribes, land swaps and insider deals, according to a criminal complaint filed Tuesday.

Prosecutors accused state Sen. Malcolm Smith, a seven-term Queens Democrat, of organizing bribes as he attempted to force his way on the Republican ticket for the 2013 New York City mayoral race last year. He was one of six people charged as part of three bribery schemes that emerged from an undercover FBI investigation.

""Today's charges demonstrate, once again, that a show-me-the-money culture seems to pervade every level of New York government,"" U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said. ""The complaint describes an unappetizing smorgasbord of graft and greed.""

Also charged in the plot were New York City Councilman Dan Halloran, Bronx GOP Chairman Joseph Savino, Queens GOP Chairman Vincent Tabone, Spring Valley Mayor Noramie Jasmin and Deputy Mayor Joseph Desmaret.

Smith, once the first African-American majority leader of the state Senate, is a key member of the coalition of Republicans and Democrats that control the chamber. His spokesman said Smith would be cleared of wrongdoing.

""(Smith) will be vindicated when the all the facts in the case are revealed,"" Todd Shapiro said in a statement.

All six defendants were arrested Tuesday morning and were to be arraigned in White Plains federal court before U.S. Magistrate Judge Lisa Margaret Smith.

Smith, a Democrat, needed approval from at least three of New York City's five GOP leaders to run as a Republican in the mayoral race.

An FBI undercover agent who posed as a wealthy real estate developer and another person identified in court papers as a ""cooperating witness"" allegedly observed Smith offer tens of thousands of dollars to Tabone and Savino for their support. Halloran allegedly accepted $20,500 to set up key meetings, court papers say. The cooperating witness, who pleaded guilty March 11 to unspecified charges, assisted investigators to get a more lenient sentence, the FBI said.

Smith and Halloran, a former police officer, were both recorded on wire taps. In one recording, Smith allegedly says he wants to ""close the deal"" with the borough GOP leaders. In another recording, Halloran purportedly explains how money controlled New York politics.

""That's politics. That's politics. It's all about how much,"" Halloran said, according to the criminal complaint. ""And that's our politicians in New York. They're all like that, all like that, and they get like that because of the drive that the money does for everything else. You can't do anything without (expletive) money.""

At a meeting Feb. 8 at a hotel in Manhattan, Halloran allegedly told the undercover FBI agent that Savino, the Bronx Republican chairman, wanted $25,000 for his support, and Tabone, the Queens party chairman, wanted $25,000 up front and another $25,000 after he signed the papers to put Smith on the ballot, court papers say. At another meeting, Smith allegedly suggested structuring the payments as retainers for legal and accounting services, court papers say.

Savino allegedly accepted $15,000 for the undercover FBI agent at a Manhattan restaurant on Valentine's Day, court papers say. The same day, Tabone accepted $25,000 from the undercover agent.

Prosecutors charged Smith with conspiracy to bribe, wire fraud and extortion. Tabone, Savino and Halloran are charged with conspiracy and wire fraud. Jasmin and Desmaret are charged with mail fraud.

Jasmin and Desmaret are accused of agreeing to sell land belonging to the Village of Spring Valley to a real estate developer in exchange for money and a stake in the ownership of the project. Jasmin allegedly promised to vote for transferring the land in exchange for an ownership stake in the project and gave the cooperating witness $600 to set up a holding company under a relatives name to hide the transaction, court papers say. Desmaret allegedly accepted about $10,000 in cash bribes, the complaint says.

Bharara, who has targeted a number of state lawmakers as part of high-profile corruption cases, said New Yorkers should ""demand more"" from their government.

""Any time you have a situation that happens again and again and again and it happens to people that should know better … then something is broken in the system,"" Bharara said.

Many feminists have differing opinions on the much-talked about first lady and her role.

Many feminists have differing opinions on the much-talked about first lady and her role.

In the opening moments of her second turn at history, as Michelle Obama waves at celebrants along Pennsylvania Avenue, Americans will clamor to see the first lady, who remains one of the most popular public figures in the country. In the most recent poll, fully 73 percent said they approve of the way she is handling her job.

But a significant group of Americans — feminist Americans — have been vocally disappointed with her choices and feel let down by her example.

In 2008, when Obama announced her intention to be “mom-in-chief,” many feminists decried her decision to give up her career and said she had been victimized by her husband’s choices. She was regarded as one of the women feminist Linda Hirshman described as “letting down the team.”

But most black feminists and writers had a different view. Let the sister get settled, they said. Give her a minute to do a head count. And if she wanted to focus on motherhood, for black women that was more than fine. It was arguably revolutionary, because black women were long denied the right — or lacked the means — to simply care for their own.

As she begins another four years in the White House, the nation’s feminists are divided about the “work” Obama has done, and the work they’d like to see her do.

Caption From the velvet frocks of Mary Todd Lincoln to John F. Kennedy’s formal tails and Michelle Obama’s silk chiffon, a look at sartorial choices of the presidents and their first ladies on the special day. Early inauguration celebrations were intimate affairs, though the number of parties associated with the event and their formality have varied over the years and cultural climate. Mary Todd Lincoln was known for her grand style and extravagant taste. Shown here is a replica of the purple velvet gown by Elizabeth Keckley that Lincoln wore in 1864. Lincoln was one of the original first ladies to be heavily criticized for her spending habits and opulent taste. Oggiano-Frederick Wait 1 second to continue.

This split has bitter historic roots. It surfaced during the suffrage movement, when white women suggested their votes could counter those of “the darker races,” and again in the 1970s, when black feminists broke away over the white middle-class focus of “women’s lib.”

Now, with an African American woman in the White House, these differences have rushed back to the fore.

Last year, after Obama and Ann Romney submitted recipes for a cookie contest, Hirshman told The Washington Post that Obama’s “first mom, gardener thing” is “silly.” Now, Hirshman says, “I’ve kind of lost interest in Michelle Obama. She was trapped by assumptions about race and had limited room to maneuver. Whether that was a welcome choice or she had no choice, I will never know. It’s very difficult to envision her as running for senator from the state of Illinois as you did with Hillary Clinton running for senator from the state of New York.”

“Are fashion and body-toning tips all we can expect from one of the most highly educated First Ladies in history?” asked author Leslie Morgan Steiner in an online column last January. She said she’d “read enough bland dogma on home-grown vegetables and aerobic exercise to last me several lifetimes.”

Steiner contended Obama probably had little leeway. “I’m sure there is immense pressure — from political advisors, the black community, her husband, the watching world — to play her role as First Black Lady on the safe side.”

Feminist discontent with the first lady spiked again last summer at the Democratic National Convention, after she called her daughters “the heart of my heart and the center of my world.” She then repeated her feminist crazy-maker: “You see, at the end of the day, my most important title is still ‘mom-in-chief.’ ”

“Why does mom-in-chief have to be the most important thing this strong, vibrant woman tells us about herself as she flexes the strange but considerable power of the office of first lady?” Emily Bazelon asked on Slate.com.

“Judging by Michelle Obama’s speech, feminism is dead to the Democratic party, ” Lilith Dornhuber wrote on a feminist Web site’s community forum.

Author Katie Roiphe, who says she has had her own battles with fellow white feminists, calls these complaints misplaced. “I think there’s a certain unconstructive scrutiny going on in this certain population of white feminists on the blogosphere,” Roiphe says. “It’s such a naive definition of power to say that the first lady is not a working woman.”

This take — that Obama doesn’t exercise agency in her choices, that her anti-obesity, healthy-eating issues lack gravity, or that she’s not working — is one that many minority feminists and writers of color find ahistorical. They join the Michelle conversation from a different center and land on wildly different points.

By necessity and by choice, a majority of black women have been working outside the home at least since the census began keeping track of their labor in 1972. There has never been a national effort to keep black women at home, caring sweetly for their children. They have always worked, and their work has never been a separate thing from their mothering.

“Feminists who wish that Obama would strike a blow for feminism and against stereotyped roles of women, too easily forget that all women are not burdened by the same stereotypes,” wrote Tami Winfrey Harris in a September article, “A Black Mom-in-Chief is Revolutionary: What White Feminists Get Wrong about Michelle Obama,” for the online magazine Clutch.

“There’s no denying that the emphasis as ‘mom-in-chief’ can be read as conservative,” says Koritha Mitchell, an English professor at Ohio State University who specializes in African American literature and feminist criticism. But black traditional families are rarely pictured in the mainstream, Mitchell says. And, “let’s be real about how much assumptions about black families being pathological really dictate public policy.”

“I just have a problem with the idea that Michelle Obama doesn’t work,” says author Joan Morgan, a visiting scholar at Stanford University. “It’s a basic anti-feminist argument to say the work she does in making sure her family is okay — that the girls are healthy and not caught up in the craziness of celebrity and acting out — is not valuable work.”

Morgan contends that some white feminists are unable to see beyond their own narrative. “Michelle is deeply personal to black women,” Morgan says, and if white feminists “took a modicum of interest in what black women’s lives were like, and took some time to learn about them, then we wouldn’t always end up in this place where there’s an issue or person that seems so polarizing, and we wouldn’t be standing on opposite sides of the chasm.”

Author Rebecca Walker, who writes about culture, identity and motherhood, is the daughter of Pulitzer Prize-winning author Alice Walker. She says her mother told her of white female writers: “We read them, but really, they do not read us.”

That feminist notion of being on the same team is often absent when it comes to issues affecting women of color and their communities, says Walker, who is biracial and who says she finds the intense questioning of the first lady’s choices “tedious.”

Do we really think “that she would have more power as a hospital administrator than she would as first lady?” she asks.

Nicole Guidotti-Hernandez, an associate professor at the University of Texas who blogs for Ms. Magazine, has closely followed the anti-obesity work the first lady has done with American Indian, Latino and African American children — “with American children more broadly, but with a focus on minority children.”

Obama “refocuses the conversation around black womanhood and black motherhood away from the welfare queen and into the middle class,” Guidotti-Hernandez says. “It’s a different version of race and motherhood that as a nation, and for me as a Latina, is really important.”

In the second term, Guidotti-Hernandez says, she’d love to see the first lady take on women’s pay equity.

Roiphe would like to see her use her position to champion gun control.

Morgan says she’s “content with where Michelle is and what she does.”

Walker wants to see her “stay happy.”

As for a lot of other feminists, they’ve already cut their losses with Obama and are looking past her. All the way to 2016.

The 50-49 final vote came just before 5 a.m., a dramatic legislative lollapalooza in a stately chamber chiefly populated by men and women fast approaching Medicare age. Congress now adjourns for a two-week Easter recess.

Like the far more austere Republican budget approved by the House last week, the Democratic version that passed the Senate is a partisan document that sets out the party’s vision but does not have the force of law.

The $3.7-trillion Democratic blueprint for 2014 would raise taxes on corporations and the wealthy, trim spending modestly, and invest new revenue to build infrastructure and tamp down the federal deficit. Under the plan, the government would still be in the red a decade from now.

Passage of the plan sets the stage for contentious negotiations with the House and the White House next month over how to reconcile the two vastly dissimilar blueprints. The GOP plan is far to the right of President Obama’s views on the federal budget, while the Democratic version falls to his left.

The White House applauded the vote, saying in a statement that the plan “will create jobs and cut the deficit in a balanced way. Like the President’s plan, the Senate budget cuts wasteful spending, makes tough choices to strengthen entitlements, and eliminates special tax breaks and loopholes for the wealthiest Americans to reduce the deficit.”

The House Republican budget, the statement said, “refuses to ask for a single dime of deficit reduction from closing tax loopholes for the wealthy and the well-connected but instead makes deep cuts to education and manufacturing while asking seniors and the middle class to pay more. That’s not an approach we support and it’s not an approach the majority of the American people support.”

Republicans marked the occasion by hammering Democrats for finally passing a budget after four years.

“It’s about time,” said a one-line news release from the House GOP whip, Rep. Kevin McCarthy of Bakersfield.

No Republicans voted for the plan. Four red state Democrats who face re-election next year opposed it, leading to the squeaker of a final vote. The four Democrats were Mark Pryor of Arkansas, Kay Hagen of North Carolina, Mark Begich of Alaska and Max Baucus of Montana.

“While there are clear areas of disagreement about how to strengthen our economy and restore our nation’s fiscal health,” said Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), the chairwoman of the Budget Committee, “this was a productive conversation and one I hope we can build on in the coming weeks.”

Extra supplies were brought into the Capitol late Friday — wood for the fireplaces on a chilly spring night, packaged meals for the take-out shelves — as senators hunkered down for a long night.

Under Senate rules, the budget debate offered senators an unusual opportunity to offer an unlimited number of amendments to debate. And they did.

More than 600 amendments were filed on the bill, from the lofty to the parochial. They included proposals to de-fund new healthcare laws, to restrict potential surveillance by domestic drone aircraft, and to prevent a Western bird called the sage grouse from being listed as an endangered species. Like some members of the Senate, it is known for its strutting displays.

Senators presented their issues in rapid-fire fashion and then called for a vote. The usually lonely Senate floor was filled with senators and aides. Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.), had suggested 66 amendments by the time the sun set Friday.

The lawmakers began the long night knowing only that the final budget vote would come when they had finished all the others.

“We are not at carnival stage yet,” Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada said near midnight, as the senators gamely pressed on.

Senators dispatched with several key amendments.

They tossed aside the House GOP budget drafted by Rep. Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, which calls for deep cuts to the social safety net, including Medicare, and in an effort to achieve balance in 10 years. Five GOP senators defected on their party’s defining document.

Senators also voted down, largely on party lines, a proposal that would require a balanced budget.

Several GOP ideas to block money for Obama’s signature domestic achievement, the new healthcare law, fell by the wayside on party-line votes. Democrats on Friday celebrated its third anniversary. But an amendment to halt the law’s tax on medical devices won bipartisan approval.

Women benefited from the exercise, as Republicans showed no interest in fighting Democratic proposals to ensure equal pay and reproductive care. Both issues were approved.

And the proposed Keystone oil pipeline, between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico, drew broad bipartisan support.

As the night wore on, senators were essentially trapped on the Senate floor waiting for the final vote. Murray warned her colleagues, many of whom also had an avid interest in the March Madness basketball games, not to stray too far.

“You leave at your own peril,” she said.

In the end, most of the amendments were political messaging to show where senators stand on certain issues — and to provide fodder for campaigns targeting senators up for re-election.

One outcome was guaranteed: paychecks for the senators.

Failure to approve budgets this year would have suspended pay for the lawmakers under a provision slipped into a law earlier this year by House Republicans to goad Democratic senators into presenting their own budget proposal — and saving their $174,000 a year salaries.

Not long ago, this was considered an unlikely outcome.

Republicans in the House, trying to force Obama to accept deep cuts, had come close to shutting down the government before and appeared primed to do so again.

But House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) has united his rambunctious majority ever so tenuously around a strategy that, for now, sets aside the cycle of crisis politics to aim for long-range objectives.

Not only did lawmakers hold their fire to approve the legislation, they did so ahead of schedule — without the midnight-hour brinkmanship that has come to characterize Congress and its dealings with the White House.

That let politicians slip past a crucial fiscal deadline without damaging their reputations or the economy. The bill, which needs to become law by Wednesday, keeps the government open through the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. The parties agreed to continue the deep “sequester” cuts, but lawmakers found common cause and created bipartisan coalitions to lessen the effects on their favored programs.

When Republicans in the House shifted money to ensure embassies are secured and the Border Patrol stays at full force, the Democrats who control the Senate obliged.

Senators, meanwhile, reached across the aisle to craft amendments to keep meat inspectors on the job, fund a tuition assistance program for service members and spare a few thousand children from child-care cuts. The Republican-led House did not flinch, though Boehner did need Democratic votes to get it over the finish line.

This display of pragmatic governing, however, may be fleeting. The deal Boehner made with his party’s conservative majority also sets up the next clash.

Even as the House voted Thursday to fund the government for the next six months, Republicans also pushed through an austere budget plan that would balance revenue and spending in 10 years. Drafted by Rep. Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), the former vice presidential nominee, the proposal would overhaul Medicare and the social safety net, while dropping taxes for the wealthy and corporations.

In the Senate, Democrats are expected to approve their own 10-year budget plan Friday that goes in the opposite direction. Democrats want wealthier Americans and corporations to pay more to lower the deficit while investing some new revenue in transportation, education and public employees to create jobs.

“Even though we got two political parties with competing ideologies, the American people expect us to find common ground,” Boehner said Thursday.

In the Senate, Democrats have shown little interest in negotiating as Republicans have used almost every procedural weapon to push an agenda in stark contrast to one advocated by Obama.

Hostage-taking, as the White House has called the GOP approach, has its limits, and polls show voters agree.

Earlier this year, at a tony retreat in Williamsburg, Va., Boehner tapped Ryan, along with the House’s top conservatives, to engineer a strategy that could provide a more measured approach to the Republican goals.

Advertisement

The outcome has become known as the Williamsburg accord. The House GOP would fast-forward past day-to-day battles — such as keeping the government running — to a more lofty one: approval of a balanced budget.

“It is the primary reason that I ran for Congress, and I think it is the defining issue and the most critical argument of our day,” said freshman Rep. Chris Stewart, a Republican from Utah, as he urged his colleagues this week to vote for the GOP budget.

Boehner’s accord with his restive troops is fragile and could come undone, particularly as patience among the most conservative Republicans wears thin.

In a matter of months, Washington will face its next deadline, when Congress will be asked to raise the federal debt limit, an essential step to avoid a default that could have serious economic ramifications.

Advertisement

Tea-party-aligned deficit hawks want to use the limit, which will be reached May 18, as leverage to pressure the White House to negotiate on an overhaul of Medicare, Medicaid and other safety net programs.

“Some people in this conference believe that the plan is just to pass the Paul Ryan budget,” said Rep. Raul Labrador (R-Idaho), a conservative. “My goal is not to pass a meaningless document by itself, unless we actually implement the policies that will get us to a 10-year balance.”

But conversations on making that happen, Boehner acknowledged, have just begun.

“At this point in time,” he said, “I don’t know how we go forward.”

24/7 Wall St.

Five states have passed measures to raise the minimum wage this year

Only one of the eight states is has %27right to work%27 law

Highest state minimum wage is %249.19 an hour

The White House recently announced President Obama's support for a Senate bill that would increase the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour. While it remains to be seen whether the bill will make it through Congress, many states are not waiting to take action.

Five states have passed measures to raise the minimum wage this year, according to data published by the National Conference of State Legislators. Only one of these states, California, has passed a bill that would raise the minimum wage to $10 per hour. Based on data from the U.S. Department of Labor, 24/7 Wall St. identified the states with the highest minimum wages.

Whether or not a higher minimum wage is good for the economy continues to be the subject of debate. The National Employment Law Project (NELP), which advocates raising the minimum wage, maintains that the decline in the purchasing power of the minimum wage ""has contributed to the growth of income inequality over the past three decades.""

Other groups maintain that raising the minimum wage is bad for business and jobs. The Heritage Foundation notes that if the United States raises the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour, the combined costs of wages, employer penalties for not paying health insurance and taxes ""would raise the minimum cost of hiring a full-time worker to $12.71 per hour.""

A state's cost of living may influence its minimum wage. The cost of living in six of the eight states with a minimum wage over $8 an hour is higher than the nationwide cost of living. In Connecticut, where the minimum wage is currently $8.25, the cost of living is the fourth highest in the nation. The cost of living is similarly high in California, Massachusetts and Vermont.

Another factor keeping the minimum wage high in these states likely involves labor representation. Among these eight states, only Nevada is a ""right to work state,"" meaning workers cannot be required to join a union or pay for a union's costs as a condition of employment.

Many states where current minimum wages are among the nation's highest also have high union membership. In Washington, which currently has the nation's highest minimum wage, 18.5% of workers are union members, fourth highest nationally. Among private sector workers, five of the eight states had among the 10 highest union membership.

Based on information provided by the U.S. Department of Labor, 24/7 Wall St. identified the eight states with a minimum wage above $8 per hour. Additional figures on the cost of living in various states are from the Missouri Economic Research and Information Center (MERIC). Data on union membership by state are from the Union Membership and Coverage Database for 2012. Figures on poverty, income and income inequality as of 2012 are from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey. Unemployment rates are as of October 2013, from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

These are the eight states with the highest minimum wages.

8. Massachusetts

> Minimum wage: $8.00 (tied for 7th highest)

> Poverty rate: 11.9% (11th lowest)

> Union participation: 14.3% (12th highest)

> Cost of living: 8th highest

Unlike the many states that tie minimum wages to inflation to ensure earnings keep up with living costs, in Massachusetts the minimum wage has not changed since 2008. The cost of living in Massachusetts is hardly low. Overall, the state is one of the most expensive places to live in the country. The cost of health care, for example, is higher than in every state except for Alaska. That burden, however, may not be felt as much by the state's population because more than 95% of residents are covered by health insurance, the most in the nation. Other high costs may still be affordable for many living in Massachusetts. Median household income last year was among the highest in the United States, at $65,339. Union participation in the state is especially strong. Roughly 64% of public workers are union members, trailing only New York.

7. California

> Minimum wage: $8.00 (tied for 7th highest)

> Poverty rate: 17.0% (18th highest)

> Union participation: 17.2% (6th highest)

> Cost of living: 6th highest

California's minimum wage of $8 per hour is tied with Massachusetts as the seventh highest in the nation. This should change, as California's legislature recently approved plans to increase the state's minimum wage to $9 per hour next year and to $10 per hour by 2016, higher than any other state. The state is among the nation's most expensive, especially due to the high cost of housing, which trails only Hawaii and New York, according to MERIC. While California's poverty rate was just 18th highest among the 50 states, poverty remains an issue. When extending poverty measures to take into account families and individuals that are not reflected in standard poverty rates, California had the nation's highest ""supplemental poverty measure"" from 2010 and 2012, at 23.8% versus 16% nationally, according to a recent report from the Census Bureau.

6. Nevada

> Minimum wage: $8.25 (tied for 4th highest)

> Poverty rate: 16.4% (19th highest)

> Union participation: 14.8% (10th highest)

> Cost of living: 24th lowest

Workers in Nevada must either be paid $8.25 an hour, or the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour if they receive health benefits. Nevada also indexes its minimum wage to annual changes in inflation or the federal minimum wage, whichever increases by more. But because the federal minimum was raised in 2009, the state has not increased its minimum wage in recent years. Still, the state's minimum wage remains among the nation's highest. Nearly 15% of the state's workers, including 11.1% of the state's private workers, were union members last year, 10th and fourth highest nationwide, respectively.

5. Illinois

> Minimum wage: $8.25 (tied for 4th highest)

> Poverty rate: 14.7% (24th lowest)

> Union participation: 14.6% (11th highest)

> Cost of living: 21st lowest

Overall, it is cheaper to live in Illinois than most other states. The state's minimum wage is the highest in the Midwest at $8.25, tied with Nevada and Connecticut. Even so, Governor Pat Quinn has advocated raising the minimum wage to $10 per hour. In some sectors, union membership may be strong enough to improve working conditions without the government. For example, nearly 40% of private construction workers are union members, by far the most compared to other states. Despite the well-being suggested by the relatively low cost of living and the high wages — typical Illinois households earn more than the national median — the state still faces challenges. As of October, the state's 8.9% unemployment rate was one of the highest in the country.

4. Connecticut

> Minimum wage: $8.25 (tied for 4th highest)

> Poverty rate: 10.7% (4th lowest)

> Union participation: 14.0% (14th highest)

> Cost of living: 4th highest

In May, the Connecticut House passed a bill to increase the state's minimum wage to $9 per hour by 2015. Governor Dan Malloy noted the bill would make life ""easier for working people in [the] state without adversely impacting the business community."" However, as of the third quarter of this year, Connecticut was still one of the most expensive states in the nation to live. The state ranked at least sixth highest in every major component factored into the cost of living, including ranking fourth highest for groceries and second highest for transportation, according to MERIC. Income inequality in the state also remains extreme. Last year, only New York had a higher Gini coefficient than Connecticut — the coefficient measures income distribution. The wealthiest 5% of Connecticut households accounted for 24.6% of all state earnings as of 2012, more than in any other state.

3. Vermont

> Minimum wage: $8.60

> Poverty rate: 11.8% (10th lowest)

> Union participation: 10.7% (21st highest)

> Cost of living: 9th highest

Minimum wage is $8.60 per hour in Vermont, the third highest in the nation. While a typical Vermont household income was higher than in most states last year, earnings do not go as far. The state's fuel and food costs are among the highest in the nation. The minimum wage rate in Vermont is partly determined by inflation, as calculated by the consumer price index. The state labor department recalculates the appropriate wage every year. This year, the minimum wage is scheduled to increase by 13 cents to $8.73 an hour. As is usually the case nationwide, poverty in Vermont has been worse in urban areas. In Burlington, the state's largest city, the city council implemented a livable wage ordinance in 2001. The ordinance set a minimum pay of $17.71 per hour when health insurance is not offered and $13.94 an hour when it is. Last year, less than 12% of households lived below the poverty line and only 6.5% of residents lacked health insurance, both among the best rates in the nation.

2. Oregon

> Minimum wage: $8.95

> Poverty rate: 17.2% (15th highest)

> Union participation: 15.8% (9th highest)

> Cost of living: 13th highest

Despite having the nation's second highest minimum wage, take-home incomes in Oregon may be inadequate for many state residents. Median household income was lower than the national rate in 2012, at $49,161. More than one in five households relied on food stamps last year, the highest proportion in the country. Additionally, despite having a higher cost of living than the country as a whole, the state's median income was just over $49,000, more than $2,000 less than the national median income. Soon, however, workers earning minimum wage can expect a moderate improvement. Starting January 1, 2014, the minimum wage will increase by 15 cents to $9.10 per hour. With the increase, minimum wage employees working 30 hours a week will earn an additional $234 annually, according to the state's Bureau of Labor and Industries.

1. Washington

> Minimum wage $9.19

> Poverty rate: 13.5% (19th lowest)

> Union participation: 18.5% (4th highest)

> Cost of living: 15th highest

Washington has the highest minimum wage in the nation at $9.19 per hour. Recently, state officials certified a vote in favor of Proposition 1, the ballot measure to implement a $15 wage floor in the city of SeaTac. The new law, if passed, will affect roughly 6,000 airport and hotel employees in SeaTac, Washington. Union activity is strong in Washington, with 18.5% of the state's workforce active union members, more than all but three other states. Union membership among those working in the manufacturing sector is the highest out of every state. Washington is also among America's wealthier states, with a median household income of $57,573 as of 2012, versus a national median of $51,371.

Obama warned Washington could hurt economy

The president was interviewed on CBS before the Super Bowl

He urged the Boy Scouts to drop its ban on gays

President Obama said Sunday the economy is poised for growth, but not if Washington ""dysfunction"" gets in the way.

""Washington cannot continually operate under a cloud of crisis,"" Obama told CBS News in his annual Super Bowl Sunday interview. He urged Congress to avoid an upcoming series of automatic spending cuts.

Obama, who has granted a pre-game Super Bowl interview every year of his presidency, also urged the Boy Scouts of America to drop its ban on gays, expressed concern about the safety of football, and said he would not hesitate to order women into combat.

In a discussion of the economy, Obama said that he is not interested in further raising income tax rates to reduce the federal debt, but that more tax revenue from the wealthy is needed in the form of closing loopholes and deductions; the president also said that he wants to reduce red ink through ""smart"" cuts in the budget and more efficient administration of existing programs.

The president spoke just days after news that the economy shrunk slightly in the fourth quarter of 2012, a development Obama attributed to a sharp drop in defense spending brought on by uncertainty over the ""fiscal cliff"" and other political disputes.

The White House and Congress forestalled the fiscal cliff -- a series of automatic tax hikes and budget cuts -- with a New Year's Day agreement that raised income tax rates on households that make more than $450,000 per year. The deal also deferred automatic spending cuts for two months, to the start of March.

In his CBS interview in the Blue Room at the White House, Obama urged Congress to avoid those automatic spending cuts -- the sequester -- by coming up with a new debt-reduction plan.

As for his own plan, Obama said the issue now is not tax rates, but eliminating loopholes and deductions that favor only special interests. ""There is no doubt we need additional revenue, coupled with smart spending reductions, in order to bring down our deficit,"" Obama said.

If the economy is to pick up, Obama said, ""we can't have Washington dysfunction get in the way.""

On other issues, Obama said:

-- He hopes the Boy Scouts of America follow through on a proposal to lift a ban on gays. The president says gays and lesbians ""should have access and opportunity the same way everybody else does.""

-- He has no qualms about ordering women into combat, pursuant to a recent Pentagon directive, because they are already in combat ""as a practical matter."" Women ""have carried out their jobs with extraordinary patriotism and distinction,"" Obama said.

- He loves football, but organizers at all levels need to do what is necessary to make the game safer. While professional football players are adults who have union protection, Obama said he is more concerned with safety in youth, high school and college football leagues. ""I want to make sure we're doing everything we can to make the sport safe,"" Obama said.

If he had a son, Obama said he'd ""have to think"" about whether to allow him to play football.

The president was not asked -- and did not offer -- a prediction on the Sunday evening game between the Baltimore Ravens and San Francisco 49ers. ""I've got some wings waiting for me upstairs,"" he said."

(CNN) —

The federal government may not be hit with a double whammy on top of the ongoing shutdown, as House Speaker John Boehner told a group of fellow GOP legislators that he won’t let the nation default on its debt, according to a House Republican.

Boehner said that he’d set aside the “Hastert Rule” – that Republicans would only bring measures up for a vote if they are backed by a majority of their caucus – and rely on Democrats to pass a measure to raise the nation’s debt limit, said the House member. This legislator attended a meeting Wednesday involving Boehner, but requested anonymity because that gathering was private.

Congressional Republicans remain divided on how to structure legislation to raise the government’s borrowing level. And an aide to the House speaker downplayed the development, saying, “Boehner has always said the United States will not default on its debt, so that’s not news.”

Still, at least one Democrat – Sen. Charles Schumer of New York – cheered the prospect of the GOP leader refusing to block at least this measure that President Barack Obama and his fellow Democrats strongly support.

“This could be the beginnings of a significant breakthrough,” Schumer said in a statement. “Even coming close to the edge of default is very dangerous, and putting this issue to rest significantly ahead of the default date would allow everyone in the country to breathe a huge sigh of relief.”

The Ohio Republican’s vow comes exactly two weeks before the government is set to run out of money to cover its roughly $16.7 trillion debt, unless Congress agrees to lift the so-called debt ceiling. That had long been routine in Washington – until recently, that is, when conservative Republicans have pushed not to allow more borrowing without significant cuts.

Boehner himself wrote earlier this week in USA Today that “there is no way Congress can or should pass (a debt ceiling hike) without spending cuts and reforms to deal with the debt and deficit and help get our economy moving again.” He accused President Barack Obama of refusing to negotiate; Obama and fellow Democratic leaders have since said they are open to talks on any and all budgetary matters, but only after the government is reopened.

Yet Boehner’s comments signal that, at least on the debt ceiling issue, he’s willing to allow a vote on a measure backed by top Democrats but not most Republicans in his chamber – something he’s refused to do with a Senate-passed measure to reopen the federal government, without any add-ons.

Chief among those Democrats is Obama who, for all his strong rhetoric on ending the government shutdown, has said that avoiding a federal debt default is an even bigger necessity. He’s insisted Congress pass such a measure, as is, without tying it to anything else.

“As reckless as a government shutdown is, an economic shutdown that results from default would be dramatically worse,” the president said in a speech Thursday in Rockville, Maryland. “There will be no negotiations over this.”

Obama challenges Boehner to allow ‘yes-or-no vote’ on shutdown

While Boehner’s comments suggest hope toward some common resolution on the debt ceiling, the government shutdown is another matter entirely.

The two sides appeared no closer to an agreement Thursday, the third day of the shutdown that comes because Congress failed to agree on a budget plan to send to President Barack Obama. In fact, they appeared to dig in – insisting their approach is best and that the other was to blame for the 800,000 workers at risk of furloughs, shuttering of national parks, loss of funding for various programs and other effects of the shutdown.

A conservative GOP wing has demanded that any spending measure include provisions to dismantle or defund Obamacare, which became law in 2010 and was upheld by the Supreme Court last year.

As he’s done before, Obama on Thursday challenged Boehner to stop what he called Republicans “reckless” strategy of refusing to pass the “clean” spending bill – which doesn’t have provisions targeting the president’s signature health care reform, the Affordable Care Act, like several passed by the GOP-led House – and instead pushing measures to fund popular programs on a one-by-one basis.

The shutdown: Personal stories from Americans on the edge

The president said the spending initiative passed by the Democratic-led Senate would pass the House with support from Democrats and some Republicans, except that Boehner won’t allow the vote.

“The only thing that is keeping the government shut down, the only thing preventing people from going back to work, and basic research starting back up, and farmers and small-business owners getting their loans – the only thing that’s preventing all that from happening right now today, in the next five minutes, is that Speaker John Boehner won’t even let the bill get a yes-or-no vote because he doesn’t want to anger the extremists in his party,” Obama said.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid was part of the Democratic chorus Thursday, accusing Boehner of reneging on an agreement to let the House vote on a “clean” spending package of $988 billion, $70 billion less than Democrats wanted). Boehner went back on that deal, Reid surmised in an interview with CNN’s Dana Bash, because he feared fellow Republicans would turn on him and oust him from his position as House speaker.

“His job is not as important as our country,” Reid said. “… He has to have some courage.”

Reid jabs Boehner, says he reneged on deal

Cantor: GOP should stand its ground

GOP Rep. Michael Grimm said Thursday night that “very, very arrogant and very obstinate” remarks by Reid and what he calls a lack of needed leadership from Obama undermines the chances of reaching a deal.

“If you’re going to be insulted …, and if you’re going to be spoken down to, and there’s going to be this air of arrogance, you’re only going to make things worse,” Grimm, of New York, told CNN’s Anderson Cooper.

While Grimm and a few other moderate Republicans have backed a “clean” spending bill without anti-Obamacare provisions, some of his colleagues in the House say the party won’t budge from their strategy. Rep. Tim Huelskamp of Kansas, for one, described his caucus as “very unified” and said Reid and Obama are “confused” if they think “we’re going to fold and let them win on everything.”

In fact, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor wrote in a memo that it’s the positions of Obama and other Democrats that are “untenable.”

House Republicans would continue passing piecemeal funding measures for popular programs such as veterans affairs, national parks and medical research to keep up pressure on Senate Democrats who refuse to consider such measures in the ongoing stalemate, Cantor’s memo said.

“While no one can predict with certainty how the current shutdown will be resolved, I am confident that if we keep advancing common-sense solutions to the problems created by the shutdown that Senate Democrats and President Obama will eventually agree to meaningful discussions that would allow us to ultimately resolve this impasse,” Cantor said in the memo that a GOP source made available to CNN.

A conversation between two conservative GOP senators showed Republicans think they can win the debate. In the comments caught by live microphone, tea party-backed Sen. Rand Paul told his Kentucky Republican colleague, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, that continuing to hammer Democrats for refusing to consider GOP proposals would eventually succeed.

Proposal from moderates

Meanwhile, two moderate House members – one Republican and one Democrat – proposed a compromise Thursday that would fund the government for six months while eliminating a tax on medical devices in the health care reforms.

Senate Democrats quickly rejected the idea because it would link the health care reform provision to the need to fund the government now while extending deep mandatory budget cuts they oppose for half of the new fiscal year.

GOP moderates huddle as conservatives set agenda

Instead, Obama -- who canceled a trip to Brunei and Indonesia for this weekend’s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit because of the ongoing shutdown – and other Democrats have said they want to negotiate a broad budget deal that could include tax reforms and other matters. But they’re only willing to engage in such talks after the government reopens.

This already slogging debate over what to do about the crisis ground to a halt Thursday because of something that, at first glance, did not directly involve any of the legislators on Capitol Hill, even if it did hit very close to home.

A chase that began at a White House security checkpoint ended near the U.S. Capitol Hill when authorities opened fire on a car containing a woman and a child, an intelligence source told CNN.

Two police officers suffered injuries in the ordeal, according to D.C. Police Chief Cathy Lanier. The female driver – who didn’t fire any shots herself, according to multiple sources – died of gunshot wounds.

The House and Senate were both put on lockdown, with no one allowed to leave or enter Capitol Hill buildings and everyone urged to steer clear of windows and doorways, for about an hour.

Not long after, Democrats and Republicans reconvened on the House floor and, in a rare show of unanimity, thanked the responding officers.

Then they resumed their normal business – which, if the past few weeks is any indication, meant more blame and little agreement on how to bring the government back on line.

Now that we're criticizing Wall Street? No credibility! And we're just like the Tea Party, having cost Democrats a half-dozen seats and the Senate majority in the last couple of years.

Oh, you mean we haven't pushed the Democratic Party outside of the national mainstream?Weird, then. On the other hand, it wasn't bloggers trying to save Sen. Scott Brown's hide in 2012, like good ol' Chuck:



There is a good little story. [Looks to aide] I can tell this. I went to Scott Brown and said, “If you give us the sixtieth vote for the Citizens United rollback, we won’t go after you.”

If it was up to Schumer, he would've traded an entire Senate seat for one meaninglessvote on a bill that would've died a quick death in the House. God knows his Wall Street benefactors would've beenat that!

From my perspective, intra-party relations have never been better. It seems odd that Schumer is trying to start an internecine war at this very moment, particularly with a tough 2014 up ahead. And as the number three Democrat in the Senate, his words carry outsized weight. But it's clear that the Wall Street wing of the Democratic Party is feeling the heat from its resurgent populist wing: the Warrens, Baldwins, Browns and Merkleys.

Republicans are locked in their own bloody civil war. Schumer (and his Third Way allies) may have just signaled that we may be in for some bloodshed of our own. In fact, he appears eager to lead Wall Street's counter attack."
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/28/us/politics/illinois-lawmakers-say-they-have-plan-to-fix-underfunded-pension-system.html,2013-11-28 00:00:00,['Monica Davey'],Illinois Lawmakers Say They Have Plan to Fix Underfunded Pension System,"CHICAGO — Leaders of the Illinois legislature on Wednesday announced that they had found, at long last, a way to repair the state’s deeply troubled pension system, which has been deemed among the most underfunded public systems in the nation, has jeopardized the state’s financial stability and has become a political risk for state leaders.

The leaders declined to make details of their plan public as they privately sought support from rank-and-file lawmakers before a special session called for Tuesday. Gov. Pat Quinn, a Democrat, praised the leaders — a group of top Democrats and Republicans — for what he described as a “critical agreement.” He said, without providing more details, that the deal met a crucial standard of eliminating the unfunded debt and fully stabilizing the system, which has an estimated $100 billion in unfunded liability.

But the state has appeared on the eve of a solution to its pension crisis before, and some suggested on Wednesday that the votes were by no means assured. Labor union leaders said that they expected any proposal to include cuts to retirees’ pension benefits, and that they intended to vehemently object. Among the topics of discussion in earlier efforts to overhaul the pension system have been notions such as lowering cost-of-living allowances and increasing the age for retirement.

“Unions representing hundreds of thousands of public employees and retirees were not included in the leaders’ talks,” said a statement issued by a coalition of unions, known as We Are One Illinois. “If their new plan is in line with what’s been reported from earlier discussions, then it’s an unfair, unconstitutional scheme that undermines retirement security.”"

Final passage of the $85-billion package, however, remains uncertain because of rising opposition from tea party lawmakers and influential conservative groups. A House vote, expected this week, will once again test the ability of Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) to hold together enough Republicans to pass the compromise with support of the chamber’s Democratic minority.

The two-year deal, negotiated by the GOP’s budget point man, Rep. Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, and his counterpart in the Senate, Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, delivered a rare bipartisan budget agreement after two years of financial brinkmanship in Washington.

“Because of this deal, the budget process can now stop lurching from crisis to crisis,” said Murray, chairwoman of the Senate Budget Committee.

Ryan, the former Republican vice presidential candidate whose political credibility may rest with his ability to sway his conservative colleagues, praised the agreement because it will further reduce the federal deficit by $23 billion and contains no new tax increases.

“I see this agreement as a step in the right direction,” Ryan said. “In divided government, you don’t always get what you want.”

The last budget standoff culminated in a 16-day shutdown in October, costing the government billions of dollars and driving Americans’ approval of Congress to record lows.

The agreement would undo $63 billion of the automatic “sequester” budget cuts that are set to take place over the next two years, slicing across government agencies and programs, including the Pentagon. Lawmakers from both parties, including defense hawks, are eager to avoid the arbitrary cuts.

But some tea party conservatives would prefer to live with those reductions, however painful, to keep down government spending.

Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, like Ryan a potential GOP presidential contender in 2016, opposed the deal.

“This budget continues Washington’s irresponsible budgeting decisions by spending more money than the government takes in,” Rubio said, adding that the American people “deserve better.”

The deal sets 2014 spending at $1.012 trillion, higher than the $967 billion that would have taken effect under the sequester law on Jan. 15, but less than Democrats wanted. The increased spending is paid for with new fees and cuts elsewhere in the federal budget, including reductions in federal employee retirement benefits, cuts to the cost-of-living adjustment for military retirees who are younger than 62 and not injured or disabled, and new fees on airline travel.

The package does not include an extension of unemployment insurance, as President Obama had sought, for an estimated 1 million jobless Americans whose benefits expire after Christmas.

“This agreement doesn’t include everything I’d like — and I know many Republicans feel the same way,” the president said. “That’s the nature of compromise.… The American people should not have to endure the pain of another government shutdown for the next two years.”

But the accord did little to placate leading conservative groups, who attacked the deal even before its details were announced.

“We’re going to hold them accountable if they go back on sequester,” said Tim Phillips, president of the conservative Americans for Prosperity, backed by the billionaire Koch brothers. “The message is simple: Keep your word.”

“There’s a real concern about giving up the sequester,” said Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), saying he would be disinclined to back such a deal. “Republicans know that the one major victory they had was the sequester.”

Ryan was expected to brief his House Republican colleagues Wednesday.

Boehner has faced a similar challenge in the past, when his right flank rejected previous budget deals. If the speaker lost the support of his House Republican majority, he would be forced to rely on Democrats for passage, something he has been reluctant to do because it dilutes his power.

Already, 30 House Republicans have signed a letter in support of the sequester cuts, and GOP aides expect as many as 100 Democratic votes would be needed to secure passage because of likely Republican defections.

But as details of the deal emerged, it was unclear whether Boehner could pick up enough Democratic support. Rep. Raul M. Grijalva (D-Ariz.), co-chairman of the progressive caucus, said he opposed any deal that failed to close corporate tax loopholes.

Jim Dean, chairman of Democracy for America, said Democrats should reject the deal because it failed to include an unemployment insurance extension. “Negotiators have declared ‘War on Christmas,’ and potentially sentenced millions of struggling Americans to a very bleak New Year,” he said.

But another Democrat, Rep. Gerald E. Connolly, whose northern Virginia district includes many federal employees, said the cuts to retirement benefits would be a “hold your nose and vote yes” compromise.

In the Senate, where Democrats have the majority, Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) would need a handful of Republican votes to overcome an expected tea party-led filibuster. Democrats hold 53 seats, and two independents caucus with them, but 60 votes are required to overcome a filibuster. (The recent filibuster rules change pertained to most nominees, not to legislation.)

Pressure on Republican senators was coming not only from conservative groups, including Heritage Action and FreedomWorks, but from conservative candidates who are challenging incumbents in 2014 primary races.

Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Republican minority leader who is facing a primary attack from the right flank in Kentucky, said Tuesday that the sequester law had been a “success, and I hope we don’t revisit it.”

But Sen. Angus King, an independent from Maine who caucuses with Democrats, said the price of inaction would be higher. “Just doing it is important,’' he said. “If it doesn’t get done, it’s bad news.”

Leaders who want their achievements to endure know that their task includes changing the terms of the national debate and leaving behind an intellectual legacy that shapes how future generations see the country and its possibilities.

Franklin D. Roosevelt accomplished this. So did Ronald Reagan. President Obama traveled Wednesday to Knox College in Illinois to give the speech that launched his effort to join them. It was where, in 2005, he originally laid out his philosophy of government.

Obama is making this bid in the face of a political culture that is far more cynical than it was in the days of FDR or the Gipper. He confronts adversaries determined to move the country in exactly the opposite direction from the one he would have it choose. And up to now, the president has been foiled or distracted whenever he has tried to focus the public conversation on reversing rising inequality and restoring social mobility.

So why should his latest effort be any different? Here are three reasons.

1 of 68 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Tom Toles draws Obama View Photos A collection of cartoons of the president. Caption A collection of cartoons of the president. Wait 1 second to continue.

First, Obama and his advisers have learned from past failures. Earlier speeches along these lines came and went, barely causing a ripple in the public’s consciousness. This time, the president is embarking on an eight-week campaign to keep his themes at the center of the debate. He wants to bend the news cycle, rather than bow to it.

By giving a series of addresses that include specific proposals — some old, some new — he hopes to grab the public’s attention, and the media’s. His grass-roots operation will mobilize supporters to talk up these themes with their neighbors. Whatever else it is, this campaign is not a one-off.

Second, he will be speaking to a country that’s fed up with the mean, narrow and pessimistic tone emanating from a capital locked in what Obama called “short-term thinking and stale debates.” The president’s critics have said over and over that he needs to “go big” and push the system beyond itself. Even his friends have been frustrated at his difficulty in seizing the initiative and confronting obstructionist opponents. He appears to have listened.

But the most important reason this offensive has a chance is that it goes to the heart of why Obama got elected in the first place and won reelection. A substantial American majority just doesn’t buy the ideas that Obama forcefully rejected: that “inequality is both inevitable and just” and that “an unfettered free market without any restraints inevitably produces the best outcomes, regardless of the pain and uncertainty imposed on ordinary families.”

In describing his priorities, Obama’s language was plain but direct: “Good jobs. A better bargain for the middle class and the folks who are working to get into the middle class. An economy that grows from the middle out. . . . That’s where I ’ll focus my energies — not just for the next few months, but for the remainder of my presidency.”

“Middle out” is the key concept. Since the Reagan era, conservatives have enjoyed enormous success in making supply-side economics — the belief that wealth flows to everyone else from the economy’s commanding heights — a powerful, underground default position. A corollary: Government can do little to make the nation richer other than cut taxes and reduce its own reach.

The alternative view is, as Obama put it, that “growing inequality” is “not just morally wrong; it’s bad economics.”

President Obama says political distractions are keeping the U.S. economy from fully recovering from the recession. (Nicki Demarco/The Washington Post)

“When middle-class families have less to spend,” Obama insisted, “businesses have fewer consumers. When wealth concentrates at the very top, it can inflate unstable bubbles that threaten the economy.”

In the long history of the country, concentrations of wealth and income always have created perverse effects. Broadening our nation’s winners’ circle, on the other hand, has always been the best strategy for sustainable growth. We need to acknowledge this once again.

There is more Obama needs to do to make his case for the specific steps Washington can take to restore shared, robust prosperity. He will have to beat back the forces that would continue to shrink government through a sequester that is making the recovery slower than it should be.

But this time, he cannot let himself be sidetracked. With 1,276 days left in his presidency, he chose to draw a clear line and start a big argument. His place in history will hang in large part on whether he can win it.

Oh yeah, there's a new sheriff in town.

Previous diaries have illuminated the sputtering non-responses of regulators (Comptroller of Currency, SEC, etc.) to Sen. Warren's (sort of rhetorical) questions, who were not able to say when they had taken any banker to trial.

But the true sign that her line of questioning struck a nerve with bankers accustomed to the comfy status quo, was in the immediate, terrified howling pushback by numerous banking executives - who refuse to come out into the open and identify themselves, rather remain anonymous.

Elizabeth Warren asked why banks traded below book value while most corporations trade above book value. She proposed some possible explanations:



""One would be because nobody believes that the banks' books are honest,"" she said. ""Second, would be that nobody believes that the banks are really manageable. That is, if they are too complex either for their own institutions to manage them or for the regulators to manage them.""

She also earned significant ire from bankers with her line that one reason big banks mostly trade below book value may be that “nobody believes” their books are honest. Most of the complaints came on background or off the record given that these bankers have to deal with Warren in the Senate for at least six years and perhaps much longer and are (apparently quite justifiably) freaked out at the prospect.

Lawmakers hit the Sunday morning talk shows days before a possible government default

GOP Sens. Graham and Paul criticize Democrats%27 proposal

Sens. Collins and Klobuchar believe a compromise is possible

WASHINGTON — After several days of on again-off again negotiations at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, the fiscal crisis gripping Washington now hangs on whether two men can broker a deal: The Senate Republican and Democratic leaders.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., closed Sunday's Senate session saying he was ""optimistic"" that talks he has been having with Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., can lead to an end of the federal government shutdown and an increase in the nation's debt limit.

Many in the Capitol are looking to the talks between Reid and McConnell as the last, best hope for a deal after the House of Representatives abandoned talks Saturday morning. The two met Saturday, and Reid said they would continue talking throughout the day Sunday to seek a resolution.

""Americans want Congress to do its job. … That's all they're asking us to do,"" Reid said. ""I'm confident and hopeful that will be accomplished.""

McConnell could be the one to cut a deal, according to Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn.

""Republicans are very unified behind McConnell,"" Corker said. ""We probably have one or two outliers, but other than that, people are really unified behind him taking the lead on these negotiations.""

Reid and Corker's optimism, however, didn't seem universally shared. Two Republican senators said a deal to end the partial government shutdown and raise the debt limit to avoid default appears unlikely.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said on ABC's This Week that a Democratic proposal to increase spending beyond limits set by automatic budget cuts — known as sequestration -- cannot be supported by Republicans.

He doesn't anticipate a deal by the Oct. 17 deadline, when the nation's debt limit kicks in.

""I don't see one,"" Graham said. ""If you break spending caps, you're not going to get any Republicans in the Senate.""

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., agreed, saying on CNN's State of the Union that exceeding the sequestration limits is ""a real big step in the wrong direction.""

Some top Democrats were just as pessimistic.

David Plouffe, a former senior adviser to President Obama, said the nation is dangerously close to default. ""I think the notion that somehow this is going to be easily solved this week is completely false,"" Plouffe said on This Week.

Plouffe put the odds of a deal by Thursday at ""no better than 50/50. And so I think the country needs to prepare that this could go on for a while.""

However, Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., said a compromise was possible.

Collins, whose proposal to end the standoff was rejected Saturday by Reid, said on CNN that talks continue between Republican and Democrats.

""We're continuing to talk,"" Collins said. ""And I'm still hopeful that at least we sparked a dialogue that did not exist before we put out a plan.""

Klobuchar, also appearing on CNN, said the Collins' plan has jump-started negotiations.

""I see this as a positive framework going forward,"" Klobuchar said. ""And we need that right now.""

Collins' plan would extend the debt ceiling to January and reopen the government through March, as well as delay an unpopular tax on medical devices under the Affordable Care Act.

Coming somewhere in between the dire and dream of a deal was Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. Appearing on CBS' Face the Nation, McCain said he was encouraged that negotiations continued, but he warned Democrats, who he suggested hold the upper hand, not to ""humiliate"" Republicans.

""We should be sitting down,"" McCain said. ""And the president should be engaged. And the Democrats, they better understand something. What goes around comes around. And if they try to humiliate Republicans, things change in American politics. And I know what it's like to be in the majority and in the minority. And it won't be forgotten. Now's the time to be magnanimous and sit down and get this thing done."""

Washington (CNN) – Former President Bill Clinton, who sat in the Oval Office during the last government shutdown, supports President Barack Obama's refusal to negotiate with congressional Republicans and argues he should call their ""bluff"" as the government nears a possible shutdown and default.

""He could stop it, but the price of - the current price of stopping it is higher than the price of letting the Republicans do it and taking their medicine,"" he said in an interview that aired Sunday on ABC's ""This Week.""



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker'] [twitter-follow screen_name='KilloughCNN']

Clinton went on to say that House Republicans, having realized they have little chance of pushing through legislative items their party wants, have dug in and scrapped any plans of negotiating. ""Give us what we want or we're going to shut the government down,"" Clinton said, describing how he sees the GOP strategy.

""I think under those circumstances, the president has to take the position he's taken,"" he continued. ""Which is 'You - not me - you voted to spend this money.' … You can't negotiate over that. And I think he's right not to.""

Obama has repeatedly vowed he won't bargain in the upcoming debt ceiling debate. If the debt ceiling isn't raised by October 17, the government won't be able to pay its bills.

Republicans frequently point to Clinton's tenure, when he negotiated with congressional Republicans over raising the debt ceiling in 1996.

But Clinton argued Sunday that was a different period in time, saying the negotiations then were ""extremely minor"" and the stakes at the time were not as large: ""The economy was growing and the deficit was going down.""

He said while he was criticized for agreeing to lower the capital gains tax during those negotiations, in return he got the children's health insurance program, which ultimately led to coverage for 10 million kids up through Obama's first term.

""That's what lawmaking is. It's that kind of compromise,"" he told ABC's George Stephanopoulos, Clinton's former communications director in the White House. ""There's no opportunity for that in this forum. We don't have enough time. They don't want - they're mad because they don't want to negotiate.""

Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who was at the helm of the House in the 1995-1996 showdowns, told CNN's Piers Morgan earlier this week that he was able to work with Clinton because the former president was able to ""compartmentalize,"" compared to Obama.

""It wasn't that we were friends, but we both understood that you had to find a way to work for America, even if as political rivals,"" said Gingrich, who's now a co-host of CNN's ""Crossfire."" ""We were little bit like two graduate students in that we would get in a room and we started talking and theorizing and remembering books and doing stuff. But in that process, you begin to get away from what you couldn't do and you begin to gradually work your way to what you could do.""

""My guess is that we spent more days together than Obama and (House Speaker John) Boehner has spent minutes together this year,"" he continued. ""The president has to come off with his high horse. Boehner has to also say they may now be able to get everybody in his party to vote for something.""

Clinton, however, encouraged Obama to stick to his stand.

""I think there are times when you have to call people's bluff,"" he said, according to a transcript of the interview.

Republicans have signaled they plan to attach a number of items – including tax reforms and provisions to roll back regulations on businesses - in the upcoming debt limit debate.

""If I were the president, I wouldn't negotiate over these draconian cuts that are going to take food off the table of low-income working people, while they leave all the agricultural subsidies in for high-income farmers and everything else. I just think it's - it's chilling to me,"" Clinton said."

Six Big Fibs in Walmart's New Ad Campaign","Walmart is good: good for its employees, its customers, its suppliers, and even for the environment, says the company's new ad campaign and website, dubbed ""The Real Walmart"" as a retort to the company's critics.

But alas, the facts say otherwise. On inspection, each of the major claims in the campaign turns out to be ""The Fake Walmart."" Let's examine each of these glowing pronouncements, along with the murky reality that lies behind it.



1. The Claim: ""Opportunity: That's the Real Walmart!"" exults one of the ads. ""Over 75 percent of store management started as hourly associates.""

The Reality: An internal Walmart document just leaked to the press this week reveals that:

Hourly ""associates"" at Walmart start at or near the minimum wage. Performance-based pay increases can result in ""promotions"" in pay and title. But even the very highest level of performance will net you an annual raise of just $.60 per hour, capped for each job title. Last year, only 18 percent of hourly workers received any pay raise at all. If an employee is so industrious as to rise to the management level of, say, ""check out supervisor,"" her pay will be $1.70 more than that of the lowest paid employee.

And getting from the hourly wage ghetto to a salaried position is, as the Magic 8 Ball likes to say, ""Not likely."" In a typical Walmart store, there may be 200 employees and only a handful of salaried managers. Getting one of those few positions is ""more like a lottery than a reliable path.""

""When our store does well, I earn quarterly bonuses!""

The Reality: Those bonuses of $100 to $300, intended to make employees work harder, don't make for a living wage. If Walmart really wanted to improve workers' lives, it would allow more of them to work full time, and thus have access to health insurance and other benefits. Instead, the company keeps a tight lid on full-time work, thus denying benefits to about 70 percent of its store employees.



3. The Claim: ""Walmart helps customers save on prescription drugs!""

The Reality: But at what cost to those same customers as taxpayers? Walmart's wages and benefits are so low that many of its workers have to rely on Medicaid and other social services to support their families, costing taxpayers between $900,000 and $1.75 million annually per store in the state of Wisconsin, where these costs were calculated. That's a taxpayer tab of at least $67.5 million each year for the state of Wisconsin alone.



4. The Claim: ""President Clinton praised which company for putting solar panels on its stores?"" asks a cheerful young spokesmodel of passersby in another ad. They are surprised to learn that it's Walmart.

The Reality: The passerby's initial assumption -- that it wouldn't be Walmart -- is well taken. In fact, despite announcing in 2005 that the company would move to having 100 percent of its power supplied by renewable sources, Walmart today receives only four percent of its energy from solar and wind power.

Why would Bill Clinton say such a thing? Call me cynical, but it may have something to do with the fact that Walmart has been a major supporter of the Clintons since Bill's days as governor of Arkansas. In fact, Hillary was a member of Walmart's Board of Directors for the six years leading up to her husband's first presidential campaign in 1992. By 1993, tax returns showed the Clintons owned more than $100,000 worth of Walmart stock. In 2008, the company made substantial contributions to Hillary's presidential campaign, while Bill has maintained a close personal relationship with Walmart CEO H. Lee Scott. If Hillary runs in 2016, it will be in the post-Citizens United era of the SuperPac. These are made by billionaire contributors, and there are few billionaires as billiony as the scions of Walmart -- the six Walton heirs together own as much wealth as 40 percent of the U.S. population. The candidate who has them has the atom bomb of the SuperPac wars.



5. The Claim: ""Meet real Walmart shoppers!"" Here we meet a businessman, a teacher, a carpenter, a mechanical engineer, a firefighter and an accountant, all of them redolent with middle class status, who proudly shop at Walmart. ""Living better,"" the tag line says, ""that's the real Walmart.""

The Reality: Walmart's customers are disproportionately poor, Southern and elderly. The fact that none of these demo's made it into Walmart's ad about ""Our Customers"" means not only that Walmart is a fibber, but also that Walmart is a disser of its own ""real"" customers.



6. The Claim: ""We work directly with manufacturers, eliminating costly markups.""

The Reality: If by ""work with,"" the ad means ""dictate to,"" then this claim is accurate. But again, as Charles Fishman, the business reporter who wrote The Walmart Effect asks, what is ""the high cost of these low prices?"" Walmart's market power is such that many of its suppliers face a stark choice: take dictation from Walmart, or lose half or more of their business. ""To survive in the face of [Walmart's] pricing demands, makers of everything from bras to bicycles to blue jeans have had to lay off employees and close U.S. plants in favor of outsourcing products from overseas.""

Just ask Steve Dobbins, CEO of 75-year old Carolina Mills, a company that supplies thread and yarn to textile manufacturers -- half of whom supply Walmart. His company grew steadily until 2000. Then his customers, with Walmart's gun to their heads -- began a hemhorrage of offshoring in order to find the dirt cheap labor necessary to meet Walmart's low price demands. Carolina Mills shrank from 17 factories to 7 within three years. The way Walmart ""works with"" its suppliers has been disastrous for American workers.

In the end, what can we learn from ""The Real Walmart""?

When large corporations are criticized, they squirt PR like a cuttlefish. After all, it's a lot cheaper to fix the image than to fix the problem. This summer, reports have emerged showing that Walmart's pay and promotion policies are miserly, and that as a result, taxpayers get stuck with a big tab. If ""greenwashing"" is hiding your environmental sins with PR, and red is the color of labor, ""The Real Walmart"" has, in response to its critics, given us ""redwashing.""

Perversion is dangerous Mr. moulitsas you are a first-rank promotor of homosexuality and other deviant behivior. I think this is because you do not undrsetand the danger of such pervert activity. Male homosexusality is the cause of AIDS and drug use.It has also been proven that most pedophiles are male homosexuals. this measn that completely outlawing male homsoexaulity would gretly reduce crime or even completely eliminate it. Violence isalso mostly caused by male homosexuals, note that Hitler was an homosexual. Female homosexauls are a different matter baecause they are not violent or cirminal, or use drugs like male homosecuals. They are more dangerous thou because they reduce the number of avaialable women. And less women means that less children be born every year. And when no kids are born this country will become mexico (yes, the one with the drug cartells). Outlawing female hoosexuality is necesary to keep our country alive. As you cans ee I am not saying we that anyone should be executed just that that homosexuality should be illegal. This is reasonable and also constitutioinal since the constitution was writen by non-homosexuals. You should support thi agenda to protect children and our country.

The Cause of Global Warming The worst part about global warming is nobody is doing anything about it. The cause is the destruction of the ozone layer. The remedy is to replace the ozone as rapidly as possible. We can do that. We must do that. We must start the program NOW. NOW. NOW. ! The Kos has some responsibility for this. Had I been able to tell my story, you would have stopped the people that were causing the huge holes in the ozone layer. It was NASA.

Tax-trough feeders

From: Dewayne Knox

To: Markos Tax-trough feeders like school teachers (who produce nothing -- the kids are all illiterate) now outnumber the tax contributors so there's no way the country will work. Too many takers and not enough givers can only go downhill and you can see it happening. In California corporations leave and take their tax-payers with them. California is finished and the teacher's unions are largely to blame

From: Markos

To: Dewayne Knox Name three California corporations that have left. Heck, name one.

From: Dewayne Knox

To: Markos I'm not helping someone like you with research -- I personally have persuaded three California corporations to leave and they for obvious reasons shall remain nameless.

Even many corporations not registered in Calif have taken most if not all their function out of state which essentially means the tax (paid by their workers) with them as well -- Verizon, half the entertainment industry find it to costly to work. There are many that have just outsourced and you know it A friend of mine who is a simple insurance agent moved to Vegas and with all the fees and compliances now removed even he saves about 20K a year.

If it's not a problem why the shortfall and lay-offs -- despite the tax increases. I enjoy watching the state workers and teachers squirm -- they brought it on themselves. I'm retired but it's great to watch the lay-off show. California's gone from the Golden State of Ronald Reagan to the banana republic of Jerry Brown.

I have a story of California stupidity so ludicrous it should be on 60 minutes but it's too long to waste time here. Enjoy the cuts prick.

From: Markos

To: Dewayne Knox Ahh, so you don't know any major corporations. Just making shit up. Typical.

From: Dewayne Knox

To: Markos I never said major -- stop making shit up.

California is being eroded from underneath -- no great announcements just small companies that are no longer here -- doesn't mean they're not somewhere else -- hellooooo.

I see you won't answer my question. If it's not happening why is there a budget deficit?

California has great agriculture, great ports, cheap labor, defense industry (what hasn't left), entertainment (what hasn't left) Silicon Valley (for now) sales tax, state tax (some states have neither -- but no budget deficit) and taxes on everything -- yet there's deficits.

Forty years of big spending democrats and parasitic unions have ruined the place -- and now with sponging state retirees expecting fat pensions there is no fix. I'm not a repub but at least they put some brakes on the spending but they never get the chance here and this the result -- aided and abetted by greaseballs like you. Pity those Turks didn't wipe you out -- but you seem to be doing it to yourselves over there.

From: Markos

To: Dewayne Knox So no major corporation has left California, it still has more Fortune 500 companies than any other state, and far more diversified economy at that. It has a balanced budget (actually a surplus, link below) -- something the last Republican governor couldn't accomplish, and it's still the center of both the global entertainment and technology industries. So your evidence that corporations are leaving California is your podunk insurance agent friend? Somehow, I think California will manage to survive that devastating blow, lol. http://www.reuters.com/... You know what allowed us to build budget surplus? A Democratic governor and Democratic super-majorities in the state legislature. No more rump fringe Republicans able to hold California back. And best of all? America is following suite. Pretty awesome, huh?

From: Dewayne Knox

To: Markos Hey Turkey's bitch,

Some co's are still registered here but they've removed their facilities so the tax payers have gone. I suppose all the layoffs are just my imagination and those still with a job are living on eggshells. Teachers with forty kids in the class instead of twenty as teaching staff gets reduced. I see the numbers -- oh and I don't bother with links -- you can get viruses you know.

I haven't gone into a lot of detail because some companies are working the angles and I'm not tipping you off. It's easy to get out of Calif tax if you know how and all the lame propositions can't stop the loss.

Governors have little to do with it idiot -- the dem house does the spending -- dems if left to themselves will bankrupt anything -- and you ain't seen nothing yet.

How's your greaseball Greek economy doing Lol

From: Markos

To: Dewayne Knox You can get a virus from Reuters? Ha ha ha! But I get it. Fox News or bust, right? But then again, you think California has a budget deficit when it has a surplus, so reality isn't your strong suit. Neither is providing evidence for your Fox-fueled fantasies.

From: Dewayne Knox

To: Markos The list of business leaving Calif has no end in sight -- you're probably a tax-trough feeder but your views shoot yourself in the foot -- that trough you're feeding from is on shaky grounds. Go and gloat about your surplus with those laid off -- not that I give a fuck for them either -- I've fed off state employees for years and now I'm showing companies how to leave this liberal mess. Google on opening a corporation in Nevada and other places -- all those law firms don't advertise for nothing -- they make a profit year in year out because so many take that step. It's great. But put your Visigoth head in the sand -- ignore the inevitable .

And fuck Fox news -- the media is all the same

Go Turkey -- fuck those Visigoths hee hee

From: Markos

To: Dewayne Knox So no actual examples, just some random insurance agent? So I looked it up. 254 businesses left California in 2011. That same year, 132,000 new businesses were started in the state -- by far the most of any state in the country, and second-most per capita (only Arizona had more startups, per capita). Reality is a bitch, huh? Like when you thought California had a budget deficit, but thanks to Democratic super-majorities it now has a nearly $1 billion surplus?

From: Dewayne Knox

To: Markos Ha ha I got Nick the Greek rattled.

132,000 hahaha -- 3 still in business -- and they're wetbacks mowing lawns

No point in telling you -- you don't (or don't dare) read it. You prefer fiction

I gave you a short list -- you can google a thousand for yourself. Companies might have an address here -- I do myself -- but the facility is elsewhere. But to you I'm a positive statistic hee hee

You haven't explained why they're laying off people in your prosperous Golden state -- teachers by the thousand -- God knows what the private sector's like -- almost non-existent.

Anyway I enjoy watching the 20% unemployment in inaction -- serves the fuckers right. I'd love to have you face to face with them -- they'd probably kill ya -- you know -- those who are no longer entitled to unemployment so for myth pushers like you they don't exist.

Keep crunching your figures -- all professional bulshitters do

Go Turkey -- kill those useless Ostrogoths

From: Markos

To: Dewayne Knox Let me guess -- you're one of those people who ""unskewed"" polls late last year, because only the ""professional bulshitters"" (your spelling) believed the (poll) figures, right? You'd think you wingers would learn their lessons and start trusting reality. And you know what is reality? California led the nation in job creation the last 12 months: http://www.cbsnews.com/... California has created almost 234,000 jobs, more than Texas and the next nine biggest states combined. Sucks when reality smacks hard against your ideology, huh?

America isn't who you think America is. It voted for that ""worthless"" president, after all.Poor Eva Braun! Unless ... she was a hoosexual too!Um ... no thanks.Sigh...I've long noticed this right-wing fantasy California, where the state is crumbling and jobs are leaving and whatnot. I wrote about it here . I decided to engage.And that was that. I never did figure out what he had against the Ostrogoths."

Washington (CNN) - President Barack Obama continued what's become an annual post-Thanksgiving tradition by stopping at a bookstore for Small Business Saturday.

With his two daughters alongside, the President went to Politics and Prose in Washington to pick up a few books, telling reporters he bought a ""long list"" of titles for every age group, including his own. (Read the full list below)

The President chatted at length with several customers, while his daughters, Sasha and Malia, browsed.

He went to the cashier to make his purchase after about 20 minutes. As he left the shop, the President wished everyone a ""great holiday,"" and customers applauded.

Started by two people in 1984, Politics and Prose has grown to a staff of 50 employees and is known as a popular spot for book discussions and readings, with daily visits by authors.

First lady Michelle Obama, who was not with the family Saturday, held a book signing at Politics and Prose in May to promote “American Grown,” a book about the White House garden and her campaign against obesity.

Last year, the Obamas shopped at a different bookstore - One More Page Books - in the Washington suburb of Arlington, Virginia.

Small Business Saturday is a tradition started by American Express in 2010.

In 2011, they went to Kramerbooks and Afterwords Café in Washington.

List of books purchased by Obama, according to the White House:

“Half Brother” by Kenneth Oppel

“Heart of a Samurai” by Margi Preus

“Flora and Ulysses” by Kate DiCamillo

“Jinx” by Sage Blackwood

“Lulu and the Brontosaurus” by Judith Viorst and Lane Smith

Shear']",Democrats Turn to Minimum Wage as 2014 Strategy,"WASHINGTON — Democratic Party leaders, bruised by months of attacks on the new health care program, have found an issue they believe can lift their fortunes both locally and nationally in 2014: an increase in the minimum wage.

The effort to take advantage of growing populism among voters in both parties is being coordinated by officials from the White House, labor unions and liberal advocacy groups.

In a series of strategy meetings and conference calls among them in recent weeks, they have focused on two levels: an effort to raise the federal minimum wage, which will be pushed by President Obama and congressional leaders, and a campaign to place state-level minimum wage proposals on the ballot in states with hotly contested congressional races.

With polls showing widespread support for an increase in the $7.25-per-hour federal minimum wage among both Republican and Democratic voters, top Democrats see not only a wedge issue that they hope will place Republican candidates in a difficult position, but also a tool with which to enlarge the electorate in a nonpresidential election, when turnout among minorities and youths typically drops off."

Darrell Issa, chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, said Friday that a provision in House GOP leadership’s “no budget, no pay” plan is unconstitutional.

“That’s unconstitutional,” Issa said of House leadership’s plan to withhold the pay of members of Congress if they don’t pass a budget by April 15.

The plan offers to raise the debt ceiling for three months, and the Senate must pass a budget by the end of that time period-April 15. If they fail to pass the budget by April 15, members of Congress wouldn’t be paid.

Issa said that would interfere with the 27th amendment to the Constitution, which doesn’t allow pay for members of Congress to change until after an election. “No law, varying the compensation for the services of the Senators and Representatives, shall take effect, until an election of Representatives shall have intervened,” the 27th amendment reads.

Hours before, American Majority Action spokesman Ron Meyer also said the plan was unconstitutional for the same reason. Because of that, Meyer said “No Budget No Pay” couldn’t “take effect until next Congress.”

Meyer also said in an email that “numerous conservative members of the House have already come out and said they won’t vote for a plan which doesn’t cut spending.” At this time, it’s unclear if “No Budget No Pay” will cut any spending.

UPDATED (5:40pmET): In a statement to Breitbart News after this piece was published, Issa said he “strongly support[s] the House Republican leadership’s proposal to link the debt ceiling increase to passage of a budget by the Senate which has gone 1360 days without passing a blueprint for federal spending. While the 27th Amendment prohibits Congress from varying its own pay within a given Congress, as I noted in my interview it can certainly withhold pay. I have not read the legislative text of the ‘No Budget, No Pay’ proposal and how it approaches historically difficult questions about Congressional compensation. I would note that there has even been legal action taken challenging the current system that gives Members of Congress an automatic pay-raise. I have been an advocate for the strategy of linking a debt ceiling increase to passage of a budget as an effective way of forcing President Obama to focus on our nation’s long term fiscal situation. I expect the final proposal brought before the House will have resolved any constitutional questions and that it will have my support.”"

http://www.breitbart.com/InstaBlog/2013/09/07/Congratulations-Australia,2013-09-07 00:00:00,['John Hayward'],"Congratulations, Australia","I’d like to congratulate the voters of Australia for doing what the voters of America should have done in 2012:

Australia’s conservative leader Tony Abbott swept into office in national elections on Saturday as voters punished the outgoing Labor government for six years of turbulent rule and for failing to maximize the benefits of a now fading mining boom.

Abbott, a former boxer, Rhodes scholar and trainee priest, promised to restore political stability, cut taxes and crack down on asylum seekers arriving by boat.

“From today I declare that Australia is under new management and Australia is once more open for business,” Abbott told jubilant supporters in Sydney.

America, on the other hand, will not be open for business until 2017 at the earliest.

It’s always a mistake to overstate the similarities between different national political environments – the differences are profound in even the most similar countries. But there are some sharp parallels to be drawn here, particularly on the need for pro-growth tax cuts, and the squandering of a natural resources revolution. Obama’s War On Energy has some similarities to the way Australians seem to feel their mining boom was wasted:

The election was been pitched as a choice on who is best to lead the A$1.5 trillion ($1.4 trillion) economy as it adjusts to an end to a prolonged mining investment boom, fuelled by China’s demand for its abundant natural resources.

Abbott, 55, built up a strong opinion poll lead on the back of promises to rein in government spending, scrap an unpopular tax on carbon emissions, and stop the flow of refugee boats arriving in Australia’s northwest.

His campaign had support from media magnate Rupert Murdoch and his Australian newspapers, which have urged voters to reject Rudd’s Labor government. Australia’s other major newspaper group Fairfax also called for a change of government, saying

Rudd had painted Abbott’s planned spending cuts as dangerous European-style austerity and said his government was best placed to manage an economy that is slowing but remains the envy of much of the developed world.

This is really a golden moment for any aspiring capitalist economy to eat America’s lunch. We’re years away from being remotely competitive. The Obama Democrats are hell-bent to double down on his failed policies, not just due to ideological rigidity, but because Obama’s ego will never allow him to admit he’s been fundamentally wrong about everything for five years.

And the American ruling class has become quite obsessed with using socialist policies to build invulnerable voting coalitions of government dependents. They take Obama’s re-election as a sign that the American electorate is reasonably comfortable with the New Normal of double-digit real unemployment, expensive gas, a declining standard of living, out-of-control government spending, and all the rest of it. The bar of economic leadership was lowered to accommodate President Obama; the ruling class doesn’t think it will be raised any time soon.

Now is your moment, aspiring capitalist tigers of the world. The American workforce is buried under food stamps and long-term disability checks; employers are wrapped in chains of regulation, held tightly shut with the padlocks of ObamaCare. No corporation in its right mind would relocate into the American quagmire of soaring corporate taxes (with class-warfare battle cries signaling even worse to come), high labor costs, and crushing regulatory burdens. Every CEO in the world watched Democrats march Apple Inc. executives into a show trial and berate them for daring to keep their offshore revenue offshore, instead of bringing it home so Uncle Sam could cut himself a thick slice. They all watched Obama and his party present irresponsible government deficits as an argument for tax increases, rather than government reform.

A weakened America has turned away from its bedrock principles of economic liberty. A huge void is waiting to be filled."

“The conduct of the Republican leadership was disgraceful, it was indefensible and it was immoral.”

“There was a betrayal.”

“Disappointing and disgusting.”

“It’s inexcusable.”

“Failed that most basic test of public service.”

And this was coming from the Republicans.

The spark: Boehner’s last-minute decision to let the 112th Congress fade into history without a vote on the $60 billion Hurricane Sandy relief package for the Northeast. In a sense, this was an outrage, because such recovery bills traditionally pass without a fuss. But in another sense, it followed a familiar script: Tea party Republicans balked at taking up the spending bill (it had enough votes to pass), and because the tea party rules the House GOP, Boehner obeyed rather than risk his reelection as speaker on Thursday.

The Sandy sidestep provided a perfect coda for the first two years of this Republican-controlled House, which only by a loose definition can still be called a legislative body.Lawmakers in both parties are congratulating themselves for passing a bill to avoid the “fiscal cliff,” but they did little more than approve a short-term fix that postpones the standoff 60 days. Ominously, even this stopgap measure failed to win the votes of two-thirds of House Republicans, including top Boehner lieutenants Eric Cantor and Kevin McCarthy, who preferred to risk economic calamity.

The House GOP’s antics on the fiscal cliff leave little optimism that lawmakers will be reasonable when it comes to more substantial issues such as restructuring entitlements, rewriting the tax code and reducing the debt. The fury over the Sandy sidestep could be a sign, though, that even some House Republicans are tiring of the tea party’s dominance of their caucus.

Various Republicans, mostly from the Sandy-soaked Northeast, went to the House floor Wednesday morning to join Democrats in denouncing Boehner’s decision.

First came Rep. Michael Grimm, whose New York district was pummeled by the storm. The GOP leadership’s “error in judgment is going to cost, I think, the trust of the American people,” he said. Offering a “heartfelt apology” to his constituents for the House’s inaction, he warned that “to delay this vote even for another day is something that will resonate . . . with the American people for a long time.”

It certainly will resonate with voters in the Northeast, where Republicans such as Grimm are an endangered species. But even some from outside the region didn’t like the message the party was sending.

Rep. Robert Dold of Illinois — who, like Grimm, came to Congress in the tea party wave of 2010 — reminded his colleagues that although “the federal government should play as little role as possible in the lives of Americans, they do need to play a role.” Dold, who lost his reelection bid, warned that “we’re anchoring to the extremes as opposed to coming to the center.”

Rep. Tom Reed, whose Upstate New York district wasn’t hurt by the hurricane, tried to reason with his fellow conservatives: “There is not a better purpose of the federal government than for the federal government to stand with our citizens when they are suffering the most.”

And Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.), reminding conservatives that New York and New Jersey pay more in taxes than they receive from the federal government, made an emotional appeal for Boehner to reconsider. “Nature pulled the rug out from under people,” he said, and “now Congress is going to pull the rug out.” [UPDATE: This quote was uttered by the person who spoke just after Smith, minority leader Nancy Pelosi. It was the rare day in Congress when Smith and Pelosi were on the same side of an issue.]

But it was Rep. Peter King, a Long Island Republican and chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, who delivered the harshest denunciation of Boehner’s leadership and of “a strain in the Republican Party,” which, he said, has a bias against the Northeast.

“I can’t imagine that type of indifference, that type of disregard, that type of cavalier attitude being shown to any other part of the country,” he said.

Accusing Boehner of ignoring “real life-and-death situations,” King thundered: “This should not be the Republican Party. This should not be the Republican leadership.”

[UPDATE: As of Thursday morning, King pronounced that he had been mollified.]

Off the floor, the furious lawmaker hinted in a CNN interview that he might bolt the GOP, saying that anyone in New York or New Jersey who gives money to the House Republican campaign effort “should have their head examined.”

“People in my party, they wonder why they’re becoming a minority party,” he continued. “They’ve written me off and they’re going to have a hard time getting my vote.”

A few more brave voices such as King’s could save the party from itself.

Americans want the government to re-open. Speaker Boehner is telling us that is not possible at this time and that our government must remain shuttered because the votes simply aren't there for a clean CR to pass.

I personally hate to believe that the Speaker of the House of Representatives is an actual liar and yet, I have to believe that he is. I understand that the votes are there.

The only way to resolve this issue - Is the Speaker of the House of Representatives Being Truthful to the American Public is for him to PROVE IT.

Offer up the clean CR with the same budget numbers you agreed to last month then count the votes.

The Speaker indicated that it's a waste of time. We do know that the Republicans don't really mind wasting time since they have pointlessly repealed the ACA 42 times, so that wouldn't be the real reason for not presenting it.

In fact, the only reason I can come up with for not presenting the clean CR is the obvious one:

Because it will pass and expose the Speaker of the House as the weak, unreliable, prevaricating politician that he has been throughout these negotiations.

If Mr. Boehner does not want the American public to think these are the underlying reasons for not presenting the CR, he should act swiftly to counter this impression.

So Speaker Boehner, you say the votes aren't there -I ask again for you to

(CNN) —

If all the recent wrangling over the fiscal cliff has revealed anything, it’s how tense and strained President Obama’s relationship is with Republicans in Congress.

Borger: Fiscal cliff was bound to collapse

And Obama’s relationship with Congress reached yet another low Thursday when House Speaker John Boehner confirmed to CNN that he has told House Republicans he will no longer negotiate legislative deals with the president.

And in an opinion piece on Thursday, Sen. John Cornyn of Texas faulted the president for all the fiscal brinksmanship since 2010. The new No. 2 Senate Republican also suggested that “[i]t may be necessary to partially shut down the government in order to secure the long-term fiscal well being of our country.”

Low bar for new Congress

In the White House’s relationship with Capitol Hill, “the real negative is clearly that the relationship with House Republicans is as bad as ever,” CNN contributor and Princeton University historian Julian Zelizer said, adding that the House GOP refuses to acknowledge any mandate from Obama after November’s election.

“They are going to fight the president tooth and nail,” Zelizer said, a problem made worse by the fact that Boehner “is not in control” of House Republicans, particularly the contingent of fiscal conservatives brought to Washington by support from the tea party movement.

Zelizer: GOP faces choice – leadership or gridlock?

CNN contributor Ruben Navarrette Jr. said Obama’s strained relationship with congressional Republicans dates back to the contentious debate over Obama’s signature health care legislation, where the president showed his willingness to push through major proposals and major legislation without consulting them.

“He is so good at the business of politics that he’s really outmaneuvered them,” Navarrette observed about Obama’s relationship with Republicans over the past four years.

Navarrette: The real issue is runaway spending

The already difficult relationship isn’t helped by unique issues on each side.

The GOP has been struggling to define itself and its message in tough economic times amidst twin concerns about government spending and income inequality.

Zelizer: What the tea party cost the GOP

And buoyed by his electoral success in 2008, legislative successes in the first half of his first term and by winning a second term, Obama adopted a take-it-or-leave-it attitude with Republicans, even as the nation teetered on the edge of the fiscal cliff.

“My preference would have been to solve these problems in the context of a larger agreement, a bigger deal, a grand bargain. But with this Congress, that was obviously a little too much to hope for at this time,” Obama said Monday afternoon at a White House event that at moments seemed like a campaign gathering.

At the same event, Obama also warned the GOP about expected battles over spending cuts in the coming months.

“Now, if Republicans think that I will finish the job of deficit reduction through spending cuts alone,” Obama said, “[I]f they think that’s going to be the formula for how we solve this thing, then they’ve got another thing coming. That’s not how it’s going to work.” Rather, Obama declared “it’s going to have to be a matter of shared sacrifice, at least as long as I’m president. And I’m going to be president for the next four years.”

Obama’s recent post-election trash talking directed at Congress is “defiance politics” that misunderstands what it means to win an election, Navarrette said.

The president’s recent comments are like “an end zone dance, a celebration” or, in the world of mixed martial arts competition, like “putting your foot on the other guy’s neck and holding your hand up in the air,” after you’ve felled your opponent, according to Navarrette.

Instead of taking every opportunity to remind Republicans that he won (and they lost) last November, Obama needs to realize that “with winning elections comes the responsibility to lead,” Navarrette said. As the person in whom the public has placed its trust and confidence, “your burdens are much greater (than your losing opponent’s).”

Democrats counter that Obama hasn’t had anyone to make a deal with.

“When John Boehner comes to the table and he can’t even bring his deputy or his third in command to vote for the deal that he is agreeing to, I think you’ve got a real crisis of leadership in the House,” former White House press secretary Bill Burton said.

Debt Ceiling: Welcome to Fight Club

“And so the president showed that even in that case, he can get a deal that moves the ball forward for the country, but going forward, you just wonder, how much control does Boehner have over the folks in the House and what kind of deals are we going to be able to get?”

For all his recent public swagger when it comes to Congress, Obama “really does compromise a lot,” said Zelizer. For example, Zelizer pointed out that during recent negotiations over the fiscal cliff, the president changed his position substantially on the income threshold for eliminating the Bush tax cuts.

While he says he doesn’t think there’s much more Obama can do publicly to smooth over the differences with House Republicans, Zelizer said that Obama can’t let stand Boehner’s declaration that he’s abandoning any more legislative deal-making with the White House. The president would be wise to try to work behind the scenes to keep Boehner “in the fold and maintain some sort of relationship” with the speaker.

And Zelizer noted an encouraging pattern in the recent fiscal brinksmanship between Congress and the president.

After negotiations between Boehner and Obama broke down, “(Senate Minority Leader Mitch) McConnell stepped up and put the deal together,” observed Zelizer, who added the Senate could take the lead again in working out agreements on things like handling automatic spending cuts put off by this week’s fiscal cliff deal and likely upcoming battles over the debt ceiling and funding the federal government.

Zelizer noted that after McConnell negotiated a deal with Vice President Joe Biden, Boehner allowed House Republicans to entertain an alternative that would have included more spending cuts, an alternative which never made it to a vote because fiscal conservatives couldn’t muster a majority in the House GOP to support its passage.

Ultimately, Boehner kept his pledge to Democratic leaders in Congress to put the Senate’s deal up for a House vote. By making the pledge before the terms of the Senate deal were even set, Zelizer said, Boehner sent a signal to House Republicans that they were going to lose the battle over the fiscal cliff even if they didn’t like the Senate deal.

The maneuvers by McConnell and Boehner suggest a path forward if repeated, according to Zelizer, because if GOP leaders continue not to obstruct Democrats as they try to move forward with legislation, that could help bring around tea party Republicans in the House.

Tea party calls for consequences after fiscal cliff vote

In order to improve their relationship with the White House, Navarette said Republicans “have to fix what’s broken in their own party, they have to heal the divisions in their own party … and define what the GOP is about.”

Boehner re-elected speaker in midst of public defections

Calling it “a miracle” that Boehner was re-elected as speaker, Navarette said the GOP must also decide which role it wants to play in Obama’s second term. Will they try to be accommodating and try to work with the president to find solutions to problems, including some problems Republican donors and the Republican establishment wants fixed? Or will they play the proverbial loyal opposition?

Both are “not terribly attractive options” for the GOP, Navarette said, especially up against a masterful political strategist like Obama.

And Navarrette suggests that the sports-loving and competitive Obama invite top Republicans over to the White House for his annual Super Bowl watching party in order to build personal relationships across the aisle in Congress.

For Obama, moderating his triumphal, defiant approach when it comes to Republicans and Congress is also important because, Navarette points out, gun control and immigration reform are both high on Obama’s second term agenda. And there are strong feelings on the part of conservatives and Obama’s liberal base on both issues.

Politics in 2013: 5 things to watch for

Obama talks about ‘worst day of my presidency,’ goals for next term

On the fiscal issues where Obama has repeatedly clashed with Capitol Hill Republicans in the past two years, Zelizer warns that recent events could repeat themselves.

“It’s going to be rough, going to be tough, we’re going to see this issue recur again and again over the years,” the historian said.

Indeed, both Obama and McConnell, the GOP’s new lead fiscal negotiator, already seem to be playing out a familiar script.

3 more fiscal cliffs loom

The last fiscal battle barely over, Obama wasted no time late Tuesday night staking out his position in the battles to come.

After saying “I am very open to compromise,” the president went on to fire a shot over Congress’ bow in the likely fight in February over raising the debt ceiling. “[W]hile I will negotiate over many things, I will not have another debate with this Congress over whether or not they should pay the bills that they’ve already racked up through the laws that they passed,” Obama declared, “Let me repeat: We can’t not pay bills that we’ve already incurred.”

McConnell quickly fired back.

“The president may not want to have a fight about government spending over the next few months, but it’s the fight he is going to have, because it’s a debate the country needs,” McConnell wrote in a Yahoo op-ed published Wednesday night, adding that Obama “must show up” and deliver a serious plan for slashing federal spending.

“That’s the debate the American people really want. It’s a debate Republicans are ready to have. And it’s the debate that starts today, whether the president wants it or not,” McConnell wrote.

Although he has sworn off direct negotiations with Obama, Boehner echoed McConnell’s remarks on Friday.

“With the cliff behind us, the focus turns to spending,” Boehner told House Republicans.

Obama: Job of debt reduction nearly done

By Lori Montgomery,

When President Obama delivers his State of the Union address Tuesday evening, here’s one thing you won’t hear: an ambitious new plan to rein in the national debt.

In recent weeks, the White House has pressed the message that, if policymakers can agree on a strategy for replacing across-the-board spending cuts set to hit next month, Obama will pretty much have achieved what he has called “our ultimate goal” of halting the rapid rise in government borrowing.

“Over the last few years, Democrats and Republicans have come together and cut our deficit [over the next decade] by more than $2.5 trillion through a balanced mix of spending cuts and higher tax rates for the wealthiest Americans,” Obama said during his weekend radio address. “That’s more than halfway towards the $4 trillion in deficit reduction that economists and elected officials from both parties say we need to stabilize our debt.”

By the administration’s math, Washington needs to enact only $1.5 trillion more in 10-year savings to hit the $4 trillion target, White House economic adviser Jason Furman told reporters last week. At $1.2 trillion, the automatic cuts, known as the sequester, quite nearly fit the bill.

Deficit hawks have reacted with alarm to the administration’s position. Since a calamitous recession hit in December 2007, the amount the government owes outside investors has more than doubled, soaring from about $5 trillion to more than $11.6 trillion. By the end of this year, the debt will top $12 trillion, according to new projections from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office — about 76 percent of the nation’s economy.

Cutting an additional $1.5 trillion would indeed stabilize the debt, leaving it growing at about the same rate as the broader economy for the rest of the decade, the CBO said. However, the debt would remain above 73 percent of gross domestic product — the highest level in U.S. history except for the period after World War II.

That’s much higher than the 62 percent target policymakers set three years ago when Obama appointed the Bowles-Simpson fiscal commission. And because policymakers have avoided changes to the big federal health and retirement programs, the debt would start rising again after 2023 as the bulk of the baby-boom generation retires.

“You don’t do half the job and say you’re done,” said Maya MacGuineas, president of the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. “And stabilizing the debt is just half the job.”

As MacGuineas spoke, her organization released an updated analysis of the issue titled “Our Debt Problems Are Far From Solved.”

“While the deficit reduction enacted to date represents notable progress, lawmakers have achieved only slightly more than half of the minimum necessary deficit reduction to achieve sustainability over the next decade by our estimates,” the report says. “. . . [T]he debt-to-GDP ratio is on a path to reach about 79 percent by 2023 under our current policy projections, rather than 91 percent of GDP absent this deficit reduction. Though this represents a notable improvement, it still leaves debt on an upward path — rising from 73 percent of GDP today to nearly 130 percent by 2040.”

The report concludes that policymakers need to find an additional $2.4 trillion in savings to put the debt on “a clear downward path.” A similar report released Monday by the Democratic group Third Way calls for additional savings of roughly $2 trillion.

A third report, by the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, on Monday backed the White House target of $1.5 trillion as “the minimum appropriate budget policy.” Though it would not “permanently solve our fiscal problems, it would still represent an important accomplishment,” the report says.

However, the center’s analysts concluded that “a somewhat larger amount of deficit reduction would be desirable, if it can be secured through sound, balanced policies that don’t impede the economic recovery . . . don’t increase poverty and inequality (which are already larger in the United States than in most of the Western world), and don’t sacrifice health care quality or access or raise overall U.S. health care costs.”

That is a direct shot at House Republicans, who have set their sites on finding roughly $4 trillion in savings on top of the sequester, which is what the CBO says is needed to wipe out deficits entirely by 2023.

That is a whopping figure, and House Republicans have pledged to do it without raising taxes, cutting military spending or reducing current benefits for the elderly. That does not leave them much to cut. But if they can do it, it would bring the debt ratio down dramatically by 2023, to less than 60 percent of GDP, according to CBO estimates.

Administration officials say that the president is willing to consider more than $1.5 trillion in additional savings and that his most recent offer to House leaders, worth around $1.8 trillion, remains on the table. That proposal includes changes to Social Security and federal health programs that would produce even bigger savings after 2023.

However, Obama is insisting that any new package include new revenue. It does not have to be 50/50, Furman told reporters; he suggested a ratio of $900 billion in spending cuts to $600 billion in tax hikes.

But with Republicans opposed to more tax increases, the parties are facing the same old stalemate for the third year in a row."

http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2013/07/30/paul-christie-is-the-king-of-bacon-on-government-spending/,2013-07-30 00:00:00,"['Tampa Tim', 'Rudy Nyc', 'The', 'Compassionate', 'Gop Solution', 'Posted By']",Paul: Christie is the 'king of bacon' on government spending,"8 years ago

(CNN) - The feuding between Republicans Chris Christie and Rand Paul continued Tuesday as the senator from Kentucky cautioned the governor from New Jersey was picking a fight with the wrong guy.

In an interview on CNN's ""The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer,"" Paul defended himself against Christie's most recent allegations that the senator was bringing home too much money for his state.



""This is the king of bacon talking about bacon,"" Paul said about Christie. Both are considered potential 2016 contenders for the Republican presidential nomination.

Earlier in the day, the outspoken governor chastised Kentucky for taking more federal money than New Jersey, saying the Blue Grass state gets back $1.51 on every dollar it sends to Washington, while the Garden State receives 61 cents.

""So if Senator Paul wants to start looking at where he's going to cut spending to afford defense, maybe he should start cutting the pork barrel spending that he brings home to Kentucky,"" Christie told reporters Tuesday in Little Ferry.

Paul pointed to Kentucky's two military bases as reasons why the state may get more money from the government.

""What does he want to do, shut down military bases in Kentucky?"" he said.

Fort Campbell and Fort Knox, both Army bases, are located in Kentucky. New Jersey itself is home to a large joint military base that houses the McGuire Air Force base; Naval Air Engineering Station Lakehurst; and Fort Dix, an Army base.

""In order to have enough money for national defense, which I think is a priority for the government, you have to be willing to cut spending in other places,"" Paul continued. ""And Governor Christie and others have been part of this 'gimme gimme gimme','give me all this money.'""

He was referring to Christie's requests for federal relief aid after Superstorm Sandy slammed into the Northeast last fall. Congress ultimately passed more than $50 billion in aid to the states affected by the storm.

But Paul said the aid should have been appropriated ""in a responsible way."" The senator blasted Christie for the same reason on Sunday, saying Christie and others were ""bankrupting"" the government.

Throwing more fuel on the fire, Paul said Tuesday that Christie should be careful about choosing his battles.

""It's not helping the party for him to pick a war with me. It's a big mistake. It's not very smart. And it's not a good way to grow the party,"" Paul said, adding that the Republican Party is ""shrinking"" in the Northeast. ""Why would he want to pick a fight with the one guy who has a chance to grow the party by appealing to the youth and appealing to people who would like to see a more moderate and less aggressive foreign policy?""

Asked if the feud is a preview of a potential fight for the GOP presidential nomination in 2016, Paul responded: ""Who knows?""

Their spat first started on Thursday when Christie bashed libertarian-leaning lawmakers, like Paul, who oppose some of the National Security Agency's surveillance programs.

""These esoteric, intellectual debates – I want them to come to New Jersey and sit across from the widows and orphans and have that conversation,"" Christie said during a Republican governors forum in Colorado, referring to those who lost loved ones on 9/11. ""And they won't. That's a lot tougher conversation to have.""

Paul hit back on Sunday attacking Christie on Superstorm Sandy aid. But Christie further defended his argument on Tuesday.

""If you ask me a question, I give an answer,"" Christie said. ""You know, his response seems that he has something personal against me, but that's okay. He can just get in line on that front.""

Another Republican from the Northeast joined Christie in his criticism over the weekend. Rep. Peter King, R-New York, chided Paul for saying NSA leaker Edward Snowden was performing an act of civil disobedience when he revealed the massive snooping programs.

""This is the anti-war, left-wing Democrats of the 1960s that nominated George McGovern and destroyed their party for almost 20 years. I don't want that happening to our party,"" King told CNN's Candy Crowley on ""State of the Union.""

King also says he's mulling a potential 2016 presidential bid.

But Paul brushed off the line of attack, saying Tuesday more Americans would side with him in the debate.

""I don't think the Bill of Rights is esoteric, I don't think the Fourth Amendment is esoteric and I think the idea that we should have a right to privacy is not esoteric,"" he said on CNN.

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/12/31/congress-letting-55-tax-breaks-expire-at-year-end/,2013-12-31 00:00:00,[],Congress letting 55 tax breaks expire at year's end,"In an almost annual ritual, Congress is letting a package of 55 popular tax breaks expire at the end of the year, creating uncertainty -- once again -- for millions of individuals and businesses.

Lawmakers let these tax breaks lapse almost every year, even though they save businesses and individuals billions of dollars. And almost every year, Congress eventually renews them, retroactively, so taxpayers can claim them by the time they file their tax returns.

No harm, no foul, right? After all, taxpayers filing returns in the spring won't be hurt because the tax breaks were in effect for 2013. Taxpayers won't be hit until 2015, when they file tax returns for next year.

Not so far. Trade groups and tax experts complain that Congress is making it impossible for businesses and individuals to plan for the future. What if lawmakers don't renew the tax break you depend on? Or what if they change it and you're no longer eligible?

""It's a totally ridiculous way to run our tax system,"" said Rachelle Bernstein, vice president and tax counsel for the National Retail Federation. ""It's impossible to plan when every year this happens, but yet business has gotten used to that.""

More On This...

Some of the tax breaks are big, including billions in credits for companies that invest in research and development, generous exemptions for financial institutions doing business overseas, and several breaks that let businesses write off capital investments faster.

Others are more obscure, the benefits targeted to film producers, race track owners, makers of electric motorcycles and teachers who buy classroom supplies with their own money.

There are tax rebates to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands from a tax on rum imported into the United States, and a credit for expenses related to railroad track maintenance.

A deduction for state and local sales taxes benefits people who live in the nine states without state income taxes. Smaller tax breaks benefit college students and commuters who use public transportation.

A series of tax breaks promote renewable energy, including a credit for power companies that produce electricity with windmills.

The annual practice of letting these tax breaks expire is a symptom a divided, dysfunctional Congress that struggles to pass routine legislation, said Rep. John Lewis of Georgia, a senior Democrat on the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee.

""It's not fair, it's very hard, it's very difficult for a business person, a company, to plan, not just for the short term but to do long-term planning,"" Lewis said. ""It's shameful.""

With Congress on vacation until January, there is no chance the tax breaks will be renewed before they expire. And there is plenty of precedent for Congress to let them expire for months without addressing them. Most recently, they expired at the end of 2011, and Congress didn't renew them for the entire year, waiting until New Year's Day 2013 -- just in time for taxpayers to claim them on their 2012 returns.

But Congress only renewed the package though the end of 2013.

Why such a short extension? Washington accounting is partly to blame. The two-year extension Congress passed in January cost $76 billion in reduced revenue for the government, according to the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation. Making those tax breaks permanent could add $400 billion or more to the deficit over the next decade.

With budget deficits already high, many in Congress are reluctant to vote for a bill that would add so much red ink. So, they do it slowly, one or two years at time.

""More cynically, some people say, if you just put it in for a year or two, then that keeps the lobbyists having to come back and wine-and-dine the congressmen to get it extended again, and maybe make some campaign contributions,"" said Mark Luscombe, principal tax analyst for CCH, a consulting firm based in Riverwoods, Ill.

This year, the package of tax breaks has been caught up in a debate about overhauling the entire tax code. The two top tax writers in Congress -- House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp, R-Mich., and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus, D-Mont. -- have been pushing to simplify the tax code by reducing tax breaks and using the additional revenue to lower overall tax rates.

But their efforts have yet to bear fruit, leaving both tax reform and the package of temporary breaks in limbo. When asked how businesses should prepare, given the uncertainty, Camp said: ""They need to get on board with tax reform, that's what they need to do.""

Further complicating the issue, President Barack Obama has nominated Baucus to become U.S. ambassador to China, meaning he will soon leave the Senate, if he is confirmed by his colleagues.

As the Senate wound down its 2013 session, Democratic leaders made a late push to extend many of the tax breaks by asking Republican colleagues to pass a package on the floor of the Senate without debate or amendments. Republicans objected, saying it wasn't a serious offer, and the effort failed.

So should taxpayers count on these breaks as they plan their budgets for 2014?

""The best thing I would say is, budget accordingly,"" said Jackie Perlman, principle tax research analyst at The Tax Institute at H&R Block. ""As the saying goes, hope for the best but plan for the worst. Then if you get it, great, that's a nice perk. But don't count on it."""

Elected amid (or possibly because of) a financial crisis, the Panic of 2008, President Obama has spent his time in office lurching from disaster to disaster.

Obama’s reflexes, praised instinctive timing and audacious as a candidate, turn out to be poorly suited to high office. Obama has been mostly reactive and mostly captive to events. Veering here and there is part of being president. The world is big and dangerous and governance is hard. But watching Obama govern is like watching a distracted man flipping through television channels and all of it bad.

“If I had a son, he would look like Trayvon.”(flip) Never mind. (flip) We must bomb Syria now! (flip) Er, scratch that. (flip) Al Qaeda is on the run. (flip) It depends on what you mean by “core al Qaeda.” (flip)



Some of the crises have been self-inflected, and sometimes even intentional. Obama’s signature health law, for example, was born of a crisis in Congress. As support for the entitlement long sought by liberals was fracturing, even with Democrats in complete control of Washington, the president jammed the throttle down. The crisis of confidence demanded that a poorly constructed law be passed. Now! Now! Don’t think. Don’t read. Just vote.

That decision, of course, has led to other crises. The one playing out now is the risible implementation of the law. Democrats are all dripping with glib swipes about how Republicans have been waging a very messy civil war amid the partial government shutdown. But the Democrats are pushing their confident chuffles through gritted teeth. They know that the launch has been damaging, and if unrepaired, possibly fatal to the law. However the current budget debacle ends, the ObamaCare debacle has just begun.

The president compared the launch to an iPhone. More like Project Orca.

In an era of divided government precipitated by Obama’s crisis-based strategy for enacting a sweeping new health entitlement, Obama has remained crisis dependent to keep the government operating. In the 34th consecutive month of fiscal cliff diving, Obama is a self-described hostage. He vows he won’t negotiate, but then he does. He vows there will be no concessions on ObamaCare, and then lays the groundwork for accepting changes. He can’t help it, Obama says to his base, it’s a… well, you know.

The missives from the White House on this crisis, like most of the ones before, read like regrets. It would have been better if not for ________.

Republicans, meanwhile, can hardly even summon the will to govern by crisis. They are so focused on affixing blame for what they all expect to be a total rout that they seldom do anything so far sighted that it could even be called opportunistic. While the supporters of former Sen. Jim DeMint’s assault on Republican congressional leadership assure supporters that the rout would have been worse if they had not drawn first blood, the defenders of the political establishment all say that they all had a secret plan to scupper ObamaCare, if only Sen. Cruz hadn’t started talking.

The truth is that both alternate versions of history rely on wishful thinking. For the establishment, the canard hangs on the idea that the liberal press would have suddenly become obsessed with how bad Obama’s law was working out. No way. For the DeMintists, the presupposition is that if the leadership had only gone along that there might have been a popular uprising in favor of “defunding” the president’s law.

Wishful thinking on both sides of the Republican divide has left the GOP in the unhappy position of reacting to the man who is perhaps America’s most reactive president.

http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/28/us/politics/illinois-lawmakers-say-they-have-plan-to-fix-underfunded-pension-system.html,2013-11-28 00:00:00,['Monica Davey'],Illinois Lawmakers Say They Have Plan to Fix Underfunded Pension System,"CHICAGO — Leaders of the Illinois legislature on Wednesday announced that they had found, at long last, a way to repair the state’s deeply troubled pension system, which has been deemed among the most underfunded public systems in the nation, has jeopardized the state’s financial stability and has become a political risk for state leaders.

The leaders declined to make details of their plan public as they privately sought support from rank-and-file lawmakers before a special session called for Tuesday. Gov. Pat Quinn, a Democrat, praised the leaders — a group of top Democrats and Republicans — for what he described as a “critical agreement.” He said, without providing more details, that the deal met a crucial standard of eliminating the unfunded debt and fully stabilizing the system, which has an estimated $100 billion in unfunded liability.

But the state has appeared on the eve of a solution to its pension crisis before, and some suggested on Wednesday that the votes were by no means assured. Labor union leaders said that they expected any proposal to include cuts to retirees’ pension benefits, and that they intended to vehemently object. Among the topics of discussion in earlier efforts to overhaul the pension system have been notions such as lowering cost-of-living allowances and increasing the age for retirement.

Perception of loss of local democratic rights creates tension

Only 25%25 of Detroit%27s registered voters turned out for last municipal election

Role of newly elected Mayor Mike Duggan remains murky

DETROIT — On Jan. 1, Detroit will swear in its first white mayor in 40 years. Usually that would be a significant turn in a city where eight of 10 residents are black. But the milestone will be diminished by the reality that this city is the largest in America where elected officials do not run their own government.

A Washington, D.C., lawyer, Kevyn Orr, is managing the day-to-day operations of the Detroit government for now and into the new year instead of Mayor-elect Mike Duggan and the Detroit City Council. Orr answers to Republican Gov. Rick Snyder, who in March appointed him as an ""emergency manager"" to steer the city through an unprecedented bankruptcy.

Michigan's election-year intervention in Detroit points up a collateral effect of a state takeover: the loss of control by a government's leaders whom residents elected to deliver their services. Nineteen states have enacted laws allowing the state government to step in and help a financially distressed city, but only a handful are as aggressive as Michigan, which has taken over seven cities and three school districts since 2007.

The perceived trampling of democratic rights often creates tension between the state and city, which disillusions many residents in places such as Detroit. The current mayor, Dave Bing, and five of nine city council members did not seek re-election Nov. 5, when 25% of registered voters came out for the municipal election.

""I feel like we have lost our democracy,"" said Gail Craig, 57, of Detroit, a General Motors consultant. ""I know a lot of people who said they weren't voting in the election because they said it wouldn't matter anyway.""

Darlene Jackson, 58, a Detroit native laid off from a city job, said, ""Now that we've elected a mayor, there's no need for an emergency manager.""

Snyder has said the emergency manager will probably be in charge at least until next fall as the city works its way through the bankruptcy, which was filed in July but is awaiting a ruling from a federal judge on whether it can proceed. The city, whose annual general fund budget is about $1.1 billion, has $18 billion in public pension and bond debt.

Mayor's role

What role Duggan will play in the coming year will be watched closely in Michigan, where Detroit's future is tied to the state's own efforts to re-invent itself after years of decline.

Under Michigan law, the emergency manager has broad powers to act in place of the mayor and council, but the manager can assign tasks to elected officials if he chooses. Some managers have done that in other Michigan cities, but the law was primarily designed to hold the manager accountable for repairing a city's finances.

Duggan, a former county prosecutor and medical center executive, captured 55 percent of the vote in the nonpartisan election. Coming off that momentum, Duggan has talked to Orr, Snyder and state lawmakers to persuade them to give him a role in city operations. Orr, a bankruptcy lawyer, is a former classmate of Duggan's at the University of Michigan law school.

A Democrat who opposed appointing the emergency manager, Duggan is asking Snyder, a Republican up for re-election next year, to honor the mandate voters gave him to help fix their city. The governor's sometimes frosty relations with Bing and the current council have not improved since the election; city officials said Nov. 13 they were insulted at the state's offer of only $5 million in aid to restructure the government.

Yet Snyder is eager to show progress in resolving the city's crisis before next year's election. ""What I'd like to do is have a strong good working relationship with the mayor-elect and see how we can work together,"" Snyder said. ""I'm very open to having a process where hopefully he can participate in the operations of the city. That's for the emergency manager and him to work out, hopefully.""

Terry Stanton, a spokesman for the state department of treasury, said Snyder is committed to working with Duggan to complete Detroit's comeback. ""It would not, however, be prudent to speculate on the specifics of that collaboration at this time,"" he said.

Historic perspective

Detroit is not the first city in Michigan or elsewhere in which elected officials have clashed with their state overseers. Pontiac's leaders also resisted a state takeover in 2009, and Flint re-elected its mayor in 2011 only to see him replaced with a state-appointed emergency manager. Allen Park unsuccessfully tried to avoid Snyder's emergency manager in 2012, saying it would harm the city's future.

Washington, D.C.'s mayor called Congress' 1995 decision to impose a financial control board on the nation's ailing capital ""the rape of democracy."" More recently, a lawyer for the city council of bankrupt Central Falls, R.I., compared the 2011 state takeover to the German occupation of Paris during World War II.

It is not just the loss of local decision-making that local officials resent. The state overseers—a manager, receiver or control board—usually cut budgets, eliminate jobs, reduce or restructure services, trim retirement benefits and raise taxes, none of which is popular.

Yet in city after city, residents opposed to the state takeover often admit it was necessary because their elected leaders would not take the politically difficult actions needed to balance spending and revenues.

""I didn't like the idea of an emergency manager, but it's obvious things wouldn't correct themselves on their own,"" said Jenise Verde, 48, a Blue Cross analyst in downtown Detroit. ""For a long time the people running the city haven't looked at what's going on in the full light of day. At some point, that blows up.""

Officials who have led relatively successful state takeovers stress the need to engage the community, including elected officials, city workers, labor unions and civic, business and religious leaders.

Michigan governors have twice named Joyce Parker an emergency manager in Ecorse (2009) and Allen Park (2012). She said in an interview that she eased the strain from budget and pay cuts in those communities in part through a series of meetings in which she explained the financial challenges the cities faced and the role of the emergency manager in resolving them. Small groups met over coffee; large groups gathered at town meetings.

""The key is educating the public, being transparent and keeping an open-door policy,"" she said. Did state officials tell her to adopt that tack? ""No. I was a city manager over 25 years,"" Parker said. ""It's common to do it that way to build consensus.""

The same transparency contributed to the quick resolution of the Central Falls bankruptcy, which lasted only 13 months, although the effects of budget and pension cuts and tax increases will linger for several years.

""For a bankruptcy to work there's really got to be negotiations,"" Theodore Orson, the attorney for Central Falls' receiver, said at a recent Bloomberg conference here on municipal finance. Officials leveraged the negotiations, he said, by stating clear goals: the state would not leave Central Falls until there was a plan to balance the budget for five years, and until the public pension and retiree health care systems were sustainable.

Unionized employees and retirees eventually accepted the benefit cuts once they realized the solvency of the pension system was at stake. Orson said, ""We had retirees who had been devastated by the cuts come up to us at the end and say, 'Thank you. This is the first time anyone's been honest with us about our pensions. Even though they will be slimmer, at least we know it's going to be there.'""

As Robert Schleshinger at US New & World Report explains:



DeMint, Cruz and their allies like to pose as champions of ""the American people"" battling against Washington elites trying to tell said populous what it should do. But DeMint here is taking arrogant Washington elitism to a whole new level, essentially telling ""the American people"" that they don't know what they really want or aren't capable of expressing their desires at the ballot box. Pay no mind to that pesky election, DeMint is saying, I know what the country wants better than some group of voters who weren't smart enough to understand esoteric concepts like ""Day one. Job one. Repeal Obamacare."" DeMint thinks he knows what voters want better than voters do. [...] DeMint, Cruz and their tea party pals don't need polls. Their certainty that they have a special knowledge of what America really wants is redolent of former half-term Gov. Sarah Palin's infamous remark about ""the real America"" and ""pro-America areas of this great nation."" It also stems from the same warped view of the country that prompted GOP megadonor Foster Friess to suggest earlier this year that urban votes should be discounted when measuring the size of President Obama's victory. DeMint, Cruz and Palin may well speak for what they view as the ""real America,"" but unfortunately for them they don't get to unskew the country any more than they get to unskew the results of last year's election.

The U.S. economy needs a national policy, not a patchwork of state and local laws. It’s time for a grand bargain on the federal minimum wage, one that recognizes that both sides in this seemingly endless debate have a point. A decent society can afford neither to price entry-level workers out of jobs nor to leave them completely without leverage in the labor market. The first step in reforming the federal minimum wage is to index it to inflation, thus eliminating the need for an act of Congress — and a rehearsal of the shopworn arguments — before every increase. Since there is a national consensus in favor of some minimum wage, if not its precise level, let’s take the politics out of maintaining its purchasing power. Both business and workers would benefit from stability and certainty; a federal minimum that kept up with inflation might also discourage state and local governments from acting separately. The second step is an increase, to make up for some of the purchasing power that has been lost in recent years. House Democrats want $10.10, which is a return to 1968’s all-time high in real terms; President Obama has suggested $9, the 1981 level. Given GOP opposition, neither is politically feasible.

Speaking of the economy, The Washington Post pens an editorial in favor of a national raise in the minimum wage:"

It can be difficult to objectively assess the quality of a state’s management. The economy and standard of living can be affected by decisions made decades ago, forces outside the control of the state’s government and administrators, as well as the government’s own actions.

Every year, 24/7 Wall St. tries to answer this question by conducting an extensive survey of every state. To determine how well states are managed, we examined their financial data, as well as the services they provide and their residents’ standard of living. This year, North Dakota is the best-run state in the country for the second year in a row, while California is the worst-run for the third year in a row.

Identifying appropriate criteria to compare the 50 states can be challenging because they vary so much. Some states have abundant natural resources, while others rely on services or innovation. A few have been burdened by struggling industries. Some are more rural, while others are more urban. Because of such differences, a spending or tax policy that can be beneficial in one state can be disastrous in another.

Many of the best-run states in the nation benefit from an abundance of natural resources. North Dakota, Wyoming, Alaska, and Texas, among the best-run states, are all among the states with the greatest concentration of GDP in the mining industry, which includes activities such as oil and natural gas extraction, as well as coal mining. The presence of this industry benefits states in several ways. North Dakota and Texas led the nation in real GDP growth in 2012, while Alaska has used its oil revenue to establish a permanent fund that pays residents an annual dividend.

The housing crisis has had a major negative impact on a number of the worst-run states. It caused a drastic decline in construction employment in states like Arizona, California, and Nevada. Many of these lost jobs have yet to be replaced. In the hardest-hit states, this has resulted not only in worsening unemployment, but increased poverty and budget shortfalls. Although the economies of these states have largely improved, the residual effects of the housing crisis remain.

While these can be considered extenuating circumstances, the fact is that each state must deal with the cards it is dealt. Governments must plan for worst-case scenarios, including the collapse of an industry. Several resource-rich states have squandered their advantages and rank poorly on our list. Good governance involves raising and spending enough to provide for the well-being of the population without risking the state’s long-term stability.

To determine how well the states are run, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed hundreds of data sets from dozens of sources. We looked at each state’s debt, revenue, expenditure, and deficit to determine how well it was managed fiscally. We reviewed taxes, exports, and GDP growth, including a breakdown by sector, to identify how each state was managing its resources. We looked at poverty, income, unemployment, high school graduation, violent crime and foreclosure rates to assess the well-being of the state’s residents.

While each state is different, the best-run states share certain characteristics, as do the worst run. For example, the populations of the worse-off states tended to have lower standards of living. Violent crime rates in these states were usually higher and residents were much less likely to have a high school diploma.

The worst-run states also tended to have weak fiscal management reflected in higher budget shortfalls and lower credit ratings by Moody’s Investors Service and Standard & Poors.

The better-run states tended to display stable fiscal management. Pensions were more likely to be fully funded, debt was lower, and budget deficits smaller. Credit ratings agencies also were much more likely to rate the well-run states favorably. Only two poorly run states received a perfect credit rating from either agency. California and Illinois, which are ranked worst and third worst, received the lowest ratings from both agencies.

The states that were well-managed also tended to have lower unemployment rates. Eight of the 10 states with the lowest unemployment rates ranked as the best-run states. California, Illinois, and Nevada — the states with the highest unemployment rates as of 2012 — were among the five worst-run states.

Correction: An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated that worst-run states tended to have better fiscal management. They have weak fiscal management.

The left-leaning Public Policy Polling surveyed voters in four key congressional districts, as well as House Speaker John Boehner's (R-Ohio) district, to gauge support for extending unemployment benefits. The poll, funded by the liberal advocacy group Americans United for Change, showed that voters across party lines were overwhelmingly in favor of extending the benefits, with 63 to 68 percent of voters in each district expressing support for preserving jobless benefits.

Voters in the four districts surveyed said they were less likely to vote for the Republican incumbent in 2014 -- by at least a 9-point margin -- were he to vote to cut off extended unemployment benefits.

Though jobless benefits are set to expire on Dec. 28 for 1.3 million longterm unemployed Americans, members of the House and Senate have returned home for the holidays without a solution to preserve those benefits. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has said it was an ""immorality"" that the benefits weren't secured in a recent budget deal, and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) has promised to bring the extension to a vote no later than Jan. 7, 2014.

Moderate Republicans urged Boehner and House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) to rescue jobless benefits for the longterm unemployed earlier in December, saying the issue was ""important to many American families."" But Boehner would only consider the proposal if cuts were made elsewhere and job growth guaranteed, and the measure ultimately did not make it into Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Rep. Paul Ryan's (R-Wis.) budget deal.

""Speaker Boehner and fellow Washington Republicans are hopelessly out-of-touch, and their decision to Scrooge over a million unemployed Americans three days after Christmas is the latest and among the worst examples of it,"" Jeremy Funk, communications director of Americans United for Change, said. ""All these struggling Americans got from the GOP for Christmas was a ‘Get Employed Soon’ card.""

Funk warned cuts to jobless benefits for the longterm unemployed would only put more Americans out of work, and bring a chain reaction of economic fallout in 2014.

""But it’s not just in America’s economic interest to extend [unemployment insurance] benefits, these polls show it’s in swing district Republicans’ own political interest to support the jobless in their districts,"" Funk said. ""Otherwise they just might join their ranks."""

The Tax Policy Center calculated that less than 5 percent of families earning $200,000 to $500,000 will actually pay more.

The size of those increases will be much smaller than President Obama originally proposed. The net effect, according to the center’s estimates, is that the top 1 percent of households will see an average income tax increase this year of $62,000 rather than $94,000. “The high-income people really are doing very well in this compared to what the president wanted to do,” said Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center.

The deal passed by the Senate and the House will impose fewer limits on deductions than the White House plan. It will also tax income from dividends at a flat rate of 20 percent, rather than the same marginal rate as earned income. And there is another important point, often misunderstood: Affluent households will pay the new 39.6 percent rate only on income above $450,000. They and everyone else will still will pay lower rates on income below that threshold.

Households making $500,000 to $1 million will pay an additional $6,700 in taxes on average. Those making more than $1 million will pay an additional $123,000 on average.

Changes in the estate tax will also benefit affluent families. The tax will not apply to the first $5 million of an inheritance, extending the current exclusion rather than reverting to the $3.5 million threshold that President Obama initially favored. However, wealth above that amount will be taxed at a rate of 40 percent rather than the previous rate of 35 percent.

The Obama administration did win a five-year extension of tax breaks for lower-income families, including the child tax credit and earned-income tax credit. Those credits eliminate income tax liability for many lower-income families. In many cases, the government actually makes a direct payment to the family to help offset the burden of payroll taxation — up to $1,000 a child under the child credit and up to $5,900 total under the earned income credit.

The deal will also restore unemployment benefits for about two million Americans. People who can’t find work, and have already received government checks for the standard period of 26 weeks, have been able to stay on the rolls for up to an additional 47 weeks. But financing for that program, which is aimed at the states with the highest unemployment rates, expired Saturday. Under the terms of the deal, people who are eligible will receive any missed benefits retroactively."

It's an outcome that House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) has worked hard to avoid, for the sake of his party's reputation. But Boehner, short on time and tactics, may have no other choice now than to let calamity physics work its will.

For the past week, warnings over the possibility of a shutdown have rung out. Jonathan Chait advised just last week that ""a government shutdown is more likely now"" because the time in which to actually deal-make around it is quickly elapsing. Not that a deal seemed likely. As one source, positioned to suss out the state of negotiations, told Jonathan Cohn, ""The breakdown is more extensive than you've heard ... There is no discussion going on at all at this point.""

And Peter Weber cautions, ""Brace yourselves,"" because everyone's incentives seem to align in such a way that makes a shutdown a fait accompli. President Barack Obama thinks the shutdown will add political capital to his coffers. Democrats believe it will improve their position to bargain on the budget. Tea party Republicans believe the conventional wisdom -- which holds that the GOP's brand loses out in the event of a shutdown -- is wrong, and that they actually have the leverage. The Hill reports that ""at least 43 conservatives want the GOP leadership to go for broke"" over this.

Standing at the center of all of this is House Speaker John Boehner, who has, thus far, attempted to stave off a shutdown on the grounds that it would be bad for the GOP's brand. But he might be all out of options.

His most recent gambit was to try to get the House to pass a continuing resolution to keep the government functioning, with a sidecar resolution attached that would defund Obamacare. The idea is to give his caucus colleagues another chance to vent their disapproval of Obamacare without imperiling the federal government. At the same time, Boehner has extended the notion that there will be time enough for hostage-taking when the debate over the debt ceiling is enjoined. (Of course, there's no indication that Boehner thinks a debt ceiling row would be any better for the GOP than a shutdown, but if his colleagues accepted this plan, he would at the very least buy some time.)

The problem, however, is that the more raucous members of his caucus have rejected Boehner's ""continuing resolution with a side of Obamacare defunding,"" and call this plan a ""sell-out."" Boehner is further hamstrung by the fact that his colleagues have turned the ""Hastert Rule"" -- which holds that the speaker can't bring anything to the floor for a vote without first securing a ""majority of the majority"" -- into official House GOP dogma.

All of this brought Boehner to his lowest point last week, when he vented his frustrations at reporters, saying, ""Do you have an idea? They'll just shoot it down anyway."" So now, as The New Republic's Noam Scheiber posits, Boehner might just let his colleagues take aim at their own collective foot.

Back in March, Scheiber mapped out the strategy that Boehner's been using to move important business through the House and survive -- both as a House speaker and as a guy tasked with keeping his party's standing from collapsing. It goes something like this:

First Boehner stakes out a position so extreme or impractical that he effectively marginalizes himself from any negotiation with Democrats. At that point, Democrats begin to bargain with Boehner's Senate counterpart, Mitch McConnell. Once they strike a deal, it passes the Senate with overwhelming support. This is the cue to Boehner to troop before his caucus and lament that they fought the good fight for as long as they could, but now even their fellow Republicans have turned on them. If it is their will to hold out, then Boehner will obey it. (Always best to give crazy people the illusion of agency.) But he can no longer in good faith recommend this path. Invariably, the lunatics fold.

But with those same lunatics in full revolt against Boehner's continuing resolution gambit, that particular jig is up. So Scheiber now reckons that Boehner has no choice left but to stop treating the symptoms and fully feed the disease:

Now, don’t get me wrong: Boehner clearly prefers to avoid a government shutdown. He's spent months figuring out how to do that, fully aware of the political debacle it would entail. Unfortunately, it's now clear that the only way he can induce the political isolation he typically relies on to prod his caucus into semi-rational action is by shutting down the government and inviting the public backlash he's been so desperate to avoid. Boehner simply has no other way of talking sense into his people, no other hope of making the House GOP governable. And so, in the end, a shutdown is in Boehner's interest, too.

The hopeful possibility here, according to Scheiber, is that now maybe Boehner's GOP antagonists will ""sober up before we take on the substantially higher-stakes proposition of avoiding a debt default."" That would, indeed, be a welcome occurrence.

But contending against this possibility are electoral fundamentals. The GOP goes into the midterm elections with a very strong hand. The vagaries of redistricting, and the fact that the bulk of the Democratic base has sequestered itself into a limited number of urban districts, means that there literally might not be enough votes in the right districts to threaten any of the GOP dead-enders. And a government shutdown may not actually be enough of an apocalypse to alter the underlying electoral plate tectonics.

So there's a good chance that Boehner's plan will simply further tarnish the GOP's standing, without providing sufficient motivation to push his colleagues in a saner direction.

But as Boehner himself has asked, do you have a better idea?

Whether money is taken from you via your phone bill, your airline ticket, or your income, it’s a tax. If politicians can’t be honest about this, it’s time to go home.

The TEA Party’s very acronym stands for “Taxed Enough Already.” We sent these politicians to Congress in an historic landslide election in 2010 with a mandate to stop the runaway spending train bankrupting our nation, not to wave to it from the station or – heaven forbid – increase its speed. And yet, here we are still pretending that there are no real world consequences to running up near trillion dollar deficits year after year with no end in sight.

So, where does this leave us? We can sit back and accept the increased spending “Compromised Plan” with increases in taxes and spending, or we can charge ahead to at least preserve the very modest Sequester cuts American workers already fought for. If we go with the first option, we simply kick the can down the road yet again and wait for the inevitable real world consequences of bankruptcy (see Detroit for an example of what’s in store). Or we can go with the second option and probably get clobbered by the media (so what’s new?!).

The Political Establishment will no doubt tell us that a budget battle will distract us from the fight against Obamacare. But that excuse is just the latest variation in the Establishment’s old canard that they’re keeping their powder dry for the next big battle which never seems to materialize because they’re always too busy waving the white flag and following the path of least resistance until election day.

Enough is enough!

Here’s the deal, folks. The media will clobber us no matter what. We do not want more taxes. We want Congress to rein in spending and live within its means. (What’s so radical about that?!) Americans have gotten quite an education recently in wasteful government spending as we’ve all seen how the federal government can blow a billion dollars on a website that doesn’t work.

Do these members of Congress really think they can justify every tax dollar they spend and still demand more from hard working Americans by increasing our taxes?

2014 is just around the corner. If any member of Congress thinks raising taxes and increasing wasteful spending is a winning strategy to run on, then by all means they should vote for the Ryan budget. We’ll be watching."
