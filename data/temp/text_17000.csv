Knives with locking blades will not be allowed under the new rules.

This presentation outlines changes to the Transportation Security Administration's prohibited items list. Some small knives will be allowed in carry-on luggage starting in April.

Story highlights TSA chief explains factors that went into decision Law enforcement officers' group will ask the TSA to reconsider The changes will allow small knives and some sports equipment in cabins A flight attendant union calls it a ""short-sighted"" decision

(CNN) —

Groups representing federal air marshals and flight attendants – outraged over the Transportation Security Administration’s decision to allow small pocketknives back into aircraft cabins – say they will ask the TSA to reconsider the policy.

Both groups say they learned about the policy change Tuesday, and charged that the TSA is forgetting about the terrorist attacks that led to the formation of the agency.

“It’s as if we didn’t learn anything from 9/11,” said George Randall Taylor, head of the air marshal unit of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association (FLEOA). “Flight attendants are going to be sitting ducks.”

On Tuesday, TSA Administrator John Pistole announced that small pocketknives and an array of sporting equipment – which were banned from aircraft cabins in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks – will be allowed in U.S. planes beginning April 25.

Former TSA chief backs ‘knife’ decision; suggests axes and machetes, too

Pocketknives will be allowed if the blade is no longer than 2.36 inches (6 centimeters), which is shorter than the 4-inch blades that were allowed at the time of the 2001 attacks. And they must adhere to other rules: the blade can be no more than 1/2 inch at its widest point, it cannot have a locking or fixed blade and cannot have a molded grip. Box cutters and razor blades are still not allowed inside the passenger cabin.

The TSA also will allow travelers to bring billiard cues, ski poles, hockey and lacrosse sticks and a maximum of two golf clubs into aircraft cabins as carry-on baggage. It will allow novelty and toy bats if they measure less than 24 inches and plastic bats if they weigh less than 24 ounces.

Some experts say security improvements since the attacks – most notably reinforced cockpit doors, better intelligence and motivated passengers – have made the strict prohibition of small pen-knives unnecessary.

But Taylor said he is “appalled” by the decision, and said air marshals are voicing their opposition to him. “I’ve received probably over a hundred (calls from air marshals). They’re very upset.”

FLEOA President Jon Adler said the dangers extend beyond air marshals. “Pistole’s decision is putting my guys at greater risk,” Adler said. “It’s not just the (Federal Air Marshal Service), it’s all of my guys,” he said, noting that law enforcement officers are allowed to carry weapons during commercial flights.

A union representing 90,000 flight attendants called the measure “a poor and short-sighted decision by the TSA.”

“Continued prohibition of these items is an integral layer in making our aviation system secure and must remain in place,” the Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions said in a statement.

Pistole said the TSA sought to distinguish small pocketknives, such as those equipped with corkscrews, from sturdier knives used primarily as weapons. Screeners seize on average 47 of the smaller knives every day from Los Angeles International Airport alone, he said Tuesday.

Opinion: Is TSA serious about letting people carry knives?

The new rule will allow screeners to focus on finding explosive device components and other things that can be “catastrophic” to a plane, speed trips through security checkpoints and “address the hassle factor,” Pistole said.

Pistole said his agency consulted with its federal air marshals and other experts before making the change, and that led to the continued prohibition of the sturdier knifes with short blades.

“Experts in martial arts and close-quarters combat talked passionately about some of these smaller (knives), even though they’re smaller than 6 centimeters. Some of these knives are primarily weapons and do not serve the similar purpose as what you would call a small pocketknife. Some are for hunters, for skinning; some are simply for weapons. And so those will still remain on the prohibited items list,” Pistole said.

Box cutters are prohibited regardless of blade length, he said.

“I wish (the new rule) could be as clean as possible,” Pistole said. But “there’s just too much emotion associated with particularly the box cutters, so those will not be allowed.”

Although it was widely reported that the 9/11 hijackers used box cutters in their attack, the weapons were not recovered, and investigators believe other types of knives were used.

“Our best working hypothesis is that a number of the hijackers were carrying – permissible under the regulations in place at the time – permissible utility knives or pocket knives,” a commission staff member said at a January 2004 hearing of the 9/11 Commission.

A Leatherman knife was displayed during the hearing. The commission said its investigation found that “at least two knives like this were actually purchased by the hijackers and have not been found in the belongings the hijackers left behind.”

Immediately after the attacks, the TSA prohibited a wide range of items from aircraft cabins. But it has gradually been reintroducing some banned items such as cigarette lighters and matches. On occasion the TSA has expanded the list, as it did after a liquid bomb scare in August 2006 when it prohibited bringing large containers of liquids and gels on board aircraft.

The former Florida governor has a new book on immigration

Some politicians are unhappy with his comments

He previously said Republicans were alienating Hispanic voters

WASHINGTON -- Former Florida governor Jeb Bush is angering Democrats and some in his own party over his opposition to allowing illegal immigrants to attain U.S. citizenship, a stance he reveals in his new book on immigration.

In the 2012 presidential campaign Bush said that the GOP was being ""tone deaf"" on the issue of illegal immigration and what to do about it, saying the Republicans were alienating Hispanic voters.

Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney did not favor amnesty for the estimated 11 million people living in the country illegally. He supported securing the border and improving the ability of businesses to know whether a job applicant was an illegal immigrant, which he said would reduce the number of illegal immigrants who ""self-deport"" because there would be no work for them here.

GOP primary contender Herman Cain suggested, among other things, building a moat on the border to keep people from entering the country illegally.

At the time Bush was saying the government needed to allow illegal immigrants a chance at legal residence and U.S. citizenship. But Bush's new book Immigration Wars said he opposes granting citizenship to illegal immigrants.

In a story that appeared Monday in USA TODAY, he talked about his book and the self-inflicted wounds he thinks cost Republicans a winnable presidential race in 2012. One wound he said was the GOP's poor outreach to fast-growing demographic groups such as Hispanics that he said should be natural allies.

A ""pathway to citizenship"" is an integral part of immigration bills being considered by the White House and bipartisan groups in Congress. Bush explained that his idea is for illegal immigrants who came to the country as adults to attain a level of legal status. But he said that it should not be full U.S. citizenship, arguing that ""those who violated the laws can remain but cannot obtain the cherished fruits of citizenship.""

The idea is one that has been floated in conservative circles as a way to solve the thorny issue of illegal immigration: recognize that millions of illegal immigrants will not leave nor should they be forced to leave, but at the same time do not reward them for breaking U.S. immigration laws.

The Florida Democratic Party said Bush's credibility on immigration has ""vanished."" Senate President Harry Reid, D-Nev., said Bush ""made a fool of himself.""

""Poor Jeb Bush. So far from God and so close to the Tea Party,"" said Rep. Xavier Becerra, D-Calif. ""This is why things are the way they are, because Republicans let themselves be bullied by the most extreme members of their party.""

Republican members of the bipartisan Senate group working on an immigration overhaul bill with Democrats were not pleased with Bush's comments. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said Bush's stance ""undercuts what we're trying to do."" Another member of the group, Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., said he was ""a bit perplexed"" and ""disappointed"" to learn of Bush's approach.

Flake has said that he opposes ""blanket amnesty"" for illegal immigrants. But because of the different components of the bill they are working on with Democrats -- including added border security and a requirement that all U.S. businesses check the immigration status of prospective workers -- Flake and other Republicans in the group agreed to Democrats' priority of granting citizenship to illegal immigrants.

Bush -- the son of one president, brother of another and a possible contender himself for the 2016 race -- took to the airwaves Monday to promote his book and defend his position.

On the Today Show he said many illegal immigrants don't want citizenship and that granting it to those who do want it could open the door for future waves of illegal immigrants.

""Our proposal is a proposal that looks forward. And if we want to create an immigration policy that's going to work, we can't continue to make illegal immigration an easier path than legal immigration,"" Bush told host Matt Lauer, alluding to immigrants who apply legally to come to the United States and often wait several years for citizenship. ""I think it's important that there is a natural friction between our immigrant heritage and the rule of law.""

On MSNBC he suggested he may agree to citizenship or illegal immigrants here already if it was part of a package that sufficiently reduced the magnets for future illegal immigrants.

""If you can craft that in law where you can have a path to citizenship where there isn't an incentive for people to come illegally, I'm for it, I don't have a problem with that,"" Bush told host Joe Scarborough. ""I don't see how you do it, but I'm not smart enough to figure out every aspect of a really complex law."""

Paul Kevin Curtis, a sometime-Elvis impersonator who appeared in a Mississippi federal court Thursday and denied wrongdoing, has penned numerous rants accusing the government of hounding him. Many of his screeds have ended with the same line his letter to President Obama reportedly did: “I am KC and I approve this message.”

An affidavit released by the Department of Justice quotes Curtis’ letters to Obama, Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) and a judge as saying: ""Maybe I have your attention now even if that means someone must die.""

[pullquote]

Curtis has claimed unknown forces blew up his car, interfered in his personal relationships and rigged Elvis impersonation contests. His rants, which have appeared at ripoffreport.com on his Facebook page seem to stem from 2001, when, as a cleaner hired by a morgue, he claims to have found bags of body parts, including a severed head. After reporting his discovery to authorities, Curtis came to believe he was made a “person of interest where my every move was watched and videotaped.”

On Ripoffreport.com, a forum for people to complain about purported scams, a man who identified himself as Curtis detailed in 2007 how the alleged incident began his spiral.

“3 Years of research lead to countless court battles, cops harassing me weekly, death threats, personal & financial losses, several thefts, my home burned down, car exploded, marriage dissolved & bankruptcy,” he wrote.

Curtis claims he sought help from elected officials, including Wicker, who was his congressman prior to being elected to the Senate in 2007. Wicker told CNN he has met Curtis and believed him to have “mental issues.”

Curtis reportedly wrote that he is on the “hidden front lines of a secret war” on his Facebook page hours before federal agents arrested him at his home in Corrinth Wednesday. He is being held in the Lafayette County Detention Center.

“My mother wants me to SHUT UP. My brothers fear me. My sister hates me. . . . I have lost most of my friends,” he wrote. “I have spent more than $130,000 on legal fees in 13.5 years. . . . They destroyed my marriage, they distracted my career, they stalked, they trolled, they came into my home, took my computers, had me arrested 22 times and guess what? I am still a thorn in the corrupt anals! I will remain here until Jesus Christ decides its time for me to go.”

The letters to Obama and Wicker, which bore Memphis postmarks, have tested positive for ricin. The ones sent to Washington were opened in a remote facility and no one appears to have been harmed by them. The FBI has said there is no indication of a connection between the letters and the Monday bombing in Boston that killed three people and injured more than 170. The letters to Obama and Wicker were postmarked April 8, before the marathon."

According to journalist Todd Miller, author of “Border Patrol Nation: Dispatches From the Front Lines of Homeland Security,” the U.S. spent $90 billion on border enforcement in the decade after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. In 2012, the immigration and border enforcement budget was $18 billion. The immigration bill now being debated in Congress would spend an additional $40 billion and would raise the number of Border Patrol agents to 40,000. That is 10 times the number of agents in service in the early 1990s.

The rush to beef up security after 9/11 was driven by the new fear that terrorists would creep into the country and by the longtime concern about thousands of undocumented immigrants sneaking up from Latin America. Arguably, the dramatically increased surveillance and interdiction has contributed to a sharp drop in illegal immigration and, so far, no terrorists have been discovered trying to cross from Mexico or Canada.

But the new, massive round of spending being proposed may have less to do with terrorists or Mexicans -- those concerns seem to have been met -- than with defense contractors who see America’s wars winding down. Border security is a new cash cow for them, and the more security they can sell, the more profit they will make, even if that security is unnecessary and redundant.

Effectively, both our southern and northern borders are already militarized. If even more manpower and equipment are added, we may have a lot of guys with guns without enough to keep them busy. Miller reports that, already, regular citizens in border areas are feeling as if they live in a war zone where random searches are increasingly common and border agents turn up on private property challenging the right of residents to be on their own land.

In 2008, Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy was stopped at a checkpoint 125 miles from the Canadian border, ordered out of his car and asked to prove his citizenship. Leahy said he asked the federal agent who initiated the stop by what authority he was acting. According to the senator, the agent pointed to his gun and said, “That’s all the authority I need.”

This year, Leahy, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, added a provision to the immigration bill that would disallow checkpoint searches beyond a 25-mile distance from the border. “The wide latitude in current law for setting up checkpoints far from our borders has led to maximum hassles of law-abiding local residents, with minimal value to border enforcement,” Leahy said in a statement.

Leahy’s provision, by the way, only applies to the northern border. Law-abiding residents of California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas will get no such relief -- unless, of course, one of their senators gets pulled over for no good reason by any of the thousands of new Border Patrol agents looking for something to do."

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

(CNN) —

The news that Canadian law enforcement on Monday arrested two men accused of planning to derail a passenger train in the Toronto area has attracted much attention, in part, because the plotters are also charged with “receiving support from al Qaeda elements in Iran.”

If these allegations are true, it would appear to be the first time that al Qaeda elements based in Iran have directed some kind of plot in the West.

And it also underlines the perplexing relationship between the Shia theocratic state of Iran, which the Sunni ultra-fundamentalists who make up al Qaeda regard as heretical but with which they have had some kind of a marriage of convenience for many years.

Tim Hetherington for CNN Peter Bergen

While there isn’t evidence that al Qaeda and the Iranian government have ever cooperated on a terrorist attack, al Qaeda’s ties to Iran, surprising perhaps to some, stretch back more than a decade.

As recently as October, the U.S. Treasury named as terrorists six al Qaeda members living in Iran who it alleged were sending fighters and money to Syria to fight Bashar al-Assad’s regime and were also funding terrorism in Pakistan.

Al Qaeda’s Iranian presence began after the fall of the Taliban in Afghanistan during the winter of 2001 when some of Osama bin Laden’s family and his top lieutenants fled to neighboring Iran, where they lived under some form of house arrest.

They included Saif al-Adel, the Egyptian military commander of al Qaeda; Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, bin Laden’s son-in-law and spokesman; and Saad bin Laden, one of the al Qaeda leader’s older sons who has played a leadership role in his father’s organization.

Saad helped bin Laden’s oldest wife, Khairiah bin Laden, and a number of his father’s children to move to Iran in 2002. Bin Laden’s sons Ladin, Uthman and Muhammad and his daughter Fatima, who is married to Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, settled in Tehran, the Iranian capital.

According to Saudi officials, it was from al Qaeda’s leaders in Iran that al Qaeda’s Saudi affiliate received the go-ahead in 2003 for a number of terrorist attacks in Saudi Arabia that killed scores of Saudis and Westerners and targeted Saudi Arabia’s oil infrastructure.

In 2008, al Qaeda kidnapped Heshmatollah Attarzadeh-Niyaki, an Iranian diplomat living in the Pakistani city of Peshawar.

According to a Pakistani intelligence official familiar with the deal, al Qaeda released the diplomat back to Iran in 2010 as part of a negotiation that allowed some of bin Laden’s family and al Qaeda members then living in Iran to leave.

By now, relations between al Qaeda and Iran were tense.

In a letter recovered from the Abbottabad, Pakistan, compound where bin Laden was killed by a U.S. Navy SEAL team two years ago, bin Laden urged caution when his family members traveled out of Iran “since the Iranians are not to be trusted.”

Bin Laden wrote that his family “should be warned about the importance of getting rid of everything they received from Iran like baggage or anything even as small as a needle, as there are eavesdropping chips that have been developed to be so small they can be put inside a medical syringe.”

Last month Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, bin Laden’s son-in-law and one-time al Qaeda spokesman, was brought to a Manhattan courtroom to face charges of conspiracy to kill Americans.

Abu Ghaith left the comparative safety of his longtime refuge in Iran for Turkey earlier this year. Turkey then deported him to his native Kuwait via Jordan, where he was detained by FBI agents who escorted him to New York.

Abu Ghaith and the two suspects just arrested in Canada, 30-year-old Chiheb Esseghaier of Montreal and 35-year-old Raed Jaser of Toronto, will obviously be the subject of much interest from U.S. and Canadian intelligence officials.

Those officials will surely be seeking answers to the precise nature of the Iranian government’s relationship with al Qaeda over the past decade.

Has it been passive acquiescence or more active complicity?

(CNN) – Former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney praised President Barack Obama's remarks on Thursday at an interfaith service remembering victims of the Boston Marathon bombing.

In an interview on CNN's ""The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer,"" Romney also stressed the importance of learning from such terror attacks and opened up about how his faith plays a role in times of crisis.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

""I thought the president gave a superb address to the people of this city and the state and the nation,"" the former Massachusetts governor said. ""It was an inspiring day.""

Romney has deep ties to Boston. He ran his presidential campaign from the city and now serves as a chairman of a committee for the Boston-based Solamere Capital, the investment firm founded by his eldest son, Tagg.

Democratic Gov. Deval Patrick invited Romney to attend the church ceremony, along with other current and former Bay State politicos. Romney and the president did not speak at the event, the former GOP nominee said.

In the interview, Romney repeatedly emphasized a need to learn everything possible from Monday's bombings, which killed three people and injured 180 others.

The FBI released video footage of two suspects on Thursday and asked the public for help in identifying them.

""This is a learning opportunity,"" Romney said. ""We should learn the lessons that come from this and apply them to the extent that we possibly can.""

Asked if he would consider working on a security commission to study the terror attack and design steps to avert future attacks, Romney said he wouldn't turn away from a call to prevent violence.

He pointed to his experience leading the 2002 Winter Olympics and the security measures installed in Salt Lake City.

He also referenced his time serving on the Homeland Security Advisory Council, a panel comprised of a range of leaders from both the private and public sector who advise the secretary of homeland security, under the George W. Bush administration.

""In my heart of hearts, what I understand is, it is intelligence work. And by intelligence, it's not just meaning the CIA and the FBI and wire taps. It is also people who are watching what's going on, reporting what's going on, combing that information such that we can prevent the worse things that are occurring,"" he said.

Romney, who belongs to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, also gave a rare glimpse into his faith and how he sees the role of God and free will

Asked why he thinks bad things happen to good people, he said the only answer he knows for that type of question is to ""get on one's own knees and to pray for understanding and for comfort.""

""I believe very deeply that we have a creator and that he loves us and cares for us. But when he actually intervenes in the affairs of the people on this earth - it's something that happens only rarely - and when that happens and why that happens and who that happens to is something that we don't understand,"" he said.

Romney said he also gains strength from seeing the community come together during tragedy and talked about his visits with injured victims in Boston hospitals on Thursday.

""This is a time when your faith in God is enhanced by seeing the goodness of the men and women He's created,"" he said.

Referring to the interfaith service, Romney said it was an ""inspiring"" and lauded the singing of ""America the Beautiful,"" a song he was known to sometimes sing on the campaign trail.

""It was a hearty rendition.""

Washington (CNN) - The leaders of the House and Senate Intelligence committees said Sunday that terrorists have gained ground in the past two years and that the United States is not any safer than it was at the outset of 2011.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, and Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Michigan, agreed that despite the death of Osama bin Laden and drone strikes aimed at decimating al Qaeda's leadership, President Barack Obama's administration has lost ground in the ongoing battle with global terrorism.

""Are we safer now than we were a year ago, two years ago?"" host Candy Crowley asked Feinstein on CNN's ""State of the Union.""

""I don't think so,"" the Senate Intelligence Committee chairwoman replied.

""I absolutely agree that we're not safer today,"" Rogers added.

Rogers warned that the Obama administration's successes against high-value targets have fostered a false sense of security.

""People think that, well, we've got this thing beat,"" Rogers said. ""And that's just not the case.""

In the wide-ranging joint interview with Crowley, Feinstein and Rogers detailed an international climate growing more hostile toward the United States.

Feinstein said increasingly fundamentalist Islamist groups are gaining power and winning the minds of the disenfranchised in the Middle East and Near Asia.

""I see more groups; more fundamentalist, more jihadist, more determined to kill to get to where they want to get,"" Feinstein said.

As evidence the U.S. is in greater danger, the California lawmaker cited a rise in fatalities from terrorist-related activities and increasingly specialized and dangerous technology available to terrorists. Feinstein specifically highlighted bombs as a growing threat to American security - and not the kind of improvised devices that plagued U.S. armed forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, or rudimentary explosives like the pressure-cooker bomb used by the Boston marathon bombers. She said terror groups had already tried, on four separate occasions, to send these newer, more deadly explosives into the United States.

""There are new bombs, very big bombs, trucks being reinforced for those bombs,"" Feinstain said. ""There are bombs that go through (metal-detecting) magnetometers.""

Rogers said the evolving nature of the terror threat - both an increase in the number of al Qaeda affiliates globally and the group's shifting strategy - has produced an enemy that, even if it’s not outright winning, has disproven Obama's claim the group is ""decimated.""

""Al Qaeda as we knew it before is metastasizing to something different,"" Rogers said.

Rogers said the terrorist network has changed its modus operandi. Rather than placing a premium on sophisticated, simultaneous large-scale terror attacks - like those of September 11, 2001, and embassy bombings throughout the 1990s - the new breed of al Qaeda is more decentralized, he said, something that will make it ""exponentially"" harder to stop the next attack from happening.

""They've now switched to this notion that smaller events are OK, so if you have more smaller events than bigger events, they think that might still lead to their objectives and their goals,"" Rogers said.

Rogers said the potency of the al Qaeda threat comes at a time of heightened scrutiny of the American intelligence apparatus working to root out the next terror events.

""The pressure on our intelligence services to get it right, to prevent an attack, are enormous,"" Rogers said.

Rogers said a wave of disclosures about U.S. intelligence collection - revelations prompted by leaks from former NSA contractor Edward Snowden - has turned public opinion against agencies that are working to defend the United States.

""Our intelligence services are not the bad guys,"" Rogers said.

Rogers said the disclosures are not just a source of consternation among counterterrorism officials, but also a serious risk to national security. In describing the headaches posed by the drips from Snowden's spigot of classified documents detailing National Security Agency operations, Rogers said the revelations about the agency's methods of surveillance have already prompted three al Qaeda affiliates to change the way they communicate. With every disclosure, he said, it becomes more and more likely that a planned attack will slip through the intelligence web.

""I can't tell the thousands of man-hours they have spent trying to prepare people to understand fact from fiction, what is happening versus what is not happening,"" Rogers said."

USA TODAY

Two federal district courts to consider injunctions this week

Separate Supreme Court challenge won%27t be heard by justices

Judges could put temporary stop to government snooping

WASHINGTON — The federal government's once-secret telephone and Internet surveillance programs face crucial court hearings in Washington and New York this coming week, but the Supreme Court won't reconsider the decisions of a secret federal court.

The challenges, brought by liberal, conservative and privacy watchdog groups, raise the prospect that a federal judge could order at least a temporary halt to the National Security Agency's snooping on millions of Americans.

U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon on Monday will hear former Reagan administration lawyer Larry Klayman's request for preliminary injunctions against both of the government's major surveillance programs. One sweeps up telephone companies' data from domestic call records, even though the targets are foreign terrorists. The other goes after cellphone and computer data from major wireless companies and Internet service providers.

""This whole NSA thing unites both political ideologies,"" Klayman says. ""The whole country is outraged.""

Four days later, U.S. District Judge William Pauley will hear the American Civil Liberties Union's request for a preliminary injunction against the telephone surveillance program. The ACLU case, based on First and Fourth Amendment protections of speech and privacy, contends that the USA Patriot Act does not authorize such widespread spying.

""Neither the statute nor the Constitution permits the government to engage in that kind of dragnet surveillance of hundreds of millions of people who haven't done anything wrong,"" says Jameel Jaffer, the ACLU's deputy legal director.

A third case denied Monday by the Supreme Court was brought directly there by the Electronic Privacy Information Center. While the target in the other cases is the government, EPIC went after the top-secret court that authorized the surveillance of Verizon phone records under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.

""The FISA court exceeded its authority under current law,"" says Marc Rotenberg, the group's executive director. His brief to the court noted that everyone — even Supreme Court justices — could be swept up in the phone surveillance program.

The Supreme Court request was considered a long shot because the justices rarely accept cases that don't filter up from lower courts. Rotenberg noted that only the Supreme Court can review the FISA court's actions, but the justices declined.

In all the cases, the Justice Department argued that the challengers lack standing to bring the lawsuits because they were not directly involved or cannot prove their records were examined.

The solicitor general's briefs also defend the surveillance on national security grounds. Its Supreme Court brief says the program ""authorizes the production of business records where there are 'reasonable grounds to believe' that the records are 'relevant' to an authorized and properly predicated ongoing FBI investigation of specific terrorist organizations.""

Amnesty International and other civil libertarians brought the last Supreme Court challenge to government surveillance programs in 2012. But in February, the justices ruled 5-4 that the challengers lacked standing because they could not prove they had been wiretapped.

""This theory of future injury is too speculative,"" Justice Samuel Alito said in announcing the decision, calling it ""hypothetical future harm.""

Since then, however, leaks from former NSA contractor Edward Snowden have led the government to make much of the programs public, enabling challengers to claim their privacy was invaded.

The person with the most direct claim may be Jamshid Muhtorov, 35, a refugee from Uzbekistan living in Aurora, Colo. His lawyers were told last month by the Justice Department that terrorism-related charges against him stemmed from the warrantless surveillance program.

Muhtorov was arrested in January 2012 on a charge of providing and attempting to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization. The FBI alleged that he planned to travel overseas and fight on behalf of the Pakistan-based Islamist Jihad Union, which has conducted suicide attacks in Uzbekistan and claims responsibility for attacks against coalition forces in Afghanistan.

Based on the insistence of Solicitor General Donald Verrilli, the Justice Department plans to notify other criminal defendants as well when their charges are based on warrantless surveillance. That makes the prospect of a future Supreme Court case more likely.

""All of these cases are different vehicles for trying to get into the courts the issue about large-scale electronic surveillance and the Constitution,"" says Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional law professor and founding dean at the University of California-Irvine School of Law."

Knives with locking blades will not be allowed under the new rules.

This presentation outlines changes to the Transportation Security Administration's prohibited items list. Some small knives will be allowed in carry-on luggage starting in April.

Story highlights TSA chief explains factors that went into decision Law enforcement officers' group will ask the TSA to reconsider The changes will allow small knives and some sports equipment in cabins A flight attendant union calls it a ""short-sighted"" decision

(CNN) —

Groups representing federal air marshals and flight attendants – outraged over the Transportation Security Administration’s decision to allow small pocketknives back into aircraft cabins – say they will ask the TSA to reconsider the policy.

Both groups say they learned about the policy change Tuesday, and charged that the TSA is forgetting about the terrorist attacks that led to the formation of the agency.

“It’s as if we didn’t learn anything from 9/11,” said George Randall Taylor, head of the air marshal unit of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association (FLEOA). “Flight attendants are going to be sitting ducks.”

On Tuesday, TSA Administrator John Pistole announced that small pocketknives and an array of sporting equipment – which were banned from aircraft cabins in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks – will be allowed in U.S. planes beginning April 25.

Former TSA chief backs ‘knife’ decision; suggests axes and machetes, too

Pocketknives will be allowed if the blade is no longer than 2.36 inches (6 centimeters), which is shorter than the 4-inch blades that were allowed at the time of the 2001 attacks. And they must adhere to other rules: the blade can be no more than 1/2 inch at its widest point, it cannot have a locking or fixed blade and cannot have a molded grip. Box cutters and razor blades are still not allowed inside the passenger cabin.

The TSA also will allow travelers to bring billiard cues, ski poles, hockey and lacrosse sticks and a maximum of two golf clubs into aircraft cabins as carry-on baggage. It will allow novelty and toy bats if they measure less than 24 inches and plastic bats if they weigh less than 24 ounces.

Some experts say security improvements since the attacks – most notably reinforced cockpit doors, better intelligence and motivated passengers – have made the strict prohibition of small pen-knives unnecessary.

But Taylor said he is “appalled” by the decision, and said air marshals are voicing their opposition to him. “I’ve received probably over a hundred (calls from air marshals). They’re very upset.”

FLEOA President Jon Adler said the dangers extend beyond air marshals. “Pistole’s decision is putting my guys at greater risk,” Adler said. “It’s not just the (Federal Air Marshal Service), it’s all of my guys,” he said, noting that law enforcement officers are allowed to carry weapons during commercial flights.

A union representing 90,000 flight attendants called the measure “a poor and short-sighted decision by the TSA.”

“Continued prohibition of these items is an integral layer in making our aviation system secure and must remain in place,” the Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions said in a statement.

Pistole said the TSA sought to distinguish small pocketknives, such as those equipped with corkscrews, from sturdier knives used primarily as weapons. Screeners seize on average 47 of the smaller knives every day from Los Angeles International Airport alone, he said Tuesday.

Opinion: Is TSA serious about letting people carry knives?

The new rule will allow screeners to focus on finding explosive device components and other things that can be “catastrophic” to a plane, speed trips through security checkpoints and “address the hassle factor,” Pistole said.

Pistole said his agency consulted with its federal air marshals and other experts before making the change, and that led to the continued prohibition of the sturdier knifes with short blades.

“Experts in martial arts and close-quarters combat talked passionately about some of these smaller (knives), even though they’re smaller than 6 centimeters. Some of these knives are primarily weapons and do not serve the similar purpose as what you would call a small pocketknife. Some are for hunters, for skinning; some are simply for weapons. And so those will still remain on the prohibited items list,” Pistole said.

Box cutters are prohibited regardless of blade length, he said.

“I wish (the new rule) could be as clean as possible,” Pistole said. But “there’s just too much emotion associated with particularly the box cutters, so those will not be allowed.”

Although it was widely reported that the 9/11 hijackers used box cutters in their attack, the weapons were not recovered, and investigators believe other types of knives were used.

“Our best working hypothesis is that a number of the hijackers were carrying – permissible under the regulations in place at the time – permissible utility knives or pocket knives,” a commission staff member said at a January 2004 hearing of the 9/11 Commission.

A Leatherman knife was displayed during the hearing. The commission said its investigation found that “at least two knives like this were actually purchased by the hijackers and have not been found in the belongings the hijackers left behind.”

Immediately after the attacks, the TSA prohibited a wide range of items from aircraft cabins. But it has gradually been reintroducing some banned items such as cigarette lighters and matches. On occasion the TSA has expanded the list, as it did after a liquid bomb scare in August 2006 when it prohibited bringing large containers of liquids and gels on board aircraft.

On Hagel: Powell is a big fan. ""He's had a very, very distinguished public service record that he can stand on,"" Powell said. Powell said he believes Hagel will be confirmed after he's given a chance to respond to questions at his hearing with the Senate. ""I think he gets confirmed,"" Powell said. ""I've read some of the responses that he's already put together, and I think he will make a very, very spirited defense of his position. And I think he'll be confirmed."" Powell defended Hagel's support for the state of Israel. ""There are people who are very supportive of the state of Israel,"" Powell said. ""I'm very supportive of the state of Israel. So is Senator Hagel, and you'll see that in the confirmation hearings, but it doesn't mean you have to agree with every single position that the Israeli government takes."" He also defended Hagel from accusations of anti-Semitism. ""When they go over the edge and say because Chuck said 'Jewish lobby' he's anti-Semitic, that's disgraceful,"" Powell said.

On racism in the GOP: It's bad. ""There's also a dark vein of intolerance in some parts of the party,"" Powell said. ""What do I mean by that? What I mean by that is they still sort of look down on minorities."" Powell pointed to Sarah Palin's controversial 'shuckin' and jivin'' remark, and Romney surrogate John Sununu saying the President was 'lazy' in the first debate. ""He didn't say he was slow, he was tired, he didn't do well; he said he was 'lazy,'"" Powell said ""Now, it may not mean anything to most Americans, but to those of us who are African Americans, the second word is ""shiftless,"" and then there's a third word that goes along with it."" Powell also chided the Republican party for even allowing the birther movement to exist. ""The whole birther movement: Why do senior Republican leaders tolerate this kind of discussion within the party?"" Powell asked. ""I think the party has to take a look at itself."" Powell blamed a hard shift to the right for the party's recent down spell. ""In recent years, there's been a significant shift to the right, and we have seen what that shift has produced: two losing presidential campaigns,"" Powell said. ""I think what the Republican Party needs to do now is take a very hard look at itself and understand that the country has changed. The country is changing demographically. And if the Republican Party does not change along with that demographic, they're going to be in trouble."" But he did have idea about what they could do in the future to change their fortunes, namely education, immigration and climate change policy. ""Everybody wants to talk about, 'Who's going to be the candidate?'"" Powell said. ""You've got to think first about what's the party actually going to represent? If it's just going to represent the far right wing of the political spectrum, I think the party is in difficulty. I'm a moderate, but I'm still a Republican.""

On gun control: Powell seemed to be in favor of an assault weapons ban. He said he is a gun owner and he is familiar with the Second Amendment, but that there still needs to some kind of restrictions in place to stop dangerous people from getting their hands on powerful guns. ""I see no need for Bushmasters in the hands of an individual person who might be deranged,"" Powell said. ""You want to fire a Bushmaster, go out to a range and fire a Bushmaster. But whether or not it's in our overall interest to have these kinds of weapons in the hands of Americans who might not be responsible is a question we have to answer. How much are we really giving up if we said that this kind of weapon should not be readily available to anybody who wants to buy one?"" He also seemed to support a more complex gun registry, and an increase in required background checks. ""Surely we should be able to find some meeting of the minds on this issue,"" Powell said. ""Why can't we test everybody, or have everybody run through a screen to make sure that they're a responsible person before they're allowed to buy a weapon, either in a store or in a private transaction? Why can't we do a better job of registering things?""

John McCain and Joe Manchin wouldn't say whether they were going to support Chuck Hagel in his Senate hearing on CBS's Face the Nation. Manchin is scheduled to have a one-on-one with Hagel soon, which should help Manchin make up his mind. ""He's coming in next week to speak with me,"" Manchin said. ""I look forward to that. Manchin said he plans on asking Hagel about Israel, the Iraq War, Iran and Afghanistan. Host Bob Schieffer asked McCain if he would be voting against Hagel. ""No, nor would I vote for him,"" McCain said. ""This is why we have hearings."" Hagel and McCain used to be close friends on the hill, but they've suffered from a falling out in recent years. ""My questions about him, and they will be raised in the Senate, are, what his view of America's role in the world?"" McCain said. ""Whether he really believes that the surge was the worst blunder since the Vietnam War? That clearly - that's not correct. In fact, it's bizarre. Why would he oppose calling the Iranian revolutionary guard a terrorist organization?""

Sen. Kelly Ayotte told Fox News Sunday's Chris Wallace she's confused by the President's choosing Chuck Hagel as his nominee for Secretary of Defense. ""I'm very troubled,"" Ayotte said. ""I think that the hearings on this nomination are going to be consequential. I have not made up my mind, but here's where we are. You put up his prior positions. It makes we wonder - it perplexes me why the president nominated Sen. Hagel."" One of her biggest concerns involves how Iran took the news of Hagel's nomination. ""Iran this week kind of reacted favorably somewhat,"" Ayotte said. ""There were some statements that were favorable to his nomination. In fact, they said they were hopeful that with his nomination, they hoped that we would change our policies. What I want to make sure is that Iran is actually not hopeful, but they're fearful as a result of our nominee from the secretary of defense perspective because I think that will cause them to stop marching toward acquiring a nuclear weapon."" When Wallace asked if Ayotte was leaning towards voting against Hagel, she would only say that Hagel ""has a lot of questions to answer.""

Sen. Bob Corker brought up a new concern about Hagel's nomination on ABC's This Week: Hagels's temper. Apparently a number of his former aides have come forward to Corker to speak about how he handled things in the office. ""There are number of staffers who are coming forth now just talking about how he dealt with them,"" Corker said. Corker wants the Senate to consider whether Hagel is fit to manage an organization as stressful and complex as the Pentagon. But Corker will get his own one-on-one time with Hagel when the two meet to discuss things this week. Hagel reached out to him to set up a meeting. ""He's coming in to see me next week, this is going to be a whole process,"" Corker said.

NRA President David Keene thinks the current state of Congress is going to protect him from Dianne Feinstein's proposed assault weapons ban. ""I would say that the likelihood is that there not going to be able to get an assault weapons ban through this Congress,"" David Keene told Candy Crowley on CNN's State of the Union. Keene did concede the President could spend some political capital and get the bill through. When asked if the NRA was trying to ""gin up"" second amendment fear to increase gun sales, Keena blamed the President and Feinstein. ""The two people who were selling so called assault rifles are Sen. Feinstein and President Obama,"" Keene said. ""They're the ones scaring people, not us.""

Newark Mayor Cory Booker said he's still not sure whether he will run for Senate in 2014 or not. ""That's my intention, but it's over a year away,"" Booker said on NBC's Meet the Press. ""A lot could change between now and then."" So, Booker wouldn't come out and confirm that he is running, despite already filing paperwork to start a campaign. ""I'm not ruling out anything right now but it's premature to be speculative,"" Booker said. ""You have to file the papers even to do research on the issue."" Booker did rule out taking on Gov. Chris Christie in what would surely be a losing battle."

The agreement would bolster efforts by the Pentagon to rebalance American military forces across the Asia-Pacific region and by the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, to raise his country’s strategic posture and check the growing military influence of China.

An official document approving a landfill on which much of the base would be built was stamped by the governor of Okinawa, Hirokazu Nakaima, and sent to the local branch of the Ministry of Defense, Kanako Shimada, a prefectural official, said on Friday.

Napolitano will be the next president of the University of California system

President Obama praises her response to threats%2C from hurricanes to terrorism



Napolitano will stay at her post until September

Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, who has handled hot-button issues ranging from immigration to counter-terrorism, said Friday she is resigning to run the University of California and its system of colleges.

""I thank President Obama for the chance to serve our nation during this important chapter in our history,"" Napolitano said in a statement. ""And I know the Department of Homeland Security will continue to perform its important duties with the honor and focus that the American public expects.""

Obama praised Napolitano's performance during four-and-a-half years at the Department of Homeland Security, noting that its responsibilities during her tenure ranged from the Joplin tornado to Hurricane Sandy, as well as efforts to thwart terrorism.

""Since day one, Janet has led my administration's effort to secure our borders, deploying a historic number of resources, while also taking steps to make our immigration system fairer and more consistent with our values,"" Obama said. ""And the American people are safer and more secure thanks to Janet's leadership in protecting our homeland against terrorist attacks.""

White House spokesman Jay Carney noted that Napolitano will stay at her post until September, and that Obama will be ""very deliberate"" in selecting a successor.

A prominent senator -- Democrat Charles Schumer of New York -- has already floated one name, New York City Police Commissioner Ray Kelly.

Her resignation caught many in Washington by surprise -- Napolitano has often been mentioned as a potential successor to Attorney General Eric Holder.

Some Republicans and others criticized Napolitano over immigration policies, citing a de-emphasis on prosecutions against suspects believed to be in the United States illegally. Napolitano also backed a plan to end deportations against young people who lacked legal status.

Napolitano and supporters said limited law enforcement resources should focus on threats to public safety and national security.

Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., said Napolitano's tenure has been marked ""by a consistent disrespect for the rule of law,"" and that ""the most significant obstacle to immigration reform remains President Obama's selective enforcement of the law.""

Others, however, pointed to record numbers of deportations on Napolitano's watch. Chris Newman, legal director for the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, said, ""we are pleased to see her go.""

Sessions and other critics have also faulted Napolitano's department for failing to be transparent about border security and the botched ""Fast and Furious"" gun running investigation.

Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said he and his fellow Arizonan ""have had our share of disagreements"" over the years, ""but I have never doubted her integrity, work ethic, or commitment to our nation's security.""

Napolitano, a former governor of Arizona, is only the third person to lead the Department of Homeland Security, created a decade ago in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. She held the job throughout Obama's first term.

DHS employees ""serve on the front lines of our nation's efforts to protect our communities and families from harm,"" Napolitano said, and working with them ""has been the highlight of my professional career.""

She said her department ""has improved the safety of travelers; implemented smart steps that make our immigration system more fair and focused while deploying record resources to protect our nation's borders; worked with states to build resiliency and make our nation's emergency and disaster response capabilities more robust; and partnered with the private sector to improve our cybersecurity.""

The University of California regents who run a 10-campus college system confirmed Napolitano's new appointment in a statement, praising her as someone who has run large public agencies and has a deep interest in improving higher education.

Chosen over more than 300 other potential candidates, Napolitano will be the 20th president of the University of California.

""While some may consider her to be an unconventional choice, Secretary Napolitano is without a doubt the right person at the right time to lead this incredible university,"" said a statement from Sherry Lansing, the regent and former film industry executive who headed the search committee.

Added Lansing: ""She will bring fresh eyes and a new sensibility — not only to UC, but to all of California. She will stand as a vigorous advocate for faculty, students and staff at a time when great changes in our state, and across the globe, are presenting as many opportunities as challenges.""

In her statement, Napolitano said that in her new job she wants ""to play a role in educating our nation's next generation of leaders."""

The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

D’Amato, a New York Republican, and Benjamin Abrams, a former top aide to Representative Steny H. Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat and House minority whip, have already been pressing Homeland Security officials and lawmakers on behalf of their clients, efforts that have been backed up with millions of dollars of industry campaign contributions.

Homeland Security would have to decide, in consultation with Congress, how to divide the money — on long-range cameras, radar systems, mobile surveillance equipment, aircraft or lower-tech solutions like more border agents or physical fences — decisions that would determine how various contractors might fare.

“It has been a tough time for the industry: people have been laid off or furloughed,” said James P. Creaghan, a lobbyist who represents a small Texas company, Personal Defense, which is trying to sell more night-vision goggles to Homeland Security. “This could help out.”

Northrop has won some important allies on Capitol Hill, including Senator Thomas R. Carper, Democrat of Delaware, the chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, who is urging the department to invest more in Northrop’s drone-mounted surveillance system, called Vader. General Atomics, which Mr. D’Amato represents, has so much support in Congress that it has pressed Homeland Security in recent years to buy more Predator drones than the department has the personnel to operate, so they often sit unused, according to an agency audit.

The specific requirement in the legislation now before the Senate is that Homeland Security must install surveillance equipment or other measures that would allow it to apprehend or turn back 9 out of 10 people trying to illegally enter across all sectors of the southern land border. The department would be prohibited from moving ahead with the “pathway to citizenship” for immigrants already in the United States until this new security strategy is “substantially operational.”

The bill is scheduled to be taken up for debate on the Senate floor next week, and certain Republicans have already drafted amendments that would make the requirement even more demanding, explicitly mandating that the 90 percent standard be achieved before the pathway to citizenship can proceed."

AFL-CIO%2C U.S. Chamber accord would create W-Visa

Bipartisan groups in Senate and House have been writing own bills

Program would start granting visas in April 2015 and expand each year

WASHINGTON — Key senators welcomed an agreement Sunday by business and labor that would remove a large hurdle to a major immigration overhaul, but they cautioned that much work remains to be done and that no final deal has been reached.

The compromise between officials at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the AFL-CIO would create a ""W-Visa"" program that would bring in up to 200,000 foreign workers a year to do janitorial, hospitality and construction work.

As outlined Saturday by the AFL-CIO, the nation's largest labor union, the plan would establish a Bureau of Immigration and Labor Market Research to make recommendations on changes to the number of visas for low-skilled workers the country gives out each year.

The accord addresses one of the biggest issues facing legislators negotiating a sweeping immigration bill that would legalize the nation's 11 million illegal immigrants, strengthen border security and change the way the United States grants visas.

""We have created a new model, a modern visa system that includes both a bureau to collect and analyze labor market data, as well as significant worker protections,"" AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said in a statement. ""We expect that this new program, which benefits not just business, but everyone, will promote long overdue reforms by raising the bar for existing programs.""

Bipartisan groups in the Senate and House who have been writing their own bills are hurrying to file their bills in early April, and President Obama has supported their efforts to move quickly on the complicated topic.

The group of senators negotiating an immigration bill, known as the Gang of 8, had asked business and labor to forge a compromise on this issue but has not officially signed off on the agreement.

""This issue has always been the deal breaker on immigration reform, but not this time,"" said Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who has been involved in the current immigration deal and several failed efforts in the past.

Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., one of the Gang of 8, said Sunday he was encouraged by the agreement but called it simply a starting point in the long legislative process that lies ahead.

""We will need a healthy public debate that includes committee hearings and the opportunity for other senators to improve our legislation with their own amendments,"" Rubio said in a statement.

""We haven't signed off,"" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.

""There are a few details yet. But conceptually, we have an agreement between business and labor, between ourselves that has to be drafted,"" he said.

One of the biggest sticking points in the talks has been how much the foreign workers would be paid. Labor officials have been fearful that low salaries paid to the foreign workers would bring down wages for American workers.

Ava Avendaño, the AFL-CIO's director of immigration and community action, said the two sides agreed that the foreign workers would be paid the higher of the prevailing industry wage, or the actual wages paid by the employer to other workers with similar experience and qualifications.

The W-Visa Program would start April 1, 2015, and grant 20,000 visas in the first year. That would increase to 35,000 available visas in the second year, 55,000 visas in the third year and 75,000 in the fourth, Avendaño said. After that, the program would grow, or shrink, based on recommendations of the newly created immigration bureau.

The deal ensures that small businesses have access to the workers and limits the number of W-Visas that can be granted to construction companies.

Once granted a W-Visa, workers would be able to switch between U.S. employers — a possibility that does not exist under current law — and stay in the USA year-round. They would also be able to apply for legal permanent residence, or green cards, on their own. Current law requires employers to do that on their behalf.

Frank Sharry, executive director of America's Voice, a group that supports an immigration plan that would legalize the nation's undocumented immigrants, called the agreement a ""historic breakthrough"" that significantly increases the likelihood of an immigration plan passing Congress.

""It is the first time in our generation that the AFL-CIO and the Chamber of Commerce have come to terms on a new worker program,"" Sharry said Saturday. ""We applaud labor and business for devising a 'break the mold' approach that carefully balances the need to protect native-born and immigrant workers alike with the desire of employers to access foreign workers when legitimately needed."""

It has reached a boil, especially concerning border security, at a moment when illegal entries are at a 40-year low and net immigration from Mexico has recently been approximately zero, largely because enforcement efficiency has already been substantially improved and because America’s economic growth is inferior to Mexico’s. Yet some Senate Republicans support spending $46 billion over 10 years to, among other things, double the number of border agents.

The Government Accountability Office says border security in 2011 was about 84 percent effective. A much-discussed aspiration is 90 percent. So the $46 billion is supposed to purchase a six-point improvement. This embarrassing militarization of the border was designed to entice a few of the 14 Senate Republicans (of 46) who joined all Democrats in supporting the Senate bill. Some senators expect House Republicans to be swayed because a minority of the Senate minority supported the bill. These senators should trek to the other side of the Capitol and, like Margaret Mead among the Samoans, mingle with the natives.

On a Friday, the Senate received a 114-page amendment to the (by then) more than 1,000-page “Gang of Eight” bill, which the Senate passed the following Thursday. Senators can repent at leisure after they read details such as: Never mind what maps say, the Senate says Nevada is a border state. So Majority Leader Harry Reid’s constituents, and those of Nevada’s Republican Sen. Dean Heller, who supported the bill, can feast on border-security pork.

Such provisions reflect an imperative of legislating in a continental nation. Because durable, principle-based congressional majorities are rare, legislation often becomes large and complex through the process of cobbling together a coalition of legislators more attuned to parochial interests than philosophical arguments. Logrolling is necessary to this process, but it necessarily reduces the moral momentum of the final product.

Whatever momentum the Senate imparted to reform is a wasted asset. The House is unlikely to complete its immigration legislation before the August recess, when Republican members will return to their districts, about which the Wall Street Journal says: Only 38 of 234 House Republicans — 16 percent — represent districts that are at least 20 percent Hispanic. And “only 28 Republican-held districts are considered even remotely at risk of being contested by a Democratic challenger.” Democrats will not accept a bill that does not provide a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, and in a recent poll, almost half of Republicans said they were less likely to support a legislator who supports a pathway.

Four Augusts ago, Congress was busy passing — in order to find out what was in it — a different mammoth, because “comprehensive,” bill. During the August 2009 recess, legislators conducted often-tumultuous town hall meetings, where they discovered that intensity resided disproportionately among opponents of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). Opponents’ anger was registered emphatically in congressional elections 15 months later, which is one reason why implementation of the act’s most onerous provisions was delayed until 2014, after the 2012 presidential election.

The PPACA remains unpopular, and there are congressional elections in years divisible by two — not even the Obama administration can ignore that constitutional fact — so last Tuesday, the administration said this about the act’s mandate that in 2014, large employers provide expensive health-care coverage for their workers or pay a substantial penalty: Never mind.

Although the Constitution has no Article VIII, the administration acts as though there is one that reads: “Notwithstanding all that stuff in other articles about how laws are made, if a president finds a law politically inconvenient, he can simply post on the White House Web site a notice saying: Never mind.”

Never mind that the law stipulates 2014 as the year when employers with 50 full-time workers are mandated to offer them health-care coverage or pay fines. Instead, 2015 will be the year. Unless Democrats see a presidential election coming.

This lesson in the Obama administration’s approach to the rule of law is pertinent to the immigration bill, which at last count had 222 instances of a discretionary “may” and 153 of “waive.” Such language means that were the Senate bill to become law, the executive branch would be able to do pretty much as it pleases, even to the point of saying about almost anything: Never mind.

He Has Previously Served As The Post'S National Editor""]",Petraeus’s role in drafting Benghazi talking points raises questions,"The controversy over the Obama administration’s response to the Benghazi attack last year began at a meeting over coffee on Capitol Hill three days after the assault.

It was at this informal session with the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence that the ranking Democrat asked David H. Petraeus, who was CIA director at the time, to ensure that committee members did not inadvertently disclose classified information when talking to the news media about the attack.

“We had some new members on the committee, and we knew the press would be very aggressive on this, so we didn’t want any of them to make mistakes,” Rep. C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger (Md.) said last week of his request in an account supported by Republican participants. “We didn’t want to jeopardize sources and methods, and we didn’t want to tip off the bad guys. That’s all.”

What Petraeus decided to do with that request is the pivotal moment in the controversy over the administration’s Benghazi talking points. It was from his initial input that all else flowed, resulting in 48 hours of intensive editing that congressional Republicans cite as evidence of a White House coverup.

A close reading of recently released government e-mails that were sent during the editing process, and interviews with senior officials from several government agencies, reveal Petraeus’s early role and ambitions in going well beyond the committee’s request, apparently to produce a set of talking points favorable to his image and his agency.

The information Petraeus ordered up when he returned to his Langley office that morning included far more than the minimalist version that Ruppersberger had requested. It included early classified intelligence assessments of who might be responsible for the attack and an account of prior CIA warnings — information that put Petraeus at odds with the State Department, the FBI and senior officials within his own agency.

The only government entity that did not object to the detailed talking points produced with Petraeus’s input was the White House, which played the role of mediator in the bureaucratic fight that at various points included the CIA’s top lawyer and the agency’s deputy director expressing opposition to what the director wanted.

“What [committee members] were looking for was the lowest common denominator,” said a senior administration official, one of several who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the editing process. “That’s not what the agency originally produced.”

Petraeus did not respond to e-mailed requests to clarify questions surrounding his role in drafting and reviewing the talking points. He resigned as CIA director in November after details of an extramarital affair became public.

The attack

At 9:42 p.m. Sept. 11, 2012, as violent anti-American demonstrations unfolded across the Middle East and North Africa over an anti-Islam video made in the United States, a group of armed men attacked the U.S. diplomatic compound in the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi, killing Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans.

Recriminations in Washington began within hours. But it was not until a month later that it became clear that the CIA, rather than the State Department, maintained the most significant presence in Benghazi.

Near the diplomatic outpost was a CIA installation where about two dozen intelligence and security personnel were based. Their mission was to track weapons shipments out of the country and to identify the numerous militias operating in Benghazi.

Security at this annex was the responsibility of the CIA, not the State Department. But because the annex operated under diplomatic cover, its existence as an intelligence facility was classified.

The State Department and the White House became the primary focus of the public criticism.

The debate within the CIA

After Petraeus’s morning coffee on Sept. 14, the CIA’s Office of Terrorism Analysis sent an internal agency e-mail with the subject line: “FLASH coordination — white paper for HPSCI,” referring to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.

The committee “has asked for unclassified points immediately that they can use in talking to the media,” the e-mail said.

Then, shifting into the first person, the office’s director, who had accompanied Petraeus to the coffee, wrote, “I have been asked to provide a bit on responsibility,” including “warnings we gave to Cairo prior to the demonstration, as well as material on warnings we issued prior to 9/11 anniversary.”

Included was a six-point draft that began, “We believe based on currently available information that the attacks in Benghazi were spontaneously inspired” by anti-American demonstrations elsewhere “and evolved” into assaults against “the U.S. consulate and subsequently its annex.”

It followed with a reference to previous attacks against foreign interests in Benghazi and a mention of Ansar al-Sharia, a terrorist organization with links to al-Qaeda. That information, put in at Petraeus’s request, would become the chief source of tension between the agency, the State Department and the FBI.

Fifteen minutes after that e-mail, the CIA’s Office of Congressional Affairs sent its own internal message, with the subject line: “Due-Outs from HPSCI coffee.”

The first item for the committee was a “white paper” on media guidance — the talking points that would emerge a few hours later.

In addition, the e-mail listed two items “For DCIA,” a reference to Petraeus. That request included “Cable(s) to [redacted] warning of protests linked to the film and response” and “cable(s) to stations on 9/11 security.”

Republicans would later contend that the CIA had wanted to tell the truth about what unfolded that day but that the State Department, with White House support, removed the information for political reasons amid a heated presidential campaign.

But the e-mails reveal that the initial talking points also generated tension and confusion within the CIA, as officials sought to understand how Petraeus’s requests squared with what the committee had asked for.

Stephen W. Preston, the CIA’s general counsel, was among those most concerned with the first draft.

In an internal agency e-mail at 4:24 p.m. that Friday, he acknowledged that “there is a hurry to get this out.” The talking points should not “conflict with express instructions” from the National Security Council, the FBI and the Justice Department, he wrote, and that “in light of the criminal investigation, we are not to generate statements with assessments as to who did this.”

Although Ansar al-Sharia had quickly backed off an initial assertion of responsibility for the Benghazi attack, the group did not deny that some of its members were involved.

But its likely involvement was a classified matter, senior administration officials said, and the FBI had objected to including the information in the talking points on the grounds that doing so would undermine its investigation of the attack.

“I am copying the CIA front office,” Preston wrote, referring to Petraeus’s department, “who may be more familiar with those instructions and the tasking arising from the HPSCI coffee.”

Less than an hour later, the agency sent the talking points, which had been strengthened to include repeated CIA security warnings, to the White House and other agencies for review. The reference to Ansar remained in the draft, as did a line particularly beneficial to the CIA.

“The Agency has produced numerous pieces on the threat of extremists linked to al-Qaeda in Benghazi and eastern Libya,” the fifth talking point began.

At 6:21 p.m., then-National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor e-mailed the CIA Office of Public Affairs saying that Principal Deputy National Security Adviser Denis McDonough, who has since become the White House chief of staff, had asked that “highlighted portions” of the draft be “coordinated with the State Department in the event that they get inquiries.”

The highlights indicated that McDonough’s main concern was the information about the prior CIA warnings to U.S. diplomatic missions in North Africa — information that was included at Petraeus’s request.

State Department balks

At 7:39 p.m. Friday, Victoria Nuland, then the State Department’s chief spokesperson, e-mailed deputy national security adviser Benjamin J. Rhodes; Jake Sullivan, director of policy planning at State; Shawn Turner, a spokesman for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence; and others. She expressed “serious concerns” about including Ansar and mentioning “warnings” in the talking points.

Nuland said the mention of the warnings “could be abused by members to beat the State Department for not paying attention to Agency warnings.”

Rhodes responded, “We need to resolve this in a way that respects all of the relevant equities, particularly the investigation,” and suggested that the issue be resolved the next morning during a previously scheduled meeting of the national security deputies.

“We’ve tried to work the draft talking points for HPSCI through the coordination process but have run into major problems,” the CIA’s Office of Public Affairs wrote to Petraeus at 9:52 p.m. Sept. 14. “The White House cleared quickly, but State has major concerns.”

Early the next morning, CIA Deputy Director Mike Morell, informed of the State Department’s concerns, took his own editing pencil to the talking points.

He agreed with Nuland that the warnings about other protests in the region were irrelevant to the committee request, senior administration officials said, and that any mention of Ansar could expose classified information.

At 9:45 a.m. Saturday, Morell sent out his edited version of the talking points, pared down to three bullet points. A few minutes later, the terrorism analysis director, who had written the original version after attending the coffee with Petraeus, responded.

“They are fine with me. But, pretty sure HPSCI won’t like them,” the official wrote, signing off with a smiley-face emoticon.

A little more than two hours later, an e-mail to Morell from Petraeus’s front office staff expressed concern about what was happening to the talking points.

“Before going to the committee, may I please ask you to send these to the Director?” the front office wrote. “He needs to know in advance what is going to the Hill in his name, even if it is going with the force of the full interagency coordination.”

Morell responded with concern about whether Petraeus would approve the document, even after other agencies had signed off.

“Please run the points by the Director, then get them to

HPSCI,” he wrote soon after. “I spoke to the Director earlier about State’s deep concerns about mentioning the warnings and the other work done on this, but you will want to reemphasize in your note to DCIA.”

Morell was right to be worried.

In an e-mail sent two hours later to Morell and others inside the agency, Petraeus wrote, “No mention of the cable to Cairo, either? Frankly, I’d just as soon not use this, then. . . [National Security Council] call, to be sure; however, this is certainly not what Vice Chairman Ruppersberger was hoping to get for unclas use.”

Asked about Petraeus’s warning, Ruppersberger said, “I’m not sure what he meant. I had no expectations.”"

U.N. approves sanctions against North Korea

Pyongyang threatened a nuclear strike against U.S.

White House%3A Rogue regime %22will achieve nothing by threats or provocations%22

WASHINGTON — The White House said Thursday that the United States is fully capable of defending against a North Korean ballistic missile strike.

Earlier Thursday, the United Nations Security Council voted unanimously for new sanctions against North Korea, which carried out a third nuclear test Feb. 12. Pyongyang threatened a nuclear strike against the United States.

""The United States is fully capable of defending against any North Korean ballistic missile attack,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said.

North Korea is prepared to ""exercise the right to a pre-emptive nuclear attack to destroy the strongholds of the aggressors,"" and Washington is ""set to light a fuse for a nuclear war,"" according to a statement from a Foreign Ministry spokesman carried by the Korean Central News Agency.

Carney said the rogue regime ""will achieve nothing by threats or provocations.""

Friday, Pyongyang announced that it was canceling a hotline and a nonaggression pact with South Korea.

Shortly after Kim Jong Un was elevated to succeed his father as ruler of North Korea, U.S. negotiators reached an understanding with Pyongyang that was announced Feb. 12, 2012.

The North Koreans agreed to suspend their uranium enrichment program and allow U.N. inspectors back in the country, moves that gave the United States and other allies a sliver of hope that six-party talks on North Korea's nuclear program could be revived.

Sixteen days after the deal was reached, North Korea announced it would launch a satellite attached to a rocket into space, compelling condemnation from the Obama administration and international community. The launch was carried out April 13, 2012, and the North Koreans carried out a subsequent long-range missile launch Dec. 12, 2012.

(CNN) —

Federal terrorism charges against Boston Marathon bombings suspect Dzhokar Tsarnaev could be filed soon, even as he remains hospitalized, a Justice Department official told CNN on Saturday. The 19-year-old could also face murder charges at the state level.

At the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, where Tsarnaev was in serious condition while being held in federal custody, federal prosecutors were formulating the charges.

The development came amid questions as to what’s next for the suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings.

President Barack Obama said he’s keenly interested in answers.

“There are still many unanswered questions,” Obama said Friday night. “Why did these young men who grew up and studied here as part of our communities and our country resort to such violence? How did they plan and carry out these attacks? And did they receive any help? The families of those killed so senselessly deserve answers.”

Tsarnaev and his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, are accused of setting off bombs at the marathon Monday, killing three people and wounding more than 170.

On Thursday night, they allegedly killed a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer before the older brother was killed during a shootout with police.

Dzhokar Tsarnaev was captured Friday night after he was found hiding in a boat in a backyard in Watertown, Massachusetts.

When will the suspect be in court?

Tsarnaev could be in a courtroom for an arraignment soon.

Ordinarily at an arraignment, the suspect is provided a lawyer, and the defense and prosecution try to make a case for whether he should be released on bail.

“He will not get bail obviously,” said senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin.

“They will set a preliminary hearing that could happen in the next 30 days. He will be indicted with the grand jury. And that’s when the case will begin.”

After the charges are filed, the Federal Public Defender Office in Boston will be appointed to represent Tsarnaev, according to Miriam Conrad, the federal public defender for the Massachusetts district.

Should bomber suspect be questioned without a lawyer?

For now, the government is invoking the public safety exception, a designation that allows investigators to question Tsarnaev without reading him his Miranda rights, a Justice Department official told CNN on condition of anonymity.

In ordinary cases, a suspect is told by police he has the right to remain silent and he has the right to a lawyer.

But this is not an ordinary case, say U.S. Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham.

They urged that Tsarnaev be held as an “enemy combatant,” a designation that allows a suspect to be questioned without a lawyer and without being informed of his Miranda rights.

“Now that the suspect is in custody, the last thing we should want is for him to remain silent. It is absolutely vital the suspect be questioned for intelligence gathering purposes,” the senators said. “Under the law of war we can hold this suspect as a potential enemy combatant not entitled to Miranda warnings or the appointment of counsel.”

But Sen. Carl Levin, D-Michigan, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said Saturday that the suspect should not be held as an enemy combatant.

“I am not aware of any evidence so far that the Boston suspect is part of any organized group, let alone al Qaeda, the Taliban, or one of their affiliates – the only organizations whose members are subject to detention under the Authorization for Use of Military Force, as it has been consistently interpreted by all three branches of our government,” he said.

“In the absence of such evidence I know of no legal basis for his detention as an enemy combatant. To hold the suspect as an enemy combatant under these circumstances would be contrary to our laws and may even jeopardize our efforts to prosecute him for his crimes.”

Alan Dershowitz, a prominent defense attorney and Harvard law professor, scoffed at the Republican senators’ statement.

“Impossible. There’s no way an American citizen committing a domestic crime in the city of Boston could be tried as an enemy combatant,” he told CNN’s Piers Morgan. “It could never happen. And that shows absolute ignorance of the law.”

Dershowitz also said statements made by police in Boston seems to contradict the government’s reasons for invoking the public safety exception.

“The police have said there’s no public safety issue; it’s solved, it’s over,” Dershowitz said. “There are no further threats. But the FBI is saying there’s enough further threats to justify an exception.”

Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani said the federal government may have known about international threats about which state officials were not aware.

“You would have to know the internals of what they have before you can assess whether there is a sensible invocation or not,” Giuliani said.

If the government had prior knowledge of Tsarnaev’s activities, it hasn’t disclosed it. It did say that Tamerlan Tsarnaev had been on the FBI’s radar in the past.

FBI agents interviewed Tamerlan two years ago and also looked at his travel history, checked databases for derogatory information and searched for Web postings. The agency found no connection with terror groups, an FBI official told CNN.

Two key Republicans on the House Homeland Security Committee – Rep. Mike McCaul of Texas, the panel’s chairman; and Rep. Peter King of New York – will press the Obama administration for details about the FBI’s questioning of Tamerlan Tsarnaev, according to a GOP congressional source.

Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was not a U.S. citizen, traveled to Sheremetyevo, Russia, in January 2012, according to travel records provided by a U.S. official. He returned six months later.

Federal or state trial?

Dershowitz said there are many arguments that can be made to try the case in state court. It may be hard for a prosecutor to prove which crimes were committed by Tsarnaev or his older brother, Dershowitz said.

“If he says my intent was to please my brother, they could raise the question of federal jurisdiction,” Dershowitz said.

This fight over federal or state jurisdiction could mean life or death.

Massachusetts does not have the death penalty.

There’s another big question: The National Defense Authorization Act of 2012 requires temporary military custody of certain terrorist suspects, but Dzhokar Tsarnaev is a U.S. citizen, and the act doesn’t apply to Americans.

What is the reaction in the suspects’ homeland?

Tsarnaev’s family lives in the Russian republic of Dagestan, which is next to the suspects’ homeland of Chechnya, located in the North Caucasus region of southern Russia.

Russia’s investigative committee in Dagestan said it will not engage with the Tsarnaev family unless there is “an order from above” to do so, spokesman Rasul Temerbekov told Russian state news agency RIA Novosti on Saturday.

A spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin said Saturday that Russia wants to get official information from the United States about the bombing suspects, and he wants there to be contact between investigators in both countries.

“This failure originated from two practices that we need to reverse,” Deputy Defense Secretary Ashton Carter said at a security forum at the Aspen Institute.

“In an effort for those in the intelligence community to be able to share with each other, there was an enormous amount of information concentrated in one place,” he said. “That’s a mistake. Loading everything onto a server creates a security risk.”

Second, he said, “You had an individual who was given very substantial authority to access that information and move that information.… We’re acting to reverse both of those things.”

Carter said the NSA was moving to a system under which no single person could move large amounts of sensitive data without another person signing off, an arrangement common to nuclear weapons controls.

The Snowden disclosures of NSA surveillance systems were a prime topic at the Aspen Security Forum, which features a series of panel discussions by current and former intelligence officials. Snowden, charged with violating the Espionage Act, has been stuck in the international zone of a Moscow airport since June 23, and has asked for temporary asylum in Russia.

Among Snowden’s revelations was that the NSA had assembled a giant database of telephone calling logs of nearly every American.

Raj De, the NSA’s general counsel, said Congress was fully briefed on that program through classified “white papers” sent to lawmakers in 2009 and 2011. In recent weeks, some lawmakers have said they do not believe the Patriot Act allows such a broad collection of domestic records.

De and other current and former government officials defended the surveillance as narrow, legal and useful. Under questioning from reporter Barton Gellman, who wrote about some of the Snowden disclosures for the Washington Post, Dennis Blair, the former director of national intelligence, argued there was no evidence of abuses or Americans being wrongfully targeted.

Americans have been more inconvenienced by having to take off their shoes at airports than they have by NSA snooping, Blair said.

“I would be more outraged if I had found a story in which the activities of the NSA have caused inconvenience or harm or damage to an American,” he said. “I have not seen that story yet.”

Anthony Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, said Snowden had done the country a service by forcing a debate on surveillance programs that had been kept from the American people. Current and former US intelligence officials disagreed, but Blair said he wished the U.S. government had disclosed some of the surveillance in general terms years ago.

“If we had more fully explained these programs … I think we would be in much better-off shape,” Blair said. “As it is, we are whipsawed by revelations … that make it appear as if we have much more to hide.”

He Sketches The Foolish', 'The Fallacious', 'The Felonious In Politics.']",Dana Milbank: Edward Snowden’s NSA leaks are the backlash of too much secrecy,"Keep your distance: The director of national intelligence is having intestinal distress.

“For me, it is literally — not figuratively, literally — gut-wrenching to see this happen,” James Clapper told Andrea Mitchell over the weekend, referring to leaks about the government’s secret program to collect vast troves of phone and Internet data.

There might be a bit more sympathy for Clapper’s digestive difficulty if he hadn’t delivered a kick in the gut to the American public just three months ago.

Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) asked Clapper at a Senate hearing in March, “Does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?”

“No, sir,” Clapper testified.

Ann Telnaes animation: The NSA’s data gathering technique (Ann Telnaes/The Washington Post)

“It does not?” Wyden pressed.

“Not wittingly. There are cases where they could inadvertently, perhaps, collect, but not wittingly.”

We now know that Clapper was not telling the truth. The National Security Agency is quite wittingly collecting phone records of millions of Americans, and much more.

As the administration and some in Congress vent their anger about leaks to The Post and to Britain’s Guardian newspaper, officials have only themselves to blame. It is precisely their effort to hide such a vast and consequential program from the American public that caused this pressure valve to burst. Instead of allowing a democratic debate about the programs in broad terms that would not have compromised national security, their attempts to keep the public in the dark have created a backlash in which the risks to national security can’t be controlled.

Edward Snowden, the leaker, did the honorable thing in revealing his identity; it would be more honorable if he would turn himself in and face the consequences for his law-breaking. But there is little honor in the way administration officials and lawmakers have avoided responsibility. Obama administration officials are blaming Snowden, while some lawmakers complain disingenuously that the administration kept them out of the loop.

“All of us are sort of asking what in the world has gone on,” a seemingly bewildered Eric Cantor (R-Va.), the House majority leader, alleged Monday on CBS’s “This Morning.”

Host Norah O’Donnell asked whether he had known about the program before the leaks.

“Well,” Cantor replied, “there are a variety of — of classified programs that exist for us to, again, guard against a terrorist threat. And . . . ”

Asked whether the Obama administration’s surveillance went further than the George W. Bush administration’s, Cantor said that “these are questions we don’t know the answers to.”

“How do you not know the answer?” O’Donnell asked.

Good question. All 535 members of Congress had authorization to learn all about the programs. Senators even received a written invitation in 2011 to view a classified report. Likewise, Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.), a former chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, said Monday that members “could have gotten a briefing whenever they wanted to.”

But apparently few bothered. Worse, lawmakers quashed efforts to allow even modest public disclosure of the broad contours of the program. Steven Aftergood, who runs the Federation of American Scientists’ Project on Government Secrecy, lists the various ways in which the administration, Congress and the courts denied the public any right to know:

The Justice Department and the DNI promised a new effort to declassify opinions issued by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court; Justice official Lisa Monaco, now Obama’s counterterrorism director, said all significant FISA rulings would be reviewed for declassification. But no new opinions were declassified under the initiative.

The House last year turned back attempts to require public reports on the general outlines of the government’s surveillance programs. The various disclosure proposals, offered by Democratic Reps. Bobby Scott (Va.), Jerrold Nadler (N.Y.) and Sheila Jackson Lee (Tex.), were defeated by the Judiciary Committee.

In the Senate, amendments to provide modest disclosures and declassifications, offered by Wyden and fellow Democratic Sens. Jeff Merkley (Ore.) and Mark Udall (Colo.) during the FISA renewal in December, were all defeated.

The FISA court itself colluded in the secrecy. After senators asked the court to provide declassified summaries of its decisions, the chief FISA judge, Reggie B. Walton, responded with a letter on March 27 citing “serious obstacles” to the request.

“It was a shoddy performance all around,” Aftergood said Monday. “The pervasive secrecy on this topic created an information vacuum. If congressional oversight was not going to fill it in, it turned out leaks would. That’s not the optimal solution.”

Not optimal, but probably inevitable. Officials who denied the public a responsible debate on surveillance will now have a debate on Snowden’s terms — and there’s no use in bellyaching about it.

""This Sunday, the president under pressure as he faces a growing debate about how safe we are at home from terror....."" ""This morning, a debate about the state of our homeland security in a new age of terror."" ""I think there's the broader topic we're broaching here about national security, about our own personal freedoms in America, coming out of the Boston bombing, is in part ongoing concern about terrorism."" ""Is there something here that somehow gets to why we're more vulnerable now.....?"" ""Are there questions that have to be answered that reflect how vulnerable we are and what we're doing about it?"" "".....What does this tell us about what we're up against here.....? And this question of 'Are we any safer?'"" "".....We're dealing with radicalization inside the homeland. How do we deal with it?"" ""It's a security question. Two years after Osama bin Laden has been killed, are we safer as a country or not?"" ""Do we need to sacrifice privacy in order to be safer? Is that going to be the immediate lesson from the Boston bombing?"" ""Boston was an exclamation point about the ongoing terror threat and this new age of terror.....""

Gregory's short ""Post-show thoughts"" web video is titled ""Keeping America Safe."" Another clip from the show, featuring the gruesome Rudy Guiliani, is titled ""Privacy may become cost of safety.""You get the point. We Are Not Safe. Terror. Must Keep Safe. Terror. Are We Less Safe? More Safe? Equally Safe? Terror.It's worth pausing to consider how amazingly irrational all of this is and how the quixotic project of Keeping America Safe only seems to interest the political and media classes when it revolves around combating the virtually nonexistent specter of terrorism.First, a simple look at the facts about this alleged New Age of Terror that exists only in David Gregory's imagination. In 2011, the most recent year for which we have data, 17 Americans were killed by terrorism, a number that's basically consistent with previous years. Significantly more Americans (26) were killed by lighting. ""Death by furniture"" constitutes a comparable threat.But even these figures fail to fully convey the irrationality at play here. Gregory is evidently obsessed withterrorism in particular. Of those 17 Americans killed by terrorism in 2011,were killed in the United States. In 2010, too, not a single American was killed by domestic terrorism. More Americans were killed by syphilis in 2011 than by terrorism in the entire decade after 9/11. Death by domestic terrorism is so rare as to render it absurd to even discuss. David Gregory devoted nearly an entire show to it.Note that more than 122,000 died from accidental injury and 53,000 died from the flu and pneumonia in 2011. One could cite any number of statistics to illuminate the silliness of this obsession. Most instructive, though, is to compare terrorism to gun violence, which at least falls under a similar category. Gun violence is killing tens of thousands of Americans annually. Yes, the media have paid a reasonable amount of attention to gun violence over the past few months, but never in the context of Keeping America Safe, which clearly conveys asense of urgency. The focus on the Terror Threat is just fanatically out of proportion relative to the coverage of virtually any other ""threat"" one can think of. Devoting an entireto syphilis and the current state of medical research on syphilis would make more sense than this.The obsession with domestic terrorism serves important objectives of the political class. It provides a rationale for further eroding privacy and civil liberties - more in sorrow than anger, of course (Gregory: ""Do we need to sacrifice privacy in order to be safer?""). To the extent that domestic terrorisma threat, it makes no distinction based on class (as in the case of 9/11), as opposed to gun violence, which, by and large, targets America's underclass. It keeps Americans scared, obedient, and supportive of their leaders (a New Age of Terror is hardly an appropriate time for dissent).We should never accept this stupid obsession with Terrorism just because it's become so ubiquitous since 9/11. It's the responsibility of thinking citizens to relentlessly point out how truly irrational it is and how it so transparently involves ulterior motives.

Sanger']",No Bunker-Buster Bomb in Israel’s U.S. Arms Deal,"Israel has asked the United States for weapons like the Massive Ordnance Penetrator in the past and has been turned down. American officials declined to say whether the yearlong negotiations with Israel that resulted in the new arms package had included a discussion of the new bomb.

Instead, they pointed to a decision by President Obama to send advanced refueling tanker planes to Israel that would make it possible for the country’s fighter aircraft to reach as far as Iran. A similar refueling capability was turned down during the administration of President George W. Bush.

George Little, the Pentagon press secretary, said the arms package to Israel was “unprecedented” and would “guarantee and augment our strong ally’s qualitative military edge for a generation to come.”

The debate is about more than just equipment. Israel’s position has been that Iran cannot be allowed to build up too large a stockpile of medium-enriched uranium that could allow it to then race for a bomb. When Mr. Netanyahu addressed the United Nations in New York last September, he drew a red line across a cartoon picture of a bomb, which aides later said indicated that Iran would not be allowed to amass enough medium-enriched uranium to get enough fuel to make a single weapon.

But most of Iran’s production of that uranium is occurring inside the mountain at Fordo. So far, Iran has stayed just below Mr. Netanyahu’s red line, converting some of the fuel to a metallic form that can be used in a nuclear reactor — but that would take significantly more time to further enrich it to bomb-grade material. To the United States, this has offered up more time for a diplomatic solution. To many Israeli officials, it is a ploy, intended to buy time as Iran installs a new generation of centrifuges that could speed its production.

“It’s all about timetables,” said Dore Gold, the president of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs and a member of Mr. Netanyahu’s inner circle of strategists. “If you say the goal is to halt Iran in the enrichment phase, you don’t have much time. If you are waiting for Iran to weaponize” — the position the Obama administration has taken — “maybe you can give it another year or more.”

Mr. Yaalon suggested that there was still time. “There are other tools to be used and to be exhausted, whether it is diplomacy, economic sanctions,” he said."

They argue President Obama cannot be trusted to enforce the laws and that state and local governments across the country have already established roadblocks to enforcement. They point most recently to a study by the Federation for American Immigration Reform showing 103 U.S. cities, towns and counties have resolutions, ordinances, executive actions and other initiatives “designed to thwart federal law enforcement efforts.”

Whether the Republican-led House will vote on immigration reform has become a hot issue on Capitol Hill now that lawmakers have, at least temporarily, resolved their recent fiscal crises and with just 16 more days remaining in this legislative session.

House Speaker John Boehner has expressed interest in allowing votes on several incremental immigration bills, which would likely include one on tighter border security.

However, those concerned about the enforcement of immigration laws also fear House leaders will take their legislation to a conference committee with Senate Democrats and leave with a comprehensive bill that is tantamount to amnesty for many of this country’s 11 million illegal immigrants.

“If the leadership appoints conferees and we go to conference committee with the Senate over the Schumer-Rubio amnesty bill, the odds are pretty good they're going to come out with something that is basically the same as Schumer's bill,” Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, said recently.

That situation might put enough pressure on Boehner to put that bill to a full floor vote, which would likely pass with support from House Democrats and moderate Republicans, critics argue.

In addition, roughly 130 pro-enforcement groups recently sent a letter to Boehner asking him to not allow House immigration legislation to reach the conference committee.

The FAIR study released Friday shows the majority of so-called “sanctuary” policies, 104 including the District of Columbia, have been put in place since Obama took office in 2009 and that almost half were set in the past two years.

“All across the country, local officials are buckling to special interest demands that immigration lawbreakers not only be tolerated, but protected,” group President Dan Stein said.

The sanctuary policies essentially provides leeway for state and local police officers in complying with a 1996 federal law requiring them to assist the U.S. government with illegal immigrants. The policies also essentially say the officers do not question the status of suspected illegal immigrants.

California and Connecticut are among the major states to have sanctuary-type policies, with many East Coast cities having similar ones.

FAIR spokesman Bob Dane said Wednesday he thinks Americans are concerned about Obama not enforcing the law in large part because his administration has issued guidelines on who Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents can pursue and because of the president’s 2012 Executive Order that allows young people who entered the country as children to remain for two years without fear of deportation."

""Let's hit these office phone lines, twitter accounts, and Facebook pages hard today, and instead of pro amnesty supporters, let the Americans speak against amnesty on 9/11!"" reads the email, signed by the Americans for Legal Immigration PAC President William Gheen and posted to its website.

""The illegals are trying to hijack the cockpit of America's government!"" the email continues. ""Let's roll!""

Immigration reform opponents often invoke the 9/11 attacks to help make their arguments, pointing to the undocumented status of some of the hijackers who overstayed their visas.

ALIPAC was founded on 9/11 nine years ago, according to its email, ""in honor of the victims of the terror attacks that occurred because our government failed at its most basic responsibility to protect our citizens from those who would enter our nation to do us harm.""

The email seems to imply that other undocumented immigrants are, at least metaphorically, in a similar position of trying to harm the United States. It called on recipients to contact members of the House of Representatives who might support reform and urge them to vote against it.

Members of the ""gang of eight,"" a bipartisan group that drafted a reform bill passed by the Senate in June, argued that their legislation would aid the government's efforts to detect people who overstayed their visas by requiring airports to track both entries and exits to the United States.

Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), a member of the gang of eight, said after the bombings in Boston earlier this year that such attacks only showed the importance of immigration reform.

""It’s a compelling argument for better identifying people who leave and enter this country,"" McCain said in April. ""I think that the whole system of better border enforcement, e-verify system, better help us account for people in this country and their activities."""

Lewis, a computer security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “The hacker got into the storeroom.”

In an age when terabytes of data can be stashed inside palm-size devices, the new details about Mr. Snowden’s training and assignments underscore the challenges that the N.S.A. faces in recruiting a new generation of free-spirited computer experts with diverse political views.

Mr. Snowden, who is now marooned at an airport in Moscow waiting to see if another country will grant him asylum, has said he leaked the documents to alert the public to the sweeping nature of the American government’s surveillance. He took a job as an “infrastructure analyst” with Booz Allen Hamilton in April at an N.S.A. facility in Hawaii, he has said, to gain access to lists of computers that the agency had hacked around the world.

Mr. Snowden prepared the résumé shortly before applying for that job, while he was working in Hawaii for the N.S.A. with Dell, the computer maker, which has intelligence contracts. Little has been reported about his four years with Dell, but his résumé, as described, says that he rose from supervising computer system upgrades for the spy agency in Tokyo to working as a “cyberstrategist” and an “expert in cyber counterintelligence” at several locations in the United States.

In what may have been his last job for Dell in Hawaii, he was responsible for the security of “Windows infrastructure” in the Pacific, he wrote, according to people who have seen his résumé. He had enough access there to start making contacts with journalists in January and February about disclosing delicate information. His work for Dell may also have enabled him to see that he would have even more access at Booz Allen."

Ms. Napolitano, a former Arizona governor who for four and a half years shaped the administration’s response to hurricanes, terrorist attacks, illegal immigration and a catastrophic oil spill, will leave in September to become president of the University of California system. Ms. Napolitano had her eye on becoming the next attorney general, but now is taking herself out of the Washington arena.

Her departure deprives the administration of one of its most prominent voices on immigration even as it is in the throes of pushing Congress for an overhaul that would provide a pathway to citizenship for most of the 11 million foreigners who are here illegally. Ms. Napolitano said she decided to leave only after concluding that her absence would not affect chances for the immigration legislation, a person close to her said, but confirmation of a successor could become wrapped up in the larger immigration debate.

Her move west creates an opening that could be hard for President Obama to fill. The secretary of homeland security presides over a sprawling department that was created after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, by combining nearly two dozen agencies as varied as the Secret Service, the Transportation Security Administration, the Coast Guard and the Federal Emergency Management Agency."

(CNN) —

American intelligence leaker Edward Snowden has more damaging information that could be a “nightmare” for the U.S. government, a journalist who first published his documents said.

Glenn Greenwald of the Guardian told an Argentine newspaper, La Nacion, that releasing more information to hurt the United States is not Snowden’s goal.

However, he said, Snowden has a “large number” of documents about software people use “without consciously agreeing to surrender their rights to privacy.”

Snowden has given copies of the papers to several people, Greenwald told the paper, according to an English translation.

“The U.S. government should be on their knees every day praying that nothing happens to Snowden, because if something happens, all information will be revealed and that would be their worst nightmare,” he said.

Others have suggested this before.

Kristinn Hrafnsson, a WikiLeaks spokesman, said last month that other secrets may be revealed.

“There is more to come,” he said.

What are the odds of a Snowden getaway?

Snowden is a former computer technician for U.S. defense contractor Booz Allen Hamilton.

In June, he gave Greenwald and colleague Ewen MacAskill a 12-minute video interview on why he provided the Guardian the classified documents about U.S. surveillance programs.

Following his revelation, he fled to Hong Kong, then headed to Russia, where he is in political limbo in the transit area of a Moscow airport. He has requested asylum from Russia while he awaits safe passage to Latin America, according to WikiLeaks.

No application from Snowden has yet been received, the head of the Russian Federal Migration Service, Konstantin Romodanovsky, told the nation’s news agency, Interfax.

The presidents of Venezuela and Bolivia have said their countries would give him asylum, and Nicaragua’s president said he would offer it “if circumstances permit.”

Snowden faces espionage charges in the United States.

He met with human rights activists and lawyers Friday at the airport. It was his first public appearance since he left Hong Kong on June 23.

Merkel wants EU data protection pact

“I announce today my formal acceptance of all offers of support or asylum I have been extended and all others that may be offered in the future,” he said in a statement.

“As we have seen, however, some governments in Western European and North American states have demonstrated a willingness to act outside the law, and this behavior persists today. This unlawful threat makes it impossible for me to travel to Latin America and enjoy the asylum granted there in accordance with our shared rights.”

In his remarks, Snowden also sought to defend his actions in leaking documents to the media that exposed U.S. mass surveillance programs.

“I did what I believed right and began a campaign to correct this wrongdoing. I did not seek to enrich myself. I did not seek to sell US secrets. I did not partner with any foreign government to guarantee my safety. Instead, I took what I knew to the public, so what affects all of us can be discussed by all of us in the light of day, and I asked the world for justice,” he said.

“That moral decision to tell the public about spying that affects all of us has been costly, but it was the right thing to do and I have no regrets.”

The United States has reached out to the Russians regarding Snowden’s meeting with human rights groups, two senior State Department officials told CNN.

http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/31/politics/hagel-mccain/index.html,2013-01-31 00:00:00,"['Dana Bash', 'Rachel Streitfeld']",McCain moves from backer to skeptic on Hagel,"Story highlights In 2000, candidate McCain says Hagel would make a great Defense Secretary In 2013, McCain says he has concerns over Hagel's nomination to the post The views of the onetime friends have ""diverged dramatically,"" McCain says

During his 2000 presidential run, a New Hampshire voter asked Republican Sen. John McCain who he might choose as secretary of defense.

McCain responded by tossing out the name of a dear old friend and colleague, the very man who would be nominated to that post by a Democrat and frequent McCain target 13 years later.

“There’s a lot of people that could do that,” he told voters at a January town hall in Nashua, New Hampshire. “One of ‘em, I think, is Sen. Chuck Hagel.”

Now Hagel has been nominated for that same job, by McCain’s 2008 campaign rival, President Barack Obama. But when the Senate Armed Services Committee meets on Thursday to discuss the nomination, McCain will be one of Hagel’s biggest skeptics.

What Hagel will say Thursday

“My biggest concern is his overall attitude about the United States, our role in the world – particularly in the Middle East and whether we should reduce the Pentagon further – but mainly his general overall world view,” McCain told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer about his former colleague.

To understand the depth of the fallout between the two men one needs to understand how close the senators once were.

McCain loaned his star power to Hagel’s first Senate campaign in 1996, traveling to appear with him in Nebraska.

When Hagel was elected to the Senate, the two men shared a bond over their service in Vietnam. In 1997 they attended a ceremony marking the 15th anniversary of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.

Speaking about his comrades in arms, McCain mentioned the “unique bond that exists between us of which I am eternally proud.”

“When I see them on the floor of the Senate or somewhere in the Capitol, I feel a little lift,” he said.

Hagel spoke of McCain’s service, declaring “no one during this entire time ever gave more, or showed more courage, than John McCain.”

Five things Hagel may be asked about

Their friendship led to a close working relationship during the 2000 presidential campaign, when Hagel served as a loyal surrogate and campaign co-chair for McCain.

Then, Hagel said his friend felt he owed the country his service. “His life has been committed to something larger than he is,” Hagel said after McCain suspended his campaign effort to make way for an ascendent George W. Bush. “He’s a selfless person who’s given much to his country.”

Later that year, Hagel introduced McCain on the stage of the party’s convention with a giant embrace.

Back in the Senate, the long-time friends and combat veterans both voiced early concerns about the handling of the Iraq war.

But their views diverged as McCain came to support President Bush’s proposed troop surge in 2007, a military decision that drew Hagel’s scorn. He famously called the proposal “the most dangerous foreign policy blunder in this country since Vietnam if it is carried out.”

Why some conservatives are still going after Hagel

A source close to McCain said the friends just drifted apart as friends sometimes do, not because of policy differences. But even McCain acknowledged the change.

“I’ve noticed over the years that our views on the United States of America and what we should be doing in the world have diverged rather dramatically,” he said earlier this month.

By McCain’s 2008 presidential run, Hagel was more in line with McCain’s anti-Iraq war opponent Barack Obama.

The two traveled together on a Middle East Senate trip Obama used to beef up his foreign policy chops, and Hagel was never seen on McCain’s iconic Straight Talk Express campaign bus.

Avlon: Reality check for Hagel bashers

Hagel and McCain spoke after the former senator’s nomination to the Defense Department. Afterward, McCain said he had concerns about Hagel’s positions on Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan. But citing their long friendship, McCain said he would not oppose Hagel before the hearing.

“Sen. Hagel and I are, are old friends and we had a very frank and candid conversation and I’ll be looking forward to the hearing and asking questions,” McCain said on January 22. “I think that he should be given the opportunity of a hearing before any of us make a judgment.”

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/03/25/Defense-Industry-drone-zones,2013-03-25 00:00:00,['Ben Shapiro'],Defense Industry Pushes for 'Drone Zone' over Southern California,"Despite Americans’ concerns about the domestic use of drones, California local agencies are reportedly moving forward with an application to declare a broad swath of Southern California a “drone zone” – an area to be used to test pilotless aircraft. The purpose: government stimulus.

In California, the San Diego Military Advisory Council (SDMAC) and the San Diego Regional Economic Development Corporation (EDC) have filed an application with the Federal Aviation Administration to create a drone zone. These groups want to stimulate state drone business, even as the state raises its taxes repeatedly, driving out other business. Northrup Grumman, a major drone producer, has relocated branches of its unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) program to Southern California. General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, which produces Predator drones, is located in Poway. The UAV industry in San Diego County clocks in at approximately $1.3 billion, and that number is growing fast.

And it’s not just California. The FAA is prepared to greenlight six test zones across the country, and over 40 applications have been filed or will be filed shortly, according to the San Diego Union-Tribune. Applicants include the State Department, the Ohio Department of Transportation, the National Institute of Standards and technologies, and the Grand Forks Sheriff’s Department. The winners of this drone zone sweepstakes will be able to claim a chunk of what may be a $10 billion industry. Senator Harry Reid‘s office says he pushed the FAA program that laid the groundwork for the drone zones. “We had Nevada in mind,” said Reid’s spokeswoman to the Las Vegas Sun. But the zones are bipartisan-approved: Gov. Brian Sandoval (R-NV) is apparently working with Reid and the FAA to try to grab one of the zones.

Ian Gregor, Public Affairs Manager for the FAA Pacific Division, directed Breitbart News to the FAA website’s page on Unmanned Aircraft Systems without further comment. The FAA website describes the goal of the test-site program: “The research done at the test sites will help the FAA develop regulatory standards to foster UAS technology and operational procedures. The effort also will add to the data we need to eventually permit routine UAS operations in the NAS.” The FAA’s press release asking for public input on UAS test-site selection makes no mention of civil liberties. When Gregor was asked via email for comment on whether test sites would rule out urban areas or other areas of population density, he did not respond.

The American Civil Liberties Union is protesting the possibility of such zones, stating, “Unmanned aircraft carrying cameras raise the prospect of a significant new avenue for the surveillance of American life.”

According to reports, 63 drone sites have already been authorized across the country.

Times reports.

A resettlement plan under discussion in Washington and other capitals is aimed at relieving pressure on Middle Eastern countries straining to support 1.6 million refugees, as well as assisting hard-hit Syrian families. The State Department is “ready to consider the idea,” an official from the department said, if the administration receives a formal request from the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees, which is the usual procedure. The United States usually accepts about half the refugees that the U.N. agency proposes for resettlement. California has historically taken the largest share, but Illinois, Florida, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia are also popular destinations.

U.N. refugee officials, along with diplomats and non-governmental relief groups, are scheduled to meet in Geneva this week to discuss potential resettlement plans. Germany has already agreed to take 5,000 refugees.

“It was probably inevitable that in this crisis, with these overwhelming numbers, governments would start moving in this direction,” Lavinia Limon, chief executive officer of the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, a Virginia-based advocacy and service group, told the L.A. Times. Limon added, “But there will be resistance.”

Congress is unlikely to warm up to the idea of agreeing to resettle thousands of Syrian refugees into the U.S. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle who are currently pushing immigration reform bills, particularly aimed at Latinos who are in the country illegally, will need to explain why they may favor or oppose resettling thousands of Syrian refugees.

It should be noted that Congress resisted accepting Iraqi refugees in 2003 following the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. Between 1983 and 2009, the U.S. resettled a total of 76,205 Iraqis. Meanwhile, seventy percent of total refugees in the U.S. were on food stamps in 2009. Within that number, 95 percent of Iraqi refugees were food stamp recipients. Additionally, the report shows an unemployment rate of 46 percent in 2009 among Iraqi refugees. A total of 219 Syrian refugees were resettled in the U.S. between 1983 and 2009.

More importantly, President Obama’s administration supports Syrians who are attempting to oust Syrian President Bashar Assad, but the emergence of Islamic extremist groups with ties to al Qaeda among the Syrian opposition presents a serious security concern. The L.A. Times alludes to the potential danger with such a resettlement:

Homeland security officials require careful vetting of refugees, with multiple interviews and background checks before they are allowed to enter the country. Under normal circumstances, the screening process can take a year or longer. U.S. officials are likely to be extra careful with Syrian refugees. As Islamic militants take a more prominent role in the rebel forces, officials worry about fighters with Al Qaeda ties trying to enter the country. Two resettled Iraqis were convicted of trying to send arms to Al Qaeda from their home in Bowling Green, Ky.

New National Security Advisor Susan Rice and President Obama’s nominee for U.N. ambassador Samantha Power are both refugee advocates and will likely push for the resettlement."

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

USA TODAY

Immigration bill goes to full Senate%3B vote possible in June

Conservatives say it faces obstacles because of lack of security

The bill survived more than 200 proposed amendments over five hearings

After three long weeks of hearings and debates, spectators burst out into screams and applause Tuesday night after the Senate Judiciary Committee approved an immigration bill that would be the biggest overhaul to the nation's immigration laws in a generation.

The bill was produced by a bipartisan group of senators known as the Gang of Eight. With four of those members on the committee, the bill survived 212 amendments over five lengthy hearings.

Left intact was the core of the bill, which will allow the nation's 11 million unauthorized immigrants to apply for U.S. citizenship, add significant investments in border security and fundamentally alter the legal immigration system of the future.

The committee approved the bill 13-5, meaning the bill is on track to be debated on the full Senate floor beginning the first week of June.

Some Republicans warned that the amendment process had done little to assuage their fears that they were facing a repeat of 1986, when Congress last passed a sweeping immigration bill that allowed up to 3 million people to gain citizenship, but did not fulfill its promises of fully securing the nation's borders.

""Today, we're right back at the same place talking about the same problems and proposing the same solutions,"" said Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and the ranking member of the committee.

The committee's chairman, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said it was not ""the bill I would've written,"" but he called it the best opportunity for immigration reform he's seen in years.

""We've demonstrated to the United States Senate that we can all work together, Republicans and Democrats,"" Leahy said. ""Now let's go out of this room, and work together with the other members of the Senate.""

President Obama issued a statement late Tuesday, congratulating the committee for advancing the bill that is ""largely consistent with the principles of common-sense reform I have proposed and meets the challenge of fixing our broken immigration system.""

""None of the committee members got everything they wanted, and neither did I, but in the end, we all owe it to the American people to get the best possible result over the finish line,"" the statement read.

Tuesday's vote capped off a grueling, sometimes-emotional trek through the committee where senators voted on everything from visas for displaced Tibetans to the ability of unauthorized immigrants to access government benefits. Sponsors of the bill tried to accept as many Republican amendments as they could to garner their support, while holding off ""poison pill"" amendments that could scuttle the carefully negotiated bill.

One example came Tuesday, when Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., finished days of negotiations and reached a breakthrough compromise on visas for high-tech workers.

The bill increases the number of H1-B visas that are primarily given to foreigners trained in science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields, but Hatch and other Republicans worried that the bill placed too many restrictions on U.S. tech companies trying to hire those workers. Tuesday's agreement requires companies to make a good faith effort to hire Americans for high-skilled technology jobs, but eases some of the hiring requirements originally in the bill.

Hatch called it a ""sensible and reasoned balance"" that made the final product a ""much more acceptable bill.""

Sponsors of the bill also found middle ground in the border security debate.

The committee voted down an amendment from Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., to require that all the nation's airports, seaports, and land ports of entry establish a system to collect the fingerprints of all departing foreigners. Republicans, and some Democrats, feel that is the most efficient system to track who has remained in the country after their visas have expired. That is a major concern since 40% of the nation's 11 million unauthorized immigrants fall into that group.

On Monday, the committee accepted a scaled-down version of the program. Under an amendment filed by Hatch, the nation's 10 busiest international airports will have to implement the program within two years, and it will be expanded to the 30 biggest airports within six years."

Although members of Congress remain deeply split and polls indicate Americans oppose military action, Obama on Tuesday won the backing of the two top House Republicans, Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio and Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia. He also picked up the support of the No. 2 House Democrat, Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland; House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) was already on board.

Late Tuesday, the top Democrat and Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee agreed on language authorizing U.S. military action against Syria for its alleged use of chemical weapons in the suburbs of Damascus, while ruling out the commitment of U.S. ground forces and limiting the window for an attack to 90 days. A committee vote could come as early as Wednesday.

Earlier, Secretary of State John F. Kerry, along with Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had sought to dispel the concern of some committee members that, as with Iraq, the U.S. was at risk of acting on flawed or exaggerated intelligence, or that the U.S. could be drawn more deeply into Syria’s civil war.

“This is not the time for armchair isolationism. This is not the time to be spectators to slaughter,” Kerry said.

Obama took one of the biggest gambles of his presidency Saturday when he announced he would seek Congress’ blessing for military action in hope of bolstering the limited foreign and domestic support for the mission. Substantial risk remains that rank-and-file lawmakers in the House, who sense the hostility of many Americans to more U.S. military action in the Middle East, could break with their leadership.

But Boehner urged Republican House members, usually antagonistic toward Obama, to support him because “this is something that the United States, as a country, needs to do.” He called Syrian President Bashar Assad’s alleged attack with sarin gas, which the U.S. says killed more than 1,400 people on Aug. 21, a “barbarous act.”

Obama called for Congress to act promptly.

“What we are envisioning is something limited. It is something proportional,” he said in brief comments before meeting with legislators. “It will degrade Assad’s capabilities. At the same time, we have a broader strategy that will allow us to upgrade the capabilities of the opposition.”

The language crafted by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman, Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) and the committee’s leading Republican, Bob Corker of Tennessee, calls for the use of force “in a limited and tailored manner” against military targets in Syria in response to the government’s use of “weapons of mass destruction.”

Two leaders of the Senate’s hawk faction, John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), also argued on television news shows in favor of a strike, although they remain critical of how Obama has handled the Syrian civil war.

The No. 3 House lawmakers from both parties, Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Bakersfield) and Rep. James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.), remain undecided. So do most lawmakers, who are still weighing the policy merits and the political risks of a vote that may be deeply unpopular whichever way they decide.

Two polls released Tuesday, from the Pew Research Center and Washington Post-ABC News, found that Americans remain opposed to U.S. military action in Syria.

Yet key members and aides said Boehner’s announcement provided at least a temporary momentum swing from Saturday, when many in Congress were predicting that the support Obama sought was not there. Lawmakers lining up with Obama said that if the United States did not seek to deter chemical weapons use, it would embolden Assad and his allies in Iran; hurt America’s standing around the world; and put U.S. allies such as Israel, Jordan and Turkey at risk of such attacks.

The Boehner-Cantor decision “is a game-changer for the House vote, and far more important than McCain and Graham, who lead a small minority seeking greater military involvement,” said a senior Senate aide who declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly. The aide noted that a number of traditional hawks, such as Sen. Mark Steven Kirk (R-Ill.), were also lining up with Obama in favor of a limited strike.

Speaking Tuesday before the Senate committee, at the first congressional hearing on the issue, Kerry, Hagel and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey said inaction was unacceptable.

“The risk of not acting is greater than the risk of acting,” said Kerry, a former chairman of the committee.

He said he and Hagel, who had been in the Senate for the Iraq vote a decade ago, “are especially sensitive … to never again asking any member of Congress to take a vote on faulty intelligence. And that is why our intelligence community has scrubbed and rescrubbed the evidence.”

Kerry said Assad had been responsible for a series of chemical weapons attacks numbering “in the teens,” which suggests the Syrian military has employed them far more than has been publicly known. Administration officials were unable to provide any immediate elaboration.

Obama’s position also drew an expression of public support from former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, a possible 2016 Democratic presidential candidate, who had remained silent on the issue.

The American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the nation’s most influential pro-Israel organization, also declared itself in favor of a punitive attack. “Simply put, barbarism on a mass scale must not be given a free pass,” the group said in a statement.

Congressional attention is now focused on negotiating language for the resolution, with many members pressing to make it narrow enough to convince skeptical lawmakers it will not open the way for deeper military involvement.

In the House, Reps. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) and Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.) said they were also working on a proposal.

The White House has indicated it will work with Congress on the language, aiming for a vote by the middle of next week. Officials have said they are not seeking to topple Assad or deploy U.S. troops.

Kerry signaled one possible complication on the issue when he told the Senate committee that the administration would oppose language specifically barring U.S. “boots on the ground” because that could limit U.S. options in the event of an emergency, such as a threatened chemical weapons release.

But moments later, facing objections from senators, Kerry backed off, saying the administration had no desire to insert U.S. ground troops and would work with lawmakers to find language making that clear.

Some senators worried aloud that missile strikes on Assad, even if limited, might draw the United States more deeply into the civil war if it widens to entangle U.S. allies.

“What happens if they get into it with Israel?” asked Sen. Jim Risch (R-Idaho). “What’s our response going to be?”

Kerry sought to assure Risch that a limited mission “doesn’t mean the United States of America is going to war.”

The administration seemed to have the support of some committee liberals with antiwar histories, such as Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), who has said that her vote against the Iraq war was her proudest moment. She said a failure to act “gives Assad license to use these weapons again.”

Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), a leader of the non-interventionist GOP faction, criticized the administration for being unwilling to say whether it would go ahead with an attack if Congress voted no. “You are making a joke out of us, you are making theater,” said Paul, who threatened to filibuster the resolution.

Kerry said Obama had not decided whether he would launch the attack in the absence of congressional support.

Another public hearing is set for Wednesday before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and administration officials will continue to brief lawmakers in private.

The president, who will be in Sweden and Russia until Friday, and other top administration officials are expected to make calls to wavering lawmakers to lobby them.

Veterans such as U.S. Rep. Tammy Duckworth — the first woman injured in combat to be elected to national office when the Democrat ousted former Republican Rep. Joe Walsh in November — applauded the move as a broadening of opportunities for women and said it will improve the nation's armed forces. But several older veterans said most women are not physically strong enough to participate directly in combat.

Duckworth fought in Iraq with the Illinois Army National Guard as a Blackhawk helicopter pilot, one of the few combat positions available to women at the time. She lost both her legs when a rocket-propelled grenade hit her helicopter in 2004.

The Pentagon's decision overturns a 1994 ruling that banned women from being assigned to smaller ground combat units.

""The decision to allow women to serve in combat will allow the best man or woman on the front line to keep America safe,"" Duckworth said in a statement Wednesday. ""As a combat veteran, I know the inclusion of women in combat roles will make America safer and provide inspiration to women throughout our country.""

Lizette Rhone, president of the Chicago chapter of the Women's Army Corps Veterans' Association, served during World War II. She joined in 1943 hoping to be stationed overseas. But being African-American in the then-segregated military prohibited that and she instead filled an administrative role in Missouri, she said.

Rhone said some women would have jumped at the opportunity to serve in combat, even during World War II.

""I think it's the type of career some women would look forward to,"" said Rhone, 86. ""Now, they have the opportunity to really just soar.""

Rhone and Duckworth said women have been serving in combat zones, unofficially, for years.

""You can't believe that these women were in combat areas and never fired a gun and tried to protect themselves,"" Rhone said. ""We knew that (women) had been doing this.""

Two other female World War II veterans, however, said they aren't comfortable with the idea of women serving in combat.

Yolanda Imhoff, 94, of Evanston, served as a sergeant in the Army Air Forces as a high-speed radio operator in Europe. She worries that women generally are not as strong as men and that women might be more vulnerable if captured.

""They did teach us how to practice shooting a gun,"" Imhoff said about her time in service. ""We did have that. But as far as any combat, I'm, being my age, and what I saw and went though, I'm not sure I think women should be in combat.""

Doris Dina, 88, of Chicago, also a World War II veteran, said she doesn't think it's a good idea for most women, but that it could work for some.

""I appreciate the fact that some women are strong and they can handle combat,"" Dina said. ""I think it would be good for them. But not for people like myself.""

David McArtin, of Round Lake, a 30-year Navy veteran, said it's about time women serve in combat. He understands that some, like Imhoff, fear women will be subjected to abuse.

""That's happening today,"" McArtin said. ""I think we need to accept these things will happen in combat. ... And not every woman is going to say, 'This is for me.' Not everyone in America serves.""

The U.S. Navy plans to deploy a laser weapon aboard a warship for the first time, Navy leaders said on Monday.

The laser will be deployed on the USS Ponce in early 2014.

""The weapon's quick-reaction capability matches what we see as potential targets"" in the Persian Gulf, a Defense Department official said.

The laser has been tested against and destroyed drones and fast-moving small boats, the official said.



A second defense official said the laser is fully capable of being used against threats even though it is its first deployment.

""The system has been tested and proven. So while it's going on the Ponce as a demonstration, it is a system that can be used in real-world scenarios.""

The first official estimated the cost at roughly $31 million.

""That could go down in the future, accounting for an actual procurement order,"" that official said.

In announcing the laser on Monday, Chief of Naval Research Rear Adm. Matthew Klunder touted the technology.

He said the ""solid-state laser is a big step forward to revolutionizing modern warfare with directed energy, just as gunpowder did in the era of knives and swords.""

He also said it's expected to ultimately save the Navy money.

""Our conservative data tells us a shot of directed energy costs under $1,"" Klunder explained. ""Compare that to the hundreds of thousands of dollars it costs to fire a missile, and you can begin to see the merits of this capability.""

The laser does not require ""unique platforms"" and could potentially be deployed on a variety of ships, one of the officials said. But another also said it does have limitations.

It needs a ""line of sight"" for targeting. ""It does not curve, and cannot go over the horizon,"" the official said.

He also noted that bad weather can affect the beam, but added that ""bad weather can be a factor in many of our current weapons systems"" as well."

A search warrant was executed at the company%27s headquarters in Toano%2C Va.

Another search warrant was also executed at a business location in Richmond

No other information about the details of the search was provided by authorities

RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — Federal authorities on Thursday executed a search warrant at the Virginia headquarters of hardwood flooring retailer Lumber Liquidators.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations spokesman Brandon Montgomery said the warrant was executed at the company's Toano, Va., headquarters and a Lumber Liquidators business location in suburban Richmond in coordination with U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Department of Justice.

No other information about the details of the search was provided and Montgomery said the warrant is sealed. He could not say whether the warrant was related to a particular person or for the company as a whole.

A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia did not immediately return a phone message seeking comment.

In a statement, the company said it is cooperating to provide information and documentation to ""answer questions relating to the importation of certain products.""

Lumber Liquidators Holdings has more than 305 stores in North America.

According to the agency's website, Homeland Security Investigations probes a wide range of domestic and international activities arising from the illegal movement of people and goods into, within and out of the U.S. It investigates immigration crime, human rights violations and human smuggling, smuggling of narcotics, weapons and other types of contraband, financial crimes, cybercrime and export enforcement issues.

In July, Lumber Liquidators said its second-quarter net income jumped nearly 68% to $20.4 million year over year as its revenue rose to $257.1 million and lower costs increased its profit margins. It also announced plans to construct a new East Coast distribution center outside Richmond and lease another facility in California to help make its supply chain more efficient.

Shares of Lumber Liquidators Holdings added $2.16, or 2%, to close Thursday at $112.96. In after-hours trading, the stock fell 2.6% to $110.05. The stock has traded between $47.31 and $115.59 the past 52 weeks, and has more than doubled since the start of the year."

(CNN) - The death penalty should be applied in the case of Dzhokar Tsarnaev, the 19-year-old suspected of participating in the Boston Marathon bombings, Sen. Chuck Schumer said Sunday.

""Given the facts that I've seen, it would be appropriate to use the death penalty in this case and I hope they would apply it in federal court,"" Schumer, D-New York, said on CNN's ""State of the Union.""



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker'] [twitter-follow screen_name='KilloughCNN']

And Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Sunday on Fox News the case should likely be considered a death penalty case under federal law.

While the death penalty is not legal in the state of Massachusetts, it can be used at the federal level.

Tsarnaev, a naturalized citizen, remains in the hospital in serious condition under federal custody. Federal prosecutors hope to charge him as early as Sunday, a Department of Justice official told CNN. Due to his condition, he may be arraigned at the hospital, a law enforcement source said.

Federal prosecutors had been working on preparing terrorism and possibly other charges against him, a Justice Department official told CNN. He's suspected of plotting and carrying out the Boston Marathon bombings along with his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, who died after a shootout with police Thursday night.

Schumer authored the 1994 law that expanded the federal death penalty to include additional crimes. Timothy McVeigh, who was convicted of carrying out the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, received the death penalty. He was executed by lethal injection in 2001.

""This is just the kind of case that it should be applied to,"" Schumer said, referring to the Boston Marathon blasts, which killed three people and injured more than 170 others. The Tsarnaev brothers are also suspected in the shooting death of an MIT officer last week."

Scott Applewhite, file)

WASHINGTON -- How was it that Stanley McChrystal, a revered combat leader who reached the pinnacle of his career as the four-star general commanding the longest and perhaps most complex political-military conflict in American history, fell so fast, so dramatically, so quickly?

And why is it that three and a half years after McChrystal took command in Afghanistan, with yet another new military campaign plan designed to win the war, that the United States seems no closer to a satisfying end to the conflict?

In a new memoir, My Share of the Task, to be published Monday, McChrystal comes at these questions only obliquely. But he acknowledges a critical error: Unlike previous successful wartime leaders -- Dwight Eisenhower comes to mind -- he maintains that he wouldn't and didn't play politics. A reader finishing these nearly 400 pages suspects he disdained the political machinations that in Washington were determining the course of the war he was prosecuting thousands of miles away.

""I resolved to try to steer clear of politics,” he explains. “That wasn't easy."" Nor, he acknowledges, 31 months after he was forced to resign, was it smart.

McChrystal insists that he sought to emulate the traditional ideal of the professional soldier -- to operate as far as possible outside of the sometimes-messy business of backroom statecraft.

But, as his memoir makes clear, his attempt to avoid politics created a deeper problem. In the fall of 2009, McChrystal was assembling an ambitious new counterinsurgency strategy for Afghanistan, just as the Obama White House was struggling to extricate itself from the deeply unpopular war. It was a time of intense and sometimes ugly partisan infighting with leaks and rumors raging through the White House, Pentagon, Capitol Hill and the 24-hour media.

At issue was the very course of the war: Shut it down and bring the troops home, or ramp up the effort to win.

What the nation badly needed at that critical juncture was a wartime commander who could not only inspire troops in battle, but could lead in the political arena as well. It needed a warrior who understood what was possible in Afghanistan and how to do it, someone who could knit together a coalition of support from such antagonists like Vice President Joe Biden, who favored a massive troop withdrawal, and Sen. John McCain, who was thundering for a massive troop increase.

In hindsight, McChrystal writes in an exasperatingly passive voice, ""there were political realities outside my view ... I recognized, perhaps too slowly, the extent to which politics, personalities and other factors would complicate a course that, under the best of circumstances, would be remarkably difficult to navigate.""

That a man so clearly talented -- a brilliant combat leader, most would acknowledge -- a voracious reader of history, a warrior fiercely dedicated, fanatically hardworking, demanding of and tender toward his troops -- could be blindsided by political intrigue and his own missteps, mirrors the ancient truths of Greek tragedy.

There was bad blood between the White House and the military long before McChrystal handed in his resignation in June 2010.

That was hours after Rolling Stone portrayed the lean, four-star commando as ""The Runaway General"" who coerced an intimidated President Barack Obama into sending more warfighters to Afghanistan and then engaged his staff in a few rounds of bashing the clueless civilian-politicians in Washington.

It's hard to imagine how a seasoned professional soldier -- a West Pointer who studied Clausewitz (""War is not merely a political act, but also a real political instrument""), who dramatically expanded and led secretive hunter-killer teams across Iraq and two dozen other countries, who served in Washington as director of the Joint Staff and had risen to four-star rank -- never seems to have developed the political antenna to warn of approaching threats, or to have mastered the basic mechanics of political maneuver.

Things got so bad, McChrystal relates, that he was shocked to find that while he was trying to fine-tune the Afghanistan War strategy, the Obama White House in the late fall of 2009 was still grappling with the question on the minds of most Americans: What exactly was the U.S. trying to accomplish in Afghanistan?

Or, as an exhausted infantryman put it to McChrystal during one of the general's battlefield tours: ""Why are we here, Sir? What's the point?""

At just under 400 pages, McChrystal's memoir, written in 22 months and approved after an exhaustive Pentagon review, never clears up that question -- and dances away from other issues with scant explanation.

Many readers, for instance, might skip to the episode (page 387) in which he and his staff allowed Michael Hastings, a reporter for Rolling Stone -- a magazine known for its anti-war passion -- generous and extended access to their operations and private lives.

Apparently, McChrystal never gave this decision a second thought until he was awakened at 2 a.m. on June 22, 2010, with the news that the article had been published and ""it's really bad.""

His first thought: ""How in the world could that story have been a problem?""

McChrystal takes just a page and a half to recount the incident, from that moment to the president's acceptance of his resignation. Readers will search in vain for an explanation of whether the general and his staff did and said what had been reported; if they did, why; or why precisely they allowed Hastings such unrestricted access. In short, were they guilty, and if so, what the heck were they thinking?

In true stoic warrior form, McChrystal simply takes responsibility: ""Regardless of how I judged the story for fairness or accuracy, responsibility was mine. And its ultimate effect was immediately clear to me.""

In similar fashion, McChrystal skips lightly over issues which deserve fuller explanation.

In April 2004, for instance, Spec. Pat Tillman of the Army's 75th Ranger Regiment was accidentally shot and killed by fellow troops during a firefight in eastern Afghanistan. McChrystal says he immediately advised the Special Operations and Central Commands that an investigation was underway but that early evidence pointed to friendly fire as the cause of his death.

Under intense pressure from the Bush White House, which wanted to portray Tillman as a combat hero, Tillman's family was led to believe that he died courageously under enemy fire. That misleading explanation was drafted by McChrystal's staff and approved by the general.

But he dismisses the entire episode by concluding that ""any errors, which I should have caught, were not the result of any intention to misrepresent or mislead … to this day I am saddened by Ranger Tillman's death, as I am for the loss of every service member I served with, and for the pain such losses cause each family.""

Only rarely in his memoir does McChrystal allow a glimpse behind his public persona as the stoic, unfeeling warrior. In one telling anecdote, he relates going on a daytime raid with Army Rangers on a house of suspected insurgents in Ramadi, Iraq.

The Rangers moved quickly and gathered a group of local men from inside and around the buildings on the concrete parking areas in the front. To ensure security, as they moved to identify each man, they had him lie on the pavement with his hands behind his head. One Iraqi was notably older than the others, and a young Ranger, without instruction, retrieved a white plastic chair for him from an automotive maintenance shop. As was normally the case, even in daytime, there were no women in the immediate area. But I saw a boy, probably about four years old, standing near one of the men, no doubt his father.

As the Rangers motioned for the men to lie down on the ground, I watched the boy. He stood quietly, as if confused, then, mimicking his father, the child lay down on the ground. He pressed one cheek flat against the pavement so that his face was turned toward his father and folded his small hands behind his head.

As I watched, I felt sick.

I could feel in my own limbs and chest the shame and fury that must have been coursing through the father, still lying motionless. Every ounce of him must have wanted to pop up, pull his son from the ground, stand him upright, and dust off the boy's clothes and cheek. To be laid on the ground in full view of his son was humiliating. For a proud man, to seemingly fail to protect that son from similar treatment was worse.

As I watched, I thought, not for the first time: It would be easy for us to lose.

But the war went on. ""We could only hope the residents understood these raids were necessary,"" McChrystal writes, and a few pages later adds: ""Our war demanded relentless focus and a hardening of natural emotions.""

Yet it comes as no surprise that a man who devoted eight years to combat in two brutal and bloody wars, himself the son of an Army general who fought in Korea and Vietnam, feels profoundly the valor of shared sacrifice among men at war. Of war itself, McChrystal has almost nothing to say: no musing, at the end of his long career of service, about why he fought, and to what end, whether in the future the use of violent force could be or should be avoided. Or, more usefully, how to bridge the gap of mistrust between senior military leaders and the civilians they serve.

In a mea culpa of sorts, McChrystal offers that he sought as a senior commander to follow the ethic proposed by Samuel Huntington in his classic 1957 work, The Soldier and the State.

Huntington, McChrystal writes, ""argued that a military commander should endeavor to operate as independently of political or even policy pressures as possible. And yet I found, as much as I wanted my role to be that prescribed by Huntington, the demands of the job made this difficult. The process of formulating, negotiating, articulating and then prosecuting even a largely military campaign involved politics at multiple levels that were impossible to ignore.""

The counterpoint to his distaste for politics is one which readers might ponder. At a time when few Americans volunteer to serve, when the military seems a world away from the American mainstream, he takes just a moment to reflect on the nature of war and the community of those who volunteer to take part in it.

On a long helicopter flight north across Iraq on Christmas Eve 2009, hunched against the cold blast of air from an open hatch, he reflects that this is where he feels most comfortable.

I knew from history that war comes with frightening regularity, often fought over the same ground and similar causes as previous conflicts. Wars often begin with enthusiastic vigor but typically settle into costly, dirty business characterized for soldiers by fear, frustration and loneliness.... I felt the unbroken tradition of commitment to a mission, and a fierce commitment to one another. Like the generation they followed and those they now led, they came forward when called and sacrificed when needed. They did so quietly, often in shadows, with no expectation of reward. They were no better than their grandfathers, and not a bit worse."

The representatives -- all Democrats, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco -- sent a letter to Gov. Jerry Brown urging him to sign the bill if it reaches his desk.

The bill, known as the Trust Act, “establishes a bright line standard between local law enforcement and federal immigration enforcement” and would “continue California’s proud tradition of being a leader on smart and sensible policies,” the letter says.

The representatives said unnecessary deportations have “reduced the willingness of immigrant and non-immigrant crime victims and witnesses to cooperate with local law enforcement, and consequently has diminished public safety.”

Among the letter’s signatories are Reps. Zoe Lofgren and Mike Honda both of San Jose, and recently departed members of the state Legislature now in Washington such as Reps. Alan Lowenthal of Long Beach, Jared Huffman of San Rafael and Julia Brownley of Westlake Village.

The bill (AB 4), authored by Assemblyman Tom Ammiano (D-San Francisco), would limit local law enforcement’s role in working with federal authorities to begin deportation proceedings.

California congressional representatives had urged Brown to sign a previous version of the legislation last year, but the governor vetoed it over concerns it was too broad. It has since been amended to expand the types of crimes and misdemeanors that could trigger the deportation process.

The bill is now awaiting a vote on the Senate floor.

USA TODAY

Washington Post%2C Guardian first reported siphoning of personal data Thursday night

PRISM manages foreign intelligence information collected under Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act

Executives from several tech companies refuted reports they provide direct access to servers to NSA%2C FBI

The National Security Agency's classified PRISM program is an internal government computer system used to manage foreign intelligence collected from Internet and other electronic service providers, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said in a statement Saturday.

The disclosure Saturday marks the most extensive explanation the government has offered of what the program is, how it works and what it is authorized to collect.

Clapper said he declassified the details of the NSA's surveillance and intelligence collection programs ""in hope that it will help dispel some of the myths and add necessary context to what has been published"" about government surveillance of Americans' phone records and foreigners' Internet use.

The National Security Agency and the FBI are siphoning personal data from the main computer servers of nine major U.S. Internet firms, The Washington Post and the London-based Guardian reported Thursday night. Clapper said those reports lacked context about how the program is governed.

The Guardian this week revealed that the government demanded millions of phone records from Verizon. On Saturday, the newspaper reported on a classified NSA data-mining program called ""Boundless Informant"" that allegedly records and analyzes where electronic intelligence comes from. The classified document shows NSA collected nearly 3 billion pieces of intelligence from U.S. computer networks in one month, the paper reported.

""Over the last week, we have seen reckless disclosures of intelligence community measures used to keep Americans safe. In a rush to publish, media outlets have not given the full context — including the extent to which these programs are overseen by all three branches of government — to these effective tools,"" Clapper said.

""PRISM is not an undisclosed collection or data mining program,"" Clapper said in a fact sheet that accompanied his statement.

The system manages foreign intelligence information collected under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, he said. ""The authority was created by the Congress and has been widely known and publicly discussed since its inception in 2008,"" he said.

The program has yielded results, including providing insight into a terrorist organization's strategic planning efforts, intelligence about weapons of mass destruction proliferation networks and information about potential cyberthreats, the fact sheet said.

""This insight has led to successful efforts to mitigate these threats,"" the fact sheet said.

Clapper said Congress ""after extensive public debate"" reauthorized Section 702 in December. He and Attorney General Eric Holder provide ""exhaustive"" reports assessing compliance with targeting to Congress twice a year, Clapper said in the fact sheet. Congress also receives opinions from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, he said, and congressional intelligence and judiciary committees are regularly briefed.

The government ""does not unilaterally obtain information from the servers of U.S. electronic communication service providers,"" Clapper added. ""The notion that Section 702 activities are not subject to internal and external oversight is similarly incorrect. Collection of intelligence information under Section 702 is subject to an extensive oversight regime, incorporating reviews by the Executive, Legislative and Judicial branches.""

The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which meets in secret, approves the information collection and the providers know about it, Clapper said. The decisions are based on ""a written directive"" from Holder and Clapper, the fact sheet said. Eleven federal judges, appointed by the chief justice of the Supreme Court, sit on the court.

""In short, Section 702 facilitates the targeted acquisition of foreign intelligence information concerning foreign targets located outside the United States under court oversight,"" the fact sheet said. ""Service providers supply information to the government when they are lawfully required to do so.""

Executives from Facebook, Google and Apple disputed reports that the companies have provided direct access to their servers for the National Security Agency and the FBI.

To target someone for such intelligence collection, the government must have ""an appropriate, and documented, foreign intelligence purpose,"" such as for the prevention of terrorism, hostile cyberactivities, or nuclear proliferation, and the foreign target must be ""reasonably believed to be outside the United States,"" the fact sheet said. Section 702 prohibits ""intentionally"" targeting any U.S. citizen or anyone known to be in the United States, the sheet said. The agency also cannot target a person overseas if the purpose is to get information from a person inside the United States, the sheet said.

""We cannot target even foreign persons overseas without a valid foreign intelligence purpose,"" the fact sheet said.

If the intelligence community intercepts communications for a person in the U.S., it cannot use the information unless it is needed to understand or assess the importance of foreign intelligence, is evidence of a crime, or indicates a threat of death or serious injury, the fact sheet said.

Targeting decisions are reviewed by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Department of Justice, the fact sheet said."

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/03/25/Defense-Industry-drone-zones,2013-03-25 00:00:00,['Ben Shapiro'],Defense Industry Pushes for 'Drone Zone' over Southern California,"Despite Americans’ concerns about the domestic use of drones, California local agencies are reportedly moving forward with an application to declare a broad swath of Southern California a “drone zone” – an area to be used to test pilotless aircraft. The purpose: government stimulus.

In California, the San Diego Military Advisory Council (SDMAC) and the San Diego Regional Economic Development Corporation (EDC) have filed an application with the Federal Aviation Administration to create a drone zone. These groups want to stimulate state drone business, even as the state raises its taxes repeatedly, driving out other business. Northrup Grumman, a major drone producer, has relocated branches of its unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) program to Southern California. General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, which produces Predator drones, is located in Poway. The UAV industry in San Diego County clocks in at approximately $1.3 billion, and that number is growing fast.

And it’s not just California. The FAA is prepared to greenlight six test zones across the country, and over 40 applications have been filed or will be filed shortly, according to the San Diego Union-Tribune. Applicants include the State Department, the Ohio Department of Transportation, the National Institute of Standards and technologies, and the Grand Forks Sheriff’s Department. The winners of this drone zone sweepstakes will be able to claim a chunk of what may be a $10 billion industry. Senator Harry Reid‘s office says he pushed the FAA program that laid the groundwork for the drone zones. “We had Nevada in mind,” said Reid’s spokeswoman to the Las Vegas Sun. But the zones are bipartisan-approved: Gov. Brian Sandoval (R-NV) is apparently working with Reid and the FAA to try to grab one of the zones.

Ian Gregor, Public Affairs Manager for the FAA Pacific Division, directed Breitbart News to the FAA website’s page on Unmanned Aircraft Systems without further comment. The FAA website describes the goal of the test-site program: “The research done at the test sites will help the FAA develop regulatory standards to foster UAS technology and operational procedures. The effort also will add to the data we need to eventually permit routine UAS operations in the NAS.” The FAA’s press release asking for public input on UAS test-site selection makes no mention of civil liberties. When Gregor was asked via email for comment on whether test sites would rule out urban areas or other areas of population density, he did not respond.

The American Civil Liberties Union is protesting the possibility of such zones, stating, “Unmanned aircraft carrying cameras raise the prospect of a significant new avenue for the surveillance of American life.”

According to reports, 63 drone sites have already been authorized across the country.

(CNN) —

Federal terrorism charges against Boston Marathon bombings suspect Dzhokar Tsarnaev could be filed soon, even as he remains hospitalized, a Justice Department official told CNN on Saturday. The 19-year-old could also face murder charges at the state level.

At the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, where Tsarnaev was in serious condition while being held in federal custody, federal prosecutors were formulating the charges.

The development came amid questions as to what’s next for the suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings.

President Barack Obama said he’s keenly interested in answers.

“There are still many unanswered questions,” Obama said Friday night. “Why did these young men who grew up and studied here as part of our communities and our country resort to such violence? How did they plan and carry out these attacks? And did they receive any help? The families of those killed so senselessly deserve answers.”

Tsarnaev and his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, are accused of setting off bombs at the marathon Monday, killing three people and wounding more than 170.

On Thursday night, they allegedly killed a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer before the older brother was killed during a shootout with police.

Dzhokar Tsarnaev was captured Friday night after he was found hiding in a boat in a backyard in Watertown, Massachusetts.

When will the suspect be in court?

Tsarnaev could be in a courtroom for an arraignment soon.

Ordinarily at an arraignment, the suspect is provided a lawyer, and the defense and prosecution try to make a case for whether he should be released on bail.

“He will not get bail obviously,” said senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin.

“They will set a preliminary hearing that could happen in the next 30 days. He will be indicted with the grand jury. And that’s when the case will begin.”

After the charges are filed, the Federal Public Defender Office in Boston will be appointed to represent Tsarnaev, according to Miriam Conrad, the federal public defender for the Massachusetts district.

Should bomber suspect be questioned without a lawyer?

For now, the government is invoking the public safety exception, a designation that allows investigators to question Tsarnaev without reading him his Miranda rights, a Justice Department official told CNN on condition of anonymity.

In ordinary cases, a suspect is told by police he has the right to remain silent and he has the right to a lawyer.

But this is not an ordinary case, say U.S. Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham.

They urged that Tsarnaev be held as an “enemy combatant,” a designation that allows a suspect to be questioned without a lawyer and without being informed of his Miranda rights.

“Now that the suspect is in custody, the last thing we should want is for him to remain silent. It is absolutely vital the suspect be questioned for intelligence gathering purposes,” the senators said. “Under the law of war we can hold this suspect as a potential enemy combatant not entitled to Miranda warnings or the appointment of counsel.”

But Sen. Carl Levin, D-Michigan, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said Saturday that the suspect should not be held as an enemy combatant.

“I am not aware of any evidence so far that the Boston suspect is part of any organized group, let alone al Qaeda, the Taliban, or one of their affiliates – the only organizations whose members are subject to detention under the Authorization for Use of Military Force, as it has been consistently interpreted by all three branches of our government,” he said.

“In the absence of such evidence I know of no legal basis for his detention as an enemy combatant. To hold the suspect as an enemy combatant under these circumstances would be contrary to our laws and may even jeopardize our efforts to prosecute him for his crimes.”

Alan Dershowitz, a prominent defense attorney and Harvard law professor, scoffed at the Republican senators’ statement.

“Impossible. There’s no way an American citizen committing a domestic crime in the city of Boston could be tried as an enemy combatant,” he told CNN’s Piers Morgan. “It could never happen. And that shows absolute ignorance of the law.”

Dershowitz also said statements made by police in Boston seems to contradict the government’s reasons for invoking the public safety exception.

“The police have said there’s no public safety issue; it’s solved, it’s over,” Dershowitz said. “There are no further threats. But the FBI is saying there’s enough further threats to justify an exception.”

Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani said the federal government may have known about international threats about which state officials were not aware.

“You would have to know the internals of what they have before you can assess whether there is a sensible invocation or not,” Giuliani said.

If the government had prior knowledge of Tsarnaev’s activities, it hasn’t disclosed it. It did say that Tamerlan Tsarnaev had been on the FBI’s radar in the past.

FBI agents interviewed Tamerlan two years ago and also looked at his travel history, checked databases for derogatory information and searched for Web postings. The agency found no connection with terror groups, an FBI official told CNN.

Two key Republicans on the House Homeland Security Committee – Rep. Mike McCaul of Texas, the panel’s chairman; and Rep. Peter King of New York – will press the Obama administration for details about the FBI’s questioning of Tamerlan Tsarnaev, according to a GOP congressional source.

Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was not a U.S. citizen, traveled to Sheremetyevo, Russia, in January 2012, according to travel records provided by a U.S. official. He returned six months later.

Federal or state trial?

Dershowitz said there are many arguments that can be made to try the case in state court. It may be hard for a prosecutor to prove which crimes were committed by Tsarnaev or his older brother, Dershowitz said.

“If he says my intent was to please my brother, they could raise the question of federal jurisdiction,” Dershowitz said.

This fight over federal or state jurisdiction could mean life or death.

Massachusetts does not have the death penalty.

There’s another big question: The National Defense Authorization Act of 2012 requires temporary military custody of certain terrorist suspects, but Dzhokar Tsarnaev is a U.S. citizen, and the act doesn’t apply to Americans.

What is the reaction in the suspects’ homeland?

Tsarnaev’s family lives in the Russian republic of Dagestan, which is next to the suspects’ homeland of Chechnya, located in the North Caucasus region of southern Russia.

Russia’s investigative committee in Dagestan said it will not engage with the Tsarnaev family unless there is “an order from above” to do so, spokesman Rasul Temerbekov told Russian state news agency RIA Novosti on Saturday.

A spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin said Saturday that Russia wants to get official information from the United States about the bombing suspects, and he wants there to be contact between investigators in both countries.

This is not a man who is going to shrink from a fight with the chicken hawks of the Senate.

President Obama hit the right theme in nominating Hagel on Monday to be secretary of defense — the first enlisted man and the first Vietnam veteran to be so honored. “To this day, Chuck bears the scars — and the shrapnel —from the battles he fought in our name,” Obama said during an appearance with Hagel and other officials in the East Room.

“Maybe most importantly,” Obama added, “Chuck knows that war is not an abstraction. He understands that sending young Americans to fight and bleed in the dirt and mud, that’s something we only do when it’s absolutely necessary.”

Behind the men was the Washington Monument, concealed by the East Room’s gold curtains. In front of them, on Pennsylvania Avenue, workers were finishing the parade reviewing stand for Obama’s second inauguration. For the president, who has too often shied from forceful leadership, the Hagel nomination was a welcome sign that he is willing to pick a fight in his second term.

And Hagel is worth fighting for. The Republican former senator from Nebraska should and probably will be confirmed by the Senate, despite irresponsible claims that he is anti-Semitic, anti-Israel, anti-gay and a coddler of Iran. Most of that is false and the rest is irrelevant: As head of the Pentagon, Hagel would not determine foreign policy.

What he would do is lead the people who fight wars — and for that, the old infantry sergeant is uniquely qualified. When he says that war should be the last resort, he speaks with a moral authority that few of those senators who would judge him can match.

In accepting the nomination, Hagel spoke of the troops as his top priority, the “men and women in uniform and their families . . . who have sacrificed so much over more than a decade of war.” The only agenda item he mentioned was to “strengthen our country and strengthen our country’s alliances.”

Alliances were a Hagel trademark in the Senate, where, although he voted to authorize the Iraq war, he became a scalding critic of the George W. Bush administration’s unilateralist policies and bungled prosecution of the conflict. His criticism of the administration antagonized many of his Republican colleagues, who are now returning the favor.

Sen. John Cornyn (Tex.) called Hagel’s record “extremely concerning.” Sen. David Vitter (La.) said Hagel’s confirmation “would send exactly the wrong message.” Sen. Lindsey Graham (S.C.) said Hagel’s views send “the worst possible signal.”

Neither Cornyn nor Vitter lists military service in his biography. Graham was an Air Force lawyer.

Even some Republicans who once praised Hagel view him differently now that Obama has embraced him. When Hagel left the Senate four years ago, Sen. Mitch McConnell (Ky.) praised his “clear voice and stature on national security and foreign policy.” But on Sunday, the Senate minority leader retreated, telling ABC News’s George Stephanopoulos only that Hagel is “outspoken” and that it is necessary to “take a look at all the things that Chuck has said over the years.”

Before he can become Secretary of Defense, Chuck Hagel will likely face sharp questioning in his upcoming confirmation hearings. Post columnist David Ignatius says the confirmation battle could serve as a preview of the most important foriegn policy debates of 2013. (The Fold/The Washington Post)

Hagel, who fought from foxholes, knows better than to expect loyalty from former Senate colleagues, and he reacted with equanimity when neoconservative critics, hearing rumors of his nomination, put out word that he is anti-Semitic. “What a town!” he remarked at the time.

Standing to Obama’s right in the East Room on Monday, Hagel wore a slight frown beneath his droopy eyes as the president lavished praise on him. “As a young private, and then a sergeant, he served with honor alongside his own brother,” Obama recounted. “When Chuck was hit by shrapnel, his brother saved him. When his brother was injured by a mine, Chuck risked his life to pull him to safety.”

Hagel, hands at his side, continued to wear his unimpressed frown as the man he would succeed, Leon Panetta, said Hagel is “a patriot, he’s a decorated combat veteran, and . . . his deep understanding of the security issues facing this country make him the right choice to be secretary of defense.”

Panetta said he will return home to his California walnut farm to deal “with a different set of nuts.”

It will now be Hagel’s task to crack the nuts Panetta leaves behind — beginning with those in the Senate.

If people miss their flights%2C or give up on flying because it%27s a hassle%2C the TSA doesn%27t suffer.

If bombs got through%2C the consequence probably wouldn%27t be higher-ups at TSA losing their jobs.

The TSA is more about %22security theater%22 designed to give the appearance of security.

In the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, the United States took a number of rapid actions. One was the passage of the Patriot Act, which I regarded as a mistake then, and which doesn't seem much better now. Another was the creation of the Department of Homeland Security, a bureaucratic monstrosity that doesn't seem to have done much to keep us actually, you know, safer. And another was the federal takeover of aviation security by the Transportation Security Administration, which also seems to have been a bust.

There's now some talk about repealing or revising the Patriot Act, and the failure of the Department of Homeland Security to do much good seems pretty widely acknowledged. But it's widely accepted -- even by the Government Accountability Office -- that the TSA's army of unionized federal employees is no better, and perhaps worse, than private screeners.

This should come as no surprise. When, as was the case before 9/11, security screeners were contractors employed by airlines, they had every incentive to do a good job: Airlines don't want their planes hijacked or blown up. And they also had every incentive to be speedy and pleasant: Airlines don't want to irritate their customers, or to make flying an unpleasant experience in general.

Federal employees have no such incentives, and it often shows. If people miss their flights, or just give up on flying because it's too much hassle, the TSA doesn't suffer. Even if bombs or hijackers get through, the most likely consequence isn't a bunch of higher-ups at TSA losing their jobs -- when does anybody in the government get fired for failure these days? -- but rather an increased budget and more staff ""to make sure this won't happen again."" The incentives don't align.

Most other advanced nations use private screening services, and their security is just fine -- and, according to most accounts, less of a hassle for travelers. Some American airports, from San Francisco to Jackson Hole, are already trying out that approach. Why not take that national?

One reason, of course, is that the TSA's bloated unionized workforce will oppose it. But the TSA is also one of the most unpopular agencies with the public. What's more, as Bruce Schneier notes, it has never caught a terrorist. It's not about security, but about ""security theater"" designed to give the appearance of security. I think the traveling public has caught on to that, and travelers account for more votes than screeners do.

We wanted to be sure that something like 9/11 could never happen again, but as Brad Todd wrote just a few days after the attacks, that was already made sure of by the passengers' themselves on United Flight 93. As Todd wrote:

Just 109 minutes after a new form of terrorism -- the most deadly yet invented -- came into use, it was rendered, if not obsolete, at least decidedly less effective. Deconstructed, unengineered, thwarted and put into the dust bin of history. By Americans. In 109 minutes. And, in retrospect, they did it in the most American of ways. They used a credit card to rent a fancy cell phone to get information just minutes old, courtesy of the ubiquitous 24-hour news phenomenon. Then they took a vote. When the vote called for sacrifice to protect country and others, there apparently wasn't a shortage of volunteers. Their action was swift. It was decisive. And it was effective.

The 9/11 attacks worked because they caught people -- used to theatrical hijackings that didn't kill anyone -- by surprise. Once Americans figured out this new game, which took, as Todd notes, only 109 minutes, they put an end to it by themselves. The creation of the TSA didn't do any good, and it costs a lot of money, and it does a lot of harm. Put an end to it.

An unmanned drone came within 200 feet of a commercial jet over New York, triggering an FBI appeal to the public for any information about the unusual and potentially dangerous incident.

The crew of Alitalia Flight 608 approaching John F. Kennedy airport on Monday reported the sighting.

“We saw a drone, a drone aircraft,” the pilot can be heard telling air traffic controllers on radio calls captured by the website LiveATC.net.

CNN Explains: U.S. drones

The FAA said it was investigating the incident.

The Alitalia aircraft did not take any evasive action and landed safely.

The FBI expanded on the FAA report, saying in a statement that the Alitalia flight from Rome was roughly three miles from runway 31R when the incident occurred at an altitude of approximately 1,750 feet.

The unmanned aircraft, described by the FBI as black and no more than three feet wide with four propellers, came within 200 feet of the Boeing jetliner.

The FBI said it was looking to identify and locate the aircraft and its operator. A source with knowledge of the incident says investigators interviewed the pilot and others on the Alitalia plane.

“The FBI is asking anyone with information about the unmanned aircraft or the operator to contact us,” said Special Agent in Charge John Giacalone. “Our paramount concern is the safety of aircraft passengers and crew.”

Air traffic controllers warned other planes approaching the JFK runway of the drone report, but at least two other pilots radioed they did not see it.

A spokesman for the New York Police Department was not aware of the incident and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the airport, referred CNN to the FAA.

Unmanned aerial systems, sometimes called drones, and other remote-controlled planes could pose a risk to larger passenger aircraft if they collided or were sucked into an engine.

For recreational hobbyists, flying remote-controlled planes is only allowed by the FAA up to 400 feet, and within sight of the operator. If they are going to fly within three miles of an airport, they have to let air traffic controllers know.

Flying unmanned aerial vehicles is illegal for most business purposes; however, governments and public entities such as police departments can apply for permission to operate them.

The FAA has been working to setup new rules and to safely integrate the use of unmanned aircraft into the national air space, and last year opened an “unmanned aircraft systems integration” office.

USA TODAY

Current adviser Tom Donilon is leaving the administration

Samantha Power is nominated to replace Rice as U.N. ambassador

National security job does not require Senate confirmation

Congressional Republicans may have cost Susan Rice a job as secretary of state, but President Obama has now given her a post that could be more powerful.

In moving Rice from United Nations ambassador to national security adviser, Obama said Wednesday that she ""exemplifies the finest tradition of American diplomacy and leadership.""

She also assumes a job designed to coordinate national security policies along with the State Department, Pentagon and intelligence agencies — a very influential position within what one analyst called a ""White House-centric"" administration.

""It's driven by the very small group of people close to the president,"" said David Rothkopf, CEO and editor-at-large of Foreign Policy magazine.

Rice — a long-time adviser to Obama — ""is already a member of that group,"" Rothkopf said.

The Rice appointment renewed Republican accusations that Obama administration officials sought to cover up details of the Sept. 11 attack on a U.S. facility in Benghazi, Libya. The protests have little effect, however — the national security adviser's job does not require Senate confirmation.

Obama also announced Wednesday that he is nominating former National Security Council aide Samantha Power to replace Rice at the U.N., describing the human rights scholar as ""one of our foremost thinkers on foreign policy.""

Unlike national security adviser job, the U.N. position does require Senate approval.

Rice, 48, will replace Tom Donilon, whose work as national security adviser since 2010 won praise from a president who spoke of "" strengthening our alliances"" and ""enhancing our relationship with key powers.""

The switch comes as Obama prepares for a summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping; Donilon was in Beijing recently preparing for the meeting.

Donilon, 58, will stay on the job until early July, working with Obama on planned trips to Europe and Africa.

His retirement has been expected sometime this year, and Rice has long been considered the top candidate for his replacement.

Obama had considered Rice for secretary of State late last year, but appointed John Kerry instead, in part because of the controversy that surrounding the Benghazi attack that killed four Americans, including U.S. ambassador Christopher Stevens.

Republicans investigating Benghazi have criticized Rice over television interviews she gave five days after the attack, attributing it to protests over an anti-Islam film. After the administration later called it a pre-planned terrorist assault, GOP members accused Rice and others of an attempted cover-up.

Rice said she discussed the attack based on the evidence known at the time, while Obama and aides accused the Republicans of politicizing the tragedy.

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., a potential 2016 presidential candidate, tweeted after Rice's appointment: ""I really question the President's judgment in promoting someone who was complicit in misleading the American public on the Benghazi attacks.""

The Rice appointment may also be a sign that Obama and aides believe the Benghazi investigation is behind them.

""It is certainly a very confident move on the part of the president,"" Rothkopf said.

During a Rose Garden ceremony unveiling his revamped team, Obama noted that Rice put together his foreign policy advisory team ahead of the 2008 presidential campaign.

Describing Rice as ""passionate and pragmatic,"" Obama said that ""everybody understands Susan is a fierce champion for justice and human dignity. But she's also mindful that we have to exercise our power wisely and deliberately.""

In brief remarks, Rice said she was ""deeply honored"" by the appointment, and added that ""we have vital opportunities to seize and ongoing challenges to confront.""

Among those challenges: The U.S. reaction to the civil war in Syria and violence throughout the Middle East, sometimes testy relationships with China and Russia, and completing the end of U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan.

James Mann, author of a book on the administration's foreign policy team called The Obamians, said the national security adviser is often ""more central"" to policy making than the secretary of state, especially in this White House.

""I think Obama wants to be his own decision maker on foreign policy,"" said Mann, author-in-residence with the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University.

One Republican critic — Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., Obama's opponent in the 2008 presidential election — tweeted that while he disagree with the Rice appointment, ""I'll make every effort to work with her on important issues.""

In nominating Power to be the new ambassador to the United Nations, Obama picked a former campaign aide, White House official and author who has specialized in genocide and human rights. As Obama noted, Power, 42, won a Pulitzer Prize for her 2002 book, A Problem From Hell: America and the Age of Genocide.

Power had to leave the presidential campaign in the spring of 2008 after describing then-rival Hillary Rodham Clinton as a ""monster"" who would stop at nothing to defeat Obama. Power apologized for the remark. After the election, Obama put Power on the NSC and made Clinton his first secretary of State.

Power, who was born in Ireland, said the United States plays a critical role in helping the United Nations meet its obligations. ""I have seen U.N. aid workers enduring shell fire to deliver food to the people of Sudan,"" she said. ""Yet I've also seen U.N. peacekeepers fail to protect the people of Bosnia.""

Donilon has worked for Obama throughout his presidency, first serving as deputy national security adviser. Obama appointed him to the top job in October of 2010, following the departure of James Jones.

Obama said Donilon helped improve U.S. relations with Asia, wind down the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, slap new sanctions on Iran, and coordinate the raid that killed 9/11 architect Osama bin Laden in 2011. The president said Donilon handled a wide portfolio that ranged from trade to energy to military security. ""Tom has been instrumental every step of the way,"" he said.

For his part, Donilon praised Obama and thanked him for his appointment, calling it ""the privilege of a lifetime."""

Chuck Hagel of Nebraska to be defense secretary, and top White House counterterrorism adviser John Brennan to be CIA director. Obama pressed the Senate to confirm them quickly, warning ""we don't like to leave a lot of gaps"" in senior national security posts.

""Chuck Hagel is the leader that our troops deserve,"" the president said in a ceremony in the White House's East Room, flanked by the former lawmaker, Brennan, outgoing Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, and acting CIA director Michael Morell.

Obama's announcement was his latest move to round out his second-term Cabinet, following his nomination of Democratic Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry to succeed Hillary Clinton as secretary of state. He is also expected to name a new treasury secretary soon to replace the departing Timothy Geithner.

With both Hagel and Brennan expected to face a fight in the Senate, the president used his remarks to squeeze wary lawmakers.

“I hope that the Senate will act on these confirmations promptly. When it comes to national security, we don’t like to leave a lot of gaps between the time that one set of leaders transitions out and another transitions in,"" Obama said. “So we need to get moving quickly on this.”

Republican resistance to Hagel had been building before the official announcement. And even as Obama spoke, Sen. John McCain, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, which will vet Hagel's nomination, said he had ""serious concerns about positions"" his former colleague ""has taken on a range of critical national security issues in recent years.""

Hagel, who earned two Purple Hearts in Vietnam and still carries shrapnel in his chest, would be the first former enlisted soldier to head the Pentagon. But his nomination has drawn fire from Republican senators, who point to his votes against sanctions on Iran and complaints about the pro-Israel ""Jewish lobby.""

Story continues

Hagel has also moved to defuse objections from the gay and lesbian community over remarks he made in 1998, when he criticized James Hormel, President Bill Clinton's choice for ambassador to Luxembourg, for being ""openly, aggressively gay."" He apologized last week, calling the remark ""insensitive.""

White House officials expect a confirmation fight—but say it is one they will ultimately win. They predict that Hagel, who served two terms in the Senate and left office in January 2009, will face tough questions about administration plans for implementing spending cuts at the Pentagon, the increasingly tense standoff over Iran's nuclear program and the looming troop withdrawal from Afghanistan.

After voting in favor of the Iraq War in late 2002, Hagel infuriated conservatives by turning sharply against then-President George W. Bush's troop ""surge."" His outspoken criticisms drew fire from then-Vice President Dick Cheney.

""Let's say I believe firmly in Ronald Reagan's 11th commandment: Thou shalt not speak ill of a fellow Republican,"" Cheney told Newsweek in an interview. ""But it's very hard sometimes to adhere to that where Chuck Hagel is involved.""

Obama paid tribute to Hagel’s military service, and underlined that the former lawmaker knows that war is “something we only do when it’s absolutely necessary."" And he stressed that Hagel “represents the bipartisan tradition that we need more of in Washington” and predicted he would “speak his mind” from the Pentagon.

Hagel did not address criticisms of his approach to Israel in his remarks at the White House—but had aimed to refute them in an exclusive interview with his hometown Lincoln Journal Star. He insisted that foes of his nomination had “completely distorted” his record and that he had always shown “unequivocal, total support for Israel.”

There is ""not one shred of evidence that I'm anti-Israeli, not one (Senate) vote that matters that hurt Israel,"" he said.

Brennan's nomination to succeed retired Gen. David Petraeus—who left the CIA in November after admitting to an extramarital affair with his biographer—is not expected to face serious opposition. The meatiest parts of his confirmation hearings will likely take place behind closed doors, such as potentially sharp questions from liberal senators over Obama's controversial program of assassinating suspected extremists with drone strikes. Those attacks are deeply unpopular overseas, where they have been blamed for civilian casualties and tarred as violations of national sovereignty. But criticisms will likely focus more on the president's policies than on Brennan's general qualifications for the job.

Few aides, if any, better reflect Obama’s embrace of controversial Bush-era national security policies. After winning the White House in 2008, the president considered Brennan to head the CIA, but Brennan withdrew his name from consideration when it became apparent that his service under Bush had rendered him unconfirmable. Liberal groups had accused him of failing to stop the “enhanced interrogation techniques” that fit international definitions of torture, like waterboarding. In 2012, that connection is apparently no longer a disqualifier.

At the ceremony, the president highlighted Brennan's leadership of the war on al-Qaida and paid tribute to his work ethic: ""I'm not sure he's slept in four years.""

Brennan underlined that he was ""neither a Republican nor a Democrat,"" and vowed to ensure that the CIA ""has the tools it needs"" while pursuing ""a full and open discourse"" with Congress on intelligence activities.

Obama’s decision to go with Hagel comes after the White House backed off a confirmation battle last month over U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice, who was widely seen as the president’s favorite to succeed Clinton. Administration officials assessed that Rice could not be confirmed after centrist Republican Sen. Susan Collins came out against her.

Hagel's biggest obstacle is likely to be his comment, in a 2006 interview, that ""the Jewish lobby intimidates a lot of people up here"" and his follow-up remark that ""I'm not an Israeli senator. I'm a United States senator."" Some of the former lawmaker's critics have suggested that those words mark him as hostile to Israel.

Anti-Defamation League National Director Abraham Foxman said in a statement released Monday that he hoped Hagel would “clarify and explain his comments about the ‘Jewish Lobby’ that were hurtful to many in the Jewish Community” and address “concerns” about his approach to Israel.

Still, Foxman said: “Sen. Hagel would not have been my first choice, but I respect the president’s prerogative.”

Democrats have 55 votes in the Senate (including two independents, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Angus King of Maine). Republicans have 45. Sixty are needed for confirmation.

Panetta and Morell both spoke at the event and warmly endorsed their would-be successors. Panetta brought down the house with a quip about his plans to leave public service after a half-century to spend more time with his family and his walnut farm where, he says, he'd be ""dealing with a different set of nuts.""

My continued liberty has been owed to the efforts of friends new and old, family, and others who I have never met and probably never will. I trusted them with my life and they returned that trust with a faith in me for which I will always be thankful.

On Thursday, President Obama declared before the world that he would not permit any diplomatic ""wheeling and dealing"" over my case. Yet now it is being reported that after promising not to do so, the President ordered his Vice President to pressure the leaders of nations from which I have requested protection to deny my asylum petitions.

This kind of deception from a world leader is not justice, and neither is the extralegal penalty of exile. These are the old, bad tools of political aggression. Their purpose is to frighten, not me, but those who would come after me.

For decades the United States of America have been one of the strongest defenders of the human right to seek asylum. Sadly, this right, laid out and voted for by the U.S. in Article 14 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, is now being rejected by the current government of my country. The Obama administration has now adopted the strategy of using citizenship as a weapon. Although I am convicted of nothing, it has unilaterally revoked my passport, leaving me a stateless person.

Without any judicial order, the administration now seeks to stop me exercising a basic right. A right that belongs to everybody. The right to seek asylum.

In the end the Obama administration is not afraid of whistleblowers like me, Bradley Manning or Thomas Drake. We are stateless, imprisoned, or powerless. No, the Obama administration is afraid of you. It is afraid of an informed, angry public demanding the constitutional government it was promised — and it should be.

I am unbowed in my convictions and impressed at the efforts taken by so many."

He Was Among Post Reporters Awarded The Pulitzer Prize For National Reporting.']",Managing the bomb,"Is the United States entering a period in which it has to learn to live with “the bomb,” as in the spread of nuclear weapons?

Compare the apparent contradiction between the way Washington is dealing with North Korea and Iran and the effect this could have on other countries.

North Korea not only has the capability to produce nuclear weapons (it has conducted three underground tests), but it has also stated an intention to build them. At last month’s plenary meeting of the North Korean Central Committee of the Workers’ Party, “a new strategic line was laid down on simultaneously pushing forward economic construction and the building of nuclear-armed forces,” said a spokesman for North Korea’s General Department of Atomic Energy.

In April 2009, Pyongyang threw out inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency. Since then there has been no monitoring of those facilities. North Korea has been subjected to increasing economic sanctions, but those efforts have not slowed its progress toward a deliverable nuclear weapon.

Yet I haven’t heard any official in Washington, Seoul, Tokyo or Beijing talk about attacking reactors at Yongbyon, where plutonium or uranium are being refined — or any secret facilities that may be making highly enriched uranium.

Meanwhile, Israel and the United States have threatened military action against Iran should Tehran move toward building a nuclear weapon. Israel’s red line is Iran developing the capability to produce highly enriched uranium at its two major facilities at Natanz and Fordow. Both are being visited by IAEA inspectors who report on the level of enrichment being achieved.

The inspections provide the United States and Israel some early warning should Iran suddenly try to break out and produce weapons-grade material. Another tipoff: if Iran told the IAEA to leave.

And although North Korean verbal threats are treated as bluster because they don’t appear to be supported with military action, Iran is seen as an “existential threat.” and its repeated claims that it doesn’t want to build nuclear weapons are dismissed as lies.

Several truths are not being discussed in all of this.

The first is that most people in Iran and North Korea want the prestige that goes with nuclear weapons, although most are paying an economic price. Notice that North Korea’s youthful new leader tied the determination to build nuclear-armed forces with “pushing forward economic construction.”

What most Americans don’t know is that North Korea first sought help from the Soviet Union for a nuclear reactor after the United States threatened to use its nuclear weapons to end the Korean War. Soon after, Pyongyang learned that U.S. nuclear bombs and artillery shells had been stored at bases in South Korea — and the desire for their own weapons increased.

Having nuclear weapons is a popular political issue in Iran. Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi began the nuclear power program with technology and highly enriched uranium provided by the United States for a research reactor. He also had in mind gaining technology for producing a bomb. When the shah was deposed in 1979, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ordered an end to Iran’s nuclear programs.

Ironically, it was U.S. claims that Iraq, Tehran’s enemy, was developing nuclear weapons that led Khomeini to restart his country’s program in 1984. Today, Iran’s neighbors — Russia, India and Pakistan — have nuclear weapons, as do its prime enemies, Israel and the United States.

No wonder the nuclear program appeals to Iranian national pride. In 2009, when President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad tried to calm the United States and other Western countries by appearing to negotiate the future of the nation’s nuclear program, his most vocal opposition came from Iran’s Green Movement leaders, who had worked against his election and feared he would give away too much.

Today there is growing talk in South Korea that the United States should return its tactical nuclear weapons, which were withdrawn in 1991, or that Seoul should develop its own nuclear deterrent.

Even Japan has some legislators talking about dispensing with their longtime principles that bar the possession, manufacture or storage of nuclear weapons on Japanese soil. Shinzo Abe, Japan’s new prime minister, has said that the country’s constitution does not preclude the acquisition of nuclear weapons for tactical defense.

Perhaps it’s time for the United States to at least discuss this possible new reality: No nation, not even the powerful United States, can threaten strong enough economic sanctions or military action against any country whose leaders and public want to build nuclear weapons.

Take the view of Stanford professor Sigfried Hecker, a director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory from 1986 to 1997, who has visited North Korea seven times. He was the person who announced in November 2010 that the Kim Jong Il regime had built a state-of-the-art uranium enrichment facility.

On Tuesday, Hecker said in an interview posted on Stanford’s Center for International Security and Cooperation Web site that North Korea “has a bomb but not yet much of an arsenal.” He said Pyongyang “lacks fissile materials, plutonium or highly enriched uranium to fuel its bombs” and it is for that reason it is threatening to restart its old plutonium reactor and increase the capacity of its uranium enrichment facility.

Given that circumstance, the United States should focus on trying to dissuade the North Koreans from producing more fissile material, rather than trying to get them to totally give up nuclear weapons.

The United States should work toward Pyongyang having “no more bombs, no better bombs and no export,” Hecker said.

“Why would the regime want to launch a nuclear attack when it fully knows that any use of nuclear weapons would result in a devastating military response and would spell the end of the regime?”

That’s deterrence, which worked during the Cold War and I believe will continue to work no matter who has a nuclear weapon, North Korea, Iran, or any other country.

Nations ultimately will have to see this is the only rational way to proceed.

The Federal Aviation Administration said Friday it had issued 1,428 permits to domestic drone operators since 2007, far more than were previously known. Some 327 permits are still listed as active.

Operators include police, universities, state transportation departments and at least seven federal agencies. The remotely controlled aircraft vary widely, from devices as small as model airplanes to large unarmed Predators.

The FAA, which has a September 2015 deadline from Congress to open the nation’s airspace to drone traffic, has estimated 10,000 drones could be aloft five years later. The FAA this week solicited proposals to create six sites across the country to test drones, a crucial step before widespread government and commercial use is approved.

Local and state law enforcement agencies are expected to be among the largest customers.

Earlier this month, TV footage showed a midsized drone circling over the bunker in southeast Alabama where a 65-year-old gunman held a 5-year-old boy hostage. After a tense standoff, an FBI team stormed the bunker, rescued the boy and shot his captor. Authorities refused to say who was operating the AeroVironment drone, which has a 9-foot wingspan.

In Colorado, the Mesa County Sheriff’s Office has used a fixed-wing drone to search for lost hikers in the mountains, and a helicopter drone to help crews battling fires. Flying manned planes or helicopters would cost at least $600 an hour, explained Ben Miller, who heads the program.

“We fly [drones] for less than $25 an hour,” Miller said. “It’s just a new way to put a camera up that’s affordable.”

Big-city police departments, including Los Angeles, have tested drones but are holding back on buying them until the FAA issues clear guidelines about operating in congested airspace, among other issues.

“You’ve got to take baby steps with this,” said Michael Downing, the LAPD deputy chief for counter-terrorism and special operations.

Los Angeles Police Department officials went to Simi Valley in December, he said, to watch a demonstration of a helicopter-like device that measured about 18 inches on each side and was powered by four propellers. It could fly about 90 minutes on its battery.

Downing said the LAPD was “pursuing the idea of purchasing” drones, but wouldn’t do so unless the FAA granted permission to fly them, and until the department could draw up policies on how to keep within privacy laws.

If the LAPD bought drones, Downing said, it initially would use them at major public events such as the Oscars or large protests. In time, drones could be flown to track fleeing suspects and assist in investigations. Tiny drones could even be used to fly inside buildings to shoot video if a suspect has barricaded himself within.

In theory, drones can offer unblinking eye-in-the-sky coverage. They can carry high-resolution video cameras, infrared sensors, license plate readers, listening devices and other high-tech gear. Companies have marketed drones disguised as sea gulls and other birds to mask their use.

That’s the problem, according to civil liberties groups. The technology is evolving faster than the law. Congress and courts haven’t determined whether drone surveillance would violate privacy laws more than manned planes or helicopters, or whether drone operators may be held liable for criminal trespassing, stalking or harassment.

“Americans have the right to know if and how the government is using drones to spy on them,” said Catherine Crump, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, which has called for updating laws to protect privacy.

A backlash has already started.

In Congress, Reps. Ted Poe (R-Texas) and Zoe Lofgren (D-San Jose) introduced privacy legislation Thursday that would require police to get a warrant or a court order before operating a drone to collect information on individuals.

“We need to protect against obtrusive search and surveillance by government and civilian use,” Poe said in a telephone interview. A similar bill failed last year.

Legislatures in 15 states are considering proposals to limit drone use. The City Council in Charlottesville, Va., passed a resolution on Feb. 4 barring local police from using drones — which they don’t yet have — to collect evidence in criminal cases.

In Seattle, Mayor Mike McGinn ordered police to return two Draganflyer X6 helicopter drones earlier this month after privacy advocates and others protested. The police said they had hoped to use them for search-and-rescue operations.

Federal agencies fly drones to assist in disasters, check flood damage, do crop surveys and more. U.S. Customs and Border Protection flies the largest fleet, 10 unarmed Predators, along the northern and southern borders to help track smugglers and illegal immigrants.

Although flying drones might appear as easy as playing a video game, pilots and crews require extensive training.

In 2004 and 2005, the U.S. Marshals Service tested two small drones in remote areas to help them track fugitives, according to law enforcement officials and documents released to the ACLU under the Freedom of Information Act. The Marshals Service abandoned the program after both drones crashed.

Except in rare cases, the military is barred from using drones in U.S. airspace to conduct surveillance or pursue individuals. No state or federal agency has proposed arming domestic drones with weapons, but the prospect has raised alarms in Congress and elsewhere.

In response to a question during an online Google chat Thursday, President Obama said drones had never been used to kill “an American citizen on American soil.”

“The rules outside of the United States are going to be different than the rules inside the United States, in part because our capacity, for example, to capture terrorists in the United States are very different than in the foothills or mountains of Afghanistan or Pakistan,” Obama said.

No drone was sent up to help find suspected killer Christopher Dorner after his truck was found burning near Big Bear Lake on Feb. 7, said Al Daniel, an officer in the aviation division of the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department. But Customs and Border Protection transmitted secure video from a Pilatus PC-12 plane to police commanders on the ground.

Despite a massive manhunt, Dorner vanished and authorities speculated he had escaped to Mexico. Five days later, however, he was found in a snowbound cabin near his truck and died after a shootout and fire.

The long delay, and the embarrassing fact that Dorner was hiding close by the police command post, sparked sharp criticism of police tactics and abilities.

Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, said an aerial drone might have helped find Dorner more quickly.

“The search would have been much wider and quicker because you’d have an unmanned aircraft looking,” he said. “You can cover more ground.”

(CNN) —

A federal judge said Monday that he believes the government’s once-secret collection of domestic phone records is unconstitutional, setting up likely appeals and further challenges to the data mining revealed by classified leaker Edward Snowden.

U.S. District Judge Richard Leon said the National Security Agency’s bulk collection of metadata – phone records of the time and numbers called without any disclosure of content – apparently violates privacy rights.

His preliminary ruling favored five plaintiffs challenging the practice, but Leon limited the decision only to their cases.

“I cannot imagine a more ‘indiscriminate’ and ‘arbitrary invasion’ than this systematic and high-tech collection and retention of personal data on virtually every citizen for purposes of querying and analyzing it without prior judicial approval,” said Leon, an appointee of President George W. Bush. “Surely, such a program infringes on ‘that degree of privacy’ that the Founders enshrined in the Fourth Amendment.”

Leon’s ruling said the “plaintiffs in this case have also shown a strong likelihood of success on the merits of a Fourth Amendment claim,” adding “as such, they too have adequately demonstrated irreparable injury.”

He rejected the government’s argument that a 1979 Maryland case provided precedent for the constitutionality of collecting phone metadata, noting that public use of telephones had increased dramatically in the past three decades.

Leon also noted that the government “does not cite a single instance in which analysis of the NSA’s bulk metadata collection actually stopped an imminent attack, or otherwise aided the government in achieving any objective that was time-sensitive in nature.”

However, he put off enforcing his order barring the government from collecting the information, pending an appeal by the government.

A Justice Department spokesman said Monday that “we believe the program is constitutional as previous judges have found,” but said the ruling is being studied.

Democratic Sen. Mark Udall of Colorado, a critic of the NSA data mining, said Leon’s ruling showed that “the bulk collection of Americans’ phone records conflicts with Americans’ privacy rights under the U.S. Constitution and has failed to make us safer.”

He called on Congress to pass legislation he proposed to “ensure the NSA focuses on terrorists and spies - and not innocent Americans.”

Explosive revelations earlier this year by Snowden, a former NSA contractor, triggered new debate about national security and privacy interests in the aftermath of the September 2001 terrorist attacks.

Snowden’s revelations led to more public disclosure about the secretive legal process that sets in motion the government surveillance.

In a statement distributed by journalist Glenn Greenwald, who first reported the leaks, Snowden said he acted on the belief that the mass surveillance program would not withstand a constitutional challenge, and that Americans deserved a judicial review.

“Today, a secret program authorized by a secret court was, when exposed to the light of day, found to violate Americans’ rights. It is the first of many,” according to Snowden, who is living in Russia under a grant of asylum to avoid prosecution over the leaks in the United States.

Greenwald said the judge’s ruling vindicates what Snowden did.

“I think it’s not only the right, but the duty of an American citizen in Edward Snowden’s situation to come forward, at great risk to himself, and inform his fellow citizens about what it is their government is doing in the dark that is illegal,” the journalist told CNN’s “Anderson Cooper 360” Monday night.

The NSA has admitted it received secret court approval to collect vast amounts of metadata from telecom giant Verizon and leading Internet companies, including Microsoft, Apple, Google, Yahoo and Facebook.

The case before Leon involved approval for surveillance in April by a judge at the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC), a secret body that handles individual requests for electronic surveillance for “foreign intelligence purposes.”

Verizon Business Network Services turned over the metadata to the government.

Leon’s ruling comes as the Obama administration completes a review of NSA surveillance in the aftermath of the Snowden leaks.

CNN’s Jake Tapper reported Monday that tech company executives would meet with President Barack Obama at the White House on Tuesday to discuss the issue.

Obama plans to sit down with Tim Cook of Apple and Eric Schmidt of Google, as well as executives from Twitter, Microsoft, Facebook, Salesforce, Netflix , Etsy, Dropbox, Yahoo!, Zynga, Sherpa Global, Comcast, LinkedIn and AT&T, a White House official said.

Some of those companies issued a joint letter last week calling on the government to change its surveillance policies in the wake of the Snowden revelations.

Last month, the Supreme Court refused to take up the issue when it denied a separate petition, which was filed by the Electronic Information Privacy Center. Prior lawsuits against the broader NSA program also have been unsuccessful.

Days after the Snowden disclosure in June, some Verizon customers filed legal challenges in the D.C. federal court.

The left-leaning American Civil LIberties Union also filed a separate, pending suit in New York federal court.

Under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of the 1970s, the secret courts were set up to grant certain types of government requests– wiretapping, data analysis, and other monitoring of possible terrorists and spies operating in the United States.

The Patriot Act that Congress passed after the 9/11 attacks broadened the government’s ability to conduct anti-terrorism surveillance in the United States and abroad, eventually including the metadata collection.

In order to collect the information, the government has to demonstrate that it’s “relevant” to an international terrorism investigation.

However, the 1978 FISA law lays out exactly what the special court must decide: “A judge considering a petition to modify or set aside a nondisclosure order may grant such petition only if the judge finds that there is no reason to believe that disclosure may endanger the national security of the United States, interfere with a criminal, counterterrorism, or counterintelligence investigation, interfere with diplomatic relations, or endanger the life or physical safety of any person.”

In defending the program, NSA Director Gen. Keith Alexander told the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that “15 separate judges of the FISA Court have held on 35 occasions that Section 215 (of the Patriot Act) authorizes the collection of telephony metadata in bulk in support of counterterrorism investigations.”

Initially, telecommunications companies such as Verizon, were the targets of legal action against Patriot Act provisions. Congress later gave retroactive immunity to those private businesses.

The revelations of the NSA program and the inner workings of the FISC court came after Snowden leaked documents to the Guardian newspaper. Snowden fled to Hong Kong and then Russia to escape U.S. prosecution.

The case is Klayman v. Obama (13-cv-881).

If Mr. Tsarnaev was involved, then the murders may shed light on the crucial question of what may have turned him violent and unstable, and whether that was before he traveled to his homeland in the North Caucasus region of Russia last year.

The recent focus on Mr. Tsarnaev’s possible involvement in the Waltham murders has also raised questions about whether authorities in Massachusetts missed an opportunity to thwart the marathon bombings by not adequately pursuing Mr. Tsarnaev as a murder suspect.

There was no indication on Wednesday why Mr. Todashev — who, like the Tsarnaevs, was an ethnic Chechen — would have implicated himself and Mr. Tsarnaev in the murders. Investigators, who are seeking to determine how Mr. Tsarnaev made money, have been looking into whether Mr. Todashev and Mr. Tsarnaev were drug dealers, one of the law enforcement officials said.

Mr. Todashev had not signed a written statement about the Waltham murders before he was fatally shot. “He had only said it orally but had not signed anything,” said the first official. “But that was where it appeared to be heading.”

The shooting occurred in a sprawling condominium complex in Orlando, less than a mile from an entrance to Universal Studios, where many of the residents work. On Wednesday, several streets in the complex were blocked off by federal and local law enforcement officials.

The law enforcement official said that the authorities had spoken to Mr. Todashev at least twice since the April 15 bombings in Boston, which killed three people and injured more than 200."

Mrs. King carried on her husband’s civil rights activism after he was assassinated.

In a 1991 letter to Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT), Coretta Scott King and other black community leaders argued that illegal immigration would have a devastating impact on the black community. At the time, Hatch was working his U.S. Senate position to undo some enforcement measures laid out in Ronald Reagan’s 1986 amnesty agreement, attempting to weaken interior enforcement and sanctions against employers who hired illegal aliens.

We, the undersigned members of the Black Leadership Forum, write to urge you to postpone introduction of your employer sanctions repeal legislation until we have had an opportunity to report to you what we believe to be the devastating impact the repeal would have on the economic condition of un- and semi-skilled workers–a disproportionate number of whom are African-American and Hispanic; and until we have had the opportunity to propose to you and to our Hispanic brothers and sisters, what we believe could be a number of effective means of eliminating the discrimination occasioned by employer sanctions, without losing the protection sanctions provide for U.S. workers, especially minority workers.

While the members of the Black Leadership Forum wrote they had “divergent views” at the time on the employer sanctions regarding illegal immigration, they wrote they were “united in three respects.”

First, they wrote they were united in being “fully committed to the elimination of the root causes of national origin discrimination under the Immigration Reform & Control Act of 1986 (IRCA) [Reagan’s amnesty], as well as discriminatory impact.”

Second, they said they stood together in their belief that “there are a number of effective ways to remedy discrimination resulting from IRCA, without tampering with employer sanctions. Some measures we support are contained in the Report and Recommendations of the Taskforce on IRCA-Related Discimination and in the 1990 GAO Report on Immigration Reform: Employer Sanctions and Question of Discrimination.”

Third, the writers said they were unanimous in their request for a discussion with Hatch and other members of Congress on “the importance of employer sanctions to the economic security of African Americans and Hispanic workers.”

The black leaders wrote that they feared lack of interior immigration enforcement would lead to future illegal immigration, and the hiring of those illegal immigrants into jobs that could be occupied by black and Hispanic American citizens.

“We are concerned, Senator Hatch, that your proposed remedy to the employer sanctions-based discrimination, namely, the elimination of employer sanctions, will cause another problem–the revival of the pre-1986 discrimination against black and brown U.S. and documented workers, in favor of cheap labor–the undocumented workers,” they wrote. “This would undoubtedly exacerbate an already severe economic crisis in communities where there are large numbers of new immigrants.”

Coretta Scott King and the other black leaders added that they were “concerned that some who support the repeal of employer sanctions are using ‘discrimination’ as a guise for their desire to abuse undocumented workers and to introduce cheap labor into the U.S. workforce.”

America does not have a labor shortage. With roughly 7 million people unemployed, and double that number discouraged from seeking work, the removal of employer sanctions threatens to add additional U.S. workers to the rolls and drive down wages. Moreover, the repeal of employer sanctions will inevitably add to our social problems and place an unfair burden on the poor in the cities in which most new immigrants cluster–cities which are already suffering housing shortages and insufficient human needs services.

The black leaders then called for education reform to train American workers for jobs, rather than immigration reform to bring in foreigners to fill those jobs while American workers suffered. “Senator Hatch, we believe that what this country needs is not to prematurely scrap employer sanctions, but rather, we need education and training programs designed to prepare the unemployed, especially African Americans, Hispanics, and others at great risk, to meet the market demands of tomorrow,” they wrote.

The authors added that while “not a panacea for the nation’s illegal immigration problems, employer sanctions are one necessary means of stopping the exploitation of vulnerable workers and the undercutting of American jobs and living standards.”"

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/25/barack-obama-hecklers-immigration_n_4338945.html,2013-11-25 00:00:00,['Deputy Enterprise Editor'],Obama Confronts Hecklers At Immigration Speech,"WASHINGTON -- Hecklers interrupted President Barack Obama during a speech on Monday to demand he halt deportations, which have risen to record levels during his time in the White House.

""Our families are separated,"" a young man yelled during remarks in San Francisco at the Betty Ann Ong Chinese Recreation Center. ""Mr. President, please use your executive authority to halt [deportations]. We agree that we need to pass comprehensive immigration reform, but at the same time, you have the power to stop deportations.""

""Actually, I don't,"" the president replied, ""and that's why we're here.""

Other people in the crowd began to yell as well: ""Stop deportations. Yes, we can.""

As Obama delivered a speech calling on House Republicans to press forward with immigration reform, the interruption served as a reminder that many advocates are frustrated and ready for the president to take immediate action. Most have been calling for Obama to slow or halt deportations for months or years, but as progress on legislative reform has slowed, they say there's no more time to wait. This year 1,100 people will be forced out of the country each day if removals continue at the same rate as the previous year.

Obama has said that he can't simply halt deportations by executive action, although he did so more narrowly for undocumented young people who entered the U.S. as children. He asked for the hecklers to remain in their seats, and said again that such an action would be illegal.

""What you need to know, when I'm speaking as president of the United States and I come to this community, is that if in fact I could solve all of these problems without passing laws in Congress, then I would do so,"" he said. ""But we're also a nation of laws. That's part of our tradition.""

""So the easy way out is to try to yell and pretend like I can do something by violating our laws,"" he continued. ""What I'm proposing is the harder path, which is to use our democratic process to achieve the same goal that you want to achieve. But it won't be as easy as just shouting. It requires us lobbying and getting it done.""

Before the interruption, the president made his pitch to the House GOP to take up immigration reform to deal with a number of different issues, even if they do it through a more piecemeal approach. ""It's Thanksgiving,"" he joked. ""We can carve that bird into multiple pieces.""

House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) said last week that immigration reform is ""absolutely not"" dead, although without answering questions about the timetable. Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), who previously said immigration bills won't go for votes until next year, said Sunday on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" that reform ""is going to happen in a step-by-step method.""

But so far, it's not clear what pieces House Republicans plan to include. While there are already proposals on border security, high-skilled worker visas and interior enforcement, the GOP has not put any bills on the table to give legal status to undocumented immigrants. House Democrats, joined by three Republicans, introduced a comprehensive immigration reform bill in October and are urging a vote, but House leadership has indicated they won't get one.

A poll released Monday from the Public Religion Research Institute found that 63 percent of Americans support allowing undocumented immigrants to eventually become citizens if they meet certain criteria, while 14 percent said they should be given legal residency without a path to citizenship. Only 18 percent said all undocumented immigrants should be deported.

Obama said he hopes that Boehner will not let a small minority of immigration reform opponents block the process, and called it ""good news"" that the speaker had repeated his commitment to reform last week.

""I believe the speaker is sincere,"" he said. ""I think he genuinely wants to get it done, and that's something we should be thankful for this week.""

CORRECTION: This article has been updated to correct the average number of deportations per day last year. An earlier version listed the daily figure as the total for the year."

Three secret court opinions%2C other classified NSA documents released to the public

Official says documents reveal %22effective self-policing%22 at the NSA

Problems involving %22upstream collection%22 led to NSA scooping up thousands of e-mails from U.S. accounts

WASHINGTON — The nation's top intelligence official on Wednesday declassified three secret U.S. court opinions and other classified documents that reveal how the National Security Agency intercepted thousands of e-mails from Americans with no connection to terrorism.

Director of National Intelligence James Clapper authorized the release and the agency published the documents on a newly created Tumblr page dubbed IC on the Record.

The latest revelations come amid growing criticism from members of Congress and privacy groups about the NSA surveillance programs and charges that the agency has far overstepped its bounds in collecting information on U.S. citizens. There are already bipartisan efforts in Congress to rein in the programs and increase oversight of the intelligence agencies.

The declassification of documents also follows President Obama's call on Clapper in June to release more information about U.S. surveillance programs in response to public outcry, triggered by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden's leaking of details of previously secret intelligence gathering programs.

Some of the documents shine a harsh light on how the NSA operated.

The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, authorized to oversee surveillance requests, first learned in 2011 of problems involving ""upstream collection"" that led to the intelligence community unlawfully scooping up thousands of emails from U.S. accounts over a three-year period. One opinion shows that the NSA reported to the FISA court in 2011 that it inadvertently collected as many as 56,000 Internet communications by Americans with no connection to terrorism.

In the strongly worded 86-page opinion, U.S. District Judge John Bates, who was then the court's chief judge, wrote that the ""volume and nature of the information it has been collecting is fundamentally different from what the court had been led to believe.""

Bates blasted the NSA for mishandling thousands of e-mails from Americans over those three years, and said the NSA's disclosures about its e-mail collection effort ""fundamentally alters the court's understanding of the scope of the collection … and requires careful re-examination of many of the assessments and presumptions underlying prior approvals.''

Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said the latest revelation underscores the need for greater oversight of the intelligence community. Blumenthal has proposed legislation calling for a special advocate to represent the public's interest in the secret FISA court proceedings.

""Now, the question is how many other such unconstitutional practices occurred without the court knowing, and without a special advocate to blow the whistle?"" Blumenthal said. ""This highly intrusive breach highlights the need for reforming the FISA court system to assure greater respect for constitutional rights, and to ensure that the American people have faith and trust in the institutions charged with keeping us safe."""

Here is how Nobel Laureate Paul Krugman summarizes Bush's legacy in a 27-Apr-2013 post on his NYT blog:



The Great Degrader I’ve been focused on economic policy lately, so I sort of missed the big push to rehabilitate Bush’s image; also, as a premature anti-Bushist who pointed out how terrible a president he was back when everyone else was praising him as a Great Leader, I’m kind of worn out on the subject. But it does need to be said: he was a terrible president, arguably the worst ever, and not just for the reasons many others are pointing out.

Think about his two main “achievements”, if you want to call them that: the tax cuts and the Iraq war, both of which continue to cast long shadows over our nation’s destiny. The key thing to remember is that both were sold with lies. ... their selling of the [tax] cuts offered what amounted to an expert class in how to lie with statistics. Basically, every time the Bushies came out with a report, you knew that it was going to involve some kind of fraud, and the only question was which kind and where. And no, this wasn’t standard practice before. Politics ain’t beanbag and all that, but the president as con man was a new character in American life.

Even more important, Bush lied us into war. Let’s repeat that: he lied us into war. I know, the apologists will say that “everyone” believed Saddam had WMD, but the truth is that even the category “WMD” was a con game, lumping together chemical weapons with nukes in an illegitimate way. And any appearance of an intelligence consensus before the invasion was manufactured: dissenting voices were suppressed ... ... right there you have something that should block Bush from redemption of any kind, ever: he misled us into a war that probably killed hundreds of thousands of people, and he did it in part for political reasons. There was a time when Americans expected their leaders to be more or less truthful. Nobody expected them to be saints, but we thought we could trust them not to lie about fundamental matters. That time is now behind us — and it was Bush who did it.

In addition to the usual list of policy catastrophes, Krugman thinks Bush infected us with an enduring malignancy:And,PK is not mincing words."

The recent revelations about the National Security Agency's vast powers of surveillance have served to reaffirm, if any such thing was needed, the value of leaks and whistleblowers to both journalism and to democracy.

On Wednesday morning, Americans knew next to nothing about the extent to which their government was collecting data about them. By Friday morning, the country's director of national intelligence had confirmed the existence of a program that, in the words of the Washington Post, involved the NSA ""tapping directly into the central servers of nine leading U.S. Internet companies, extracting audio and video chats, photographs, e-mails, documents, and connection logs that enable analysts to track foreign targets.""

Americans learned about these things because there were people inside the government who were willing to leak them, and journalists who were willing to report on them. At a time when the Justice Department's surveillance of journalists has aroused deep anger, the flood of new information about the NSA's activities is a reminder of the vital need for those journalists to be able to do their jobs without fear.

The Guardian's explosive piece on Wednesday about the NSA's continual tracking of Verizon customers was a classic leak story. Glenn Greenwald, the blogger who broke the news for the paper, told the Times that his source was ""a reader of mine"" who ""knew the views that I had and had an expectation of how I would display them.""

That leak then inspired more reporting, as leaks often do. People could watch media outlets trying to outgun each other on Thursday as they sought to round out the story of the surveillance programs.

They could read the Wall Street Journal's report that AT&T and Sprint were also involved in the data-mining program, or watch an NBC News segment which said that ""a secret surveillance program is collecting the telephone records of every single one of us.""

They could learn that two senators had been sending cryptic warnings to them for years about how horrified they might be if they learned about the extent of the surveillance.

They could hear people they had voted into office admit that the program had been ongoing for seven years.

On Thursday, the Post and the Guardian upped the stakes when they reported about the so-called ""PRISM"" program that accessed the Internet companies (including AOL, HuffPost's parent company). Again, it was a classic whistleblowing case, as the Post vividly reported.

The paper identified its source as a ""career intelligence officer"" who had been horrified about what he was seeing:

Firsthand experience with these systems, and horror at their capabilities, is what drove a career intelligence officer to provide PowerPoint slides about PRISM and supporting materials to The Washington Post in order to expose what he believes to be a gross intrusion on privacy. “They quite literally can watch your ideas form as you type,” the officer said.

It appears likely, if reports are to be believed, that that officer will be hunted down by the government whose secrets he has just exposed.

All of this information was completely secret on Wednesday morning. Two days later, the entire federal government apparatus had been forced to acknowledge its existence, and hundreds of millions people were much more aware of the huge size of the American surveillance state. As the Associated Press's Matt Apuzzo tweeted, ""THIS is why America needs 'leakers.'"""

You don’t want to make the survivor fit into the program. You want to work with the programs to meet the needs of the survivors and the affected communities.”"

Putin says Snowden can stay if he stops leaking intel

Snowden letter thanks Ecuador for help getting to Russia

There are unconfirmed reports the NSA bugged EU offices

MOSCOW — Russian President Vladimir Putin said earlier Monday that Snowden would have to stop leaking U.S. secrets if he wanted to be granted asylum in Russia, where Snowden has been hiding out for eight days.

Putin insisted that Russia is not going to extradite Snowden to the USA, refusing a demand from President Obama that he be handed over to the USA to face charges of espionage.

""There is one condition if he wants to remain here: He must stop his work aimed at damaging our American partners. As odd as it may sound coming from me,"" Putin told a news conference in Moscow.

""Russia has never extradited anyone and is not going to do so,"" Putin said, adding that Snowden, ""should choose his final destination and go there.""

Snowden released a statement Monday through the web site WikiLeaks critical of Obama for asking Russia to send him back after he said the president vowed not to engage in ""wheeling and dealing"" over his return.

""This kind of deception from a world leader is not justice, and neither is the extralegal penalty of exile,"" stated Snowden, who U.S. passport has been revoked. ""These are the old, bad tools of political aggression. Their purpose is to frighten, not me, but those who would come after me.""

Obama said last week that he would not offer special inducements to other nations over a routine matter of law enforcement that should be honored as part of international law. He has said the NSA secret surveillance programs that Snowden made public are legal and proper, aimed only at disrupting terrorist plots.

Snowden insisted Monday that he is a whistle-blower who should be allowed to go where he pleases and compared himself to Army Pvt. Bradley Manning, who is being court-martialed for sending secret diplomatic communications on Iraq and Afghanistan to WikiLeaks.

The 30-year-old Snowden still appears to be holed up in Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport, where he landed after fleeing Hong Kong. Interfax news agency quoted consular desk official Kim Shevchenko as saying that British citizen Sarah Harrison -- an aide to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange -- asked the Russian Foreign Ministry on Monday to grant Snowden political asylum.

The reported request comes after Ecuador hedged on whether it would grant Snowden protection as it has Assange, who is hiding out in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London to avoid extradition to Sweden on rape charges. The Los Angeles Times reported Monday that Snowden had given Russian diplomats a list of 15 countries to which he would like to apply for political asylum.

Meanwhile, the office of Germany's federal prosecutor said it is launching a preliminary inquiry into allegations from Snowden that U.S. intelligence agencies tapped European communication channels.

German news weekly Der Spiegel set off a diplomatic row when it reported that the NSA had bugged EU offices in Washington, New York and Brussels. The report cited secret U.S. documents allegedly obtained by the Snowden before he fled the United States.

Germany said it planned to call in the U.S. ambassador for an explanation over the ""breach in trust.""

""We're no longer in the Cold War,"" government spokesman Steffen Seibert told USA TODAY. ""Eavesdropping on friends is unacceptable.""

Seibert said the government will assess the facts to determine whether there had been a breach of national security. Secretary of State John Kerry said he did know all the particulars about allegations that the U.S. bugged EU offices. But he says many nations engaged in international affairs undertake lots of different kinds of activities to protect their national interests.

""The (German) foreign ministry must be shocked and horrified that it was put in with that company,"" said Ben Tonra, a professor at the University College Dublin who specializes on European security issues.

Tonra said European leaders are well aware that all governments including their own spy on each other, but the revelations if accurate could force European governments to react publicly in ways that harm relations.

Other European officials reacted angrily to Der Spiegel reports that the NSA was spying on the European Union including the Justus Lipsius building in Brussels -- home to the European Council.

""We still need more information, but If it's true, it's a huge scandal,"" said Martin Schulz, head of the European Parliament. ""It means a huge strain on relations between the EU and the U.S. and we now demand a comprehensive explanation.""

Snowden indicated he may reveal more about the NSA programs that he gained access to while working for a private contractor that provided analytical services to the NSA.

""I remain free and able to publish information that serves the public interest,"" Snowden said in an undated Spanish-language letter sent to President Rafael Correa of Ecuador, seen by Reuters.

U.S. Atty. Carmen Ortiz indicated in a news conference Friday night that investigators planned to question Tsarnaev without the standard reminder of his rights to remain silent and to request a lawyer. That could make him the first test of a two-year-old Justice Department policy expanding emergency exemptions when questioning terrorism suspects.

Ortiz’s statement brought criticism from the left and right. Civil libertarians said the decision would erode civil liberties for everyone. But some Republicans said that it did not go far enough, and that Tsarnaev should be treated as an enemy combatant.

“The accused perpetrators of these acts were not common criminals attempting to profit from a criminal enterprise, but terrorists trying to injure, maim and kill innocent Americans,” Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) and Rep. Peter T. King (R-N.Y.) said in a joint statement. Conservatives have long demanded that terrorism suspects not be tried in federal courts.

Ortiz invoked a newly expanded version of the so-called public safety exception to Miranda warnings. The Supreme Court formulated the warnings in 1966 and created a public safety exception in 1980, saying police could interrogate suspects, and use their statements against them, if the lives of police or the public were in danger.

In 2011, after intense criticism of the Justice Department’s handling of the so-called “underwear bomber,” the department expanded the use of the public safety exception in domestic terrorism cases so that it could be invoked in exceptional circumstances even when there was not an imminent safety threat. The changes were made after the suspect in the Dec. 25, 2009, airline bombing attempt, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, was questioned for less than an hour before being read his rights.

The American Civil Liberties Union said in a statement that “every criminal defendant” is entitled to the Miranda warning, noting that Tsarnaev became a naturalized American citizen: “The public safety exception should be read narrowly. It applies only when there is a continued threat to public safety and is not an open-ended exception to the Miranda rule.... Denial of rights is un-American and will only make it harder to obtain fair convictions.”

Neal K. Katyal, professor of national security law at Georgetown University and acting solicitor general of the U.S. from May 2010 to June 2011, said invoking the exemption seemed “absolutely appropriate” in this case.

“At least right now, it is right for law enforcement not to be so concerned with self-incrimination and to be more concerned with gathering intelligence,” Katyal said.

The Miranda issue may turn out to be less than crucial. Between the videotape allegedly showing Tsarnaev setting down the bag at the marathon, the shootout with police in which his brother died, and evidence police reportedly found in his apartment, prosecutors probably have a strong case already.

But Graham and McCain said Tsarnaev should stay out of the courts altogether. “We need to know about any possible future attacks which could take additional American lives,” they said. “The least of our worries is a criminal trial which will likely be held years from now.”

Legal experts said there was no basis to treat Dzhokhar Tsarnaev under the law of war because investigators had disclosed no evidence that he was acting on behalf of a foreign terrorist organization.

“With all due respect to the senators, the absence of a relationship to Al Qaeda is absolutely fatal to any ability to subject them to noncivilian trials,” said Stephen Vladeck, a law professor at American University.

“Are we really going to entertain the idea that whenever we have a big bomb go off in America the first thing that happens is the military takes over? Is that what we really want?” said Bobby Chesney, professor of national security law at the University of Texas School of Law, in a telephone interview.

Rand Paul for highlighting an important issue by using his prerogative as a U.S. senator to launch a good, old-fashioned filibuster on John Brennan’s nomination for CIA director.

As I’ve written previously, it seemed earlier that he might be off on a couple of points of constitutional law. In the rarest of circumstances, a President has power, under Article II of the Constitution, to launch a military strike on American soil–but only if that American citizen has taken up arms against his country and poses an imminent threat to American lives. He must be, legally, a military target. And it must be a situation so urgent–a Jack Bauer-type scene from 24–that there isn’t even time for federal agents to get into place to capture the terrorist.

But his overall point is correct: We are witnessing repeated power grabs by an Imperial President. And he is correct that, when non-combatants are involved (American citizens who may sympathize with terrorists but are not involved in actual or imminent attacks on our fellow citizens or homeland) the Bill of Rights applies with full force, and no President can step outside the court system under those circumstances.

But it’s different where combatants are concerned. A man who takes up arms against this country–not as a criminal but as a warrior–becomes a military target if, and only if, he is actually engaged in operations against America.

Last night, Paul made follow-up comments suggesting that, if the U.S. citizen in question actually posed an imminent threat to American lives, a President could take whatever actions were necessary to stop him. If so, we’re all on the same side of this debate.

It also must be noted that it’s hard to conceive of how such an imminent threat could happen on American soil. It happens in James Bond movies, but unless the traitor has a remote-controlled guided missile, he must approach some populated area before he can cause harm. If he’s close enough to set off a bomb, he’s probably close enough for police and federal agents to intercept him.

But enough people are supporting Rand Paul that it’s important to pick out a couple points on the margins. Most of what Paul is saying is right, but it’s worth noting where he’s saying something that many of his supporters are not, or saying something that’s wrong.

First, Paul acknowledged that the military can act in a war zone, and that we’re in war zones overseas. Some of Paul’s supporters are holding onto the idea that there has not been a legal war since World War II, and that both wars in the past quarter-century (in Iraq and Afghanistan) are unconstitutional.

Evidently, Paul disagrees (and rightly so), since a war zone only exists in a war. Not only that, but Paul sponsored legislation to de-authorize the war overseas. To end a war means that there is one currently underway, and to attempt to rescind Congress’ authorization for war means that Congress had previously authorized war, pursuant to the Declare War Clause of the Constitution.

Second, Paul said today, “I personally don’t think it would be very hard to try someone for treason.” Actually, it is extremely hard to convict someone of treason. The Constitution requires two eyewitness to the treasonous act. If you have an American-born terrorist in a foreign land, like Anwar Al-Awlaki who was hiding in Yemen and launching terrorist attacks, we could go for many years and never have eyewitnesses.

Sometimes traitors cannot be successfully convicted of treason and, ironically, it’s for a reason Rand Paul supports. It’s so no President could even try to get his political opponents convicted of treason as a trumped up charge. You must have people who actually saw the traitor take up arms against this country or directly aid those who did.

Third, Paul also referenced people who “denounced their citizenship” still deserving all the constitutional protections. Although many rights extend to all persons, whether citizens or foreigners, the United States can deal with enemies who are not citizens in a much deadlier fashion than citizens.

If someone has denounced their citizenship, then they are no longer American. It’s unclear from his comments whether Paul realizes that, or perhaps merely mispoke. It’s likewise unclear whether he recognizes the distinction between military operations and law enforcement, and between domestic and foreign operations. We’ll probably learn those things in the coming days.

But one of his points is so true it bears repeating: How do we end this war? Is this perpetual war, covering the entire globe? The Constitution gives Presidents broad powers to win a war. The idea of Presidents permanently claiming this power against an undefined enemy and then exerting those powers on our home soil is a profoundly disturbing thought — one that can endanger liberty itself for all Americans.

I’m not sure any of us know the perfect way out of that situation, though I’m sure we’re going to debate our options.

And that’s because Rand Paul was willing to actually follow through with a filibuster, and because many other senators committed to the Constitution–including other young and recent additions to the Senate, like Mike Lee and Ted Cruz–are backing that play as well.

So the Senate might have moved a step back in the direction of deserving the title of the world’s greatest deliberative body.

If Mr. Tsarnaev was involved, then the murders may shed light on the crucial question of what may have turned him violent and unstable, and whether that was before he traveled to his homeland in the North Caucasus region of Russia last year.

The recent focus on Mr. Tsarnaev’s possible involvement in the Waltham murders has also raised questions about whether authorities in Massachusetts missed an opportunity to thwart the marathon bombings by not adequately pursuing Mr. Tsarnaev as a murder suspect.

There was no indication on Wednesday why Mr. Todashev — who, like the Tsarnaevs, was an ethnic Chechen — would have implicated himself and Mr. Tsarnaev in the murders. Investigators, who are seeking to determine how Mr. Tsarnaev made money, have been looking into whether Mr. Todashev and Mr. Tsarnaev were drug dealers, one of the law enforcement officials said.

Mr. Todashev had not signed a written statement about the Waltham murders before he was fatally shot. “He had only said it orally but had not signed anything,” said the first official. “But that was where it appeared to be heading.”

The shooting occurred in a sprawling condominium complex in Orlando, less than a mile from an entrance to Universal Studios, where many of the residents work. On Wednesday, several streets in the complex were blocked off by federal and local law enforcement officials.

The law enforcement official said that the authorities had spoken to Mr. Todashev at least twice since the April 15 bombings in Boston, which killed three people and injured more than 200."

USA TODAY

President Obama is still considering the ""zero option"" in Afghanistan -- no U.S. troops there after 2014.

While the two countries have talked about keeping a residual U.S. force in Afghanistan after combat operations end in 2014, The New York Times reports Tuesday that Obama is ""giving serious consideration"" to pulling out all U.S. troops after next year because of frustration over his dealings with Afghanistan counterpart Hamid Karzai.

The latest source of Obama-Karzai friction: New U.S. peace talks with the Taliban.

Administration officials have discussed the possibility of the so-called ""zero option"" in Afghanistan throughout the year.

During a conference call with reporters in January, deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said ""we wouldn't rule out any option"" on post-2014 troop levels, including zero.

""The U.S. does not have an inherent objective of 'X' number of troops in Afghanistan,"" Rhodes said at that time.



From The New York Times:

""Mr. Obama is committed to ending America's military involvement in Afghanistan by the end of 2014, and Obama administration officials have been negotiating with Afghan officials about leaving a small 'residual force' behind. But his relationship with Mr. Karzai has been slowly unraveling, and reached a new low after an effort last month by the United States to begin peace talks with the Taliban in Qatar.

""Mr. Karzai promptly repudiated the talks and ended negotiations with the United States over the long-term security deal that is needed to keep American forces in Afghanistan after 2014.

""A videoconference between Mr. Obama and Mr. Karzai designed to defuse the tensions ended badly, according to both American and Afghan officials with knowledge of it. Mr. Karzai, according to those sources, accused the United States of trying to negotiate a separate peace with both the Taliban and their backers in Pakistan, leaving Afghanistan's fragile government exposed to its enemies."""

USA TODAY

WASHINGTON — With the announcement on Saturday that the U.S. and Russia have reached an agreement on securing Syria's chemical weapons stockpile, the American threat of U.S. military action was effectively taken off the table.

After more than two weeks of saber-rattling — and an unsuccessful effort by President Obama to win congressional and public support for a limited military strike — it was a last-minute diplomatic push led by the Russians that saved the day.

But the Obama administration is wading into the deal — which will undoubtedly be scrutinized by a Congress that is distrustful of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Syrian President Bashar Assad — with eyes wide open.

""The international community expects the Assad regime to live up to its public commitments,"" Obama said in a statement Saturday afternoon. ""While we have made important progress, much more work remains to be done.""

Secretary of State John Kerry was even more blunt about U.S. caution.

""We have committed to a standard that says verify and verify,"" Kerry said at news conference in Geneva, where he and his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, announced the framework of the agreement to secure and destroy the Syrian chemical weapons stockpile.

In previous comments, Obama has made clear that trusting the Russians and Assad will not be easy.

The president's relationship with Putin is famously tense, with the two sparring over Syria policy and Putin's decision to give temporary asylum to former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden after he leaked a treasure trove of classified information on U.S. intelligence surveillance practices.

And the Russian president didn't engender any American confidence when he penned a commentary in The New York Times earlier this week in which he slammed Obama for speaking of American exceptionalism in making his case for military action against Syria and made the dubious claim that the rebels were responsible for chemical attacks against it own people.

""We are not just going to take Russia and Assad's word for it. We need to see concrete actions to demonstrate that Assad is serious about giving up his chemical weapons,"" Obama said in his weekly radio address that aired Saturday morning and was taped ahead of the deal being announced.

Among the fine details of the deal, which was hatched out over three days by Kerry and Lavrov, are: Syria's chemical weapons stockpile must be removed or destroyed by 2014, international inspections will begin by November, and the Syrians will offer full disclosure of its arsenal within a week.

The two sides also agreed that any potential violations by the Syrians would be taken to the United Nations Security Council — where the Russians have veto power — for response.

That element of the deal allows both sides to claim that they stood their ground on potential use of force for further violations by the Assad regime. Putin said it was unrealistic for the Americans to call on Assad to hand over weapons when facing the threat of military action, while Obama has refused to cede his authority to take such action.

If the framework is implemented, it would meet Obama's goals of taking away the Assad regime's ability to conduct another chemical attack. But the White House will have a harder time making its case that it truly held Assad responsible for carrying out the brutal Aug. 21 attack that killed 1,400 Syrian civilians on the outskirts of Damascus.

Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that under the terms of agreement ""Syria's willingness to follow through is very much an open question.""

The deal is far from perfect, and requires the administration to take a leap of faith in trusting the Syrians and Russians to keep their part of the deal.

But for Obama, it offered the best way out of his unpopular call for military action.

""Obama is a winner on this substantively, but the optics on this are bad,"" said Jim Walsh, an expert on international security at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's security studies program. ""Syria doesn't get bombed, and Assad is happy about that. The Russians are winners because they look like they are birthing a diplomatic solution to what was going to be another war in the Middle East.

""Obama is not going to get credit for this because of his critics at home, but on the substance it is a win,"" Walsh added.

After the last two weeks, the White House will take it."

WASHINGTON (CNN) - Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham continued their all-out verbal assault on the Obama administration's handling of the Syria crisis, disparaging Saturday's U.S.-Russian agreement as ""morally and strategically indefensible.""

""It requires a willful suspension of disbelief to see this agreement as anything other than the start of a diplomatic blind alley,"" the senators said in a joint statement, ""and the Obama administration is being led into it by Bashar Assad and Vladimir Putin.""



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker'][twitter-follow screen_name='jhseher']

Calling the agreement ""meaningless,"" the Republican members of the Senate Armed Services Committee lambasted the White House's latest attempt to walk the country back from the brink of a military confrontation with the Syrian government.

Russia and the United States announced Saturday that they have reached a groundbreaking deal on a framework to eliminate Syria's chemical weapons.

Syria must submit within one week a comprehensive list of its chemical weapons stockpile, Secretary of State John Kerry said, and international inspectors must be on the ground no later than November.

McCain, of Arizona, and South Carolina’s Graham criticized the pact as the latest use of rhetorical gymnastics by the Oval Office, an evolution that has seen President Barack Obama go from labeling Syrian President Bashar al-Assad a ""menace (that) must be confronted"" to, in the words of McCain and Graham, ""our negotiating partner.""

""This agreement does nothing to resolve the real problem in Syria,"" the two said. ""[Assad] can go on slaughtering innocent civilians and destabilizing the Middle East.""

McCain and Graham have both advocated for a more muscular response to the Syrian government's alleged use of chemical weapons on August 21, recommending the administration provide more weapons to moderate opposition groups.

In the statement, the senators reiterated that ""significantly"" increasing the United States' support to vetted opposition forces inside Syria is the only thing capable of turning the tides of the raging civil war and creating ""real conditions for a negotiated end to the conflict.""

For the longtime senators, Saturday's agreement is more evidence that the Obama administration is unwilling to do what's necessary to stop the al-Assad regime, and now has fully retreated from its previous position of stating the Syrian despot ""must go.""

""Assad will use the months and months afforded to him to delay and deceive the world using every trick in Saddam Hussein's playbook,"" McCain and Graham said.

The senators blasted the proposed accord, which would not explicitly threaten the use of force if the al-Assad regime failed to place its chemical weapons stockpiles under international control, as ""an act of provocative weakness.""

Beyond the agreement's impact for Syria, the Republican duo say the developments underscore the United States' waning influence abroad and the president's poor stewardship of national security interests. McCain and Graham say Obama's reluctance to lead a more robust response will further embolden Syria's neighbor, Iran, to continue flaunting U.S. warnings about its nuclear program.

""We cannot imagine a worse signal to send to Iran as it continues its push for a nuclear weapons,"" the statement read.

While McCain and Graham sharply rejected the framework agreement, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee weighed in favorably on the outcome of the talks between Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, praising the accommodation as ""significant progress.""

Sen. Carl Levin, D-Michigan, disagreeing with McCain and Graham's assessment, said the pact is ""enforceable"" and that he believes it will achieve ""an even better outcome than the goals of the authorization approved just a few days ago.""

Levin also backed the administration's handling of the negotiations. Unlike the Republican chorus headlined by McCain, Graham and Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker, Levin said the accord represents a strategic victory for the United States over their Russian and Syrian counterparts. Levin also insisted that the framework still leaves a military response on the table and that the Obama administration ""remains prepared to act.""

""Russia and Syria sought two things in any agreement: a promise on our part not to use military force, and an end to international support for the Syrian opposition,"" Levin said. ""This agreement includes neither item."""

Elected amid (or possibly because of) a financial crisis, the Panic of 2008, President Obama has spent his time in office lurching from disaster to disaster.

Obama’s reflexes, praised instinctive timing and audacious as a candidate, turn out to be poorly suited to high office. Obama has been mostly reactive and mostly captive to events. Veering here and there is part of being president. The world is big and dangerous and governance is hard. But watching Obama govern is like watching a distracted man flipping through television channels and all of it bad.

“If I had a son, he would look like Trayvon.”(flip) Never mind. (flip) We must bomb Syria now! (flip) Er, scratch that. (flip) Al Qaeda is on the run. (flip) It depends on what you mean by “core al Qaeda.” (flip)



Some of the crises have been self-inflected, and sometimes even intentional. Obama’s signature health law, for example, was born of a crisis in Congress. As support for the entitlement long sought by liberals was fracturing, even with Democrats in complete control of Washington, the president jammed the throttle down. The crisis of confidence demanded that a poorly constructed law be passed. Now! Now! Don’t think. Don’t read. Just vote.

That decision, of course, has led to other crises. The one playing out now is the risible implementation of the law. Democrats are all dripping with glib swipes about how Republicans have been waging a very messy civil war amid the partial government shutdown. But the Democrats are pushing their confident chuffles through gritted teeth. They know that the launch has been damaging, and if unrepaired, possibly fatal to the law. However the current budget debacle ends, the ObamaCare debacle has just begun.

The president compared the launch to an iPhone. More like Project Orca.

In an era of divided government precipitated by Obama’s crisis-based strategy for enacting a sweeping new health entitlement, Obama has remained crisis dependent to keep the government operating. In the 34th consecutive month of fiscal cliff diving, Obama is a self-described hostage. He vows he won’t negotiate, but then he does. He vows there will be no concessions on ObamaCare, and then lays the groundwork for accepting changes. He can’t help it, Obama says to his base, it’s a… well, you know.

The missives from the White House on this crisis, like most of the ones before, read like regrets. It would have been better if not for ________.

Republicans, meanwhile, can hardly even summon the will to govern by crisis. They are so focused on affixing blame for what they all expect to be a total rout that they seldom do anything so far sighted that it could even be called opportunistic. While the supporters of former Sen. Jim DeMint’s assault on Republican congressional leadership assure supporters that the rout would have been worse if they had not drawn first blood, the defenders of the political establishment all say that they all had a secret plan to scupper ObamaCare, if only Sen. Cruz hadn’t started talking.

The truth is that both alternate versions of history rely on wishful thinking. For the establishment, the canard hangs on the idea that the liberal press would have suddenly become obsessed with how bad Obama’s law was working out. No way. For the DeMintists, the presupposition is that if the leadership had only gone along that there might have been a popular uprising in favor of “defunding” the president’s law.

Wishful thinking on both sides of the Republican divide has left the GOP in the unhappy position of reacting to the man who is perhaps America’s most reactive president.

USA TODAY

The National Security Agency is worried that Edward Snowden may have accessed files that reveal how the United States spies on China and other strategic countries, The Washington Postreported Thursday.

An internal review has found that the former NSA contractor ""was able to range across hundreds of thousands of pages of documents,"" the Post wrote, citing an unidentified former official briefed on the issue. But another intelligence official, also unidentified, told the Post that so far it did not appear that Snowden obtained data collected through hacking or other means.

The official said Snowden had ""got a lot"" but ""not even close to the lion's share"" of the NSA's intelligence trove. Nonetheless, the official described potential harm to U.S. surveillance efforts as ""a concern.""

The Post writes:

The possibility that intelligence about foreign targets might be made public has stirred anxiety about the potential to compromise the agency's overseas collection efforts. U.S. officials fear that further revelations could disclose specific intelligence-gathering methods or enable foreign governments to deduce their own vulnerabilities.

Snowden has stated publicly he does not plan to publicize technical specifics of the NSA's operations. He has archived encrypted documents with others, the Guardian newspaper has said, and U.S. officials worry they could eventually be out of his control.

The Guardian's Glenn Greenwald told the Daily Beast that ""if anything happens"" to Snowden, ""the stories will inevitably be published.""

Snowden leaked the files to the Post and the Guardian.

Separately, Greenwald and other Guardian reporters wrote that documents leaked by Snowden show that Microsoft ""collaborated closely with U.S. intelligence services to allow users' communications to be intercepted."" The company said it was legally obligated to cooperate.

With Microsoft's help, the NSA evaded encryption to intercept e-mails on Outlook and Hotmail, and Web chats and video calls on Outlook and Skype. It also gained access to SkyDrive, the company's cloud storage service.

The NSA shared the material with the FBI and CIA,the Guardian said. One agency document described the effort as a ""team sport..""

The formerly secret files illuminate the workings of the PRISM surveillance operation and reveal the extent of cooperation between big technology companies and the government during the past three years, the Guardian said.

Microsoft responded that it merely follows the law.

""We have clear principles which guide the response across our entire company to government demands for customer information for both law enforcement and national security issues,"" the company said in a statement.

First, we take our commitments to our customers and to compliance with applicable law very seriously, so we provide customer data only in response to legal processes. Second, our compliance team examines all demands very closely, and we reject them if we believe they aren't valid. Third, we only ever comply with orders about specific accounts or identifiers, and we would not respond to the kind of blanket orders discussed in the press over the past few weeks, as the volumes documented in our most recent disclosure clearly illustrate. To be clear, Microsoft does not provide any government with blanket or direct access to SkyDrive, Outlook.com, Skype or any Microsoft product.

The company added that when it upgrades or updates its products, ""legal obligations may in some circumstances require that we maintain the ability to provide information in response to a law enforcement or national security request. There are aspects of this debate that we wish we were able to discuss more freely. That's why we've argued for additional transparency that would help everyone understand and debate these important issues."""

Secret-court judges upset at portrayal of ‘collaboration’ with government

Recent leaks of classified documents have pointed to the role of a special court in enabling the government’s secret surveillance programs, but members of the court are chafing at the suggestion that they were collaborating with the executive branch.

A classified 2009 draft report by the National Security Agency’s inspector general relayed some details about the interaction between the court’s judges and the NSA, which sought approval for the Bush administration’s top-secret domestic surveillance programs. The report was described in The Washington Post on June 16 and released in full Thursday by The Post and the British newspaper the Guardian.

U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, the former chief judge of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, took the highly unusual step Friday of voicing open frustration at the account in the report and court’s inability to explain its decisions.

“In my view, that draft report contains major omissions, and some inaccuracies, regarding the actions I took as Presiding Judge of the FISC and my interactions with Executive Branch officials,” Kollar-Kotelly said in a statement to The Post. It was her first public comment describing her work on the intelligence court.

The inspector general’s draft report is among the many documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, touching off a roiling national debate about the proper balance between the government’s reach into Americans’ lives and the effort to protect the nation in the Internet age.

The document portrays the surveillance court as “amenable” to the government’s legal theory to “re-create” authority for the Internet metadata program that had initially been authorized by President George W. Bush without court or congressional approval. The program was shut down in March 2004 when acting Attorney General James B. Comey and senior leaders at the Justice Department threatened to resign over what they felt was an illegal program.

Kollar-Kotelly disputed the NSA report’s suggestion of a fairly high level of coordination between the court and the NSA and Justice in 2004 to re-create certain authorities under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the 1978 law that created the court in response to abuses of domestic surveillance in the 1960s and 1970s.

“That is incorrect,” she said. “I participated in a process of adjudication, not ‘coordination’ with the executive branch. The discussions I had with executive branch officials were in most respects typical of how I and other district court judges entertain applications for criminal wiretaps under Title III, where issues are discussed ex parte.”

The perception that the court works too closely with the government arises in large part from the tribunal’s “ex parte” nature, which means that unlike in a traditional court, there is no legal sparring between adversaries with the judge as arbiter. Instead, a Justice Department official makes the case for the government agency seeking permission to carry out surveillance inside the United States. No one speaks for the target of the surveillance or the company that is ordered to allow its networks to be tapped or to turn over its customers’ data.

Some critics say the court is a rubber stamp for government investigators because it almost never has turned down a warrant application. However, that high batting average doesn’t take into account changes the court requires in some requests and other applications that the government withdraws.

For about 30 years, the court was located on the sixth floor of the Justice Department’s headquarters, down the hall from the officials who would argue in front of it. (The court moved to the District’s federal courthouse in 2009.) “There is a collaborative process that would be unnatural in the public, criminal court setting,” said a former Justice official familiar with the court.

Kollar-Kotelly, who was the court’s chief judge from 2002 to 2006, said she could not comment further on the matter because “the underlying subjects” in the report generally remain classified by the executive branch.

Other judges on the court have confided to colleagues their frustration at the court’s portrayal, according to people familiar with their discussion.

The inspector general’s report, combined with persistent refusals by the government to declassify the opinions, have left the public in the dark about the court’s legal justifications for approving the broad surveillance programs.

“The court is a neutral party, not a collaborator or arm of the government,” said one government official close to the court. “But the information out there now leaves people wondering how and why the court endorsed these programs.”

The court historically has authorized in secret hearings classified warrants to wiretap the calls and monitor the movements of suspected criminals. After the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, far-reaching programs to gather Internet and telephone content and metadata were launched under presidential authority, without congressional action or approval from the surveillance court.

The Internet metadata portion of that program had to be revamped after Comey and other Justice officials threatened to resign. Metadata are information indicating facts such as an e-mail’s sender and recipient and its time and date, but not its content.

In May 2004, the NSA briefed Kollar-Kotelly on the technical aspects of that program’s collection, according to the report. She also met with the NSA director, Lt. Gen. Michael V. Hayden, on two successive Saturdays during the summer of 2004 to discuss the issue, the report said.

“It was very professional,” Hayden said in an interview. “We of course had to explain to her what it was we had been doing, what it was we wanted to do, how we would do it, what kind of safeguards we felt able to put in. We left it to her judgment whether there was proportionality in terms of was this worth doing, in the balance between security and liberty.”

He said in response to her concerns, the agency made some technical adjustments so that “the odds were greater that you’d pick up fewer protected communications of U.S. persons.”

Said Hayden: “She wasn’t in league with us. We were down there presenting what we thought was appropriate.”

On July 14, 2004, the surveillance court for the first time approved the gathering of information by the NSA, which created the equivalent of a digital vault to hold Internet metadata. Kollar-Kotelly’s order authorized the metadata program under a FISA provision known as the “pen register/trap and trace,” or PRTT.

The ruling was a secret not just to the public and most of Congress, but to all of Kollar-Kotelly’s surveillance court colleagues. Under orders from the president, none of the court’s other 10 members could be told about the Internet metadata program, which was one prong of a larger and highly classified data-gathering effort known as the President’s Surveillance Program, or PSP.

But the importance of her order — which approved the collection based on a 1986 law typically used for phone records — was hard to overstate.

“The order essentially gave NSA the same authority to collect bulk Internet metadata that it had under the PSP,” the inspector general’s report said, with some minor caveats including reducing the number of people who could access the records.

On May 24, 2006, Kollar-Kotelly signed another order, this one authorizing the bulk collection of phone metadata from U.S. phone companies, under a FISA provision known as Section 215, or the ”business records provision,” of the USA Patriot Act.

As with the PRTT order, the Justice Department and NSA “collaboratively designed the application, prepared declarations and responded to questions from court advisers,” the inspector general’s report said. “Their previous experience in drafting the PRTT order made this process more efficient.”

The court also agreed in 2007 to permit the government to collect the content of e-mails and phone calls to and from the United States when “there is probable cause to believe” that one of the parties is a member of al-Qaeda or an associated terrorist group. That program, known today as PRISM and described in documents obtained by The Washington Post, eventually was authorized by Congress.

Kollar-Kotelly could be a stern taskmaster when she thought the NSA was overstepping its bounds. In 2004, she temporarily shut down the government’s surveillance program when she learned of a key NSA failure, The Post reported in 2006. The agency was not properly walling off information gained in warrantless surveillance and may have been using the information to obtain court warrants, which was forbidden. In 2005, the problem resurfaced and she issued a strong warning to the government that it had to fix the problem or would face trouble obtaining court warrants.

Kollar-Kotelly “understood the problems that the government, particularly the Defense Department and the intelligence community, were facing in trying to keep this country safe,” said Robert L. Deitz, former NSA general counsel under Hayden.

But, he said, the court was no rubber stamp. “The judges ask searching questions,” he said. “If they don’t get the right answer, they don’t stamp things ‘reject.’ They say, ‘I’m not signing this.’ Then we go back and say, ‘Okay, we’ve got to do this the following way.’ ”

Still secret are the 2004 decision accompanying the PRTT court order and the legal opinion accompanying the 2006 business records order.

A former senior Justice Department official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the subject’s sensitivity, said he believes the government should consider releasing declassified summaries of relevant opinions.

“I think it would help” quell the “furor” raised by the recent disclosures, he said. “In this current environment, you may have to lean forward a little more in declassifying stuff than you otherwise would. You might be able to prepare reasonable summaries that would be helpful to the American people.”

Lawmakers and civil-liberties advocates have been pushing the Obama administration for several years to declassify these opinions and other opinions from Justice’s Office of Legal Counsel that explain the legal justification for these programs.

The Office of the Director of National Intelligence has led an effort to review these opinions to see what, if anything, can be declassified. But Robert S. Litt, ODNI general counsel, has argued that declassification can be difficult when so much of the legal reasoning is intertwined with facts that need to remain secret lest they tip off enemies about surveillance methods.

Still, the former official explained, segregating relevant facts from classified material is routinely done in criminal proceedings under the Classified Information Procedures Act. In those cases, the government can extract the information that is relevant to the defense, the judge approves it, and it is provided to the defense.

“This is not unheard-of in the unclassified world, and some kind of summary document can be generated,” the former official said. “Maybe that’s a middle ground that can be done.”

Following a massive search that shut down the city of Boston and its environs, authorities late Friday apprehended Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, a suspect in the marathon bombings who had been missing since early in the day, when he had escaped from a shootout that had left his brother,and fellow suspect, dead.

The Sept. 11, 2001, attacks led to a massive buildup of security to make the country safe. Subsequent plots, including attempts to conceal bombs in shoes and underwear, prompted hasty additions to that edifice, as officials sought to fill in cracks that terrorists might exploit.

The bombings at the Boston Marathon, carried out by two young men who immigrated to this country about a decade ago, are likely to yield a more frustrating security postmortem.

So far, there have been no calls for a major addition to the nation’s counterterrorism infrastructure, in part because it is difficult to identify a realistic measure that might have prevented the attacks.

Instead, U.S. officials and counterterrorism experts said that, while the bombings may lead to incremental changes in efforts to secure such events, they exposed the limits of the extraordinary defenses erected over the past 12 years.

The United States has spent billions of dollars on counterterrorism efforts during that span, an investment that has accomplished much of its aim. Overseas operations have pushed al-Qaeda to the brink of collapse, and domestic steps have dramatically reduced the country’s exposure to an attack of the scale and sophistication of Sept. 11.

But the Boston bombings highlighted a lingering vulnerability that officials consider impractical, if not impossible, to eliminate. It centers on small-scale plots carried out by individuals who are unlikely to surface on federal radar. They rely on devices made from common ingredients such as gunpowder, nails and a pressure cooker. They target public gatherings where security resources are stretched.

“There’s just no way to secure many large public events, and the kind of intrusive steps we would have to take are ones that no one would be willing to endure,” said Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), a former federal prosecutor and member of the House Intelligence Committee. “We’ve always known the limits of what we could do in a free society, and this week we saw those limits in all their horror.”

National security and civil rights analysts said the U.S. government’s response to the Boston bombings will depend on details that emerge from the ongoing investigation, specifically whether the brothers accused of carrying out the attacks had direct connections to a foreign terrorist organization, were inspired by the ideology of radical Islam or had other motivations.

The two men, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, were immigrants who had been in the United States for roughly a decade. They were part of a family with ties to Chechnya, a volatile region where Muslim separatists have been engaged in a bloody campaign against the Russian government for decades.

If there are connections to Islamist militant groups, including help planning and carrying out the attack, the Obama administration could expand intelligence-gathering efforts overseas, as well as widen surveillance and screening measures in the United States. But such measures would likely be controversial and far from foolproof.

If, however, the Tsarnaev brothers carried out the bombings with no foreign assistance, the administration’s policy options may be more limited.

National security and legal experts note that the United States has endured violence committed with relatively small-size explosive devices for decades, attacks carried out by radical groups with ideologies that span the political spectrum.

Benjamin Wittes, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who tracks counterterrorism policy and law, said the administration would have to move carefully if it sought to expand surveillance in public spaces or increase monitoring of Muslim communities.

It’s a “scenario in which you are almost powerless in a policy matter,” Wittes said. “You obviously have to begin thinking about additional security at marathons and other events. But just as school shootings are really hard to prevent . . . I really don’t think there’s much more to do from a policy aspect.”

U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies track thousands of potential threats each year to major public gatherings, ranging from the president’s inauguration to football’s Super Bowl. Those events are regarded as easier to safeguard because spectators must pass through checkpoints before gaining entry to a controlled space.

The Boston Marathon, by contrast, is a snaking 26.2-mile course lined by open parks, sidewalks and buildings. The Boston Police Department conducted two bomb sweeps in advance of the race, but there was little to prevent two brothers from blending into the crowd with homemade devices in their backpacks.

“This is a type of target that is unrealistic to expect to be secured,” said Daniel Byman, a terrorism expert at Georgetown University and former CIA analyst. Protecting a single venue, Byman said, only means the list of remaining vulnerable sites is “infinity minus one.”

Efforts to protect such targets have been ramped up over the past decade, but the bulk of the security measures adopted after the Sept. 11 attacks have been aimed at guarding against more catastrophic scenarios.

New agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security and the National Counterterrorism Center, were established to identify threats, generate terrorism watch lists and mobilize resources. Vast areas of the nation’s infrastructure, including its shipping ports, have been shored up to prevent dangerous materials, such as radiological or chemical weapons, from slipping into the United States.

But security cannot be guaranteed in even the most heavily fortified areas, including aviation. Twice over the past 12 years, terrorists with ties to al-Qaeda have boarded airplanes with hidden explosives. Layers of airport security and surveillance failed to stop them. Both cases might have ended in disaster if the bombers hadn’t struggled to ignite their devices before being subdued by other passengers.

The Boston bombings were reminiscent of another recent near-miss, the failed attempt in 2010 by a Pakistani American to ignite a bomb hidden in a car in Times Square. Faisal Shahzad had lit the fuse on a device that also involved a pressure cooker. A nearby food vendor noticed smoke and alerted authorities, and Shahzad was apprehended after boarding a plane bound for Dubai.

Boston was far from defenseless as the marathon got underway. Among major U.S. cities, only New York and Washington have been under more stringent security since the Sept. 11 attacks.

Boston has used federal grants to help assemble a surveillance network that employs hundreds of cameras across the city and throughout its subways. Those cameras, along with images captured by private video systems and spectators’ cellphones, helped authorities identify the Tsarnaev brothers as suspects — but only after three people had been killed and more than 170 others injured.

Schiff said the bombings may trigger new debate over whether surveillance systems such as Boston’s should be expanded, whether spy agencies should focus more resources on regions such as Chechnya and whether the United States needs to examine how it integrates disaffected immigrants.

“We’ve had a lot of successes in degrading the ability of al-Qaeda to launch massive attacks, but we’ve had a proliferation of one-off, foreign-born plots and self-radicalized individuals,” Schiff said. Ultimately, he said, “we’re going to have to recognize a certain vulnerability, and adopt a determined view that we will go on as we have, taking prudent precautions, but not changing the way we live.”

(CNN) —

On Monday, President Barack Obama’s two secretaries of state inadvertently collaborated with Russia’s foreign minister to shape a twist in the Syria debate that a day later is looking more and more like a possible way out of the current crisis.

It took an idea from being an off-the-cuff throwaway line through being an informal proposal to the point today where it will be proposed for consideration by the United Nations. Perhaps more importantly for the President, it may help save him from a political showdown in Congress where it seems increasingly likely he cannot win while adding a glimmer of hope to a story that for two weeks has been an unrelenting mess for the White House and of deep concern to the American people.

The first move came from the current secretary of state, John Kerry. In a statement that was initially seen as a slip of the tongue (probably because it was), Kerry raised the possibility that if Syria were to give up its chemical weapons, an attack might be avoided. Although the administration almost immediately backed away from the statement and the British foreign secretary characterized it as impossible, the idea quickly began to gain traction.

David Rothkopf

Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moallem announced that his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov had proposed that Syria’s chemical weapons be put under some form of international control as a way of forestalling a U.S.-led attack. Moallem went further, welcoming the initiative.

It turned out Kerry had spoken to Lavrov. And while Washington’s first response was natural skepticism given the misrepresentations of the Syrian government in the past, it became clear that if there was any chance such an initiative could spare the president the political debacle of a failed vote in the Congress – and possibly spare the country the costs of another military intervention in the region – some in the administration felt it was worth considering.

So, hours after a senior official had told CNN the Kerry statement was a “major goof,” the press office in the White House was claiming credit suggesting that the “credible threat” of a U.S. plan had triggered the diplomatic opening.

Next up, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who had already been teed up to offer a statement of support for her former boss/potential predecessor, made a brief statement that had to have been carefully cleared with the White House.

She called the idea that Syria might give up its chemical weapons an “important step” if the Russians and the Syrians actively followed up on it. This was yet another sign that the administration was hoping that the morning’s seeming misstep yield an opportunity to step away from a congressional showdown or at least buy some breathing room.

Further, while Clinton did not address the specifics of Obama’s proposed Syria intervention, she did say that she would support him.

Up until now, her silence on the issue was seen by some as an effort by the likely presidential candidate to distance herself from the Obama team’s muddled handling of the proposed Syria intervention. But Monday’s message not only showed her political loyalty to the president but it also emphasized the outsized influence of her views in America and around the globe.

In the wake of her remarks, there were initially reports that other nations, such as France, would welcome giving the Russian initiative a chance. The President framed it as a “potentially positive development.” Then on Tuesday, the Syrian government formally accepted the Russian proposal. The U.S. and France took the plan to the United Nations to give it the formal backing and oversight of that institution. It is still clearly a long way from being realized but there is momentum.

Nonetheless, even should it blow up, appearing to consider it allows Obama to be able to say he had exhausted all diplomatic options to resolve the problem. And for the more the hawkishly inclined, it would also be seen as reminder that military pressure is often key to producing peaceful, political outcomes.

Either way, for a moment, an idea that might ultimately seem to be in the interest of Obama, Russian President Vladimir Putin, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and, arguably, the Syrian Opposition (to the extent they no longer might face chemical weapons) gained surprising traction. This was thanks in part to the seeming misstep of America’s current top diplomat, to his swift interaction with his Russian counterpart, and the added weight his predecessor’s views brought to the matter.

It is a long-shot proposal started perhaps by accident, promoted by parties who have regularly lied, and cautiously embraced by a U.S. administration whose policies in Syria have been incoherent by any measure. Regardless of whether it amounts to anything or not, it speaks volumes about how bad our options are.

http://news.yahoo.com/officials-suspect-described-plot-miranda-013406616.html,,[],Officials: Suspect described plot before Miranda,"BOSTON (AP) — The surviving suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings acknowledged to the FBI his role in the attacks but did so before he was advised of his constitutional right to keep quiet and seek a lawyer, U.S. officials said Wednesday.

Once Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was read his rights on Monday, he immediately stopped talking, according to four officials of both political parties who were briefed on the interrogation but insisted on anonymity because the briefing was private.

After roughly 16 hours of questioning, investigators were surprised when a magistrate judge and a representative from the U.S. Attorney's office entered the hospital room and read Tsarnaev his rights, the four officials and one law enforcement official said. Investigators had planned to keep questioning him.

It is unclear whether any of this will matter in court since the FBI says Tsarnaev confessed to a witness and U.S. officials said Wednesday that physical evidence, including a 9 mm handgun and pieces of a remote-control device commonly used in toys, was recovered from the scene.

But the debate over whether suspected terrorists should be read their Miranda rights has become a major sticking point in the debate over how best to fight terrorism. Many Republicans, in particular, believe Miranda warnings are designed to build court cases, and only hinder intelligence gathering.

Christina DiIorio Sterling, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz, said in an email, ""This remains an ongoing investigation and we don't have any further comment.""

Before being advised of his rights, the 19-year-old suspect told authorities that his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, only recently had recruited him to be part of the attack, two U.S. officials said.

The CIA, however, named Tamerlan to a terrorist database 18 months ago, officials said Wednesday, an acknowledgment that will undoubtedly prompt congressional inquiry about whether investigators took warnings from Russian intelligence officials seriously enough.

Story continues

The U.S. officials who discussed the terrorist database and other details of the investigation are in addition to those who discussed the Miranda warning. They were close to the investigation and insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the case with reporters.

Tamerlan Tsarnaev, whom authorities have described as the driving force behind the plot, was killed in a shootout with police. Dzhokhar is recovering in a hospital from injuries suffered during a getaway attempt.

Authorities had previously said Dzhokhar exchanged gunfire with them for more than an hour Friday night before they captured him inside a boat covered by a tarp in a suburban Boston neighborhood backyard. But two U.S. officials said Wednesday that he was unarmed when captured, raising questions about the gunfire and how he was injured.

More than 4,000 mourners at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology paid tribute to a campus police officer who authorities say was gunned down by the bombing suspects.

Among the speakers in Cambridge, just outside Boston, was Vice President Joe Biden, who condemned the bombing suspects as ""two twisted, perverted, cowardly, knockoff jihadis.""

Investigators have said the brothers appeared to have been radicalized through jihadist materials on the Internet and have found no evidence tying them to a terrorist group.

Dzhokhar told the FBI that they were angry about the U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and the killing of Muslims there, officials said.

Dzhokhar's public defender had no comment on the matter Wednesday. His father has called him a ""true angel,"" and an aunt has insisted he's not guilty.

Investigators have found pieces of remote-control equipment among the debris and were analyzing them, officials said. One official described the detonator as ""close-controlled,"" meaning it had to be triggered within several blocks of the bombs.

That evidence could be key to the court case. And an FBI affidavit said one of the brothers told a carjacking victim during their getaway attempt, ""Did you hear about the Boston explosion? I did that.""

Officials also recovered a 9 mm handgun believed to have been used by Tamerlan from the site of a Thursday night gunbattle that injured a Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority officer, two U.S. officials said.

The officials told the AP that no gun was found in the boat. Boston police Commissioner Ed Davis said earlier that shots were fired from inside the boat.

Asked whether the suspect had a gun in the boat, Davis said, ""I'm not going to talk about that.""

Kurt Schwartz, director of the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency, did respond to the report.

""Within half a mile of where this person was captured, a police officer was shot. And I know who shot him."" Schwartz said. ""And there were three bombs that went off, and I know where those bombs came from. ... To me, it does not change anything. This guy was captured alive and will survive. True or not true, it doesn't change anything for me.""

The suspects' parents, Anzor Tsarnaev and Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, plan to fly to the U.S. from Russia on Thursday, the father was quoted as telling the Russian state news agency RIA Novosti. The family has said it wants to take Tamerlan's body back to Russia.

In Russia, U.S. investigators traveled to the predominantly Muslim province of Dagestan and were in contact with the brothers' parents, hoping to gain more information.

Investigators are looking into whether Tamerlan, who spent six months in Russia's turbulent Caucasus region in 2012, was influenced by the religious extremists who have waged an insurgency against Russian forces in the area for years. The brothers have roots in Dagestan and neighboring Chechnya but had lived in the U.S. for about a decade.

While in the U.S., the brothers received welfare benefits.

The Office of Health and Human Services in Massachusetts confirmed a Boston Herald report Wednesday that Tamerlan, his wife and daughter had received welfare benefits up until last year, when he became ineligible based on family income.

The state also says Tamerlan and his brother received welfare benefits as children through their parents while the family lived in Massachusetts.

Neither was receiving benefits at the time of the bombing.

At MIT, bagpipes wailed as students, faculty and staff members and throngs of law enforcement officials paid their respects to MIT police Officer Sean Collier, who was ambushed in his cruiser three days after the bombing.

Biden told the Collier family that no child should die before his or her parents, but that, in time, the grief will lose some of its sting.

""The moment will come when the memory of Sean is triggered and you know it's going to be OK,"" Biden said. ""When the first instinct is to get a smile on your lips before a tear to your eye.""

The vice president also sounded a defiant note.

""The purpose of terror is to instill fear,"" he said. ""You saw none of it here in Boston. Boston, you sent a powerful message to the world.""

In another milestone in Boston's recovery, the area around the marathon finish line was reopened to the public, with fresh cement still drying on the repaired sidewalk. Delivery trucks made their way down Boylston Street under a heavy police presence, though some damaged stores were still closed.

""I don't think there's going to be a sense of normalcy for a while,"" Tom Champoux, who works nearby, said as he pointed to the boarded-up windows. ""There are scars here that will be with us for a long time.""

http://news.yahoo.com/compromise-among-senators-eyed-border-security-225125834.html,,[],Compromise among senators eyed on border security,"WASHINGTON (AP) — After secretive talks, key senators expressed optimism Wednesday night that they were closing in on a bipartisan agreement to dramatically toughen the border security requirements in immigration legislation that also offers a path to citizenship to millions living in the country illegally.

Lawmakers and aides alike said the goal was to assure passage of the sweeping legislation by a large bipartisan vote within a matter of days.

Under the emerging compromise, the government would grant legal status to immigrants living in the United States unlawfully at the same time the additional security was being put into place at a cost of tens of billions of dollars. Green cards, which signify permanent residency status, would be withheld until the security steps were complete.

Several officials said late Wednesday the Border Patrol would roughly double in size with the addition of 20,000 agents over a decade as part of a so-called border surge. The government also would complete hundreds of miles of new fencing along the U.S.-Mexico border and purchase new surveillance drones to help apprehend would-be illegal border crossers. The cost of the additional agents alone totals $30 billion over a decade.

The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks were private.

If agreed to, the change has the potential to give a powerful boost to the immigration bill that is at the top of President Barack Obama's second-term domestic agenda.

The developments came as Democrats who met with House Speaker John Boehner during the day quoted him as saying he expects the House to pass its own version of an immigration bill this summer and for Congress to have a final compromise by year's end. Boehner, R-Ohio, has already said the legislation that goes to the House in the next month or two will not include a pathway to citizenship for those in the United States illegally.

Precise details of the pending agreement in the Senate were unavailable, but Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., said it involved a major increase of resources to the border, including more manpower, fencing and technology. The underlying legislation already envisions more border agents; additional fencing along the U.S-Mexico border; surveillance drones; a requirement for employers to verify the legal status of potential workers; as well as a biometric system to track foreigners who enter and leave the United States at air and seaports and by land.

Story continues

""Our whole effort has been to build a bipartisan group that will support the bill,"" said Hoeven, who has not yet stated a position on the legislation. ""That's what this is all about, and it's focused on border security.""

Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., one of the bill's most prominent supporters, said discussions with Republicans ""have been really productive. We've made a lot of progress in the last 24 hours. Now we have some vetting to do with our respective allies.""

The potential compromise came into focus one day after the Congressional Budget Office jolted lawmakers with an estimate saying that as drafted, the legislation would fail to prevent a steady increase in the future in the number of residents living in the United States illegally.

The estimate appeared to give added credibility to Republicans who have been pressing Democrats to toughen the border security provisions already written into the bill. Schumer and Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., met at midday with Hoeven, and Republican Sens. Bob Corker of Tennessee, John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. The Democrats, McCain and Graham are part of the so-called bipartisan Gang of Eight that drafted the bill.

If ratified, the compromise would mark concessions on both sides.

Some Republicans have been unwilling to support a bill that grants legal status to immigrants in the country illegally until the government certifies that the border security steps have achieved 90 percent effectiveness in stopping would-be border crossers.

On the other hand, Democrats have opposed Republican proposals to make legalization contingent on success in closing the border to illegal crossings. Under the legislation as drafted, legalization could begin as soon as a security plan was drafted, but a 10-year wait is required for a green card.

One plan to change that was sidetracked during the day on a vote of 61-37.

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said his proposal would require Congress to vote annually for five years on whether the border is secure. If lawmakers decide it is not, ""then the processing of undocumented workers stops until"" it is, he said. The decision would be made based on numerous factors, including progress toward completion of a double-layered fence along the U.S.-Mexico border and toward a goal of 95 percent capture of illegal entrants. A system to track the border comings and goings of foreigners is also required.

Only a day earlier, the CBO had cheered supporters of the bill with an estimate that it would help the economy and reduce deficits in each of the next two decades.

Now it was the skeptics' turn to crow.

""Illegality will not be stopped, but it will only be reduced by 25 percent,"" said Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., referring to the prediction by the non-partisan CBO.

While the public debate was taking place, lawmakers involved in the private talks expressed optimism.

""We're on the verge of doing something dramatic on the border,"" Graham told reporters. ""What we're trying to do is put in place measures that to any reasonable person would be an overwhelming effort to secure our border. This is a key moment in the effort to pass the bill.""

Across the Capitol, House Republican leaders sought to present a friendlier face to Hispanics — a group that gave Obama more than 70 percent support in last year's presidential election.

Boehner met with the Democratic-dominated Congressional Hispanic Caucus, while rank and file members of his party reviewed areas of agreement with faith-based Latino leaders.

""It's a conversation Republicans want to have,"" Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., said later at a news conference outside the Capitol.

At the same time, though, anti-immigration protesters moved across the Capitol plaza into range of television cameras, raising signs that said, ""Do Not Reward Criminals"" and ""No Amnesty for Illegal Aliens.""

Separately, the House Judiciary Committee worked on legislation creating a program allowing farm workers to come to the United States to take temporary jobs in the United States.

The measure is one of several that the panel is considering in the final weeks of June as part of a piece-by-piece approach to immigration rather than the all-in-one bill that Senate is considering.

In addition to border security measures and a pathway to citizenship for millions of immigrants in the country illegally, the Senate bill provides more visas for highly-skilled workers prized by the technology industry, a guest worker farm program and a new program for lower-skilled workers to come to the United States.

Edward Snowden comes forward as source of NSA leaks

By Barton Gellman, Aaron Blake and Greg Miller,

A 29-year-old man who says he is a former undercover CIA employee said Sunday that he was the principal source of recent disclosures about ­top-secret National Security Agency programs, exposing himself to possible prosecution in an acknowledgment that had little if any precedent in the long history of U.S. intelligence leaks.

Edward Snowden, a tech specialist who has contracted for the NSA and works for the consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton, unmasked himself as a source after a string of stories in The Washington Post and the Guardian that detailed previously unknown U.S. surveillance programs. He said he disclosed secret documents in response to what he described as the systematic surveillance of innocent citizens.

In an interview Sunday, Snowden said he is willing to face the consequences of exposure.

“I’m not going to hide,” Snowden told The Post from Hong Kong, where he has been staying. “Allowing the U.S. government to intimidate its people with threats of retaliation for revealing wrongdoing is contrary to the public interest.”

Asked whether he believes that his disclosures will change anything, he said: “I think they already have. Everyone everywhere now understands how bad things have gotten — and they’re talking about it. They have the power to decide for themselves whether they are willing to sacrifice their privacy to the surveillance state.”

Snowden said nobody had been aware of his actions, including those closest to him. He said there was no single event that spurred his decision to leak the information, but he said President Obama has failed to live up to his pledges of transparency.

“My sole motive is to inform the public as to that which is done in their name and that which is done against them,” he said in a note that accompanied the first document he leaked to The Post.

The Guardian was the first to publicly identify Snowden, at his request.

The White House said late Sunday that it would not have any comment on the matter.

In a brief statement, a spokesman for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said the intelligence community is “reviewing the damage” the leaks have done. “Any person who has a security clearance knows that he or she has an obligation to protect classified information and abide by the law,” said the spokesman, Shawn Turner.

Snowden said he is seeking “asylum from any countries that believe in free speech and oppose the victimization of global privacy,” but the law appears to provide for his extradition from Hong Kong, a semiautonomous territory of China, to the United States.

Although any extradition proceeding could take months or even years, experts said Snowden has not put himself in a favorable position.

“The fact that he outed himself and basically said, from what I understand he has said, ‘I feel very comfortable with what I have done’ . . . that’s not going to help him in his extradition contest,” said Douglas McNabb, a lawyer and extradition expert.

The Justice Department said it is in the “initial stages of an investigation” into the unauthorized disclosure of classified information but declined to comment further.



A stunning revelation

Current and former U.S. intelligence officials said the revelation of Snowden’s role in the leaks will lead to a sweeping reexamination of security measures at the CIA and the NSA, and they described his decision to come forward as a stunning conclusion to a week of disclosures that rattled the intelligence community.

“This is significant on a number of fronts: the scope, the range. It’s major, it’s major,” said John Rizzo, a former general counsel of the CIA who worked at the agency for decades. “And then to have him out himself . . . I can’t think of any previous leak case involving a CIA officer where the officer raised his hand and said, ‘I’m the guy.’ ”

A half-dozen former intelligence officials, including one who now works at Booz Allen Hamilton, said they did not know Snowden or anything about his background. Several former officials said he easily could have been part of a surge in computer experts and technical hires brought in by the CIA in the years after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks as its budget and mission swelled.

“Like a lot of things after 9/11, they just went on a hiring binge, and in the technical arena young, smart nerds were in high demand,” a former U.S. intelligence official said. “There were battalions of them.”

Officials said the CIA and other spy agencies did not relax their screening measures as the workforce expanded. Still, several officials said the CIA will now undoubtedly begin reviewing the process by which Snowden may have been hired, seeking to determine whether there were any missed signs that he might one day betray national secrets.

More broadly, the CIA and the NSA may be forced to reexamine their relationships with contractors, who were employed in roles ranging from technical support to paramilitary operations before concerns about the outsourcing of such sensitive assignments prompted a backlash in Congress and pledges from the agencies to begin thinning their contracting ranks.

Some former CIA officials said they were troubled by aspects of Snowden’s background, at least as he described it to The Post and the Guardian.

For instance, Snowden said he did not have a high school diploma. One former CIA official said that it was extremely unusual for the agency to have hired someone with such thin academic credentials, particularly for a technical job, and that the terms Snowden used to describe his agency positions did not match internal job descriptions.

Snowden’s claim to have been placed under diplomatic cover for a position in Switzerland after an apparently brief stint at the CIA as a systems administrator also raised suspicion. “I just have never heard of anyone being hired with so little academic credentials,” the former CIA official said. The agency does employ technical specialists in overseas stations, the former official said, “but their breadth of experience is huge, and they tend not to start out as systems administrators.”

A former senior U.S. intelligence official cited other puzzling aspects of Snowden’s account, questioning why a contractor for Booz Allen at an NSA facility in Hawaii would have access to something as sensitive as a court order from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.

“I don’t know why he would have had access to those . . . orders out in Hawaii,” the former official said.

The Guardian initially reported the existence of a program that collects data on all phone calls made on the Verizon network. Later in the week, the Guardian and The Post reported the existence of a separate program, code-named PRISM, that collects the Internet data of foreigners from major Internet companies.

Snowden expressed hope that the NSA surveillance programs will now be open to legal challenge for the first time. This year, in Amnesty International v. Clapper, the Supreme Court dismissed a lawsuit against the mass collection of phone records because the plaintiffs could not prove exactly what the program did or that they were personally subject to surveillance.

“The government can’t reasonably assert the state-secrets privilege for a program it has acknowledged,” Snowden said.

Journalists criticized

Snowden’s name surfaced as top intelligence officials in the Obama administration and Congress pushed back against the journalists responsible for revealing the existence of sensitive surveillance programs and called for an investigation into the leaks.

Clapper, in an interview with NBC that aired Saturday night, condemned the leaker’s actions but also sought to spotlight the journalists who first reported the programs, calling their disclosures irresponsible and full of “hyperbole.” Earlier Saturday, he issued a statement accusing the media of a “rush to publish.”

“For me, it is literally — not figuratively — literally gut-wrenching to see this happen because of the huge, grave damage it does to our intelligence capabilities,” Clapper said.

On Sunday morning, before Snowden’s unmasking, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers (R-Mich.) had harsh words for the leaker and for the journalist who first reported the NSA’s collection of phone records, the Guardian’s Glenn Greenwald.

Greenwald “doesn’t have a clue how this thing works; neither did the person who released just enough information to literally be dangerous,” Rogers said on ABC’s “This Week,” adding: “I absolutely think [the leaker] should be prosecuted.”

Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) agreed that whoever leaked the information should be prosecuted, and she sought to beat back media reports suggesting that the Obama administration overplayed the impact of the programs.

After opponents of the programs questioned their value last week, anonymous administration officials pointed to the thwarting of a bomb plot targeting the New York City subway system in 2009. Soon after, though, reporters noted that public documents suggested that regular police work was responsible for thwarting the attack, rather than a secret government intelligence program.

Feinstein said the programs were valuable in both the New York case and in another involving an American plotting to bomb a hotel in India in 2008. She noted that she could talk about those two cases because they have been declassified, but she suggested that the surveillance programs also assisted in other terrorism-related cases.

A chief critic of the efforts, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), said he is considering filing a lawsuit against the government and called on 10 million Americans to join in.

“I’m going to be asking all the Internet providers and all of the phone companies, ask your customers to join me in a class-action lawsuit,” Paul said on “Fox News Sunday.”

He spoke one day after a bipartisan group of eight senators released their own blueprint for a comprehensive reform bill, and the back-to-back events gave the odd sensation — rare during the Obama administration — of seeing Congress and the White House moving in more or less the same direction.

“Now is the time,” Mr. Obama said, noting that Washington was having a bipartisan moment on immigration not seen since George W. Bush was president and Senator Edward Kennedy was leading the push for reform. The president restated the familiar and still-sound principles behind an immigration overhaul: a more secure border and workplace; legalization for 11 million undocumented immigrants; and a modernized system of legal immigration that eliminates backlogs, reunites families and has enough visas for valued workers and entrepreneurs. He also gave a helpful reminder that it’s wrong to cast immigration as a battle of “them” and “us.” A false distinction, he said, because most of us used to be “them.”

The fiercest point of debate and the biggest obstacle to a bill, of course, is whether and how to get “them” — that is, 11 million undocumented immigrants — out of the shadows, free to live and work here legally and to become citizens if they wish. “It should be clear at the outset that there is a pathway to citizenship,” Mr. Obama said, stressing the “is.” An objectionable part of the senators’ blueprint is that it refuses to put undocumented immigrants on a path to permanent residency and citizenship until a host of border-enforcement actions is completed first.

Given existing immigration backlogs and the possibility of other administrative hurdles being placed in the way, any future path to citizenship could be so long and burdensome as to be all but imaginary. Mr. Obama, to his credit, made the citizenship path a central part of his plan and did not make it contingent on adding still more troops, border fencing and aerial drones."

NSA spying authorized in the wake of the 9/11 attacks%2C James Clapper says

Release says the agency applied %22additional internal constraints%22 on authorized activities

White House expected to reveal tweaks to NSA program in January

WASHINGTON — In the face of growing skepticism over the National Security Agency's practice of collecting bulk phone and Internet records, the director of national intelligence on Saturday declassified several documents detailing the program.

The latest declassification of documents comes during a week in which a federal judge ruled the NSA's bulk collection was likely unconstitutional and a White House task force questioned the effectiveness of the program.

Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said in a statement announcing the release that President George W. Bush first authorized the spying in October 2001, as part of the Terrorist Surveillance Program, weeks after the Sept. 11 attacks.

""President Bush issued authorizations approximately every 30-60 days,"" Clapper said. ""Although the precise terms changed over time, each presidential authorization required the minimization of information collected concerning American citizens to the extent consistent with the effective accomplishment of the mission of detection and prevention of acts of terrorism within the United States. NSA also applied additional internal constraints on the presidentially authorized activities.""

Approval for the bulk collection was eventually shifted to the Foreign Surveillance Intelligence Court, a secret court that considers government requests for electronic surveillance for intelligence-gathering purposes.

The documents released include legal arguments by two former national intelligence directors under Bush — Dennis Blair and Mike McConnell — who state their legal case for why it was essential to keep secret the practice of bulk data collection. The unclassified documents are part of an ongoing court case that was filed in 2006.

""These are among the most important intelligence tools the NSA uses, and they have never been officially confirmed or denied by the United States,"" McConnell offers in his argument. ""Disclosing or confirming these activities would seriously undermine an essential tool for tracking possible terrorist plots and would help foreign adversaries evade detection.""

But in recent days, both advisers of President Obama and a Bush appointed federal judge have offered very different assessments about the utility and legality of the practice.

U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon ruled on Monday on a lawsuit brought by conservative activist Larry Klayman that the legal challenge to the massive surveillance program — disclosed in full earlier this year by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden — would likely succeed.

""The court concludes that plaintiffs have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the government's bulk collection and querying of phone record metadata, that they have demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of their Fourth Amendment claim (of unlawful search and seizure), and that they will suffer irreparable harm absent…relief,'' wrote Leon, who was appointed to the bench by Bush.

The task force Obama appointed in August to review the NSA surveillance program and recommend changes concluded in their report — which was made public on Wednesday — that the data collection program was ""not essential to preventing attacks.""

Before leaving for his two-week Hawaii vacation on Friday, Obama said he and his aides were evaluating all of the recommendations by the five-member panel, and that he would offer a response to their suggestions in January. He hinted that that changes to the bulk data collections could be coming.

""The question we're going to have to ask is can we accomplish the same goals that this program is intended to accomplish in ways that give the public more confidence that, in fact, the NSA is doing what it's supposed to be doing,"" Obama said. ""I have confidence in the fact that the NSA is not engaging in domestic surveillance or snooping around, but I also recognize that as technologies change and people can start running algorithms and programs that map out all the information that we're downloading on a daily basis into our telephones and our computers.""

The president added, ""We may have to refine this further to give people more confidence."""

Washington (CNN) – Washingtonians are paying close attention the quadrennial contest for a major job on the global stage.

But this time it's not the race for the White House - the nation's capital is in the early stages of an effort to host the 2024 Summer Olympics.



The non-profit group DC2024 launched a campaign Tuesday on behalf of the greater Washington-Baltimore area in an attempt to seek a bid for those games.

Asked about the potential concerns associated with holding an event of that magnitude, DC2024 organizer Bob Sweeney told CNN the capital city is in a strong position.

""In terms of security, Washington, D.C., has a huge asset in that we live in a very secure environment,"" Sweeney said, adding that DC is also a city that visitors and athletes will want to explore.

He says response to the initiative has been ""incredibly positive.""

An official bid would have to come from the United States Olympic Committee (USOC), which is currently in talks with about 10 American cities interested in hosting the games, including Washington.

The USOC would decide whether to submit a bid to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in partnership with a U.S. city. The latter organization would then make the final choice of host city in 2017, seven years before the games kick off.

The IOC is now in the final stages of the selection process for the 2020 Olympic Games, having narrowed down the candidates to Istanbul, Tokyo and Madrid. The USOC chose not to submit a bid for those games.

The last time the U.S. hosted the summer Olympics was in 1996 when the games were held in Atlanta. The U.S. also hosted the winter Games in Salt Lake City, Utah, in 2002.

A similar effort for Washington to host the 2012 summer games failed, but DC2024's organizers are optimistic.

Sweeney points out the city's landscape has undergone a significant change since the 2012 initiative, with the addition of a new convention center, a new professional baseball stadium, and plans to extend the city's Metrorail system out to Washington-Dulles International Airport.

Washington ""meets or exceeds every one of the technical requirements"" to host the games, Sweeney told CNN, and the area is already ""venue rich"" because of the large number of professional and college sports arenas in the area.

Pedro Ribeiro, a spokesman for Washington Mayor Vincent Gray, said Gray is ""a huge sports fan and a huge fan of the Olympics, and thinks this is an exciting idea and one worth exploring. His main priority would be to ensure that any such effort would be in the best interest of District residents and taxpayers."

USA TODAY

The National Security Agency collected evidence of online sexual activity and visits to pornographic websites as part of a proposed plan to harm the reputations of six people the agency considered ""radicalizers,"" the Huffington Post reported, citing documents released by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.

The targets, all Muslims, are described in the document as examples of how ""personal vulnerabilities"" can be learned through electronic surveillance, and then exploited to undermine a target's credibility, reputation and authority, HuffPo said in its report.

Among the vulnerabilities are ""viewing sexually explicit material online"" and ""using sexually explicit persuasive language when communicating with inexperienced young girls,"" according to the NSA document, dated Oct. 3, 2012.

None of the six individuals targeted by the NSA is accused in the document of being involved in terror plots. The agency believes they all currently reside outside the United States, HuffPo reported.

However, the agency identifies one of them as a ""U.S. person,"" which means he is either a U.S. citizen or a permanent resident. A U.S. person is entitled to greater legal protections against NSA surveillance than foreigners are, HuffPo noted.

""The NSA scandal turns a dangerous corner,"" Ben Wizner, director of the ACLU Speech, Privacy & Technology Project, wrote on Twitter after reading the HuffPo report. ""I bet Washington is full of nervous people.""

The latest revelations come as the European Union reviews a commercial data-sharing agreement with the U.S. known as Safe Harbor. One EU executive threatened to freeze the pact, which covers commercial swaps between U.S. and European companies, information exchanged to limit international terrorist funding, and the supply of information on transatlantic air passengers.

HuffPo released an appendix that was attached to the document which lists the argument each surveillance target has made that the NSA says constitutes radicalism, as well the personal ""vulnerabilities"" the agency believes would leave the targets ""open to credibility challenges"" if exposed.

One target's offending argument is that ""Non-Muslims are a threat to Islam,"" and a vulnerability listed against him is ""online promiscuity.""

Another target, a foreign citizen the NSA describes as a ""respected academic,"" holds the offending view that ""offensive jihad is justified,"" and his vulnerabilities are listed as ""online promiscuity"" and ""publishes articles without checking facts.""

The Huffington Post said it withheld the names and locations of the six people and noted that the allegations made by the NSA about their online activities in the document cannot be verified."

Sanger'],U.S. Confronts Cyber-Cold War With China,"WASHINGTON — When the Obama administration circulated to the nation’s Internet providers last week a lengthy confidential list of computer addresses linked to a hacking group that has stolen terabytes of data from American corporations, it left out one crucial fact: that nearly every one of the digital addresses could be traced to the neighborhood in Shanghai that is headquarters to the Chinese military’s cybercommand.

That deliberate omission underscored the heightened sensitivities inside the Obama administration over just how directly to confront China’s untested new leadership over the hacking issue, as the administration escalates demands that China halt the state-sponsored attacks that Beijing insists it is not mounting.

The issue illustrates how different the worsening cyber-cold war between the world’s two largest economies is from the more familiar superpower conflicts of past decades — in some ways less dangerous, in others more complex and pernicious.

Administration officials say they are now more willing than before to call out the Chinese directly — as Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. did last week in announcing a new strategy to combat theft of intellectual property. But President Obama avoided mentioning China by name — or Russia or Iran, the other two countries the president worries most about — when he declared in his State of the Union address that “we know foreign countries and companies swipe our corporate secrets.” He added: “Now our enemies are also seeking the ability to sabotage our power grid, our financial institutions and our air traffic control systems.”"

The decision to deploy a Patriot missile battery and F-16 aircraft to Jordan was made late Friday at a meeting with top military and civilian Defense Department officials to bolster U.S. military support for Jordan - a crucial ally in the Middle East - as the violence from the Syrian civil war spreads, according to a senior U.S. official, CNN has learned.

The official declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the situation and also declined to say who was in the meeting. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has been traveling outside the United States, and it could not be learned if he attended via teleconference, although several officials tell CNN he was aware of the discussions and approved the deployment.

The overall goal is to demonstrate U.S. military support for an increasingly fragile Jordan, which is bearing the burden of hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees and a growing potential threat from extremist elements including an al Qaeda affiliate organization operating inside Syria.

The weapons systems will be sent initially as part of a military exercise called Eager Lion, planned for later this month, with an understanding they may stay in the country. There is clearly a broader message being sent, according to U.S. military officials.

""In order to enhance the defensive posture and capacity of Jordan, some of these assets may remain beyond the exercise at the request of the government of Jordan,"" Lt .Col. T.G. Taylor, a spokesman at the U.S. Central Command, told CNN.

The Patriot missiles were originally expected to be sent from their base at Ft. Bliss, Texas, but the senior official said they may simply be redeployed from Patriots already in the Middle East. Jordan does not face a Scud missile threat from Syria, but the deployment comes amid growing concern that some Syrian missiles are being shipped to Hezbollah and could be used to attack targets across the region.

In recent days, violence has spread to Lebanon, and Israeli forces have increased security along their northern border. The F-16s and air crews will train with Jordanian combat air forces amid growing pressure from some in Congress for the White House to support a no-fly zone over Syria.

Separately from the exercise, the United States is sending 200 military planners from the headquarters of the 1st Armored Division at Fort Bliss to Jordan to assist in long-term planning with Jordanian forces in case a chemical weapons crisis erupts, or if a wide scale humanitarian relief mission is ordered."

Months of investigation by The New York Times, centered on extensive interviews with Libyans in Benghazi who had direct knowledge of the attack there and its context, turned up no evidence that Al Qaeda or other international terrorist groups had any role in the assault. The attack was led, instead, by fighters who had benefited directly from NATO’s extensive air power and logistics support during the uprising against Colonel Qaddafi. And contrary to claims by some members of Congress, it was fueled in large part by anger at an American-made video denigrating Islam.

Wow! What do you say? What will become of Daryl Issa? I know--- nothing because the GOP is never held accountable by the Washington press corp. In fact, I am pretty sure that the Sunday shows will invite him on so that he can talk at length about New York Times being a liberal shill for Obama.

And of course the Conserva-conspiracy theory industry will summarily dismiss because it is the New York Times. But the rest of us can know for a fact in what this article shows. Susan Rice was right. Obama was right. Now, the question is, will they ever get apologies?

Unfortunately, we know the answer to that question as well. And we also know that Hillary Clinton won't get her much deserved apology either. The Republicans would have to have a shred of decency to apologize, and a shred is just too much to ask from that clown cabal.

Anyway, congrats to the New York Times for a great piece of journalism."

Everything,"Edward Snowden is now out of his limbo at Moscow’s airport, presumably ensconced in some Russian dacha, wondering what the next phase of his young life will bring. Having spent 30 years in the intelligence business, I fervently hope the food is lousy, the winter is cold, and the Internet access is awful. But I worry less about what happens to this one man and more about the damage Snowden has done — and could still do — to America’s long-term ability to strike the right balance between privacy and security.

Ever since Snowden, a former contractor for the National Security Agency, leaked top-secret material about its surveillance programs, he and the U.S. government have locked horns about the nature of those programs.

But those following the Snowden saga should understand two key points. First, though many things need to be kept secret in today’s dangerous world, the line between “secret” and “not secret” is fuzzy rather than stark, and if the goal is security, the harsh truth is that we should often err toward more secrets rather than fewer. Second, despite the grumbling from Snowden and his admirers, the U.S. government truly does make strenuous efforts not to violate privacy, not just because it respects privacy (which it does), but because it simply doesn’t have the time to read irrelevant emails or listen in on conversations unconnected to possible plots against American civilians.

Incidents like the Snowden affair put my former colleagues in the intelligence community in an impossible position. Yes, the official explanations about the virtues of data-collection efforts can sound self-justifying and vague. But they’re still right. I know firsthand that Gen. Keith Alexander, the NSA director, is telling the truth when he talks about plots that have been preempted and attacks that have been foiled because of intelligence his agency collected. I know because I was on the inside, I have long held security clearances, and I participated in many of the activities he describes.

I spent years in the middle of the effort to identify, disentangle, and ultimately attack Al Qaeda. We didn’t operate in secrecy because we were ashamed. We operated in the dark because we had to. Al Qaeda and its affiliates study our actions. They learn from our mistakes. America is safer because we’ve made a point of understanding their methods better than they understand ours.

I understand the trade-offs here. But the intelligence community isn’t keeping things from the American people because we don’t trust them, but rather because once important security information is out there, anyone can access it, including those who would do us harm.

That’s why I find the Snowden controversy so frustrating. I realize many Americans don’t trust their government. I wish I could change that. I wish I could tell people the amazing things I witnessed during my 30 years in the CIA, that I’ve never seen people work harder or more selflessly, that for little money and long hours, people took it for granted that their flaws would be scrutinized and their successes ignored. But I’ve been around long enough to know that deep-rooted distrust of government is immune to stories from people like me. The conspiracy buffs are too busy howling in protest at the thought that their government could uncover how long they spent on the phone with their dear aunt.

Let me break this to you gently. The government is not interested in your conversations with your aunt, unless, of course, she is a key terrorist leader. More than 100 billion emails were sent every day last year — 100 billion, every day. In that vast mass of data lurk a few bits that are of urgent interest and vast terabytes of tedium that are not. Unfortunately, the metadata (the phone numbers, length of contact, and so forth, but not the content of the conversations) that sketch the contours of a call to your family member may fall into the same enormous bucket of information that includes information on the next terrorist threat. As Jeremy Bash, the former chief of staff of the CIA, memorably put it, “If you’re looking for a needle in the haystack, you need a haystack.”

Unfortunately, during the Snowden affair, many news outlets have spent more time examining ways the government could abuse the information it has access to while giving scant mention to the lengths to which the intelligence community goes to protect privacy. We have spent enormous amounts of time and effort figuring out how to disaggregate the important specks from the overwhelming bulk of irrelevant data.

This is done under tight and well-thought-out strictures. I witnessed firsthand the consequences of breaking the privacy rules of my former organization, the National Counterterrorism Center. As the center’s deputy director, I had to fire people, good people, and remove others from their posts for failing to follow the rules about how information could be accessed and used. It didn’t happen often, and it was never a malicious attempt to gather private information. We had mandatory training and full-time staffers to supervise privacy regulations. We used precious resources to hire lawyers and civil liberties experts to oversee our efforts. And on those few occasions when we made mistakes, the punishments were swift and harsh.

Yes, some things that are classified probably don’t need to be. That may undermine public trust and dilute our ability to protect the data that really need protecting. But some things — especially U.S. sources and methods — must be kept secret. Snowden didn’t offer fresh insight about a massive policy failure. Rather, he took upon himself the authority to decide what tradecraft the intelligence community needs to keep his fellow citizens safe. Sadly, Snowden has captured the public’s imagination and attention, and the government’s reaction now seems too little, too late and too reactive. But the intelligence community — always a less sympathetic protagonist than a self-styled whistle-blower — actually has a good story to tell about how seriously the government takes privacy issues. We should tell it.

Andrew Liepman, a senior analyst at Rand Corp., was a career CIA officer and is a former deputy director of the National Counterterrorism Center."

FBI counter-terrorism agents began issuing the secret letters, which don't require a judge's approval, after Congress passed the USA Patriot Act in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.

The letters are used to collect unlimited kinds of sensitive, private information, such as financial and phone records and have prompted complaints of government privacy violations in the name of national security. Many of Google's services, including its dominant search engine and the popular Gmail application, have become daily habits for millions of people.

In a ruling written May 20 and obtained Friday, U.S. District Court Judge Susan Illston ordered Google to comply with the FBI's demands.

But she put her ruling on hold until the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals could decide the matter. Until then, the Mountain View, Calif.-based company must comply with the letters unless it shows the FBI didn't follow proper procedures in making its demands for customer data in the 19 letters Google is challenging, she said.

After receiving sworn statements from two top-ranking FBI officials, Illston said she was satisfied that 17 of the 19 letters were issued properly. She wanted more information on two other letters.

It was unclear from the judge's ruling what type of information the government sought to obtain with the letters. It was also unclear who the government was targeting.

The decision from the San Francisco-based Illston comes several months after she ruled in a separate case brought by the Electronic Frontier Foundation over the letters. She ruled in March that the FBI's demand that recipients refrain from telling anyone — including customers — that they had received the letters was a violation of free speech rights.

Kurt Opsah, an attorney with the foundation, said it could be many more months before the appeals court rules on the constitutionality of the letters in the Google case.

""We are disappointed that the same judge who declared these letters unconstitutional is now requiring compliance with them,"" Opsah said on Friday.

Illston's May 20 order omits any mention of Google or that the proceedings have been closed to the public. But the judge said ""the petitioner"" was involved in a similar case filed on April 22 in New York federal court.

Public records show that on that same day, the federal government filed a ""petition to enforce National Security Letter"" against Google after the company declined to cooperate with government demands.

Google can still appeal Illston's decision. The company declined comment Friday.

In 2007, the Justice Department's inspector general found widespread violations in the FBI's use of the letters, including demands without proper authorization and information obtained in non-emergency circumstances. The FBI has tightened oversight of the system.

The FBI made 16,511 national security letter requests for information regarding 7,201 people in 2011, the latest data available."

My continued liberty has been owed to the efforts of friends new and old, family, and others who I have never met and probably never will. I trusted them with my life and they returned that trust with a faith in me for which I will always be thankful.

On Thursday, President Obama declared before the world that he would not permit any diplomatic ""wheeling and dealing"" over my case. Yet now it is being reported that after promising not to do so, the President ordered his Vice President to pressure the leaders of nations from which I have requested protection to deny my asylum petitions.

This kind of deception from a world leader is not justice, and neither is the extralegal penalty of exile. These are the old, bad tools of political aggression. Their purpose is to frighten, not me, but those who would come after me.

For decades the United States of America have been one of the strongest defenders of the human right to seek asylum. Sadly, this right, laid out and voted for by the U.S. in Article 14 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, is now being rejected by the current government of my country. The Obama administration has now adopted the strategy of using citizenship as a weapon. Although I am convicted of nothing, it has unilaterally revoked my passport, leaving me a stateless person.

Without any judicial order, the administration now seeks to stop me exercising a basic right. A right that belongs to everybody. The right to seek asylum.

In the end the Obama administration is not afraid of whistleblowers like me, Bradley Manning or Thomas Drake. We are stateless, imprisoned, or powerless. No, the Obama administration is afraid of you. It is afraid of an informed, angry public demanding the constitutional government it was promised — and it should be.

I am unbowed in my convictions and impressed at the efforts taken by so many."

The system works by encouraging government workers to rat out any coworkers they suspect of being potentially inclined to blow the whistle before any leaks are even attempted, with an eye toward rooting out potential ""threats"" and intimidating rank-and-file workers against even daring to risk revealing information about government crimes and abuses.

It wasn't supposed to be this way. President Obama ran his initial campaign on a pledge for transparency and a promise to enhance whistleblower protection, both of which have been scrapped. Instead, the administration now forwards the narrative that whistleblowers by their very nature are a threat to national security, and that all government actions that aren't explicitly publicized by the White House are secrets as a matter of course.

Government hostility to whistleblowers is nothing new, of course. Though the claims of grave danger stemming from making the public and ""the enemy"" (in many cases the two seem identical for the career bureaucrat) never pan out, whistleblowers have always faced threats both overt and covert, and attempted retaliation from all levels of government.

In the past the worst of this retaliation was extralegal -- President Nixon ordered a break-in at the psychiatrist of whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg in the hope of uncovering something to use against him. That's no longer the case, however, as in spite of laws like the Whistleblowers Protection Act (WPA) of 1989 the retaliation against recent whistleblowers has primarily focused on threats of huge prison sentences, and in an era of secret laws and secret courts, those threats have more force now than in the past.

The WPA, and efforts to enhance it like the No-FEAR Act, have at their core an exemption for ""national security,"" and in recent administrations the attempt to label anything and everything as a matter of national security has left them treating these laws as though they essentially don't exist.

That's where the Insider Threat program comes in. Detailed by McClatchy newspapers in recent weeks, the new scheme encourages all agencies of the federal government to come up with their own disparate anti-whistleblower rules, at the center of which will be a threat to punish anybody who even suspects a potential whistleblower and doesn't turn them in. The details of the initiative get more terrifying the deeper one delves into them, with the conclusion that recent divorcees and people with perceived money troubles have to be turned in, and will face preemptive action against them, likely ending their careers on mere suspicion that they couldn't be trusted, when the chips are down, to continue betraying the public trust in the name of secrecy.

With the ""national security"" exemption in the law, the administration may feel the initiative is secure, but the reality is that any efforts to use the exemption must pass muster in a court. Even in this security-mad era, no court is going to buy that the Department of Education or others implementing this program have real concerns that an internal whistleblower uncovering abuse is truly threatening the nation as a whole.

Though it may take quite some time to get fleshed out in court, it is plain that the administration's hostility to whistleblowers has gone from pathological to downright illegal, as the Insider Threat program is explicitly designed to discriminate against whistleblowers (or even would-be whistleblowers) in ways banned under federal law.

This level of hostility toward the public's right to know cannot be permitted, nor simply left for the courts to resolve. Congress should immediately push initiatives to bolster protections for whistleblowers to the extent that a sitting president can no longer threaten the entire class of government employees. From Peter Buxtun's revelation of the Tuskegee experiments of the 1960's to the wiretapping and torture revelations of today, whistleblowers have provided an essential check against government overreach and abuse. Now more than ever that's a check we need in place.

You arrived in the Senate with an understandable interest in gun violence. The ban on assault weapons you successfully sponsored has long since expired. You’ve been working on a new one for almost a decade, and, after the Sandy Hook slaughter, it looked for a minute as if there might be a chance.

But, as the immediate impact of the tragedy faded, the assault weapons ban lost traction. This had nothing whatsoever to do with the power of the opponents’ arguments, which seem to get weaker by the day.

At the time, more than 100 teams of U.S. analysts were scouring Iraq for snippets of electronic data that might lead to the bomb-makers and their hidden factories. But the NSA director, Gen. Keith B. Alexander, wanted more than mere snippets. He wanted everything: Every Iraqi text message, phone call and e-mail that could be vacuumed up by the agency’s powerful computers.

“Rather than look for a single needle in the haystack, his approach was, ‘Let’s collect the whole haystack,’ ” said one former senior U.S. intelligence official who tracked the plan’s implementation. “Collect it all, tag it, store it. . . . And whatever it is you want, you go searching for it.”

The unprecedented data collection plan, dubbed Real Time Regional Gateway, would play a role in breaking up Iraqi insurgent networks and significantly reducing the monthly death toll from improvised explosive devices by late 2008. It also encapsulated Alexander’s controversial approach to safeguarding Americans from what he sees as a host of imminent threats, from terrorism to devastating cyberattacks.

In his eight years at the helm of the country’s electronic surveillance agency, Alexander, 61, has quietly presided over a revolution in the government’s ability to scoop up information in the name of national security. And, as he did in Iraq, Alexander has pushed hard for everything he can get: tools, resources and the legal authority to collect and store vast quantities of raw information on American and foreign communications.

Caption The National Security Agency, which is embroiled in controversy over its digital surveillance operations, has a long and storied history. It recently celebrated its 60th anniversary by releasing archive photos. The National Security Agency was established Nov. 4, 1952. But its lineage dates to World War I, when the Army began gathering information from foreign radio messages. During World War II, cryptologists used electromechanical devices, known as a bombe, to break German encryption in the 1940s. National Security Agency Wait 1 second to continue.

His successes have won accolades from political leaders of both parties as well as from counterterrorism and intelligence professionals who say the NSA chief’s efforts have helped foil dozens of terrorist attacks. His approach also has drawn attack from civil rights groups and a bipartisan group of lawmakers. One Democrat who confronted Alexander at a congressional hearing last month accused the NSA of crossing a line by collecting the cellphone records of millions of Americans.

“What authorization gave you the grounds for acquiring my cellphone data?” demanded Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), waving his mobile phone at the four-star general.

****

New details of the spy agency’s vast reach were brought to light last month by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, who leaked classified information on government programs that sweep up “metadata” on phone calls and e-mails by Americans. Those revelations in turn have spotlighted the role played by Alexander, the NSA’s avuncular leader and, by all accounts, a driving force behind a post-Sept. 11, 2001, quest to transform an agency inundated by the data revolution into one that can exploit it to defend the nation.

As portrayed by supporters, Alexander is animated by a spymaster’s awareness of serious, overlapping threats arrayed against the United States. They include foreign and homegrown terrorists. They also include a host of adversaries who are constantly probing the country’s cyberdefenses, looking for opportunities to steal secrets or unleash mayhem by shutting down critical infrastructure. Like many national security officials of his generation, Alexander’s sensibilities were shaped by a series of painful intelligence lapses leading up to the Sept. 11 attacks.

To some of Alexander’s most vociferous critics, Snowden’s disclosures confirm their image of an agency and a director so enamored of technological prowess that they have sacrificed privacy rights.

“He is absolutely obsessed and completely driven to take it all, whenever possible,” said Thomas Drake, a former NSA official and whistleblower. The continuation of Alexander’s policies, Drake said, would result in the “complete evisceration of our civil liberties.”

Alexander frequently points out that collection programs are subject to oversight by Congress as well as the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, although the proceedings of both bodies are shrouded in secrecy. But even his defenders say Alexander’s aggressiveness has sometimes taken him to the outer edge of his legal authority.

Some in Congress complain that Alexander’s NSA is sometimes slow to inform the oversight committees of problems, particularly when the agency’s eavesdroppers inadvertently pick up communications that fall outside the NSA’s legal mandates. Others are uncomfortable with the extraordinarily broad powers vested in the NSA chief. In 2010, he became the first head of U.S. Cyber Command, set up to defend Defense Department networks against hackers and, when authorized, conduct attacks on adversaries. Pentagon officials and Alexander say the command’s mission is also to defend the nation against cyberattacks.

“He is the only man in the land that can promote a problem by virtue of his intelligence hat and then promote a solution by virtue of his military hat,” said one former Pentagon official, voicing a concern that the lines governing the two authorities are not clearly demarcated and that Alexander can evade effective public oversight as a result. The former official spoke on the condition of anonymity to be able to talk freely.

Alexander himself has expressed unease about secrecy constraints that he says prohibit him from fully explaining what the NSA does. But just as in Iraq, he remains fiercely committed to the belief that “we need to get it all,” said Timothy Edgar, a former privacy officer at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and at the White House.

“He certainly believes you need to collect everything you can under the law,” Edgar said, “and that includes pushing for pretty aggressive interpretations of the law.”

Alexander maintained in a speech last month that he is mindful to “do everything you can to protect civil liberties and privacy.”

He then added a warning: “Everyone also understands,” he said, “that if we give up a capability that is critical to the defense of this nation, people will die.”

The NSA’s 5,000-acre campus at Fort Meade in suburban Maryland contains more than 1,300 heavily guarded buildings and an array of computers and gadgetry sometimes described as “the most wonderful electronic toybox in the world.” But even before his arrival there in 2005 as director, Alexander was regarded as a leading apostle for harnessing technology’s awesome power in the service of national security.

In the mid-1990s, he had pioneered work in battlefield visualization — helping the soldier see on a laptop screen where friendly and enemy forces were on a detailed terrain map. He later led the push for technological innovation as head of the Army’s Intelligence and Security Command.

At the NSA, he has presided over the agency’s physical expansion while moving quickly to speed up the collection, analysis and sharing of massive amounts of raw data.

In the process, the West Point graduate has risen to become arguably the most powerful U.S. general most Americans have never heard of — or at least not until the Snowden affair propelled him into the public spotlight. He runs the nation’s largest, costliest and most secretive intelligence agency — an organization whose very existence was not officially acknowledged in its early years. The NSA holds primacy over all electronic eavesdropping overseas, from routine spying on foreign governments to sweeping up communications between terrorists overseas. Most of it is now done through hacking into networks in other countries.

Three years ago, Alexander’s responsibilities ballooned with his appointment to lead the Pentagon’s U.S. Cyber Command.

Even close allies have fretted about the concentration of so much responsibility — not to mention influence — in a single individual. Some worry that the job was tailored to the skills of one man and not to the mission itself.

“Where do you find another person like General Alexander who possesses the intel qualifications to run NSA and the operational experience to command” the military’s cyber operations, said retired Lt. Gen. Robert J. Elder, who launched the Air Force’s first cyber command in 2007.

No one questions Alexander’s qualifications for the dual role. With a trio of master’s degrees in electronic warfare, physics and national security strategy, the Syracuse, N.Y., native is endowed with technical smarts and ambition as well as a folksy, even goofy, charm that can disarm critics.

He routinely makes references — in speeches and in person with colleagues — to his four daughters and his 14, soon-to-be 15, grandchildren, including how the youngest, a toddler, Skypes with Grandma.

In January, he was on a cybersecurity panel in Munich when someone brought up Twitter’s announcement that 250,000 of its accounts had been hacked. “I didn’t do it,” Alexander said. “I was here. I have an alibi.” Then, turning to a fellow panelist, an official from the Chinese tech company Huawei, he quipped: “Do you?”

Last summer, Alexander waded into the lion’s den when, wearing jeans and a black T-shirt, he delivered a keynote address at the Def Con hackers convention in Las Vegas and mugged for the cameras. At the time, he told the crowd that “the story that we [at the NSA] have millions or hundreds of millions of dossiers on people is absolutely false.”

That line irked lawmakers who were aware of the NSA’s secret collection of phone data. And this year, after Snowden’s revelations, Def Con organizers said federal officials were not welcome at the event.

Alexander’s outsize commitment to his mission has propelled him to seek new capabilities with an impatience that has sometimes rankled superiors, while also raising concerns about privacy and how far he wants to push into offensive uses of cybertools. Alexander has argued for covert action authority, which is traditionally the domain of the CIA, individuals familiar with the matter say.

He has been credited as a key supporter of the development of Stuxnet, the computer worm that infected Iran’s main uranium enrichment facility in 2009 and 2010 and is the most aggressive known use to date of offensive cyberweaponry. U.S. officials have never publicly acknowledged involvement in what has been described by experts as the first known, industrial-scale cyberattack on a sovereign nation, one that is estimated to have set back Iran’s uranium production by as much as a year.

Alexander also pushed hard for expanded authority to see into U.S. private sector networks to help defend them against foreign cyberattacks.

Quiet concerns also have been voiced by some of the private companies that would potentially benefit from government protection against cyberattack.

At a private meeting with financial industry officials a few years ago, Alexander spoke about the proliferation of computer malware aimed at siphoning data from networks, including those of banks. The meeting was described by a participant who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussion was off the record.

His proposed solution: Private companies should give the government access to their networks so it could screen out the harmful software. The NSA chief was offering to serve as an all-knowing virus-protection service, but at the cost, industry officials felt, of an unprecedented intrusion into the financial institutions’ databases.

The group of financial industry officials, sitting around a table at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, were stunned, immediately grasping the privacy implications of what Alexander was politely but urgently suggesting. As a group, they demurred.

“He’s an impressive person,” the participant said, recalling the group’s collective reaction to Alexander. “You feel very comfortable with him. He instills a high degree of trust.”

But he was proposing something they thought was high-risk.

“Folks in the room looked at each other like, ‘Wow. That’s kind of wild.’ ”"

Rapiscan, a unit of OSI Systems Inc., manufactured about 200 full-body scanners used by the TSA to screen passengers for hidden weapons at airports across the country. The machines generated a storm of protest because the devices use low levels of radiation to create what resembles a nude image of screened passengers.

The machines, one of two types of scanners used by the TSA for passenger screening, will be pulled from all airports by this summer. The TSA had already begun to remove the Rapiscan scanners from Los Angeles International Airport in October to replace them with faster screening machines.

The agency won’t use the Rapiscan full-body scanners because the company could not produce a software upgrade to protect the privacy of passengers in time to meet a congressional deadline, according to TSA and Rapsican officials.

Privacy advocates and others praised the move, saying the scanners violated the privacy of passengers and exposed them to unhealthy levels of radiation — a charge the TSA denies.

“This is a significant victory for privacy,” said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, an advocacy group that sued to try to force the TSA to hold public hearings over the deployment of full-body scanners at airports. “The announcement by the TSA is recognition that if devices don’t respect the privacy of the public, they don’t belong here.”

Rapiscan has agreed to pay the cost of removing its scanners from airports. Most will be replaced by a second type of scanner that uses radio waves and shows hidden objects projected onto a generic avatar image on a screen — not on a nude-like image of a passenger. Those scanners are built by New York-based L-3 Communications Holdings.

“It’s good news and a step in the right direction,” said Brandon M. Macsata, executive director of the Assn. for Airline Passenger Rights, an advocacy group that has questioned the health effects of the X-ray scans on passengers. “We still have questions about whether these machines really make airports that much safer.”

The Rapiscan scanners use low-level X-rays to create what looks like a naked image of screened passengers to uncover weapons hidden under clothes. TSA officers in isolated rooms see the images and then notify other agents at the security lines if hidden weapons are spotted.

Since 2007, the TSA has used full-body scanners, in addition to metal detectors and random pat-down searches, to try to prevent terrorists from sneaking explosives onto planes. But the TSA has been accused by privacy groups, members of Congress and others of using extreme tactics.

Responding to questions about the safety of the scanners, TSA officials said the machines have been repeatedly tested by medical experts and found to expose passengers to levels of radiation well below safe health standards.

To address privacy concerns, Congress imposed a June 2013 deadline for Rapiscan to come up with a software upgrade that would prevent the scanner from showing TSA agents the nude-like images. But Rapiscan officials said the company wouldn’t be able to meet that deadline.

“TSA has strict requirements that all vendors must meet for security effectiveness and efficiency since the use of this technology is critical to TSA’s efforts to keep the traveling public safe,” the TSA said in a statement.

Rapiscan representatives called the TSA decision “unfortunate” but noted that they fulfilled their $15-million contract to build the machines and continue to produce security devices for the TSA, including luggage scanners and metal detectors.

Peter Kant, executive vice president of Rapiscan, said his company won’t collect on the $5-million contract to complete the software upgrade and must pay for the cost of removing the existing scanners from airports across the country. But he added: “For a $400-million company, that’s a pretty small number.”

The scanners that will be removed from airports will be used by the military and federal law enforcement, among other government agencies, for security screening, Kant said.

Rapiscan has more than 1,000 employees worldwide and reported nearly $400 million in sales in 2012.

Johnson, who framed many of the administration’s national security policies as the Defense Department’s general counsel during Mr. Obama’s first term, to become the next secretary of the Homeland Security Department, according to administration officials.

If confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Johnson, 56, will fill the vacancy left by Janet Napolitano, who resigned in July to lead the University of California system.

Mr. Johnson — whose first name is pronounced “Jay” — has little experience with some of the issues that Ms. Napolitano faced, like border security and immigration. But he was a legal adviser to Mr. Obama during his first presidential campaign and has similar views to the president’s about the future of the United States’ counterterrorism operations. He was at the center of Mr. Obama’s first-term efforts to re-evaluate the counterterrorism policies of President George W. Bush.

During his tenure at the Defense Department, Mr. Johnson shaped the Obama administration’s policies on the detention of terrorism suspects and on targeted drone strikes in Yemen and Somalia. He also helped lead the drive to end the “don’t ask, don’t tell” law that had barred gay men and lesbians from serving openly in the military."

http://news.yahoo.com/nsa-revelations-stir-congressional-concern-200706066.html,,[],New NSA revelations stir congressional concern,"WASHINGTON (AP) — New revelations from leaker Edward Snowden that the National Security Agency has overstepped its authority thousands of times since 2008 are stirring renewed calls on Capitol Hill for serious changes to NSA spy programs, undermining White House hopes that President Barack Obama had quieted the controversy with his assurances of oversight.

An internal audit provided by Snowden to The Washington Post shows the agency has repeatedly broken privacy rules or exceeded its legal authority every year since Congress granted it broad new powers in 2008.

In one of the documents, agency personnel are instructed to remove details and substitute more generic language in reports to the Justice Department and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence — reports used as the basis for informing Congress.

Obama has repeatedly said that Congress was thoroughly briefed on the programs revealed by Snowden in June, but some senior lawmakers said they had been unaware of the NSA audit until they read the news on Friday. The programs described earlier vacuum up vast amounts of metadata — such as telephone numbers called and called from, the time and duration of calls — from most Americans' phone records, and scoop up global Internet usage data.

White House deputy press secretary Josh Earnest said Friday that the NSA documents showed that NSA's Compliance Office established in 2009 ""is monitoring, detecting, addressing and reporting compliance incidents,"" and that ""the majority of the compliance incidents are unintentional."" In a statement from the Massachusetts island of Martha's Vineyard, where the president is vacationing, he added that the administration is ""keeping the Congress appropriately informed of compliance issues as they arise.""

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy announced he would hold hearings into the new disclosures.

""I remain concerned that we are still not getting straightforward answers from the NSA,"" the Vermont Democrat said in a statement.

Story continues

Senate Intelligence Committee chairwoman Dianne Feinstein said her committee had been notified of compliance problems — not by seeing the internal audit but through legally required reports to her committee.

""In all such cases, the incidents have been addressed by ending or adapting the activity,"" the California Democrat said in a statement."" She added, ""The committee has never identified an instance in which the NSA has intentionally abused its authority to conduct surveillance for inappropriate purposes.""

But she said that committee would be asking for additional reports in future, and members would start making routine trips to the NSA to oversee its activities.

Her Republican House counterpart, Intelligence chairman Mike Rogers, said human error was inevitable and ""there was no intentional and willful violation of the law.""

But the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger of Maryland, called the new disclosures ""incredibly troubling."" He said he had instructed his staff ""to thoroughly review and evaluate these allegations.""

Another Democratic member of the Intelligence Committee, Rep. Mike Thompson of California, said: ""Reports that the NSA repeatedly overstepped its legal boundaries, broke privacy regulations and attempted to shield required disclosure of violations are outrageous, inappropriate and must be addressed.""

House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, who generally supports the programs, said in a statement Friday that the new revelations ""are extremely disturbing.""

And two senators who have consistently raised red flags about possible privacy violations stemming from NSA programs indicated there is more to be revealed.

""We believe Americans should know that this confirmation is just the tip of a larger iceberg,"" said Democratic Sens. Mark Udall of Colorado and Ron Wyden of Oregon in a statement. Both declined to provide details, citing Senate rules about discussing classified information.

Proposed legislation to dismantle the programs was narrowly defeated last month in the House. The July legislative effort brought together Libertarian-leaning conservatives and liberal Democrats who pressed for change against congressional leaders and lawmakers focused on security.

A week ago, Obama sought to soothe concerns by promising to consider reforms to NSA surveillance.

""It's not enough for me to have confidence in these programs,"" he said at a White House news conference. ""The American people have to have confidence in them as well.""

He announced changes such as convening an outside advisory panel to review U.S. surveillance powers, although it is unclear how that would differ from the existing U.S. Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, mandated by Congress to monitor surveillance and constitutional concerns. Obama also said the NSA would hire a privacy officer — though the NSA already has a compliance office. None of those measures would seem likely to stop the kind of inadvertent collection of information that was described in the NSA audit.

Most of the infractions revealed late Thursday involve unauthorized surveillance of Americans or foreign intelligence targets in the United States, both of which are restricted by law and executive order, according to the May 3, 2012 audit, and other top-secret documents.

The May audit counted 2,776 incidents in the preceding 12 months of unauthorized collection, storage, access to or distribution of legally protected communications. Most were reported to be unintended, and many involved failures to take sufficient care or violations of standard operating procedure. They ranged from significant violations of law to typographical errors that resulted in unintended interceptions of U.S. emails and telephone calls.

The most serious incidents included a violation of a court order and unauthorized use of data about more than 3,000 Americans and green-card holders.

In the typographical error category, the Post cited a 2008 example of the collection of a ""large number"" of phone records from Washington, D.C., when a programming error confused the District of Columbia area code 202 for 20-2, the international dialing code for Cairo, according to a quality assurance review that was not distributed to the NSA's oversight staff.

The NSA also saw a spike in the number of ""roamers,"" or overseas, phone calls wrongly tracked in the first quarter of 2012, when those roamers traveled into U.S. territory, which is outside NSA's authority. The report said the errors may have been due to tracking Chinese who were visiting friends and relatives for the Chinese lunar new year.

In another case, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which has authority over some NSA operations, did not learn about a new collection method until it had been in operation for many months. The court ruled it unconstitutional.

The FISC's chief judge told the Post that the court could rule only on the material it was given.

""The FISC is forced to rely upon the accuracy of the information that is provided to the Court,"" U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton said in a written statement to the Post. ""The FISC does not have the capacity to investigate issues of noncompliance, and in that respect the FISC is in the same position as any other court when it comes to enforcing (government) compliance with its orders.""

The Associated Press made a request to Walton for that statement. A court official said the judge had no response.

The White House declined Friday to comment on the latest revelations. It directed questions to the National Security Council, and NSC spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden directed questions to the NSA.

NSA spokeswoman Vanee Vines said the number of incidents in the first quarter of 2012 was higher than normal, and that the number has ranged from 372 to 1,162 in the past three years, due to factors such as ""implementation of new procedures or guidance with respect to our authorities that prompt a spike that requires 'fine tuning,' changes to the technology or software in the targeted environment for which we had no prior knowledge, unforeseen shortcomings in our systems, new or expanded access, and 'roaming' by foreign targets into the U.S., some of which NSA cannot anticipate in advance but each instance of which is reported as an incident.""

""When NSA makes a mistake in carrying out its foreign intelligence mission, the agency reports the issue internally and to federal overseers — and aggressively gets to the bottom of it,"" Vines said.

When asked why the Post did not publish the story earlier, though the paper said it had the documents for months, spokeswoman Kris Coratti emailed Friday that ""it has taken some time to study them and understand the information they contain.""

The AP filed a Freedom of Information Act request to the NSA on June 17 asking for all copies of ""minimization procedures"" the agency uses to avoid collecting Internet and telephone data from U.S. citizens. That request sought documents that would also detail how the government purges records that may have been accidentally collected. The AP has yet to receive responsive material, though the NSA agreed to fast-track its request.

That is incorrect: Snowden traveled using his U.S. passport. This version has been corrected.

Edward Snowden seems to be stranded.

Three weeks after Snowden revealed himself as the source of leaked top-secret documents on U.S. intelligence gathering, the former intelligence contractor is stuck in legal limbo in Russia. Although he has not been seen publicly in days, he is thought to be inside a transit area of a Moscow airport.

On Sunday, two of his strongest supporters — Julian Assange of WikiLeaks and President Rafael Correa of Ecuador — said it was unlikely that Snowden would leave there anytime soon.

“The United States, by canceling his passport, has left him for the moment marooned in Russia,” said Assange, whose anti-

secrecy organization has aided Snowden in his flight.

The United States canceled Snowden’s passport a week ago, after he was charged with espionage. Assange criticized that decision on ABC’s “This Week With George Stephanopoulos”: “To take a passport from a young man in a difficult situation like that is a disgrace,” he said.

And in Ecuador on Sunday, Correa seemed to play down the chances that his country could offer Snowden a way out. For now, Correa told the Associated Press, Snowden was “under the care of the Russian authorities.”

“This is the decision of Russian authorities. He doesn’t have a passport. I don’t know the Russian laws. I don’t know if he can leave the airport, but I understand that he can’t,” Correa said. He said the case was out of Ecuador’s hands. “If [Snowden] arrives at an Ecuadoran embassy, we’ll analyze his request for asylum.”

Snowden’s escape plan was never a simple one. After first making himself one of the most wanted men in the world, he was attempting to hopscotch 11,000 miles from Hong Kong to Russia to Ecuador — perhaps with a stopover in Cuba.

To do it, he would have to stay ahead of U.S. law enforcement and a pack of news media — and to count on the caprices of three (or four) foreign governments.

Snowden made it one stop. He flew from Hong Kong to Moscow a week ago, apparently on his U.S. passport. It had already been revoked, but Hong Kong authorities said they had not received the official request from the U.S. government.

Now, Snowden’s flight has brought him to the transit area of Sheremetyevo International Airport. And to a dwindling set of options.

One is simply staying in the airport. If Snowden is not being detained by Russian authorities — and Russian officials have said that he is not — he could remain in an area reserved for international travelers making connections. As long as he does not go through passport control, Russian officials say, he would not legally cross into Russian territory.

If he wants to leave, however, Snowden would need travel documents to replace his canceled passport.

Earlier, it appeared that Ecuadoran officials might be willing to help him with this. On June 22, the Ecuadoran Embassy in London issued a safe-conduct pass in his name. (Assange himself is holed up at the same embassy, avoiding extradition to Sweden for questioning over allegations of sexual abuse).

But it seems unlikely that Ecuador would provide the same kind of help again.

On Sunday, Correa told the Associated Press that the Ecuadoran official who issued the pass had committed “a serious error” by not consulting officials back home. Correa said the consul would be punished, though he didn’t specify how.

Correa’s tone seemed to have shifted after a conversation with Vice President Biden on Friday. Where Correa had earlier been defiant, he now voiced respect for U.S. legal procedures.

“If he really could have broken North American laws, I am very respectful of other countries and their laws, and I believe that someone who breaks the law must assume his responsibilities,” Correa said, according to AP.

Snowden might be able to obtain travel documents from another country — one willing to showily defy the U.S. government. In Venezuela, for instance, President Nicolás Maduro recently praised Snowden for revealing the extent of U.S. surveillance.

“No one has up to this point formally asked us to give political asylum to this young person, Snowden,” said Maduro, who was scheduled to arrive in Russia on Monday for a trade mission. “If they asked us for it, we’d think about it, think about it. And it’s almost certain that we’d give it to him. Why? Because asylum is an international humanitarian right to protect those who are being pursued for noble causes.”

Snowden might also seek asylum from Russia itself.

On Sunday, a spokesman for Russian President Vladi­mir Putin said Snowden is not the Kremlin’s concern. But he also noted that “public opinion on the subject is very rich,” and he pointed out that politicians and human rights defenders had spoken in support of offering Snowden asylum. “We are aware of that and take it into account.”

That could perhaps be a nod toward the possibility of asylum. Or not.

For now, only one country seems to be offering Snowden a certain way out of his airport limbo. It’s the one he doesn’t want to go back to.

“Mr. Snowden is hardly ‘marooned’ since he is still a United States citizen and his country is willing to take him back,” said Nanda Chitre, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department. “The U.S. government is prepared to issue individuals wanted on felony charges a one-entry travel document to return home.”

U.S. authorities charged Snowden last month with theft, “unauthorized communication of national defense information” and “willful communication of classified communications intelligence information to an unauthorized person.”

The charges were filed in federal court in Alexandria, whose jurisdiction includes the headquarters of contractor Booz Allen Hamilton, Snowden’s former employer. On Sunday, Assange argued that Snowden could not expect justice in that court.

“The jury pool is made up of the CIA, Pentagon, etc.,” Assange said. “There’s a . . . 99.97 percent chance that if you’re a target of the grand jury, you’ll be indicted. And a 99 percent chance that if you’re indicted by a grand jury, you will be convicted.”

Asked whether those statistics were correct, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney in that district declined to comment Sunday.

Assange was asked by Stephanopoulos whether WikiLeaks was in possession of other secrets that Snowden took with him.

“Look, there is no stopping the publishing process at this stage,” Assange said. “Great care has been taken to make sure that Mr. Snowden can’t be pressured by any state to stop the publication process.”

The Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel wrote a series of legal opinions from 2002 to 2005 concluding that the methods were not torture if used under strict rules; all the memos were later withdrawn. News organizations have wrestled with whether to label the brutal methods unequivocally as torture in the face of some government officials’ claims that they were not.

In addition, the United States is a signatory to the international Convention Against Torture, which requires the prompt investigation of allegations of torture and the compensation of its victims.

Like the still-secret Senate interrogation report, the Constitution Project study was initiated after President Obama decided in 2009 not to support a national commission to investigate the post-9/11 counterterrorism programs, as proposed by Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, and others. Mr. Obama said then that he wanted to “look forward, not backward.” Aides have said he feared that his own policy agenda might get sidetracked in a battle over his predecessor’s programs.

The panel studied the treatment of prisoners at Guantánamo Bay, in Afghanistan and Iraq, and at the C.I.A’s secret prisons. Staff members, including the executive director, Neil A. Lewis, a former reporter for The New York Times, traveled to multiple detention sites and interviewed dozens of former American and foreign officials, as well as former detainees.

Mr. Hutchinson, who served in the Bush administration as chief of the Drug Enforcement Administration and under secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, said he “took convincing” on the torture issue. But after the panel’s nearly two years of research, he said he had no doubts about what the United States did.

“This has not been an easy inquiry for me, because I know many of the players,” Mr. Hutchinson said in an interview. He said he thought everyone involved in decisions, from Mr. Bush down, had acted in good faith, in a desperate effort to try to prevent more attacks.

“But I just think we learn from history,” Mr. Hutchinson said. “It’s incredibly important to have an accurate account not just of what happened but of how decisions were made.”"

The Federal Aviation Administration announced the selection of sites in Alaska, Nevada, New York, North Dakota, Texas and Virginia.

California, vying to become the Silicon Valley of robotic aircraft, was among the losers in the 24-state competition.

“These test sites will give us valuable information about how best to ensure the safe introduction of this advanced technology into our nation’s skies,” Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx in a statement.

In 2012, Congress directed the FAA to draw up rules for incorporating the remotely piloted aircraft in U.S. airspace by 2015.

TIMELINE: The year in politics

FAA Administrator Michael Huerta has estimated that 7,500 small drones could be aloft within five years.

The remotely piloted aircraft could be used for activities such as spotting wildfires, helping police track criminal suspects, scouting film locations and inspecting pipelines.

California was thought to be a favorite in the competition, considering it is home to the nation’s major drone makers, such as AeroVironment Inc. of Monrovia, General Atomics Aeronautical Systems Inc. of Poway, Lockheed Martin Corp. and Northrop Grumman Corp., which builds drones in Palmdale.

Huerta said in a call with reporters that the agency considered factors such as geographic and climatic diversity, availability of ground infrastructure, the type of proposed research, the aviation experience of the applicants and the volume of air traffic near the test sites.

He declined to say what the agency found lacking in the losing bids until FAA officials can meet with the unsuccessful bidders. He said those states not chosen will be debriefed in the coming days.

“Safety continues to be our first priority as we move ahead,’’ he said, citing the need to ensure that unmanned aircraft can detect and avoid other aircraft.

Those bidding for the test sites -- in many cases alliances of economic development groups, universities and aerospace companies -- believe that if they land a test site, drone manufacturers will follow. Currently, drones are not allowed to fly in the U.S. except with special permission from the FAA.

The testing comes amid concerns among the public and lawmakers that greater use of drones will violate privacy rights.

Huerta, acknowledging sensitivity to privacy concerns, said the agency will require test-site operators to comply with laws protecting an individual’s right to privacy.

Michael Toscano, president and chief executive of the Assn. for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, a trade group, called the FAA announcement an “important step toward recognizing the incredible economic and job creation potential this technology brings.’’

Huerta said he expects the first test site to begin operating within 180 days.

She Is Native Of Minnesota', 'Holds Degrees Boston College', 'Uc Berkeley S Graduate School Of Journalism.', 'Christi Parsons Was The Los Angeles Times', 'White House Correspondent']",Obama strongly defends phone and Internet surveillance,"WASHINGTON — From the time he stepped onto the national stage, Barack Obama presented himself as a civil libertarian who would take a different path from that of his predecessor, who authorized surveillance on Americans in the fight against terrorism. “It is time to write a new chapter in our response to 9/11,” Obama said in a 2007 speech that outlined his vision for national security.

But revelations this week of a massive phone and Internet data collection program illustrated that as president, Obama has allowed the government to sweep up vast amounts of information about its citizens while establishing some checks on executive power.

The result has been a surveillance regime that largely continues the policies of the later years of George W. Bush’s administration, while provoking far less dissent from Congress.

Indeed, a major part of Obama’s national security legacy is likely to be as the president who institutionalized the broad powers in targeted killings abroad and in surveillance at home that Bush claimed for the federal government after the Sept. 11 attacks. Once seen as Republican initiatives, they are now endorsed by both parties.

Obama defended the extensive surveillance Friday, saying he’d come into office skeptical and had bolstered congressional oversight and judicial review.

“We scrubbed them thoroughly. We actually expanded some of the oversight, increased some of safeguards,” he said at a news conference in San Jose. “I think it’s important to recognize that you can’t have 100% security and also then have 100% privacy and zero inconvenience. We’re going to have to make choices as a society.”

Critics say Obama has not only embraced tactics he denounced as senator, but has also set up a framework that cements their place in law. They note he has often used the same justifications that he once blasted as the Bush administration’s “false choice between the liberties we cherish and the security we demand.”

“Clearly, he took a critical stance toward surveillance as a senator. That has been all but absent from his policies as president,” said Steven Aftergood, director of the Project on Government Secrecy at the American Federation of Scientists. “He has not really articulated or tried to justify the changes in his public positions. So there is a something of a credibility gap that has emerged as a result.”

The Obama administration’s programs could soon be reviewed by the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, an independent federal panel that advises the president and lawmakers. The board, without confirmed appointees, had been essentially defunct for years. Obama waited until December 2011 to nominate David Medine as chairman. He was confirmed last month.

Medine declined to comment on the surveillance, but said he had requested a classified briefing. He said the board was “very energized and focused” on carrying out its mission, which he said seemed “ever more timely.”

Although his statements as a candidate were cheered by liberals in his party, it was also clear that Obama was far more constitutional law scholar than civil libertarian. Obama’s earliest criticism of the Bush-era programs focused more on the need for oversight by Congress and the courts than worries about Big Brother.

Obama continued that emphasis Friday. He sought to reassure Americans that “nobody is listening” to their telephone calls, but most of his remarks focused not on the substance of the government’s efforts to amass data but on process and legal structures. He made repeated references to the role of Congress and the courts in supervising the

programs, touting the “checks and balances” created in recent years, some of which were put in place in the last two years of Bush’s tenure.

“That’s not to suggest that you just say, ‘Trust me. We’re doing the right thing. We know who the bad guys are,’” Obama said. “And the reason that’s not how it works is because we’ve got congressional oversight and judicial oversight.”

Advertisement

That focus on process could also be seen in Obama’s voting record in the Senate on surveillance, which was a study in compromise.

In 2005, Obama spoke out against a reauthorization of the Patriot Act, which enhanced the power of law enforcement and intelligence agencies. But Obama’s key objection was about a lack of judicial review of searches, not about how much information was gathered.

Advertisement

“This legislation gives people no rights to appeal the need for such a search in a court of law,” he said. “No judge will hear their plea; no jury will hear their case.”

Obama eventually voted for a compromise that allowed court review of national security letters, which the FBI and other federal agencies use to demand such records as lists of phone calls. The compromise also added some restrictions to Section 215 requests, secret court orders for business records, such as the one leaked this week that exposed the government’s mass collection of phone records.

Advertisement

In 2007, Obama voted against the Protect America Act, the bill that empowered authorities to conduct the sort of Internet surveillance on foreigners also uncovered this week. But a year later, Obama voted to renew those powers as part of compromise bill to overhaul some surveillance practices.

The legislation established a legal framework and congressional oversight for wiretapping without warrants, a step critics say essentially codified the practice. It also brought lawmakers and the courts into process.

Advertisement

“The programs today are more or less what they were in 2007, 2008,” said Robert Chesney, a law professor at the University of Texas who studies national security law.

Congressional oversight and judicial review have not led to a shift in policy, experts note. The surveillance tends to have bipartisan support, and the secret federal court that reviews the government’s actions has not put up any known roadblocks.

Advertisement

That may be in part because lawmakers have little reason to balk in an age where the expectation of privacy is a shrinking notion. In a National Journal poll earlier this month, 85% of adults said it was likely that their “communications history, like phone calls, emails and Internet use” was “available for businesses, government, individuals and other groups to access” without consent.

With apparent court and congressional sanction, and broad public acceptance, some said, it would be dicier for a president not to exercise the powers at his disposal.

“There’s real risk that people might try to hurt America, and no president is going to ignore that. He’s not going to pull back on these programs unless they don’t work or there’s evidence they’re not legal,” Chesney said. “Can you imagine if a president went in and said, ‘I know Congress signed off on this, and courts approved it, but I’m not comfortable with this, therefore, we’re shutting it down.’? Now, that would leak.”

“Terror is up worldwide,” said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. “The statistics indicate that. The fatalities are way up.”

Feinstein made her comments on CNN’s “State of the Union” during a joint interview with Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, who argued the terror group Al Qaeda continues to grow and consolidate.

“What's happening in places like Syria [is] that you have a pooling of Al Qaeda and affiliates. … Groups have changed the way they communicate, which means it's less likely that we're going to be able to detect something prior to an event.”

Rogers also suggested that public scrutiny over U.S. intelligence work, brought on by recent disclosures about the efforts of the National Security Agency and others, has hurt anti-terror efforts.

“We’re fighting amongst ourselves here in this country about the role of our intelligence community,” he said. “That is having an impact on our ability to stop what is a growing number of threats. Our intelligence community isn’t the bad guys.”

Rogers also said terrorists are adopting the idea that ""maybe smaller events are OK"" and still might achieve their goals.

""That makes it exponentially harder for our intelligence services to stop an event like that from happening,"" he said.

Feinstein attributed the growing threat in part to improved weaponry.

""There are new bombs, very big bombs, trucks being reinforced for those bombs,"" she said.

Though neither lawmaker offered specifics about what led them to their conclusions, Feinstein spoke generally of ""a real displaced aggression in this very fundamentalist jihadist Islamic community, and that is that the West is responsible for everything that goes wrong and that the only thing that's going to solve this is Islamic Shariah law and the concept of the caliphate.""

The caliphate is an Islamic state led by a religious and political leader, or caliph, considered a successor of the Prophet Muhammad and who governs by Shariah law.

King Joined The Post S Editorial Board In']",Colbert King: Disturbing abuses of power,"East Germany’s Ministry for State Security, also known as the Stasi, posed a major challenge during my three-year stint as an attache at the U.S. Embassy in Bonn during the 1960s. Detecting and preventing Stasi agents from penetrating the security of U.S. diplomatic facilities in West Germany was a 24-7 undertaking.

The East German secret police were even more ruthless and relentless in operations against their own citizens. Political suppression in that communist state was total. There was no room for dissent. Thousands of East Germans were arbitrarily imprisoned for “internal security” reasons.

So it was especially galling to learn upon returning to the states in 1969 that the FBI had a counterintelligence program, known as COINTELPRO, that was, in some ways, as pernicious as the threat we were working against overseas.

Senate hearings in the 1970s revealed that the FBI, under the guise of protecting national security, had treated rights guaranteed by the First Amendment as little more than a collection of antiquated wishes best ignored.

With its surveillance of citizens, infiltration of civil rights groups and disruption of legal activities, the FBI’s counterintelligence program echoed the behavior of East Germany’s Stasi. The FBI acknowledges on its Web site that “COINTELPRO was later rightfully criticized by Congress and the American people for abridging first amendment rights and for other reasons.”

Fortunately, Congress reined in the FBI, placing it behind, and not beyond, the Constitution.

Where are we now?

The revelations that the Justice Department had secretly seized journalists’ phone records and that the Internal Revenue Service had targeted conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status show that government’s heavy hand has not been lifted. Are these examples of COINTELPRO revisited?

Not quite, though they are disturbing.

Governments spend millions to prevent secrets from falling into enemy hands. A Justice Department probe into a compromised Middle East intelligence operation last year was not focused on the surreptitious work of a foreign power. The unlawful disclosure came from within.

The Justice Department sought to discover who in the U.S. government allegedly told the Associated Press about a failed al-Qaeda plot in Yemen.

The compromised Yemeni operation differs from some breakdowns in national security for its cause. Chalk up that serious breach to hubris: the leaker’s puerile chest-thumping about having bested a sworn enemy or, worse, a self-serving desire to burnish the Obama administration’s credentials as an al-Qaeda slayer.

Ann Telnaes animation: John Boehner’s selective accountability (Ann Telnaes/The Washington Post)

In this regard, the administration has only itself to blame.

On top of the mistakes made by a U.S. official leaking the nation’s secrets, the administration compounded things by launching a dragnet for the records of calls received and made from 20 phone lines (including office, home and cell numbers) of the AP journalists in five area codes and three states.

Talk about power running amok.

Meanwhile, back in the bureaucracy, Internal Revenue Service workers were having a high old time putting conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status through hoops. IRS employees were instructed to be on the “lookout” for groups with “tea party” and “patriot” in their names, according to the report of the Treasury Department’s inspector general for tax administration.

The acting IRS commissioner has already been forced to walk the plank, and more heads may roll. The IRS has a steep hill to climb to gain the public’s trust. But there is one bright spot: This misbehavior was detected and exposed by government self-policing. Of course, the selective screening never should have occurred. But the inspector general system created to ferret out government fraud, waste and abuse worked in this case.

The Justice Department, meanwhile, is in an even deeper hole.

Who can take seriously the department’s mission, as stated by its Office of Privacy and Civil Liberties, “to protect the privacy and civil liberties of the American people”?

Famed First Amendment lawyer Floyd Abrams told the Daily Beast this week that the Justice Department’s broad seizure of journalists’ phone records was “certainly one of the most intense intrusions by the government into a pressroom that I can remember.”

“Why couldn’t they put this issue before a judge?” Abrams asked. “What they have done is foreclose any meaningful response by the AP. This isn’t just seeking a record of one journalist for one day. This is breaking and entering into the heart of the journalistic process of the Associated Press.”

Media outlets covering D.C. affairs should also be concerned. Journalists who draw on confidential sources while aggressively covering the city’s corruption scandal may now wonder if U.S. Attorney Ronald Machen is going after their phone records. After all, it was Machen’s office that served the subpoenas in the AP case.

COINTELPRO? No. Unchecked government power? Yes.

http://news.yahoo.com/defense-nominee-hagel-defends-record-senate-143219140--politics.html,,[],Defense nominee Hagel defends his record in Senate,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama's nominee for defense secretary on Thursday defended his views of the military and global threats in a combative confirmation hearing, pushing back against criticism of his past statements on Israel, Iran, Iraq and nuclear weapons. Chuck Hagel told senators that America ""must engage — not retreat — in the world,"" and insisted that his record is consistent on that point.

The former two-term Republican senator faced strong GOP resistance and was forced to explain past remarks and votes even as he appeared on a path to confirmation as Obama second-term defense secretary and the nation's 24th Pentagon chief.

His fiercest exchange came with Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a fellow Vietnam veteran, onetime close friend and a potential vote that would carry considerable sway. Politics and Hagel's evolving opposition to the Iraq war caused a split between the two men that was on full display at the confirmation hearing.

McCain pressed Hagel on whether he was right or wrong about his opposition to the influx of 30,000 U.S. troops in Iraq in 2007. Hagel, who voted to authorize military force in Iraq, later opposed the conflict, comparing it to Vietnam and arguing that it shifted the focus from Afghanistan.

""Were you right? Were you correct in your assessment?"" McCain asked.

""I would defer to the judgment of history to sort that out,"" Hagel said as the two men talked over each other.

""The committee deserves your judgment as to whether you were right or wrong about the surge,"" McCain insisted.

Unable to elicit a simple answer, McCain said the record should show that Hagel refused to answer.

McCain made it clear that he would have the final word — with his vote, which he said would be influenced by Hagel's refusal to answer yes or no.

""I think history has already made a judgment about the surge, sir, and you're on the wrong side of it. And your refusal to answer whether you were right or wrong about it is going to have an impact on my judgment as to whether to vote for your confirmation or not,"" he said.

Story continues

Hagel was the lone witness in a jam-packed hearing room at a session that could be crucial in determining whether he will win Senate confirmation and join Obama's second-term national security team. He spoke out forcefully for a strong military while trying to explain 12 years of Senate votes and numerous statements.

""No one individual vote, no one individual quote or no one individual statement defines me, my beliefs, or my record,"" Hagel told the Senate Armed Services Committee. ""My overall worldview has never changed: that America has and must maintain the strongest military in the world; that we must lead the international community to confront threats and challenges together; and that we must use all tools of American power to protect our citizens and our interests.""

Hagel, 66, a decorated Vietnam combat veteran, would be the lone Republican in Obama's cabinet and the first enlisted man to become defense secretary, a point that Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin, D-Mich., highlighted.

""It would be a positive message for our soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines in harm's way around the world to know that one of their own holds the highest office in the Department of Defense and that he has their backs,"" Levin said.

Two former committee chairmen — Democrat Sam Nunn and Republican John Warner — introduced the nominee.

""War for Chuck Hagel is not an abstraction,"" Nunn said.

Hagel has the announced backing of about a dozen Democrats and the tacit support of dozens more who are unlikely to embarrass the president by defeating his Cabinet pick. One Republican — Sen. Thad Cochran of Mississippi — has said he will vote for his former colleague.

Seven Republicans, including four members of the Armed Services panel, have said they will oppose Hagel's nomination. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., announced his opposition on Thursday, saying Hagel's views ""are too apart from what I believe to be the way forward for preserving America's proper role in the world.""

Democrats hold a 55-45 advantage in the Senate.

Republicans repeatedly questioned Hagel about a May 2012 study that he co-authored by the advocacy group Global Zero that called for an 80 percent reduction of U.S. nuclear weapons and elimination of all nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missiles.

The group argued that with the Cold War over, the United States needs no more than 900 total nuclear weapons. Currently, the U.S. and Russia have about 5,000 each, either deployed or in reserve. Both countries are on track to reduce the deployed strategic warheads to 1,550 by 2018, the number set in the New START treaty that the Senate ratified in December 2010.

Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., quoted from the report and expressed serious misgivings.

""Many of my colleagues are concerned you've changed your views. My concerns are that you haven't changed your views. You continue to hold extreme views, far to the left even of this administration,"" said Fischer.

In last year's Senate race, Hagel endorsed Fischer's Democratic rival, former Sen. Bob Kerrey, who also is a decorated Vietnam combat veteran.

Hagel insisted that the report was illustrative and said it wasn't realistic to consider unilateral reductions.

In an exchange with Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., Hagel sought to explain that his wartime experience in which he was wounded twice informed his decisions and votes.

""It does condition you,"" he said. ""I'm not shaped, framed, molded, consumed by that experience. Of course not. But it's part of me.""

Once the hearing was under way, the Republican National Committee put out a news release titled, ""Chuck Hagel is the Wrong Choice for Secretary of Defense,"" and contending that he would weaken the nation's military.

Responding specifically to attacks from outside GOP-leaning groups, Hagel repeated his regrets about using the term ""Jewish lobby"" to refer to pro-Israel groups. He said he should have used another term.

""I should have used another term and I'm sorry and I regret it,"" Hagel said. ""On the use of intimidation, I should have used 'influence,' I think would have been more appropriate.""

Hagel said he was committed to Obama's goal of ensuring that Iran does not obtain a nuclear weapon, and insisted that all options, including military force, are on the table.

""My policy is one of prevention, and not one of containment — and the president has made clear that is the policy of our government,"" Hagel said.

Under questioning, Hagel said he always supported multilateral sanctions against Iran, but acknowledged that he cast votes against unilateral sanctions on a case-by-case basis. He argued that in some cases, such as votes in 2001-2002, he was taking into account the concerns of Republican President George W. Bush.

He also countered with votes and letters against Iran and Hezbollah.

""There's a more complete record than just one or two or three or four"" votes, Hagel said, insisting that he has been on the record many times saying Hamas and Hezbollah are terrorist organizations and Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism.

Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina was harshly critical of Hagel for failing to sign letters to the European Union and the president in years past on designating Hezbollah a terrorist organization and backing Israel.

""The lack of signature by you runs chills up my spine,"" Graham complained."

Rand Paul vowed to speak on the Senate floor “as long as it takes” to draw attention to his concerns about the Obama administration’s policy regarding the targeted killing of American terrorism suspects.

The Kentucky Republican took to the floor before noon Wednesday to block an expected vote on the nomination of John Brennan to lead the CIA, with aides saying he could continue for hours. Paul, beginning his remarks, said he would continue “until the alarm is sounded from coast to coast that our Constitution is important.”

“Are we so complacent with our rights that we would allow a president to say he might kill Americans?” Paul asked. “No one person, no one politician should be allowed ... to judge the guilt of an individual and to execute an individual. It goes against everything we fundamentally believe in our country.”

As Paul began the third hour of his filibuster, he shifted from discussing terrorism to government spending. No other senators were in the chamber, except freshman Democrat Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin who sat on the rostrum as presiding officer. A Senate stenographer stood just feet from Paul as he spoke from his corner desk, an aide seated to his left. A spokesman for Paul said he was armed with three large binders of material to help him deliver his remarks.

The Senate Intelligence Committee voted 12-3 Tuesday to forward Brennan’s nomination to the full Senate, a path that senators thought was cleared after the White House agreed to provide all of the Justice Department’s secret legal opinions on killing terrorism suspects abroad, as well records from the September attacks at U.S. diplomatic and intelligence compounds in Benghazi, Libya.

A leadership aide had said the Senate could potentially hold a confirmation vote Wednesday evening, with a 60-vote requirement, a threshold that appeared to be within reach.

Paul, a self-described champion of constitutional liberties, had said this week he would delay a vote until the White House assures him it has no authority to target an American within the United States under the drone program. Perhaps because he lacked the support of a sufficient number of colleagues to hold up the vote, Paul instead chose to use his prerogative as a senator to control the floor.

“I have allowed the president to pick his appointees, but I will not sit quietly and let him shred the Constitution,” he said. “I cannot sit at my desk quietly and let the president say he will kill Americans on American soil who are not actively attacking the country.”

Under Rule XIX of the Senate, senators who have been recognized to speak may do so for as long as they wish and cannot be forced to cede the floor or even interrupted without their consent, according to the Congressional Research Service.

That was traditionally how a filibuster was conducted, but that notion has changed. Instead, a filibuster now describes any procedural move by a Senate minority to block or delay consideration of legislation or appointments, and a senator is not required to the floor to speak.

Advertisement

Such was the case earlier Wednesday when 40 Republican senators voted to block one of President Obama’s appointees to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.

The last time a talking filibuster occurred was in December 2010, when Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) spoke for all but 80 minutes in a nearly nine-hour period to oppose a compromise to extend the George W. Bush-era tax rates.

Advertisement

Paul said his effort was not a partisan one. He noted that he voted for John F. Kerry as secretary of State, and for Chuck Hagel as secretary of Defense, after initially voting to block Hagel’s nomination.

Paul recalled Obama’s previous criticism of the Bush administration’s prosecution of the war on terrorism, arguing that if Obama were still in the Senate, he would likely be supporting the effort.

“It amazes and disappoints me how much he has changed,” Paul said.

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Perhaps you missed it when they haunted every move of Martin Luther King because he too wanted to live in a world at peace, and even worse, a world where people had civil rights.



Possibly you overlooked the government's harassment of the Quakers and sundry other peace groups. Could be you weren't paying attention when our government, in a nationally coordinated crackdown, brutally attacked and violently crushed the Occupy movement.







That our government thinks of OWS as terrorists tells us an awful lot about our government. Nothing too flattering either. And no, it's nothing new, which does not even begin to excuse it. If anything, it is all the more reason to be alarmed. Do not fall victim to the Stockholm Syndrome. Our government is, and has long been, hell on the good guys.



I shake my head in wonder at all those compliant souls who nod their heads in approval as the middle class is killed off to suit the mad desires of the 1% and our last remaining liberties, such as they are, are sacrificed to our unreasoning fear of the boogeymen of our own creation.



The Irrationality of Giving Up This Much Liberty to Fight Terror



Of course we should dedicate significant resources and effort to stopping terrorism.

But consider some hard facts. In 2001, the year when America suffered an unprecedented terrorist attack -- by far the biggest in its history -- roughly 3,000 people died from terrorism in the U.S. Let's put that in context. That same year in the United States:

71,372 died of diabetes

29,573 were killed by guns

13,290 were killed in drunk driving accidents That's what things looked like at the all time peak for deaths by terrorism. Now let's take a longer view. We'll choose an interval that still includes the biggest terrorist attack in American history: 1999 to 2010. Again, terrorists killed roughly 3,000 people in the United States. And in that interval,

Roughly 360,000 were killed by guns (Actually, the figure the CDC gives is 364,483 -- in other words, by rounding, I just elided more gun deaths than there were total terrorism deaths). Roughly 150,000 were killed in drunk driving accidents. The Atlantic

Nothing could be more dangerous to democracy or what we used to call freedom than a massive program of domestic spying. Those who yawn do so either out of unreasonable fear, ignorance of the history of fascistic and repressive regimes or a general lack of awareness...to put it kindly. They may need to read (or re-read) 1984, A Brave New World and the US Constitution.

I'm not saying that government is inherently bad and we don't need one. I'm no libertarian. I'm saying our particular government, dominated and owned as it is by the 1%, is bad to the bone, lies through its teeth and supports all the wrong people doing all the wrong things - and that we desperately need a new one. We need a government that does the right things for the American people, the earth and all the other people of the world. We need a government that respects our rights and our privacy. We need to live in a country where dissent is possible and the government doesn't inspire the rest of the world to want to kill us – which is the only thing that will ever keep us safe from terrorism (though, as pointed out above, statistically not that much of a problem). Manufacturing terrorists all over the world by taking anything we want by force and ruthlessly fucking over anybody who gets in our way hasn't worked out so well. Blaming the Security State on those who object is a pretty slick and cynical trick though.

Dissent, which has been called the highest form of patriotism, may well be on its last legs in this country. It is now impossible to organize any kind of opposition, no matter how innocent or righteous, without government spooks breathing down your neck. Surveillance quashes dissent...all dissent. Just remember who the government thinks is a threat: peace activists, dissidents, kids who dare object to the raw deal being crammed down their throats

A lot of people want desperately to believe that our government is a bunch of really good guys simply doing their best to keep us safe from the terrorists. It's understandable that people want to believe that but pretty fucking outrageous that anyone actually does.

""People willing to trade their freedom for temporary security deserve neither and will lose both."" arguably attributable to Ben Franklin, but a fine and pertinent quotation regardless of origin

Why does this loathsome crazy bullshit keep happening? Because almost nothing has really changed in this country since Vietnam. People have been lulled into a deep sleep by the most sophisticated and nefarious propaganda program to ever exist on the face of the earth, all so the fat cats can gorge at the expense of everybody else. Many of us simply refuse to wake up and smell the neo-fascism.

With respect to Snowden, and all the idiots screaming, ""he broke the law, he broke the law,"" let me remind you of all the high-ranking members of our fucked up society who broke many more and much more serious laws who have not paid a dime for their crimes. You can see their shining faces on the national TV. Breaking the law is only wrong in this country if you are one of the little people, and it's especially wrong if you are trying to expose the grievous wrongs committed by our government. We'd all be wise to remember that the only person in prison for the official US policy of torturing helpless prisoners to death is the guy who blew the whistle on it.

I support anyone who exposes gross misconduct or wrong doing on the part of our government or military, and consider such people to be genuine patriots and heroes. That means Ellsberg, Manning, Assange and Snowden. I am grateful to them all.

Referring to Assange, Daniel Ellsberg recently said this: “I’ve waited forty years for a release of documents on this scale.”

Those brave enough to dissent, object and resist the madness that dominates our society deserve the full support of anyone who still believes in liberty, truth or justice.

You either support the right to expose wrongdoing, or you support the wrongdoing.

The bone-headed bullshit and obsequious acquiescence of the law 'n order crowd never ceases to amaze me. Line up for showers you dumbasses.

Underlying the discussion was a simple fact: It was an election year. And Mr. Obama might lose.

For nearly four years, the president had waged a relentless war from the skies against Al Qaeda and its allies, and he trusted that he had found what he considered a reasonable balance even if his critics did not see it that way. But now, he told his aides, he wanted to institutionalize what in effect had been an ad hoc war, effectively shaping the parameters for years to come “whether he was re-elected or somebody else became president,” as one aide said.

Ultimately, he would decide to write a new playbook that would scale back the use of drones, target only those who really threatened the United States, eventually get the C.I.A. out of the targeted killing business and, more generally, begin moving the United States past the “perpetual war” it had waged since Sept. 11, 2001. Whether the policy shifts will actually accomplish that remains to be seen, given vague language and compromises forced by internal debate, but they represent an effort to set the rules even after he leaves office.

“We’ve got this technology, and we’re not going to be the only ones to use it,” said a senior White House official who, like others involved, declined to be identified talking about internal deliberations. “We have to set standards so it doesn’t get abused in the future.”"

Leonard Lance, a Republican from New Jersey, toured the U.S. border with Mexico last week, he saw more than 20-foot-high barricades outside San Diego, a surveillance drone base in Arizona and patrol boats on the Rio Grande in Texas.

Lance also spotted a body floating in the tall Spanish cane in an elbow of the Rio Grande. Border Patrol agents told him the man may have drowned trying to swim across from Mexico, or may have been killed by cartel members in a drug deal gone bad.

“To see a dead body right here,” Lance said, “is a dramatic indication that we have to do a better job” on border security.

With a Senate immigration bill approved and the GOP-controlled House starting to review a separate array of proposals, Lance joined five other Republican lawmakers on a three-day trip to the Southwest border. At stop after stop, they posed for pictures and called for more guns, guards, drones and other efforts to stop illegal immigration.

“We have a real opportunity … to finally get control of this very insecure border,” said Rep. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican who leads the House Homeland Security Committee, after he rode a patrol boat armed with two automatic machine guns mounted on swivels.

Yet the danger here is hardly so clear-cut. McAllen’s police chief, Victor Rodriguez, bristles when he hears sweeping statements about insecurity on the Texas border. The crime rate in McAllen has fallen to its lowest level in 20 years, Rodriguez said. During that time, the population has doubled to about 130,000.

“The picture people have painted, that the sky is falling down here, that is just not the truth,” Rodriguez said at a police-sponsored picnic and folk-dancing festival in a park about a mile from Mexico.

The roads into McAllen from Mexico are lined with car dealerships, shopping malls, money changers and other thriving businesses. They have been sheltered from the economic downturn by members of the burgeoning middle class in Mexico who drive north to buy luxury goods.

Rodriguez, 56, has served as police chief for more than a decade, and he previously led police departments in two other Texas border towns. But the congressional delegation that visited his town last Tuesday met with rural county sheriffs and Border Patrol officers, not him.

Rodriguez favors granting more U.S. work visas for foreigners, doing more to crack down on illegal drugs, tracking and freezing cartel bank accounts, and chasing stolen goods and fugitives heading south into Mexico.

He’s not surprised that Border Patrol officials ask members of Congress for more money, agents and equipment.

“If I am the Border Patrol … what am I going to ask for? ‘Double my size and give me boats and give me guns. I want everything I can get from you.’ If I was in their shoes, I would be doing the same thing,” Rodriguez said.

Advertisement

Smugglers will always find a way to get across the snaking loops of the Rio Grande, Rodriguez said. He is annoyed by politicians who, in his view, seek political gain, not solutions to problems on the border.

“They say, ‘Seal up the border and then we will talk everything else,’” Rodriguez said. “It’s as if I would tell you, ‘I’ll give you a million dollars when you get back from the moon.’”

Illegal immigration is down or holding steady in every area on the border except for McAllen and the rest of the Rio Grande Valley, the closest crossing point from the end of a train line nicknamed “the Beast” that runs up the Central American isthmus. Total apprehensions in the area are up 55% so far this year, to 125,000 people. More than half are from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, Border Patrol officials say.

The night McCaul’s delegation arrived in McAllen, after visiting border areas in California and Arizona, the group met with 13 local ranchers around a long table at the Patio on Guerra, a local restaurant.

Linda Vickers, 57, a member of the Texas Border Volunteers, a group that regularly alerts the Border Patrol to migrants and smugglers moving north, said over steak and chicken parmigiana that she and her husband found border crossers on their 1,000-acre spread nearly every day.

Migrants are dropped off south of a highway checkpoint and walk a 30-mile loop to elude detection, she said. That morning, she said, her 90-pound dog Tinkerbell tracked two men cresting a hill as she went to feed her horses. She called the Border Patrol, but the men escaped.

She told McCaul she worries that terrorists could be smuggled across the border, along with those simply seeking work. “It’s kind of scary that you don’t know who is coming over,” Vickers said later.

McCaul has introduced a border security bill that would require the Homeland Security secretary to produce a plan to stop 90% of illicit border crossers within two years. Unlike the Senate bill, which is stalled in the House, it says nothing about providing a pathway to legal status for the estimated 11 million people already in the country illegally. It also doesn’t include any money to help achieve the goal.

McCaul’s bill passed his committee with a unanimous, bipartisan vote. House leaders have told McCaul his bill would be the first of several proposals to come up for a vote this fall.

At the U.S. Customs and Border Protection drone operations center at Ft. Huachuca in southern Arizona, McCaul was shown a radar system developed for the war in Afghanistan. Called Vader, the drone-mounted radar can see deep into Mexico from the U.S. side of the border to identify groups of immigrants and drug smugglers moving north. In theory, it can show if they are carrying weapons or drug shipments.

“They call it ‘extending the borders into Mexico,’” McCaul said. “They then know how to deal with it in a smart way. People trying to come to work is a different threat than people coming in with dope and AK-47s.”

McCaul said other soon-to-be surplus U.S. military equipment in Afghanistan — surveillance blimps, radar systems, night-vision goggles — also could be used on the Southwest border.

“It’s not just simply erecting a fence and calling it a day,” said Rep. Kevin Yoder (R-Kan.), after touring an RC-26 Metroliner surveillance plane recently back from Afghanistan and Iraq that the Texas Army National Guard uses to help the Border Patrol track smugglers.

“The drugs that come up through here land in Kansas and all across the country,” Yoder said. “We have to ensure we are doing our job down here to stop the flow of crime and drugs to states up north.”

And many of the troops who served in the conflict have been compensated for diseases associated with their exposure to the toxic defoliant.

But after the war, some of the planes were used on cargo missions in the United States. Now a bitter fight has sprung up over whether those in the military who worked, ate and slept in the planes after the war should also be compensated. Two U.S. senators are now questioning the Department of Veterans Affairs’ assertions that any postwar contamination on the planes was not high enough to be linked to disease.

Complicating the debate is that few of the planes remain to be tested. In 2010, the Air Force destroyed 18 of the Vietnam-era aircraft in part because of concerns about potential liability for Agent Orange, according to Air Force memos documenting the destruction.

Citing tests done on some of the aircraft in the 1990s, North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr, the ranking Republican on the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, and Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), have asked the VA’s Office of Inspector General to review whether the department is “inappropriately” denying disability compensation to veterans who claim they were sickened by postwar contamination.

“It appears that [the VA] does, in fact, plan to deny any C-123 claims regardless of the evidence submitted in a particular case,” the senators wrote. The letter notes that a group of outside experts have called the VA’s scientific conclusions “seriously flawed.”

The Air Force says the planes’ destruction was handled properly.

“Because of the potential stigma associated with these aircraft, the Air Force ensured that the recycling of the aircraft was accomplished completely and that the metal was not stored improperly or abandoned prior to being smelted,” an Air Force statement said.

The C-123s were used to spray Agent Orange from 1962 to 1971 as part of Operation Ranch Hand. After the war, about 1,500 Air National Guard and Reserve crew members flew the planes on cargo missions in the United States until the last aircraft were retired in 1982.

The Air Force aborted plans to sell some of the planes in 1996, after evidence surfaced that 18 of them might still be contaminated with TCDD dioxin, a carcinogen associated with Agent Orange, according to Air Force documents and papers filed with the General Services Administration’s Board of Contract Appeals. The planes were quarantined instead in Arizona at a storage facility at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, nicknamed “the Boneyard.”

The Air Force did not notify the post-Vietnam crews or Boneyard employees of the potential risk, according to Air Force documents.

When tests on four of the quarantined planes in 2009 showed little or no remaining dioxin, the Air Force decided it was safe to destroy the aircraft.

Officials at Hill Air Force Base in Utah, which oversaw the planes, approved a consultant’s recommendation in 2009 to “dispose of/recycle the 18 UC-123K ‘Agent Orange’ aircraft as soon as possible to avoid further risk from media publicity, litigation, and liability for presumptive compensation,” according to a base memo in August 2009.

“The longer this issue remains unresolved, the greater the likelihood of outside press reporting on yet another ‘Agent Orange Controversy,’ ” consultant Alvin Young wrote in a report.

Base officials recommended that the aircraft be “shredded into cell phone-size pieces” and melted. “Smelting is necessary for these 18 aircraft so the Air Force will no longer be liable for ‘presumptive compensation’ claims to anyone who ever works around this ‘Agent Orange’ metal,” an Air Force memo said in September 2009.

In 2010, the aircraft were torn apart by heavy machinery, melted and poured into blocks.

“The toxic aircraft had to be eliminated,” said Wes Carter, a retired Air Force major who served aboard C-123s as a medical service officer in the United States for a decade. “The right thing to do would have included telling the veterans of the exposures so that health and well-being as well as rights to seek veterans benefits would all be protected.”

An Air Force review last year concluded that “given the absence of a clear finding of potential harm,” it was not necessary to notify the crews.

Carter, 66, had potentially lethal prostate cancer diagnosed in 2011. His doctor, Mark Garzotto, director of urologic oncology at the Portland Veterans Affairs Medical Center, wrote in February that the cancer is “likely related to your exposure [to] Agent Orange.”

But the VA has rejected compensation claims filed by Carter and other veterans who served on the aircraft after the war, saying their exposure to Agent Orange was too limited to connect to the diseases.

The VA is committed to reviewing claims on “a case-by-case basis,” the department said in a statement. “VA does not have a ‘blanket policy’ for denying claims” filed by postwar C-123 veterans, VA Secretary Eric K. Shinseki wrote Burr, the senator, in June.

‘VA is very concerned’

Under federal law since 1991, the VA has granted the presumption of exposure to Agent Orange to any member of the military who served in Vietnam during the war. Some 260,000 cases have been filed since 2010, helping to fuel the backlog of disability claims facing the VA.

By 2009, the VA had agreed to compensate veterans who could show they were exposed to the defoliant during wartime testing in the United States.

The C-123 aircraft cases might open up claims for postwar service, as well, according to Young, the Agent Orange consultant who advised the Air Force.

“What this means is that a whole new class of veterans may claim that their exposure was due to the fact they were members of aircrews or mechanics associated with the contaminated aircraft that returned from Vietnam,” Young wrote in a June 2009 memo to Hill AFB.

A retired Air Force colonel and former professor of environmental toxicology at Oklahoma State, Young frequently serves as a consultant on Agent Orange for the Defense Department. The 2009 memos list him as a consultant on Agent Orange to the Office of Secretary of Defense; Young said he was advising Hill AFB in an “unofficial capacity.” Both Young and the Pentagon say the consultant was not under contract with the Defense Department at the time.

Young said in an interview that the decision to destroy the planes “had nothing to do with claims. There was never any destruction of evidence.”

Carter, an Oregon resident, and his comrades in the C-123 Veterans Association say postwar crews should be eligible for the same compensation for Agent Orange provided to those who served in Vietnam. He has filed complaints with the Air Force and VA, and collected many documents via Freedom of Information requests, which he provided to The Washington Post and posted online.

A 2011 Air Force epidemiological study of the crews that sprayed Agent Orange — “the most heavily exposed veterans of the Vietnam War,” according to the report — found no link between Agent Orange exposure and their diseases.

Last year, the VA hired Young to investigate the postwar C-123 claims, and his report in November concluded that “ample evidence” disproves the veterans’ claims.

“The VA is very concerned, because it amounts to a lot of money to be paid for the rest of their lives when there isn’t the science to back it up,” Young said.

But a number of outside medical experts have concluded the veterans were likely exposed to dangerous levels of dioxins. In November, 14 prominent toxicologists sent the VA a letter saying the department’s scientific conclusions are based on “erroneous assumptions.”

“It’s not right,” said retired Air Force Lt. Col. Paul Bailey, a New Hampshire resident who served with Carter aboard C-123s and is gravely ill with cancer. “We were exposed, we can prove we were exposed, but they’re saying it doesn’t matter.”

Although the VA says there is no policy against postwar C-123 claims, Bailey was told that “VA regulations do not allow us to concede exposure to herbicides for Veterans who claim they were exposed to herbicides after the Vietnam war while flying in aircraft used to spray these chemicals,” the VA regional office in New Hampshire wrote in February, denying his claim.

The Board of Veterans’ Appeals, an administrative tribunal, has overturned VA denials several times, ruling in one case that the veteran who scrubbed planes saturated with Agent Orange after the war was exposed to the herbicide and entitled to compensation for his diabetes. But such appeals typically take years, time Bailey said he no longer has.

Disposing of aircraft

Bailey and Carter flew on one of the most famous of the C-123s for more than a decade, often eating and sleeping on the plane. Known as “Patches” for the holes left by enemy fire, it was sent to a museum in 1980.

Based on testing by Air Force toxicologists in 1994 that found Patches “heavily contaminated,” the plane’s postwar crews were exposed to dioxin “at a level greatly exceeding” the Defense Department screening levels, according to Thomas Sinks, deputy director of the federal Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry.

Many of the retired C-123s ended up in the Boneyard, and in 1996 the government arranged to sell them.

But when employees at Davis-Monthan prepared the planes for buyers, they smelled chemical vapors and experienced burning sensations on their hands and arms, according to papers in a case later heard by the General Services Administration’s Board of Contract Appeals.

Subsequent testing of 17 aircraft in August 1996 detected “strong potential of low level concentrations of dioxin,” according to Air Force documents.

In December 1996, the Air Force requested the government terminate the sales, warning that “the potential for harm to individuals from dioxin contamination is great.”

Employees at Davis-Monthan were not informed of the potential contamination until two years later, according to Air Force documents.

In 1998, the aircraft were fenced off in a restricted area and were largely untouched for another decade, before Air Force officials tried again to resolve the dilemma.

They had concerns that the Environmental Protection Agency or Arizona Department of Environmental Quality could request access and levy fines, which a base official calculated could reach $3.2 billion.

“We are still at significant risk publicity wise and with AZ environmental law for these aircraft,” an Air Force officer at Hill wrote in May 2009.

The tests by an Air Force environmental office on four planes that month indicated they could be destroyed without risk to workers. Years in the Arizona sun had “likely volatilized any remaining Agent Orange,” reported Young.

“I join with Dr. Young in saying let’s get on with it,” Wayne Downs, hazardous-waste-program manager at Hill AFB, wrote Oct. 29, 2009. “Ben and Jerry’s ice cream has more dioxin than these aircraft.”

Some Air Force officials were uneasy about the failure to test all the planes. “This lack of information is causing us, and has the potential to cause us, a lot more trouble than it would have been to just sample the aircraft,” Karl Nieman, an Air Force contractor at Hill, wrote in December 2009.

Normally, aircraft at Davis-Monthan slated for disposal are turned over to a defense agency, which would have the planes cut apart by a local metal recycler. But the agency balked, maintaining that the planes should be handled by a licensed hazardous-waste-disposal firm, a process that would require “worldwide” public notification, according to an Air Force memo.

Air Force officials instead contracted with a Navy aircraft disposal office in California, which used the same local metal recycler without the notification.

“If the Air Force wants quick and quiet disposal, the Navy option is preferable,” stated an Air Force memo in September 2009.

The destruction was approved by Hill AFB in 2010. No notification of the EPA or Arizona environmental officials was required, according to the Air Force, which noted in its statement that the collaboration with the Navy included obtaining the required demilitarization and destruction certification.

On June 8, 2010, as two Air Force officials watched, the last truckload carrying 35,000 pounds of shredded aluminum metal from the Boneyard arrived at a furnace in Belleville, Mich.

The furnace was heated to nearly 1,400 degrees, hot enough to destroy any traces of dioxins. Workers dumped in the metal. By 11 a.m. the last of the C-123 remains were being poured into 2,000-pound blocks.

The blocks, the Air Force officials were told, would be sold to the automotive industry."

http://edition.cnn.com/2013/10/30/us/nsa-google-yahoo/index.html,2013-10-30 00:00:00,"['Jim Sciutto', 'Chelsea J. Carter']","NSA chief addresses report agency taps into Google, Yahoo data links","Story highlights Gen. Keith Alexander says the NSA doesn't break into Google, Yahoo databases

But The Washington Post reports that the NSA accesses data as it moves between centers

Alexander didn't appear to address that specific claim

The NSA later denies using the technique to ""collect vast quantities of U.S. persons' data""

The National Security Agency doesn't have access to servers run by Internet giants Google and Yahoo, its chief said in a pushback to a Washington Post report that the U.S. spy network taps into overseas data links to slurp up millions of text, video and audio records every day.

But Gen. Keith Alexander's comments at a cybersecurity conference Wednesday don't appear to address the substance of the newspaper's allegations -- that the NSA has found a way to tap into the data as it moves between servers around the world without many of the restrictions imposed by U.S. law and court oversight.

Asked about the report by a Bloomberg Television reporter who interviewed him on stage at the conference, Alexander denied breaking into servers or databases run by Internet companies.

""Not to my knowledge,"" he said in response to a question about tapping into company databases.

""It would be illegal for us to do that. So, I don't know what the report is,"" Alexander said. ""But I can tell you factually we do not have access to Google servers, Yahoo servers. We go through a court order.""

However, the allegations published by The Post -- based on documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden -- aren't that the NSA has hacked into data centers or databases owned by the companies.

Instead, the newspaper -- citing the Snowden documents and unnamed ""knowledgeable officials"" -- reported that the NSA gets access to the data as it passes through vulnerable points overseas on its way to databases around the world.

According to The Post, the NSA and the British Government Communications Headquarters found a way to exploit a weakness in Internet architecture to copy data as it moves from the public Internet into data centers maintained by the companies.

The agency then uses custom-built software to decode the companies' internal data formats and filter the resulting data for information it wants to collect, the newspaper reported.

The material collected under the program -- code-named MUSCULAR -- includes e-mail addressing information, as well as ""content such as text, audio and video,"" according to The Post.

The agency's Fort Meade, Maryland, headquarters received 181,280,466 such records in the 30 days preceding the top-secret January 9, 2013, accounting on which The Post's report is based, according to the newspaper.

In a statement, the NSA said ""the assertion that we collect vast quantities of U.S. persons' data from this type of collection is also not true.""

""NSA applies Attorney General-approved processes to protect the privacy of U.S. persons,"" the agency said.

It's unclear how much of the material collected involves what the NSA calls ""U.S. persons,"" a category that includes U.S. citizens, permanent residents, groups predominantly made up of those groups and businesses incorporated in the United States.

But unlike domestic programs that fall under restrictions imposed by law and the oversight of a secret court, surveillance conducted overseas falls under an executive order with less restrictive standards, The Post reported.

The report raised concerns from Google and Yahoo, with the Internet behemoths saying they never gave the NSA permission to access communication links to their servers.

""We have strict controls in place to protect the security of our data centers, and we have not given access to our data centers to the NSA or to any other government agency,"" said Yahoo spokeswoman Sarah Meron.

Google has ""long been concerned about the possibility of this kind of snooping, which is why we have continued to extend encryption across more and more Google services and links,"" said David Drummond, Google's chief legal officer.

""We do not provide any government, including the U.S. government, with access to our systems. We are outraged at the lengths to which the government seems to have gone to intercept data from our private fiber networks, and it underscores the need for urgent reform.""

The newspaper report emerged a day after Alexander and James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, testified before a House committee reviewing the agency's surveillance activities.

The hearing, billed as a discussion of potential changes to the 35-year-old Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, commonly known as FISA, came after a report by the German magazine Der Spiegel that the NSA monitored German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cell phone. Some reports also suggest the United States carried out surveillance on French and Spanish citizens."

Without military or civilian aides, Mr. Hagel himself took extensive notes as the sergeants and petty officers poured out their concerns about pay, benefits, training and sexual assault — issues that would decide whether they make the military a way of life or just a way station in life.

At the end of the 90-minute session, which was held on Thursday, Mr. Hagel, a former enlisted soldier who was wounded twice in Vietnam, surprised them with a promise. “Remember, you always have a friend in the secretary of defense,” one of those present quoted him as saying.

Even so, Mr. Hagel did not hide the quiet storm that is gathering, one that will test his empathy with the enlisted ranks as he begins to make tough calls over coming weeks about further shrinking the Pentagon after more than a decade of war and free spending.

Even more, as President Obama — who has placed some of the military’s long-favored weapons programs in his sights — continues to negotiate with Congress over a spending and revenue deal, Pentagon officials acknowledge they are bracing for a protracted period in which they may have to manage even larger budget reductions than anticipated."

Yet Mr. Mazzetti effectively wades through the euphemisms and bureaucratic fog. When a Pentagon contractor sought to avoid infringing on the C.I.A.’s turf, he said that what he was doing was not spying or gathering intelligence, but rather collecting “atmospheric information.”

“The Way of the Knife” has some flaws. The narrative sometimes seems disjointed, because it occasionally bogs down in individual cases whose significance is unclear or in episodes that distract from the larger story.

For example, there’s Mr. Mazzetti’s superb handling — the best account yet — of the case of Raymond Davis, the burly American spy jailed by Pakistani officials after he killed two men on the streets of Lahore. The book deftly explains how this case marked a fundamental turning point in American relations with Pakistan by showing that country’s intelligence service the extent to which the C.I.A. was operating inside its borders without its permission or even its knowledge.

But then, by contrast, Mr. Mazzetti dwells unaccountably on a woman named Michele Ballarin, a Virginia socialite who dabbled in influencing American policy toward Somalia. At first glance, she seems an updated version of Joanne Herring, the Texas supporter of the anti-Soviet resistance in Afghanistan whose flamboyant character was played by Julia Roberts in “Charlie Wilson’s War.” But the book never makes clear Ms. Ballarin’s background or motivations, and the recurring accounts of her activities never seem to go anywhere.

Another defect in “The Way of the Knife” is that it sometimes transmits the tall tales, hype or braggadocio of the people Mr. Mazzetti interviewed. The book reports, in passing, that a C.I.A. official “penetrated the K.G.B. with dozens of highly placed moles in the 1970s,” although, based on cold war histories, that claim seems highly inflated even for the agency as a whole, much less an individual agent.

Similarly, another interviewee tells Mr. Mazzetti that “most of the C.I.A.’s informants in China were 80-year-old generals” although in the People’s Liberation Army these days, there are few if any generals over 80 and, I’d wager, few if any of these are working for American intelligence. These highly dubious claims come not from the author himself, but the people he interviewed — yet he might have showed some skepticism in reporting what they said.

Over all, though, Mr. Mazzetti’s book stands up as a portrait of the secret wars. Recent developments have served to underscore the point of the book. The President’s Intelligence Advisory Board warned last month that the C.I.A. has become too focused on drone strikes and paramilitary operations; it recommended a renewed focus on traditional spying and analysis in places like China.

“Many C.I.A. officers who joined the agency since Sept. 11, 2001, have experienced only man hunting and killing,” writes Mr. Mazzetti. Perhaps, one can hope, the C.I.A. will bring this era to a close."

The Battle of Ganjgal remains one of the deadliest in the Afghan war. Yet William Swenson, a former captain in the U.S. Army, managed to help fend off an onslaught of insurgents, saved lives, coordinated a rescue, and braved gunfire to retrieve fallen soldiers. This is his story. (The Washington Post)

It was a tender moment that demonstrated the brotherhood of the U.S. servicemen who fought for their lives in a remote Afghanistan province four years ago. In the heat of battle, Army Capt. William Swenson leaned in and kissed the head of a severely wounded comrade while loading him into an evacuation helicopter.

On Tuesday, President Obama cited that moment — captured in a video taken by a medevac crewman — as he presented Swenson, 34, with the Medal of Honor for heroic service in the Ganjgal valley in eastern Afghanistan. Swenson, who has since left the military, is credited with risking his life to help save other U.S. troops and Afghan allies and retrieve the bodies of four Americans who were killed Sept. 8, 2009.

“Amidst the whipping wind and the deafening roar of the helicopter blades, he does something unexpected. He leans in and kisses the wounded soldier on the head — a simple act of compassion and loyalty to a brother in arms,” Obama said of Swenson during a ceremony attended by 250 guests, including Vice President Biden, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, first lady Michelle Obama and several previous medal recipients.

Obama said that the nation has awarded the Medal of Honor, its highest military decoration, nearly 3,500 times, and that the video of Swenson “may be the first time that we can actually bear witness to a small fraction of those actions for ourselves.”

Swenson, who lives in Seattle, did not speak during the White House ceremony. Afterward, an Army spokesman confirmed that Swenson had asked to return to active duty more than two years after he left the service. “We are currently reviewing his request and processing it within established policy,” said the spokesman, George Wright. Swenson would have to undergo a routine drug test and background check.

Oct. 15, 2013 U.S. Army Capt. William Swenson bows his head for a prayer during his Medal of Honor ceremony at the White House. Swenson, 34, was honored for his service during a September 2009 battle in the Ganjgal Valley in eastern Afghanistan. Bill O’Leary/The Washington Post Wait 1 second to continue.

A return to active service would be a remarkable turnabout.

Swenson’s path to the White House ceremony was a rocky one . After he criticized his Army superiors, saying they failed to provide enough air and artillery support during the 2009 engagement, his medal nomination was delayed for years. Amy officials said his nomination packet was lost in a computer system for 19 months.

Swenson became the second service member to be awarded the Medal of Honor for the Ganjgal battle. The other recipient, former Marine Cpl. Dakota Meyer, who accepted the award in 2011, was not in attendance Tuesday. Swenson has expressed skepticism about the accuracy of Meyer’s account of the battle.

Two other Marines — Ademola Fabayo and Juan Rodriguez-Chavez, who helped Swenson and Meyer in the rescue effort — attended Tuesday’s ceremony. They both have received the Navy Cross for their actions.

During an interview with The Washington Post, Swenson said he would accept the medal to honor fellow soldiers and Marines and the family members of those who died. “It does not really belong to me; it belongs to that event and the people I stood with,” he said of the medal.

In the interview, he said he had no memory of kissing the head of Sgt. 1st Class Kenneth Westbrook, who had been shot in the cheek and shoulder, until he saw the video this year.“You could have told me it happened, and I wouldn’t have believed you,” he said. “But it did, and it was captured on film. And it offered a glimpse of the humanity that does occur on battlefields.”

Westbrook, the father of three, died about a month after the battle of complications from a blood transfusion. His wife, Charlene Westbrook, was in the audience at the White House on Tuesday. “Charlene will always be grateful for the final days she was able to spend with her husband,” Obama said.

Swenson and Westbrook had been working for a year as embedded trainers with the Afghan Border Police in Kunar province in eastern Afghanistan near the Pakistani border. They were trying to prepare the Afghan forces to patrol remote tribal areas often teeming with insurgents and beyond the control of the Afghan national government.

On the day of the battle, about 11 U.S. trainers and 80 Afghan troops set out to meet with town elders. As soon as they reached the valley, they were ambushed by Taliban fighters hidden on the higher terrain that ringed the valley on three sides. Five Americans, 10 Afghan troops and an Afghan interpreter were slain.

Looking back on his last moments with Westbrook, Swenson said of the video: “To see him and to see me in that situation gives me comfort. . . . I would trade anything for that not to be our last moment, but that was our last moment, and I’ll always have that now.”"

As I make my rounds each day in the capital, chronicling our leaders’ plentiful foibles, failings, screw-ups, inanities, outrages and overall dysfunction, I’m often asked if there’s anything that could clean up the mess.

My usual answer is a shrug and an admission that there’s no silver bullet. There are many possibilities — campaign spending limits, term limits, nonpartisan primaries, nonpartisan redistricting, a third party — but most aren’t politically or legally feasible, might not make much of a difference or, as with Harry Reid’s rewriting of Senate rules, have the potential to make things even worse.

But one change, over time, could reverse the problems that have built up over the past few decades: We should mandate military service for all Americans, men and women alike, when they turn 18. The idea is radical, unlikely and impractical — but it just might work.

There is no better explanation for what has gone wrong in Washington in recent years than the tabulation done every two years of how many members of Congress served in the military.

A Congressional Quarterly count of the current Congress finds that just 86 of the 435 members of the House are veterans, as are only 17 of 100 senators, which puts the overall rate at 19 percent. This is the lowest percentage of veterans in Congress since World War II, down from a high of 77 percent in 1977-78, according to the American Legion. For the past 21 years, the presidency has been occupied by men who didn’t serve or, in the case of George W. Bush, served in a capacity designed to avoid combat.

It’s no coincidence that this same period has seen the gradual collapse of our ability to govern ourselves: a loss of control over the nation’s debt, legislative stalemate and a disabling partisanship. It’s no coincidence, either, that Americans’ approval of Congress has dropped to just 9 percent, the lowest since Gallup began asking the question 39 years ago.

Because so few serving in politics have worn their country’s uniform, they have collectively forgotten how to put country before party and self-interest. They have forgotten a “cause greater than self,” and they have lost the knowledge of how to make compromises for the good of the country. Without a history of sacrifice and service, they’ve turned politics into war.

Compulsory military service, as old as Athenian democracy and common in countries such as Israel that live under threat, has been in decline in Western Europe since the end of the Cold War. But an exception, Switzerland, is instructive: On Sept. 22, the Swiss voted 73 percent to 27 percent to keep their conscription army. It has less to do with security than with national identity in a land of 26 cantons and four official languages. The government argued that military service teaches people “how to live and work with compatriots from all regions, all linguistic groups and all social strata,” which “contributes enormously to the national cohesion.”

In Switzerland, the sons of bankers and farmers alike do basic training for several months and then are recalled to service for brief periods. But the structure is less important than the service itself. My former colleague Tom Ricks proposes bringing back the draft in the United States but allowing for a civilian national service option — teaching, providing day care and the like — for those who don’t want to join the military.

There’s no mass movement for mandatory service, but the idea has gained a diverse group of supporters, including retired Gen. Stanley McChrystal and Rep. Charlie Rangel (D-N.Y). Gun-rights groups would cheer an armed citizenry, and an article published by the libertarian Cato Institute argued that compulsory service “can be a pillar of freedom.”

The costs would be huge. But so would the benefits: overcoming growing social inequality without redistributing wealth; making future leaders, unlike today’s “chicken hawks,” disinclined to send troops into combat without good reason; putting young Americans to work and giving them job and technology skills; and, above all, giving these young Americans a shared sense of patriotism and service to the country.

It would take some time, but this new generation of Americans, once again asking what they can do for their country, would undo much of the damage today’s crop of self-interested leaders is doing to our politics.

(Evan Vucci/AP)

The story line for this coming week is set: President Obama, facing a critical test of strength, will go before the nation to try to rally public opinion and persuade a reluctant Congress to give him the authority to launch military strikes against Syria.

The construct is familiar and appealing. It puts the focus almost singularly on the president as the decisive actor in a drama that has Washington and much of the world in suspense. It speaks directly to the stakes for Obama’s presidency if Congress rejects his appeal. And it renews questions about the president’s leadership skills that have followed him at other crucial moments.

But this narrative, of a commander in chief dependent on using the bully pulpit to save his presidency from a potentially crippling defeat, is only one way to think about the coming showdown in Congress. In fact, it might mischaracterize the way presidential power is exercised while overlooking other factors that ultimately will determine whether Obama succeeds in winning lawmakers’ support.

That, at least, is the implication of a paper written by George C. Edwards III, a political science professor at Texas A&M University. The paper, “Persuasion Is Not Power,” was presented at the American Political Science Association meeting last weekend in Chicago. Written before Obama announced that he would go to Congress ahead of taking military action, it nonetheless offers insight into what powers of persuasion presidents do and do not have.

Edwards begins his analysis with a useful reminder. He quotes a line from presidential historian James MacGregor Burns, “Leadership is one of the most observed and least understood phenomena on earth.” Taking action, for example, is not necessarily leading.

“At its core,” Edwards wrote, “decision making represents a different dimension of the job of the chief executive than obtaining the support of others.” Obama has decided that action is needed in Syria. Having chosen not to move on his own, although he said he has the power to do so, he must try to bring others around to his position.

Edwards also points to the seminal work on presidential leadership of the late Richard Neustadt. It was Neustadt who said that “presidential power is the power to persuade,” and he offered some caveats about how checks and balances inhibit that power.

But, as Edwards argues, many scholars and commentators nonetheless “have fallen prey to the personalization of politics” and therefore have “an exaggerated concept” of the potential for a president to sway public opinion or bend lawmakers to his will. “Faith in the persuasive presidency also simplifies the evaluation of the problems of governing,” he adds.

It is against that backdrop that Obama will be speaking Tuesday.

Reagan, LBJ and FDR

Through much of his presidency, Obama has suffered from criticism that he lacks the power to persuade, especially on Capitol Hill. During his 2012 reelection campaign, his own focus groups reported criticism from sympathetic voters, who wondered why he couldn’t be more like Lyndon B. Johnson, who was famous for his ability to twist arms in Congress.

Edwards looks at three presidents who are viewed as having had exceptional persuasive skills, in part because of major shifts in public policy during their presidencies: Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1930s, Johnson in the 1960s and Ronald Reagan in the 1980s.

All three produced historic policy successes. Roosevelt launched the New Deal in a flurry of action during his first 100 days as president. Johnson, after his landslide election victory in 1964, created the architecture of the Great Society and engineered the passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965. Reagan, after winning the presidency in 1980 by a margin that suggested a resounding popular mandate for conservative governance, pushed a Democratic Congress to pass significant tax cuts.

View Graphic As of Sept. 4, lawmakers appear to be tentatively dividing into four camps over military action in Syria.

But, as Edwards notes, all of them ran into significant resistance to their policy initiatives later in their presidencies. He argues that their early successes owed more to their ability to take advantage of favorable conditions than to their powers of persuasion. Of Roosevelt’s later years, he writes, “Either Roosevelt had lost his persuasive skills, which is not a reasonable proposition, or other factors were more significant in determining congressional support.”

Edwards writes that “we must not assume the power to persuade” and at one point states flatly, “There is not a single systematic study that demonstrates that presidents can reliably persuade others to support them.”

Instead, he writes, “The most effective presidents do not create opportunities by reshaping the political landscape. Instead, they exploit opportunities already present in their environments to facilitate significant changes in public policy. . . . Effective facilitators are skilled leaders who must recognize the opportunities that exist in their environments, choose which opportunities to pursue, when and in what order, and exploit them with skill, energy, perseverance, and will.”

When I talked to Edwards about this on Friday in the context of Obama’s coming speech, he said, “There’s a broad, fundamental point, which is that presidents rarely move public opinion.” He also noted that the default position among the public is to do nothing. “The default position doesn’t advantage the president,” he said.

Swaying public opinion

The Gallup organization put out an analysis Friday that said support for taking military action against Syria for its alleged use of chemical weapons “is on track to be among the lowest for any intervention Gallup has asked about in the last 20 years.”

If anything, Obama’s task looks more difficult today than it did when he announced that he would seek congressional authorization. Obama has been effective in making the moral case for responding to Syria’s use of chemical weapons. He has been far less effective in making the case that military strikes represent the best response.

A week of presidential rhetoric and closed-door meetings with world leaders has produced no demonstrable rise in support for his position. Public opinion, backing from other countries and congressional whip counts have not moved in his direction. Based on Edwards’s analysis, the president’s speech Tuesday will produce minimal changes overall in public opinion.

The president will talk to ABC, CBS, NBC, PBS, CNN and Fox News Channel for interviews that will air Monday night, White House officials said.

With the Republican rank and file generally opposed to Obama’s position, despite support from GOP congressional leaders, the president must hope he can sway members of his own party to overcome their doubts and back the resolution for the use of force. The situation is not static, and Obama’s skills as a leader will be important between now and when Congress votes.

Still, if presidents have far less power to persuade than is popularly assumed, and if the default position of a war-weary nation is to oppose what is seen as a potentially risky intervention in Syria, and if many Republican lawmakers are steadfastly against almost anything Obama proposes, the larger question about presidential leadership in this case is why Obama chose the course he took.

Certainly his argument that there are constitutional reasons to seek congressional approval for military action is valid. But if the key to leadership is less the power to persuade and more the capacity to understand the conditions that exist and to exploit them when they are favorable, then Obama’s sudden move to throw the decision to Congress appears all the more risky.

In the end, presidents often get their way on these matters. For Obama, falling short would come at an enormously high cost.

Operated from a Predator surveillance drone, the radar system has collected evidence that Border Patrol agents apprehended fewer than half of the foreign migrants and smugglers who had illegally crossed into a 150-square-mile stretch of southern Arizona.

The number of “gotaways,” as the Border Patrol calls those who escape apprehension, is both more precise and higher than official estimates.

RELATED: Is the border secure?

According to internal reports, Border Patrol agents used the airborne radar to help find and detain 1,874 people in the Sonora Desert between Oct. 1 and Jan. 17. But the radar system spotted an additional 1,962 people in the same area who evaded arrest and disappeared into the United States.

In contrast, the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, estimated in January that the Border Patrol had caught 64% of those who illegally crossed into the Tucson sector in 2011.

The new tally of unlawful border crossings could complicate White House efforts to pass comprehensive immigration reform after Congress returns from recess next week.

The Obama administration contends America’s borders are more strictly policed than ever, with nearly 365,000 apprehensions last year. Republicans have demanded more guards, drones, fencing and other security measures before legal status is granted to the estimated 11 million people believed to have entered America illegally or overstayed their visas.

President Obama is scheduled to visit Mexico in early May, and efforts to maintain rigorous border security — to stop economic migrants moving north and American-made weapons flowing south — are likely to be among his priorities in discussions with Mexico’s newly elected president, Enrique Peña Nieto.

The new system is called Vader, for Vehicle Dismount and Exploitation Radar. It was borrowed from the Army’s Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland and has been deployed in Arizona since March 2012.

PHOTOS: Securing the border with Mexico

Michael Friel, a spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said the Vader remained in a “preliminary testing phase.” He also said the method used in the agency’s internal reports to compare apprehensions to arrests was flawed because it didn’t include people who were detained after the airborne radar had left the area.

Officials warn that the radar would not work well near border towns and areas where migrants and smugglers can quickly load into a car and blend into highway traffic.

“There is no silver bullet in border technology,” Friel said.

The tests have gone well enough that the agency has asked Congress to allocate money to purchase two more Vader systems. Each system costs about $5 million per year to maintain and operate.

The Pentagon’s internal research and development group, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, helped design the Vader to aid U.S. forces in spotting insurgents burying improvised explosive devices in Afghanistan. Two of the systems are in use there.

The radar is sharp enough to detect and track individuals on foot from a Predator five miles overhead. It uses a synthetic aperture radar to collect high-contrast black-and-white images and to follow scores of moving targets in real time. The processed signals are transmitted from the drone to a ground station, where the figures are displayed as moving dots on a detailed map.

“It’s a match made in heaven for border security,” said a former U.S. law enforcement official.

He said the radar had helped Border Patrol agents watch migrants and smugglers gathering on the Mexican side of the border before they start trekking north. But not all of the agents are happy to get a precise head count for the first time of how many people they are missing.

“The rank-and-file guys are afraid it will make them look bad,” the official said. He spoke on condition of anonymity because details of the program are not public.

The system is being tested along with military-grade camera towers and surveillance blimps developed for use in Iraq and Afghanistan in an effort to provide more accurate coverage of remote border areas.

Most of the Vader flights have focused on a stretch of border flanked by desert and the craggy Baboquivari Mountains west of Nogales, Ariz. The radar is used three or four days a week, for eight to 12 hours a day.

“That is the kind of technology we would like to see all across the border,” Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas), who chairs the House Committee on Homeland Security, said in a telephone interview.

McCaul said he was briefed on the Vader during a visit to the border in Arizona on Feb. 18. He is writing a bill that would compel the Department of Homeland Security to write a national strategy that accurately measures the effectiveness of border security efforts.

“You can’t measure what you can’t see,” he said. “There is an awful lot we’re not seeing.”

Marshall Fitz, director of immigration policy for the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank in Washington with close ties to the White House, said linking immigration policy to illegal border crossings is a “political gimmick” designed to delay any real reforms.

No matter how many border agents or high-tech systems are deployed on the border, Fitz said, “you are never going to get to the point where you can raise the ‘Mission accomplished’ banner.”

It now appears likely that the response, offering the committee any factual corrections or broader judgments, will be delayed until Mr. Brennan’s arrival.

Because Mr. Obama famously said he preferred to look forward, not back at his predecessor’s counterterrorism programs, the Senate report is by far the most thorough examination of how the United States came to use nudity, cold, sleep deprivation, stress positions, wall-slamming and waterboarding, methods it had long condemned as abuse or torture.

Mr. Brennan will have to decide whether to support making a redacted version of the interrogation report public, as the committee is likely to support after the C.I.A. completes its review and as a United Nations human rights adviser urged this week. Several Democratic senators and at least one Republican, Senator John McCain of Arizona, who was tortured as a prisoner in North Vietnam, have said that a declassified version must be released, and Mr. Brennan said he would give the request “serious consideration.”

He will have to decide whether to convene what the agency calls an accountability board to recommend punishment for current or former officials accused of mismanaging or misrepresenting the interrogation program. If he tries to keep the peace by dismissing the dispute as history and a distraction from the agency’s current challenges, he will face strong resistance from the Senate committee’s Democratic majority and Mr. McCain.

But Emile A. Nakhleh, a former top C.I.A. analyst on political Islam who once worked for him, said Mr. Brennan’s work as Mr. Obama’s top counterterrorism adviser, intimate knowledge of the agency and blunt style equip him well to handle the task.

“It will be challenging, but if there’s any person who can take this on, it’s Brennan,” Mr. Nakhleh said. “He may say some harsh things about the program, and some people won’t like it. But the institution will benefit.”"

The 1,200-page bill, which now faces a stern test in the Republican-controlled House, carries a $50 billion price tag. It would double the number of U.S. Border Patrol agents along the southern border and require the construction of 700 miles of fencing there. It also would place new burdens on employers, who would be required to check the legal status of all job applicants using the government’s E-Verify system.

Senators approved the plan 68 to 32, capping more than six months of negotiations that began behind closed doors and concluded with almost a month of debate on the Senate floor. Fourteen Republicans voted with every member of the Senate Democratic caucus to approve the bill — an impressive bipartisan margin in a chamber that has become sharply partisan.

“Before the American people give up on the Congress, look at what we achieved today in a bipartisan fashion,” said Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.), a key member of a group of Democrats and Republicans who wrote the bill.

But the path ahead is likely to be increasingly acrimonious because the bill is now in the hands of the House, where intense GOP opposition threatens to kill it outright.

View Graphic What happens next with the immigration bill?

House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) on Thursday laid down stern conditions for what kind of immigration bill he would allow the House to vote on, and it was not the one that came of out the Senate.

Boehner said that any bill would need majority support among his GOP colleagues before it could get a vote in the House. “For any legislation, including a conference report, to pass the House, it’s going to have to be a bill that has the support of the majority of our members,” he said. Recent history suggests that assembling such a majority will be difficult to achieve.

If the Senate legislation were to be signed into law, it would set millions of eligible immigrants on a 13-year course toward achieving permanent residency status or U.S. citizenship, but it would also require them to pay thousands of dollars in fines and back taxes.

Before those things could happen, however, the federal government would be required to spend tens of billions of dollars fortifying the U.S. border with Mexico with thousands of new federal agents as well as radar and unmanned aerial drones to track illegal border crossings. The Department of Homeland Security also would have to establish a biometric tracking system at the nation’s 30 largest airports.

Rep. Peter Roskam (Ill.), a deputy GOP whip, on Thursday labeled the Senate bill a “pipe dream” that won’t come up for a vote in the House.

“The House has no capacity to move that bill in its entirety,” Roskam said at a breakfast hosted by the National Review. “It just won’t happen.”

Most conservative Republicans have dismissed the Senate bill as insufficient in its attempts to protect the southern border and not tough enough on people who have broken U.S. laws.

To mark the significance of the Senate vote, Vice President Biden presided over the chamber while Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) made the rare request that senators sit at their assigned desks and stand to vote during the roll call.

After the last vote was cast, there was a long pause. The chamber was unusually packed. Several House lawmakers had joined staffers along the walls, and above, the public galleries were at capacity. One section was full of young people wearing blue T-shirts that read: “11 Million Dreams.”

After Biden read the final tally, some spectators clapped but were quickly quieted. The silence did not last.

“Yes we can! Yes we can!” the group in blue chanted.

“Thank you!” shouted a man wearing a graduation gown.

President Obama, traveling in Africa, hailed the results.

“Nobody got everything they wanted. Not Democrats. Not Republicans. Not me,” Obama said. “But the Senate bill is consistent with the key principles for common-sense reform that I — and many others — have repeatedly laid out.”

“Today, the Senate did its job,” he added. “It’s now up to the House to do the same.”

But House Republicans have adopted a piecemeal approach to the immigration issue, departing sharply from the comprehensive strategy carried out by the Senate.

On Thursday, the House Judiciary Committee approved a proposal for visas for high-skilled workers. Earlier, the panel backed legislation that would make it a federal crime to be in the United States illegally and a new agricultural guest-worker program that differs from the Senate proposal.

Anticipating the House-Senate divide, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said after the vote that he had a simple request of his former House colleagues: “We ask for your consideration and we stand ready to sit down and negotiate with you.”

The political consequences going into the 2014 and 2016 election years could be significant. Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.), who worked with McCain on the bill, reminded his fellow GOP colleagues that failure to agree on immigration reform could spell more trouble for the party at the polls.

“Self-deportation as a policy of the Republican Party is in our rearview mirror, thank God,” he said, recalling Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who suggested last year that illegal immigrants would “self-deport” when they realized they couldn’t get jobs without proper legal documentation. Many in the GOP saw Romney’s comment as an example of the many ways in which the party had alienated Latino voters, thereby costing itself support at the polls.

Thursday’s vote would not have been possible without the “Gang of Eight,” which united McCain and Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), two of the chamber’s most high-profile senators, with Durbin, Graham, Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.).

After releasing the group’s compromise agreement with great fanfare in April, its members helped approve significant changes over 37 hours of deliberations in the Senate Judiciary Committee that spread over three weeks. Debate did not go as smoothly when it began in the full Senate this month. Party leaders often clashed over how many amendments would be considered and whether those proposals would require a simple majority or a supermajority of 60 votes to pass.

Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), who voted against the bill Thursday, complained that it “came about as a direct result of the fact that the forces that shaped it had goals that were important to them, but these goals are not coterminous with, they’re not in harmony with, the nation as a whole. The realpolitik gang that put it together seemed fine with that.”

The agreement would increase the number of visas available to high-skilled workers, most of whom work in the fields of science and technology, and also to lower-skilled people who take jobs in the construction and hospitality industries. Immigrant farmworkers also would be admitted under a temporary guest-worker program.

A cross section of society — dairy farmers, educators, religious leaders, labor officials and corporate titans, including Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer — hailed the Senate vote and called on the House to debate the immigration issue in an equally bipartisan fashion.

McCain credited the coalition of supporters, “not ever assembled before,” for helping push the Senate to act.

“What we’re going to have to do if we want to see this bill through to fruition is to have that coalition out there working actively on behalf of this legislation,” McCain said.

In fact, these ideas and worse have been brewing in Washington for a few years now. I first covered this issue in 2011, when the Obama Administration first began proposing 85 percent cuts in military pension plans. I noted later that year that a big battle was brewing over it, and then again in 2012 when some of the proposed cuts became part of Grand Bargain negotiations. Each time, military families have fought back, including our very own angelajean, MilitaryTracy, and others who are part of the Daily Kos Military Group . First and foremost, join their campaign to fight this cut in military benefits.

Make no mistake, the Administration and Congress have big plans for military veterans and their retirement and none of them are good.

Among the changes being considered:



The Department should establish a new structure for the military retirement system, based on annual contributions. One model for this new structure is the existing Uniformed Military Personnel Thrift Savings Plan (TSP).

The TSP operates in much the same way as a 401(k) plan, which is the largest scam ever perpetrated in the history of finance. Money is taken out of your meager military pay and then invested in mutual-type funds. They work just like a 401(k) plan, in that you can take the money out before you retire, borrow against it, or play around in high-risk securities with it. One of the funds invests in government securities and is managed by the Plan's trustees. Those funds will not ever lose money, so long as there is never a default. But, you guessed right, the rest of the funds are invested in Wall Street securities. Those funds are managed by Larry Fink's BlackRock, a spin-off of Steven Schwartzman's Blackstone Group. Management fees are, of course, paid to BlackRock. How nice is that?

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active.

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/05/13/justice-department-secretly-obtains-ap-phone-records/,2013-05-13 00:00:00,[],Justice Department secretly obtained AP phone records,"The Justice Department secretly obtained two months of telephone records of reporters and editors for The Associated Press in what the news cooperative's top executive called a ""massive and unprecedented intrusion"" into how news organizations gather the news.

The records obtained by the Justice Department listed outgoing calls for the work and personal phone numbers of individual reporters, for general AP office numbers in New York, Washington and Hartford, Conn., and for the main number for the AP in the House of Representatives press gallery, according to attorneys for the AP. It was not clear if the records also included incoming calls or the duration of the calls.

In all, the government seized the records for more than 20 separate telephone lines assigned to AP and its journalists in April and May of 2012. The exact number of journalists who used the phone lines during that period is unknown, but more than 100 journalists work in the offices where phone records were targeted, on a wide array of stories about government and other matters.

In a letter of protest sent to Attorney General Eric Holder on Monday, AP President and Chief Executive Officer Gary Pruitt said the government sought and obtained information far beyond anything that could be justified by any specific investigation. He demanded the return of the phone records and destruction of all copies.

""There can be no possible justification for such an overbroad collection of the telephone communications of The Associated Press and its reporters. These records potentially reveal communications with confidential sources across all of the newsgathering activities undertaken by the AP during a two-month period, provide a road map to AP's newsgathering operations and disclose information about AP's activities and operations that the government has no conceivable right to know,"" Pruitt said.

More On This...

The government would not say why it sought the records. Officials have previously said in public testimony that the U.S. attorney in Washington is conducting a criminal investigation into who may have provided information contained in a May 7, 2012, AP story about a foiled terror plot. The story disclosed details of a CIA operation in Yemen that stopped an Al Qaeda plot in the spring of 2012 to detonate a bomb on an airplane bound for the United States.

In testimony in February, CIA Director John Brennan noted that the FBI had questioned him about whether he was AP's source, which he denied. He called the release of the information to the media about the terror plot an ""unauthorized and dangerous disclosure of classified information.""

Prosecutors have sought phone records from reporters before, but the seizure of records from such a wide array of AP offices, including general AP switchboards numbers and an office-wide shared fax line, is unusual.

In the letter notifying the AP, which was received Friday, the Justice Department offered no explanation for the seizure, according to Pruitt's letter and attorneys for the AP. The records were presumably obtained from phone companies earlier this year although the government letter did not explain that. None of the information provided by the government to the AP suggested the actual phone conversations were monitored.

Among those whose phone numbers were obtained were five reporters and an editor who were involved in the May 7, 2012, story.

The Obama administration has aggressively investigated disclosures of classified information to the media and has brought six cases against people suspected of providing classified information, more than under all previous presidents combined.

The White House on Monday said that other than press reports it had no knowledge of Justice Department attempts to seek AP phone records.

""We are not involved in decisions made in connection with criminal investigations, as those matters are handled independently by the Justice Department,"" spokesman Jay Carney said.

Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., chairman of the investigative House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said on CNN, ""They had an obligation to look for every other way to get it before they intruded on the freedom of the press.""

Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in an emailed statement: ""The burden is always on the government when they go after private information, especially information regarding the press or its confidential sources. ... On the face of it, I am concerned that the government may not have met that burden. I am very troubled by these allegations and want to hear the government's explanation.""

The American Civil Liberties Union said the use of subpoenas for a broad swath of records has a chilling effect both on journalists and whistleblowers who want to reveal government wrongdoing. ""The attorney general must explain the Justice Department's actions to the public so that we can make sure this kind of press intimidation does not happen again,"" said Laura Murphy, the director of ACLU's Washington legislative office.

Rules published by the Justice Department require that subpoenas of records of news organizations must be personally approved by the attorney general, but it was not known if that happened in this case. The letter notifying AP that its phone records had been obtained through subpoenas was sent Friday by Ronald Machen, the U.S. attorney in Washington.

William Miller, a spokesman for Machen, said Monday that in general the U.S. attorney follows ""all applicable laws, federal regulations and Department of Justice policies when issuing subpoenas for phone records of media organizations."" But he would not address questions about the specifics of the AP records. ""We do not comment on ongoing criminal investigations,"" Miller said in an email.

The Justice Department lays out strict rules for efforts to get phone records from news organizations. A subpoena can be considered only after ""all reasonable attempts"" have been made to get the same information from other sources, the rules say. It was unclear what other steps, in total, the Justice Department might have taken to get information in the case.

A subpoena to the media must be ""as narrowly drawn as possible"" and ""should be directed at relevant information regarding a limited subject matter and should cover a reasonably limited time period,"" according to the rules.

The reason for these constraints, the department says, is to avoid actions that ""might impair the news gathering function"" because the government recognizes that ""freedom of the press can be no broader than the freedom of reporters to investigate and report the news.""

News organizations normally are notified in advance that the government wants phone records and then they enter into negotiations over the desired information. In this case, however, the government, in its letter to the AP, cited an exemption to those rules that holds that prior notification can be waived if such notice, in the exemption's wording, might ""pose a substantial threat to the integrity of the investigation.""

It is unknown whether a judge or a grand jury signed off on the subpoenas.

The May 7, 2012, AP story that disclosed details of the CIA operation in Yemen to stop an airliner bomb plot occurred around the one-year anniversary of the May 2, 2011, killing of Osama bin Laden.

The plot was significant both because of its seriousness and also because the White House previously had told the public it had ""no credible information that terrorist organizations, including Al Qaeda, are plotting attacks in the U.S. to coincide with the (May 2) anniversary of bin Laden's death.""

The AP delayed reporting the story at the request of government officials who said it would jeopardize national security. Once officials said those concerns were allayed, the AP disclosed the plot, though the Obama administration continued to request that the story be held until the administration could make an official announcement.

The May 7 story was written by reporters Matt Apuzzo and Adam Goldman with contributions from reporters Kimberly Dozier, Eileen Sullivan and Alan Fram. They and their editor, Ted Bridis, were among the journalists whose April-May 2012 phone records were seized by the government.

Brennan talked about the AP story and investigation in written testimony to the Senate. ""The irresponsible and damaging leak of classified information was made ... when someone informed The Associated Press that the U.S. government had intercepted an IED (improvised explosive device) that was supposed to be used in an attack and that the U.S. government currently had that IED in its possession and was analyzing it,"" he wrote.

He also defended the White House decision to discuss the plot afterward. ""Once someone leaked information about interdiction of the IED and that the IED was actually in our possession, it was imperative to inform the American people consistent with government policy that there was never any danger to the American people associated with this Al Qaeda plot,"" Brennan told senators."

Story highlights Media reports say the NSA tapped the phones of about 35 world leaders Key questions have emerged about what Obama knew, and his response Leaders in Europe and Latin America demand answers, say they're outraged

(CNN) —

It may not be as gripping as a spy novel, but things are heating up after the latest reports of espionage by the U.S. National Security Agency.

International leaders say they’re outraged and the Obama administration says it’s investigating.

Here are five key questions to keep in mind:

1. Are President Barack Obama’s hands clean in this?

It’s not really clear.

The Wall Street Journal reported an internal review of U.S. surveillance programs that started this summer revealed the NSA had tapped the phones of about 35 world leaders and that the White House ordered a halt to some of it.

That would suggest the President did not know about the programs for the nearly five years he has been in office.

Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Dianne Feinstein says neither Obama nor her panel knew the United States was collecting communications of allied leaders, like German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

A senior administration official separately confirms to CNN some details of the Journal report, saying the White House did not know about the program until an until an internal review over the summer, after which some of it was stopped.

Targeting of German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone, however, did not end until quite recently, the senior official said.

2. Was Obama kept in the dark?

Another U.S. official says, however, that Obama was briefed and given detailed documents describing what’s known as the framework for the surveillance programs.

One targets leaders in specific countries, which he would have been briefed about. It’s not known if the description mentioned Merkel, but countries targeted would have been included.

It’s not reasonable to expect that the President would have been involved in or necessarily briefed on decisions about individual intelligence targets, argued another senior administration official.

Rather, the president approves a set of intelligence priorities and then it’s the responsibility of his administration to determine how to carry those out.

The explanation was backed by a former senior administration official who worked on national security for the Obama White House.

“I really doubt he had to sign off on something like that or get into the details,” the former official said.

3. What has Obama done about it?

That’s a key question.

In a USA Today op-ed published last week, Obama’s homeland security and counterterrorism adviser Lisa Monaco conceded that recent “disclosures have created significant challenges in our relationships.”

To address them, the President has ordered a “review (of) our surveillance capabilities, including with our foreign partners,” she wrote.

A report on that effort is due by the end of the year.

As accusations mount and the issue becomes increasingly thorny diplomatically, it’s unclear what Obama has said and done behind closed doors.

4. Who’s upset about this?

The latest spying claims have roiled leaders in Europe and Latin America, who have accused the U.S. government of breaking the law, summoned U.S. diplomats for answers and said their confidence in the United States is shaken.

In Germany, some leaders have suggested tabling discussions of a European Union free trade deal with the United States in response.

In the United States, some have dismissed the foreign leaders’ criticism as political bluster, arguing that spying is a common practice in international relations, even for allies.

5. What would the United States hope to learn?

The United States says its surveillance programs are for the purpose of foiling terrorist plots, but there are many political reasons for interest in communications of world leaders.

For example, some media reports suggest the tapping of Merkel’s phone increased in 2010, around the time of the financial crisis in the Eurozone, in which Merkel was a major player.

The U.S also wants as much information as possible about the actions of other states to make its own decisions about important foreign policy issues, such as Syria and Iran. At the end of the day, allies cannot automatically count on each other’s loyalty.

Former Vice President Dick Cheney suggested in an interview with CNN’s “The Lead with Jake Tapper” that there is an interest in conducting surveillance on a country or a leader, even a clear ally.

“We do have a fantastic intelligence capability, worldwide against all kinds of potential issues and concerns. We are vulnerable, as was shown on 9/11, and you never know what you’re going to need when you need it,” said Cheney."

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson.

House Judiciary chairman says immigration bill must win %27sizable majority%27 of GOP votes

He predicts a %27considerably different bill%27 from the one being debated in the Senate

The chairman bristles at criticism of the GOP%27s all-male membership on his panel

WASHINGTON — House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte has a message for advocates who calculate that rolling up a big margin of victory in the Senate will provide momentum to push an immigration overhaul through the House.

Not so fast.

In an interview with USA TODAY Friday, Goodlatte said any House bill would have to win a ""sizable majority"" of Republican votes — not rely on solid Democratic support with just enough GOP backers to pass it.

""That would be a very bad idea,"" the Virginia Republican said on ""Capital Download,"" a weekly video newsmaker series. ""I'm very much a believer in following regular order and in following the principle that the majority party should have a sizable majority of its members supporting major legislative initiatives going through the Congress, and immigration is the most major legislative initiative we've had in several years.""

That ""majority of the majority"" isn't a legal requirement and doesn't have a long legislative history. It was pioneered by Republicans when the GOP won control of the House in the mid-1990s. Though it may sound like parliamentary jargon, it significantly increases the degree of difficulty in crafting a bill that can both pass the House and survive in the Senate.

""That will, in my opinion, create a considerably different bill than the Senate bill — a bill that I think will fix many of the problems with the Senate bill,"" Goodlatte said. Among them: He opposes granting any legal status to immigrants in the USA illegally until enforcement measures are in place to tighten security along the border and get control of legal visitors who overstay their visas.

He endorsed a proposal to deputize police to enforce immigration laws. ""We want to make sure that ... we have the opportunity to use state and local law enforcement,"" he said.

Goodlatte repeated his commitment to passing several piecemeal measures on immigration rather than the Senate's comprehensive package.

House Speaker John Boehner has scheduled a special House Republican conference July 10 to discuss immigration. Top Republicans, among them former governors Haley Barbour of Mississippi and Jeb Bush of Florida, have warned that making up lost ground with Hispanic voters, including passage of an immigration bill, is critical for the future of the GOP.

Goodlatte bristled at criticism from Democrats and others after Republicans on the Judiciary Committee — all of whom are male — passed a ban this week on abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. ""It would be wonderful to have Republican women on the committee, and I am an advocate for seeing that happen,"" he said. ""But it does not matter whether you're a man or a woman to care about the rights of unborn children and the rights of women.""

Federal investigation wrestling with Snowden%27s ability to defeat safeguards

NSA director declined to say whether it knew how many files Snowden had taken

Deputy Attorney General said NSA monitors activities of employees using programs

WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. government's efforts to determine which highly classified materials leaker Edward Snowden took from the National Security Agency have been frustrated by Snowden's sophisticated efforts to cover his digital trail by deleting or bypassing electronic logs, government officials told the Associated Press. Such logs would have showed what information Snowden viewed or downloaded.

The government's forensic investigation is wrestling with Snowden's apparent ability to defeat safeguards established to monitor and deter people looking at information without proper permission, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss the sensitive developments publicly.

The disclosure undermines the Obama administration's assurances to Congress and the public that the NSA surveillance programs can't be abused because its spying systems are so aggressively monitored and audited for oversight purposes: If Snowden could defeat the NSA's own tripwires and internal burglar alarms, how many other employees or contractors could do the same?

In July, nearly two months after Snowden's earliest disclosures, NSA Director Keith Alexander declined to say whether he had a good idea of what Snowden had downloaded or how many NSA files Snowden had taken with him, noting an ongoing criminal investigation.

NSA spokeswoman Vanee Vines told the AP that Alexander ""had a sense of what documents and information had been taken,"" but ""he did not say the comprehensive investigation had been completed."" Vines would not say whether Snowden had found a way to view and download the documents he took without the NSA knowing.

In defending the NSA surveillance programs that Snowden revealed, Deputy Attorney General James Cole told Congress last month that the administration effectively monitors the activities of employees using them.

""This program goes under careful audit,"" Cole said. ""Everything that is done under it is documented and reviewed before the decision is made and reviewed again after these decisions are made to make sure that nobody has done the things that you're concerned about happening.""

The disclosure of Snowden's hacking prowess inside the NSA also could dramatically increase the perceived value of his knowledge to foreign governments, which would presumably be eager to learn any counterdetection techniques that could be exploited against U.S. government networks.

It also helps explain the recent seizure in Britain of digital files belonging to David Miranda — the partner of Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald — in an effort to help quantify Snowden's leak of classified material to TheGuardian newspaper. Authorities there stopped Miranda last weekend as he changed planes at Heathrow Airport while returning home to Brazil from Germany, where Miranda had met with Laura Poitras, a U.S. filmmaker who has worked with Greenwald on the NSA story.

Snowden, a former U.S. intelligence contractor, was employed by Booz Allen Hamilton in Hawaii before leaking classified documents to the Guardian and The Washington Post. As a systems administrator, Snowden had the ability to move around data and had access to thumb drives that would have allowed him to transfer information to computers outside the NSA's secure system, Alexander has said.

In his job, Snowden purloined many files, including ones that detailed the U.S. government's programs to collect the metadata of phone calls of U.S. citizens and copy Internet traffic as it enters and leaves the U.S., then routes it to the NSA for analysis.

Officials have said Snowden had access to many documents but didn't know necessarily how the programs functioned. He dipped into compartmentalized files as systems administrator and took what he wanted. He managed to do so for months without getting caught. In May, he flew to Hong Kong and eventually made his way to Russia, where that government has granted him asylum.

NBC News reported Thursday that the NSA was ""overwhelmed"" in trying to figure what Snowden had stolen and didn't know everything he had downloaded.

Insider threats have troubled the administration and Congress, particularly in the wake of Bradley Manning, a young soldier who decided to leak hundreds of thousands of sensitive documents in late 2009 and early 2010.

Congress had wanted to address the insider threat problem in the 2010 Intelligence Authorization Act, but the White House asked for the language to be removed because of concerns about successfully meeting a deadline. In the 2013 version, Congress included language urging the creation of an automated, insider-threat detection program."

FBI probing whether political figures’ financial records were illicitly accessed

The FBI is investigating whether the financial records and other personal information of leading political figures, including Vice President Biden and first lady Michelle Obama, may have been illicitly accessed and published online, according to Justice Department officials.

A Web site posted what appear to be credit reports, banking information, Social Security numbers and addresses for several officials, as well as a number of celebrities. In addition to Biden and Obama, the site purported to have obtained records of Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., former secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton and FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III.

The Web site used the Internet suffix .su, which suggested that it was based in Russia or a post-Soviet republic.

It was unclear how the documents, if confirmed as authentic, could have been obtained. A Justice Department official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing, said the FBI is trying to determine whether it might be a case of identity theft, hacking or perhaps both.

The White House declined to comment.

Much of the posted material was drawn from credit reports from organizations such as TransUnion and Equifax.

Tim Klein, a spokesman for the credit reporting agency Equifax, said the company was investigating “fraudulent and unauthorized access” to four consumer credit reports and is working closely with law enforcement officials.

“Nothing is more important to us than data security, and we have stringent measures in place for protecting the data entrusted to us,” Equifax said in a statement. “We enable consumers to access their credit reports through a variety of channels, including annualcreditreport.com, which is a free service. In order for a consumer to have access to their credit report through this channel, they must provide Personally Identifiable Information that should be known only to the individual.”

TransUnion did not respond to a request for comment.

To obtain free credit reports, consumers are typically required to answer about five to seven questions that detail information such as the applicant’s monthly mortgage payment, who holds their car loan or the last payment amount on a particular credit card. It is not known how that kind of information was obtained about those whose credit reports were posted.

The Web site that posted the purported records also disclosed what it claims were the records of celebrities including Kim Kardashian, Ashton Kutcher, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Beyonce and Jay-Z.

In what appears to be a separate incident, former secretary of state Colin L. Powell’s Facebook and personal e-mail accounts also were hacked this week.

An unidentified hacker asserted responsibility for the breach in an e-mail sent early Tuesday to dozens of Washington journalists. The e-mail contained 16 images showing screenshots of Powell’s digital correspondence. None of the e-mails between Powell and his acquaintances — dated from 2005 to 2012 — appeared to be particularly revealing.

The images bore the handwritten word “GUCCIFER,” the name used by the hacker who obtained e-mails from the accounts of at least six Bush family members last month.

Powell told The Washington Post that he was aware his account had been breached. “I can confirm that the hacker was able to get into my old e-mails, and I’m taking precautions,” Powell said.

The day before, Powell’s Facebook page was hacked, with an unidentified person posting incendiary messages.

Powell later posted a message on his Facebook wall apologizing for the incident. “I’m sorry you have to see all the stupid, obscene posts that are popping up. Please ignore as we are working with fb to take care of this problem. I appreciate your patience,” he wrote.

The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/05/01/Sessions-Tide-is-beginning-to-turn-on-immigration-bill-sold-as-sizzle-but-is-shoe-leather-instead-of-a-steak,2013-05-01 00:00:00,['Matthew Boyle'],Sessions: 'Tide Is Beginning to Turn' Against Immigration Bill,"Senate Budget Committee ranking member Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) told Boston’s conservative radio host Howie Carr on Wednesday that the political momentum is starting to turn against the “Gang of Eight” immigration bill.

When Carr asked the senator if this process behind the push for this bill is the “same thing as Obamacare” where “we have to pass it so we can read it,” Sessions replied: “Absolutely, it really is.”

“That is exactly what it is,” Sessions said. “They’re selling the sizzle. They’re selling the smell. And it’s a shoe leather instead of a steak.”

Carr said that though everyone can agree that the immigration system is “broken,” Americans should not support the Gang of Eight bill because it would make the system “worse.” Instead, Carr argued people should support a yet-to-be-introduced solution that actually solves the problems at hand and this issue does not need to be an all-or-nothing deal with the Gang of Eight bill.

“That is exactly correct,” Sessions responded. “And Professor [George] Borjas at Harvard, the leading expert on immigration and labor, has made so clear in his work that basically what he concludes is any benefit to this economy is at the expense of lower income workers’ salaries going down.”

When Carr asked if Gang of Eight supporters had the votes to pass the bill in the House or Senate, Sessions said that they are claiming they have it in the Senate. “But I think the tide is beginning to turn,” Sessions said. “A lot of people, like myself, I thought the bill was better than it is based on what I hear the proponents say. But as we examine it, we realize that this is going to be a disaster. It’s going to be a disaster for enforcement, it’s going to be a disaster for our budget, it’s going to be a disaster for the wages of American workers, it’s going to add to our financial deficit, Social Security and Medicare are going to be impacted over the long term by trillions of dollars in unfunded liabilities and these numbers are not going to be disputed if we go forward.”

Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), a Gang of Eight member, recently said the bill could not pass the House as is, a sign it is in serious trouble. On Sean Hannity’s radio program on Wednesday, Rubio said the bill “quite frankly, may struggle to pass the Senate” because it does not effectively enforce border security as originally promised.

On the recently discovered loopholes in the Gang of Eight bill that would allow illegal immigrants access to welfare benefits for illegal immigrants, Sessions said “of the 11 million people here today illegally, over half do not have a high school diploma. And statistics and careful analysis shows a huge percentage will qualify for all kinds of these government programs. We’ve also discovered, Howie, that the people that are coming legally, about two-tenths of one percent, virtually nobody, is being rejected based on the requirement that you should not be a public charge. In other words, we’re not even enforcing that requirement and it’s certainly not going to be enforced with regard to those that will be given amnesty.”

“Any smart nation would say ‘we want immigrants, but if you’re not able to take care of yourself, if you’re going to come in and be dependent on welfare, you don’t get admitted,'” Sessions added.

The welfare loopholes allowing illegal immigrants access to public benefits is a major stumbling block for the Gang of Eight.

Rubio is even now joining his Gang of Eight colleague Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) in acknowledging that their bill contains a massive loophole that will allow illegal immigrants access to state and local benefits. “I think what he’s talking about is state and local benefits, and I would just say that yeah, if a city or a county or a state legislature decides to give benefits to illegal immigrants or someone who was previously illegally in the country, you know, they have a constitutional right to do that,” Rubio told Hannity on Wednesday in response to Sessions’ criticisms. “I would disagree with that position, and people should take it up with their state legislator or their governor or their county commissioner or what have you.”"

The shutdown comes just four days after I reported exclusively about a briefing at Mississippi’s Camp Shelby that labeled the American Family Association as a domestic hate group.

“On several occasions over the past few months, media accounts have highlighted instances of Army instructors supplementing programs of instruction and including information or material that is inaccurate, objectionable and otherwise inconsistent with current Army policy,” Army Sec. John McHugh wrote to military leaders in a memorandum I obtained.

McHugh “directed that Army leaders cease all briefings, command presentations or training on the subject of extremist organizations or activities until that program of instruction and training has been created and disseminated,” Army spokesman Col. David Patterson, Jr., tells me.

[pullquote]

The Chaplain Alliance for Religious Liberty welcomed the news and said it was about time the Secretary of the Army intervened.

“Men and women of faith – who have served the Army faithfully for centuries – have been likened to those who regularly threaten the peace and security of the United States,” said Ron Crews, executive director of the Chaplain Alliance. “It is dishonorable for any U.S. military entity to allow this type of improper characterization.”

The Camp Shelby incident led five congressmen to fire off a letter to the Pentagon expressing their grave concerns.

“This most recent mislabeling of a Christian organization reflects what appears to be a troubling trend of religious intolerance in the military,” Rep. Doug Lamborn wrote in a letter signed by Reps. Tim Huelskamp, Steve Scalise, John Fleming and Joseph Pitts. “We are very troubled.”

The Army issued a statement refuting the claims made and photographed in the briefing after it was reported in my column.

The Camp Shelby briefing was one of a number of incidents on Army bases around the nation where soldiers were instructed that groups like the American Family Association and Family Research Council should be considered domestic hate groups because of their support for traditional marriage.

Last week soldiers at Fort Hood were warned that participating in or donating money to evangelical Christian groups or Tea Party groups could result in military punishment.

And last May an Army Reserve training brief listed Catholics and Evangelical Christians as examples of religious extremism. That incident prompted 34 members of Congress to raise objections.

The Army repeatedly told me the briefings were isolated incidents where instructors used materials that were not approved by the military.

McHugh said the instructors used material that is “inaccurate, objectionable and otherwise inconsistent with current Army policy.”

He referenced recent “high-profile” cases where Army instructors found information online and included it in their presentations.

“The groups identified in the instruction were not ‘extremist’ organizations as that term is defined in Army Regulation,” McHugh wrote in his memorandum.

So where did the Army instructors get their talking points?

“None of these slides were produced by the Army, but by soldiers who included information found during an Internet search,” Patterson told me.

“The Army does not maintain or publish a list of organizations considered extremist; and after a similar incident earlier this year, commanders and other leaders were cautioned that they should not use lists of ‘extremists,’ ‘hate groups,’ ‘radical factions’ or the like compiled by any outside non-governmental groups or organizations for briefings, command presentations, or as a shortcut to determining if a group or activity is considered to be extremist.”

But the Army does provide a list of organizations that do list groups like the AFA and FRC as domestic hate groups – specifically the Southern Poverty Law Center. And the SPLC is featured in the military’s Equal Opportunity Advisor Student Guide.

The Chaplain Alliance uncovered that information through a Freedom of Information Act request. Crews wants the Army to stop using any materials from the SPLC.

“The SPLC has labeled many mainstream religious organizations as hate groups,” Crews said. “Reliance on lists produced by anti-Christian political organizations violates the apolitical stance necessary in the military.”

So to correct the problem, McHugh has directed leaders to create a standardized program of instruction and training.

“Given these recent developments, it is clear that we must act to standardize such programs of instruction and training plans to ensure consistency with Army policy,” McHugh wrote in his memorandum.

He wants the revised policies to be completed by December 13."

Story highlights William Potts hijacked a plane to Havana in 1984 He was surprised to face trial and be sentenced to 15 years in Cuban prison His daughters are now living in U.S., but Potts continues to fight to join them Potts says he realizes that violence is not the way to bring about change

(CNN) —

Should William Potts, an American fugitive living in Cuba, ever set foot in the United States again, he faces an indictment for airplane hijacking and a potentially lengthy prison term.

So why is Potts now battling to return to the same country that wants to imprison him?

In 1984, Potts hijacked a Piedmont Airlines passenger plane bound for Miami with 56 people aboard.

A Black Panther and self-styled revolutionary, Potts dreamed of receiving military training in Cuba that he could use to overthrow the United States government.

But first, the New York native had to find a way to get to the island.

Potts’ solution was to smuggle a .25-caliber pistol inside a fake cast on his arm.

The handgun set off the metal detectors at Newark Airport, but all Potts had to do was flash his cast and an easy smile to breeze past security.

After the plane took off, Potts went to bathroom, where he ditched the phony cast and put on what he calls his “Black Panther costume” of dark clothes and combat boots. He walked to the back of the airplane with the pistol in hand.

A flight attendant told him to retake his seat, Potts said, but her eyes grew wide as she saw his changed demeanor and clothing.

Potts gave her a note ordering the pilot to fly the plane to Cuba.

Over the plane’s telephone system, the pilot tried to convince Potts to end the hijacking.

“I had to be forceful with him,” Potts remembered. “I tell him, if we don’t go to Cuba, this plane is going down. We are going to hell or Cuba.”

As the plane crossed the bright blue water and the coastline and palm trees came into view, Potts still wasn’t sure he was over Cuba.

“I had them go low and circle around,” he said. “I was looking for McDonald’s and Coca-Cola and propaganda like that. I didn’t see any of it, so I figured we must be here.”

The plane landed in Havana, but Potts did not get the welcome he expected from his fellow revolutionaries.

After years of hijackings to the island, the Cubans put hijackers like him on trial.

Authorities told Potts that Fidel Castro’s government was no longer involved in spreading armed revolution abroad.

“In a Machiavellian sense, the Cubans changed,” he said. “They simply changed. They used to do it, and now they don’t do it.”

Authorities offered to let Potts return with the plane he hijacked to the United States, where air piracy charges awaited him.

Potts said he would face trial in Cuba.

“I thought I had won the case, and they gave me 15 years,” Potts said, recalling his brief court proceedings in Cuba. “I didn’t even know what 15 was in Spanish. And they said ‘quince.’ I said, what is ‘quince?’ and my translator said 15 years. And I said, ‘15 years for who?’ And they said, ‘15 years for you.’ “

Even though he was sent to one of Cuba’s toughest prisons, where he regularly battled with other inmates and the guards, Potts never lost faith in the same revolution that had become his jailer.

“If you are not able to suffer for the cause, you are just a play revolutionary,” Potts said.

Potts served his time – 13½ years in prison and the rest under supervised release – and tried to fit into Cuban society with the pidgin Spanish he learned in prison.

His first marriage, to a Cuban, didn’t work out.

“That was a clash of cultures,” he explained. “I am Muslim, and she’s a santera.”

A second failed marriage produced two daughters: Ntann, 7, and Assata Shakur, 11, named after the American fugitive also believed to be residing in Cuba whom the FBI added to its list of most wanted terrorists in May.

The girl’s mother, Aime, also a Cuban, said she didn’t realize her husband was naming their daughter after a fellow militant, convicted of murdering a New Jersey state trooper.

“He likes Japanese things, so I thought it was a Japanese name,” she said with a roll of her eyes.

Raising his two daughters, Potts said, made him realize how much he missed family in the United States and wanted his children to meet them.

He said he also needed to make amends and apologize in person to the passengers of the plane he hijacked.

Potts still considers himself a revolutionary but says that both he and the times have changed, and violence is no longer an acceptable way to bring about change.

“I regret taking the plane and putting those people’s lives in jeopardy,” he said. “I didn’t have that perspective at the time, but I have it now and will have it until the day I die. I would have been responsible for all those people dying.”

In 2009, Potts wrote President Barack Obama, requesting a pardon for the hijacking.

Hearing nothing back, Potts then wrote the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Miami to ask whether a plea deal could be worked out to take into account the time he had served in Cuba.

“Fifteen years in a communist prison that’s been cited for human rights violations, I have paid my debts to society,” he said.

Potts again got no reply, but his daughters were given U.S. citizenship and passports.

Potts wanted to travel with them to the U.S. and in September said he offered to surrender and face the charges awaiting him in the United States.

Nearly six months later, his daughters have been living with relatives in the U.S. since December, but he is still waiting for an answer.

But without a renewed U.S. passport, Potts can’t join his girls.

Dozens of fugitives are believed to be living in Cuba, from convicted cop killers to Puerto Rican separatists to suspects in a South Florida Medicare fraud scheme.

The U.S. State Department has placed Cuba on the list of countries that support state terror, along with Iran and Syria, for providing a safe haven for fugitives from U.S. and international justice.

Potts is in all likelihood the only fugitive on the island offering to be tried.

“No one’s harboring me,” Potts countered. “I am trying to go back.”

The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Miami said Potts has been indicted for the 1984 hijacking but would not comment on why his offers to surrender have gone unanswered."

As midlife sets in, maintaining a healthy weight often becomes harder. Tricks that worked in the past, like cutting down on wine or sugar, no longer seem to work, either. Even slender Samantha Cameron, now 50, has apparently been affected. In her 30s and early 40s, staying in shape was easy, she said this weekend, “but then I hit 43, I just put on three-quarters of a stone. Suddenly you don’t quite fit any of your things and I got really bloated.” At first she tried doing the 5:2 diet – eating normally five days a week, then having just 500 calories on the other two – but “I just couldn’t do it, I literally couldn’t speak in the evening, I had to go to bed at 7pm.” She has recently found a solution: the 5:2 principles, but with 800 calories on the “fast” days, and says she’s “loving it” and “the bloating’s gone”. Alongside three weekly workouts, she says it’s helping to keep her trim: her goal is “to hit my 50s in almost as good shape as I hit my 40s.” If you’re struggling to maintain your weight and fitness post-50, here’s why – and what to do about it: Muscle mass Every decade after the age of 30, we on average lose three to eight per cent of our muscle mass. At first, this might not be noticeable, but by 50 or 60, will make a considerable difference. This is bad news if you want to lose weight, because muscle burns on average three times more calories than fat per day, even at rest. What to do: Incorporate resistance training into your weekly routine to reduce muscle loss. The NHS recommends two sessions of strength training a week, which could include activities as varied as gardening or lifting weights. Don’t underestimate the good that exercise can do: a 2018 study shows that regular exercisers over the age of 55 kept up their muscle mass considerably more than inactive people. Staying active In England, half of 16 to 24-year-olds are doing the recommended amount of weekly exercise, but only one in 10 people aged 65 to 74 are doing so. If injuries have accrued, and your work and social life is less busy than it once was, you may be leading a more sedentary lifestyle than you realise. The role of exercise in weight loss is much-debated, but it can be crucial in maintaining your weight. A famous 2016 study followed participants in American weight loss competition The Biggest Loser during and after filming, and found that most regained a lot of weight after the cameras stopped rolling due to a higher appetite and slower metabolism. However, a follow-up study in 2017 found that the contestants who kept the most weight off were those who had remained committed to a fitness regimen. This was particularly interesting given that more exercise didn’t equal more weight loss during the show, when those who lost the most focused on diet over working out. What to do: Try to stick to the NHS guidelines on exercise, which recommend 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week, or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise, or a mixture of both. Make sure you are doing something appropriate for your body, too. As we get older, high-impact workouts like running may place unwanted stress on your joints, so think about lower impact options like swimming or cycling. Hormones Menopause changes where fat is stored on the body. Higher oestrogen levels in the fertile years cause fat to be stored on your legs, hips and behind, but after oestrogen drops, fat can move to your middle, even if you remain exactly the same weight. This can be an issue, as fat around your trunk is more likely to contribute to Type 2 diabetes, hypertension and heart issues than fat on your hips and legs. Men are affected by hormone changes as they age, too: after the age of 40 they lose roughly one per cent of their testosterone a year. This matters for weight, as testosterone is linked to the amount of muscle you have and where you store fat. What to do: For women, several studies suggest that HRT can help to stop the shift of fat from your bottom half to around your middle as you go through menopause. An Italian study followed two groups of equal weight post-menopausal women for a year, putting half of them on HRT, with the rest going hormone-free. At the end of the year, the HRT group stayed almost the same weight, and hadn’t put on any extra fat around their middles or arms. In the untreated group, things were different: they had put on three and a half pounds, and had increased the amount of fat around their waists and arms. HRT isn’t suitable for everyone, so make sure you consider your options and discuss with your doctor first. In men, hormones are linked to a variety of lifestyle factors, including body fat and waist size, which can increase the amount of oestrogen in your body. Keeping active is also vital for men’s hormones: a 2018 study found that regular cyclists aged 55 to 74 kept their testosterone levels up compared with inactive men. Your sleep is also a partial predictor of your testosterone levels: most of the hormone is released while we doze, so if you’re not getting enough hours in bed, your body has less chance of boosting its stores. Getting enough sleep is key for maintaining your weight for other reasons, too: not getting enough is shown to make you gravitate towards sweet foods, and muscle growth occurs largely while we’re resting at night. More stress For many, juggling looking after children and caring for parents with work can mean life post-50 requires navigating a huge amount of stress. Even if you eat exactly as you did before, stress can cause weight gain. In 2015, American researchers found that after eating a large meal, women who reported more stress in the previous day burned 104 fewer calories than women who weren’t stressed. Stressed women also had higher levels of insulin, which is linked to gaining fat. This may not sound significant, but burning 100 fewer calories a day could lead to a loss of 10lbs of fat over a year. What to do: Reducing stress is often one of the hardest lifestyle changes to make, as you may have little control over the issues at work or home. However, you can change how you react, which can reduce your stress levels even without anything changing in your external environment. Exercise is an incredibly effective way of lowering cortisol levels, as well as burning calories, which could lead to a double effect on your weight. There is also robust evidence that simply slowing your breathing can dramatically reduce stress in both the short and long term, as well as giving a range of other benefits like better sleep. “Slow” counts as anything less than 10 breaths a minute, and six breaths is even better. The NHS recommends inhaling for up to a count of five, then exhaling for the same length of time."

The Associated Press

A search warrant was executed at the company%27s headquarters in Toano%2C Va.

Another search warrant was also executed at a business location in Richmond

No other information about the details of the search was provided by authorities

RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — Federal authorities on Thursday executed a search warrant at the Virginia headquarters of hardwood flooring retailer Lumber Liquidators.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations spokesman Brandon Montgomery said the warrant was executed at the company's Toano, Va., headquarters and a Lumber Liquidators business location in suburban Richmond in coordination with U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Department of Justice.

No other information about the details of the search was provided and Montgomery said the warrant is sealed. He could not say whether the warrant was related to a particular person or for the company as a whole.

A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia did not immediately return a phone message seeking comment.

In a statement, the company said it is cooperating to provide information and documentation to ""answer questions relating to the importation of certain products.""

Lumber Liquidators Holdings has more than 305 stores in North America.

According to the agency's website, Homeland Security Investigations probes a wide range of domestic and international activities arising from the illegal movement of people and goods into, within and out of the U.S. It investigates immigration crime, human rights violations and human smuggling, smuggling of narcotics, weapons and other types of contraband, financial crimes, cybercrime and export enforcement issues.

In July, Lumber Liquidators said its second-quarter net income jumped nearly 68% to $20.4 million year over year as its revenue rose to $257.1 million and lower costs increased its profit margins. It also announced plans to construct a new East Coast distribution center outside Richmond and lease another facility in California to help make its supply chain more efficient.

Shares of Lumber Liquidators Holdings added $2.16, or 2%, to close Thursday at $112.96. In after-hours trading, the stock fell 2.6% to $110.05. The stock has traded between $47.31 and $115.59 the past 52 weeks, and has more than doubled since the start of the year."

(CNN) – Attorney General Eric Holder’s direct involvement in the decision to search a reporter’s e-mail records should bar him from leading a review of how the government investigates national security leaks, Republicans argued Sunday.

The decision to apply for a warrant to search Fox News reporter James Rosen’s private correspondence was vetted at the Justice Department's highest levels, including Holder, a Justice official said last week, although the later decision to issue the warrant was made by a federal magistrate judge.



The Obama administration's aggressive posture against leaks to reporters on national security matters has come under scrutiny as probes of Rosen and Associated Press reporters have come to light.

It prompted Obama to announce on Thursday that he has directed Holder to review federal guidelines for investigating leaks and reporters. That review will include assembling a panel of media representatives.

But Republicans argued Sunday that Holder was too entwined in the various leak investigations to objectively review his agency’s rules.

“You cannot investigate yourself, and I think it's a total conflict of interest,” said Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Oklahoma, on CBS’s “Face the Nation.”

MORE: News Corp long aware of Fox News subpoena

The investigation into Rosen centered on a 2009 leak of intelligence related to North Korea and the potential ramifications of imposing further sanctions on the country. Investigators searched Rosen’s phone records, e-mails, and security badge logs at the State Department in the course of their probe.

In a separate case, records from Associated Press reporters and editors were seized as the government attempted to find out who leaked classified information about a terrorist plot based in Yemen.

While employees of the AP were not cited as potential criminals, an FBI affidavit used to obtain the warrant for Rosen's e-mails described him as potentially being an ""aider and abettor and/or co-conspirator"" to the crime of disclosing government secrets.

A top State Department official was charged with leaking government secrets in the Rosen case, though formal charges were never filed against Rosen or Fox News.

The disclosure that government investigators have used journalists’ phone and e-mail records to try to ferret out leakers has led to an outcry from news organizations and civil liberties advocates. Speaking Thursday, Obama said he was “troubled by the possibility that leak investigations may chill the investigative journalism that holds government accountable.""

Earlier this month, the White House said it was asking Sen. Charles Schumer, D-New York, to reintroduce so-called “reporter shield” legislation that would put in place stricter standards for government seizure of media records.

The bill would switch the sensitive decisions on investigating journalists from the attorney general, who is currently empowered to issue subpoenas to news organizations, to a federal judge, who is independent of the executive branch.

Schumer said Sunday that he and Sen. Lindsey Graham have assembled a bipartisan group of eight senators to help push the measure forward.

“If we can set up these rules, I think we'll avoid the morass,” Schumer said on CBS. “You always need set rules and an independent arbiter. We have neither now.”

Graham, appearing on “Fox News Sunday,” said the recent Justice Department incidents are grounds for a special counsel, who he argued could more objectively review the government’s rules for investigating journalists.

“When classified information is leaked into the public that can put operations or American operatives in harm's way, we've got to find a way to pursue that. But this is clearly an overreach,” said Graham, R-South Carolina.

Even one Democrat said Holder’s impartiality was an open question. Sen. Dick Durbin, on “Fox News Sunday,” said he would “like to know if Holder has any conflict in here beyond what we've heard when it comes to the Fox case.”"

Announcing the news Tuesday, ICE officials said that the immigrants were released under supervision and continue to face deportation. After reviewing hundreds of cases, those released were considered low-risk and “noncriminal,” officials said.

The releases took place over the last week and were an effort “to ensure detention levels stay within ICE’s current budget,” said ICE spokeswoman Gillian Christiansen, citing uncertainty caused by a budget standoff in Washington.

“All of these individuals remain in removal proceedings. Priority for detention remains on serious criminal offenders and other individuals who pose a significant threat to public safety,” she said.

U.S. immigration law: Decades of debate

Much of the federal government is braced to feel the pinch from $85 billion in across-the-board budget cuts due to start Friday. Both Republicans and Democrats have said they oppose the cuts, but the two parties cannot agree on a budget deal that would avert them.

ICE’s decision was praised by some who have long criticized the rise in detentions and deportations under the Obama administration. Human rights and immigration advocates have accused the administration of ramping up arrests in response to political pressure.

“We have long advocated for expanded use of alternatives to detention, a step we knew would save taxpayers millions of dollars,” said Ruthie Epstein of Human Rights First. “It is a shame that it took the threat of serious budget cuts to prompt this move. Even so, ICE’s decision makes clear that the government can save money by reforming its approach to immigration detention.”

Officials say the released detainees are under other forms of supervision, including electronic and telephonic monitoring. Their cases continue to proceed in court.

Still, some Republicans blasted the announcement as part of the White House’s attempt to gin up public outcry about the looming spending cuts. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte said the decision was a political ploy that put the public in danger.

“It’s abhorrent that President Obama is releasing criminals into our communities to promote his political agenda on sequestration,” the Virginia Republican said in a statement. “By releasing criminal immigrants onto the streets, the administration is needlessly endangering American lives.”

Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano hinted at the coming news Monday, when she outlined the impact the budget cuts would have on her agencies. Napolitano said ICE would not be able to maintain its inventory of detention beds if the department is forced to cut roughly 5% of its budget this year.

“Look, we’re doing our very best to minimize the impacts of sequester. But there’s only so much I can do,” Napolitano said. “I’m supposed to have 34,000 detention beds for immigration. How do I pay for those? We want to maintain 22,000-some odd Border Patrol agents. I got to be able to pay their salaries.”

The 844-page bill does not require that any measurement of border security be reached

All U.S. business owners would have to use the federal E-Verify program

The government would have to get a system to track when an immigrant enters%2C exits U.S.

The immigration bill filed by a bipartisan group of senators Wednesday would flood the nation's southwest border with more Border Patrol agents, National Guardsmen and fencing to hold back illegal immigration.

It also calls for additional immigration judges, more horse patrols and 24-hours-a-day and seven-days-a-week surveillance by drones.

But the 844-page bill does not require that any measurement of border security be reached before the nation's 11 million unauthorized immigrants can become U.S. citizens, and that is an issue with some lawmakers.

""That's not enforcement,"" Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala, said. ""That's the honor system.""

Ever since the Senate's ""Gang of Eight"" announced they were crafting an immigration bill in January, Republicans in the House and Senate have said that they need to ensure the border is secure in order to support granting legal status to the nation's unauthorized immigrants.

Many are fearful of a repeat of 1986, when Washington passed a law that allowed up to 3 million unauthorized immigrants to become legal, but did not secure the southwest border with Mexico as promised.

The Senate bill requires several things to happen before unauthorized immigrants can get their green cards, which would then allow them to apply for U.S. citizenship. Among the requirements:

• All U.S. business owners would have to use the federal E-Verify program to check the immigration status of new hires.

• The government would have to establish a system to track every time an immigrant enters and exits the country.

• The Department of Homeland Security, with the help of $6.5 billion, an additional 3,500 Border Patrol officers and National Guardsmen, would have to develop and implement a plan to add more fencing and secure the border. It would set ""goals"" of monitoring 100% of the border, and intercepting 90% of people trying to illegally cross in high-risk sections of the border.

""They all three work together to ensure that this is the most effective enforcement system that this country has ever had,"" Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., a member of the Gang of Eight, said while outlining the bill Sunday.

But as long as border security plans are implemented, that 90% benchmark does not have to be reached for unauthorized immigrants to continue on their road to citizenship. That upset conservatives as they delved into the bill Wednesday.

Some law enforcement officials along the border were concerned that the security provisions don't go far enough.

The bill sets a goal of intercepting 90% of border-crossers in ""high-risk"" sectors, defined as one where more than 30,000 people were apprehended in the previous year. In 2012, that would include three border sectors — the Tucson sector in Arizona, and the Laredo and Rio Grande Valley sectors in eastern Texas.

Donald Reay, executive director of the Texas Border Sheriff's Coalition — which includes the chief law enforcement officer of all Texas counties within 25 miles of the border — said an intensified focus on those sectors would simply lead would-be immigrants to other points along the border.

""It's kind of like squeezing a hose — you're shutting off the water, but eventually it's going to burst out somewhere else,"" Reay said.

Reay said he was happy to see increases in grants issued to local law enforcement agencies, and was thrilled that the bill would provide satellite phones to some people who live and work in remote border regions with intermittent cellphone access that limits their ability to call for help. But he said the increases in manpower along the border wouldn't be nearly enough to stem future tides of unauthorized immigrants.

""Three thousand, five-hundred more agents is not going to cover that entire void that exists along the border,"" Reay said.

But others, such as the Border Network for Human Rights executive director Fernando Garcia, said he feels that the massive increases in manpower along the border are already more than enough. The federal government has boosted the number of Border Patrol agents from just over 4,000 in 1993 to more than 21,000 in 2012.

Garcia said that has resulted in a ""militarization"" of the region, and he called further additions a ""misguided and irresponsible use of resources.""

Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, which supports a pathway to citizenship for unauthorized immigrants, said the border provisions were added to appease conservative voters and members of Congress. But he said complaints raised Wednesday by Sessions and others that the bill doesn't assure a secure border would have been raised no matter what was in the bill.

""Unless it's putting a double-moat on the border, whatever happens, (they) are going to say that's not enough,"" Noorani said. ""The question is: is that practical? What (the Gang of Eight) wrote is something that can be implemented, something that will work."""

Loiko Has Covered Wars', 'Crises', 'Daily Life In Russia', 'The Former Soviet States For The Los Angeles Times Since']",Russian foreign minister accuses U.S. of double standard on Syria,"MOSCOW -- Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accused Washington of applying a double standard in its approach to Syria and said its evidence that President Bashar Assad’s regime used chemical weapons is unconvincing.

“It is very odd to hear … my good friend, U.S. State Secretary John Kerry, claiming that the U.S. side presented Russians with irrefutable evidence of chemical weapons use in Syria,” Lavrov told students at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations on Monday. “We were shown some data which contained nothing concrete: neither geographical coordinates, nor names nor proof that the probes were taken by professionals.”

Lavrov said the United States used a double standard in dealing with Syria and the Middle East in general.

“It is a personal issue based on a personal dislike for some authoritarian dictator, whereas dictators for whom there is no dislike are not talked about because they are assistants and allies for our Western partners,” he said. “Terrorists should not be divided into good and bad; it is absolutely unprofessional and shortsighted.”

Lavrov warned that a planned U.S. strike against Assad would jeopardize the prospects for a so-called Geneva 2 conference on Syria.

“If, to our common regret, the action declared by the U.S. president takes place … it will push the prospects of this forum far away, if not for good,” Lavrov said.

On Saturday, Russian President Vladimir Putin called Washington’s accusations against Assad’s regime “utter nonsense.”

Russia is sending another navy reconnaissance vessel toward the Syrian coast to assist a group of five boats already based in the Mediterranean.

“Russia is stepping up our navy presence in the area but we will not fight for Assad in this conflict,” Igor Korotchenko, editor in chief of the journal National Defense, said in an interview. “Moscow is just trying to prevent negative global consequences of this strike and primarily for U.S.-Russian relations, which are already at their worst in years.”

Korotchenko said that a U.S. strike would mark a significant new turn in the growing political confrontation between Russia and the United States.

“The fallout from this strike will be far more global than just dramatically aggravating the situation in the Middle East,” he said. “After this strike the Kremlin may irrevocably rethink its dealings with the U.S.A. and may bury for the foreseeable future all prospects of any partnership and any cooperation with Washington.”

Russian lawmakers say they intended to apply pressure on their U.S. counterparts before Congress votes on a strike against Syria. The speaker of the Russian parliament’s lower house, Sergei Naryshkin, told Putin that Russian lawmakers are asking U.S. lawmakers to take a balanced stand in their vote.

As unlikely as it may seem that members of Congress would be swayed by Russian arguments, Naryshkin insisted that his colleagues had influenced the debate on Syria in other countries.

“Last week we addressed … lawmakers of [European] countries and it turned out useful as parliaments of a number of European countries are taking a very balanced and sound position,” Naryshkin said in televised remarks during a Kremlin meeting with Putin on Monday. “So I think this special kind of work with U.S. congressmen could be of use.”

Putin approved the initiative, calling it “timely and right.” He added: ”I think your U.S. colleagues could have a better understanding of what the position of the Russian Federation is based on.”

There’s only one problem: both Republican and Democrat Congresspeople say that isn’t true. On Friday afternoon, the press office for Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-WI), one of the authors of the Patriot Act, tweeted, “Obama’s claim that ‘every Member of Congress’ was briefed is FALSE.”

It wasn’t just Sensenbrenner. Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR) said that only certain members of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees had been told about the program, and he only knew about it because he received “special permission” to be briefed after hearing about it through the grapevine. “I knew about the program,” he said on MSNBC, “because I specifically sought it out. It’s not something that’s briefed outside the Intelligence Committee.” Merkley added that the administration had ignored the law. “Clearly the administration has not followed what an ordinary person would consider to be the standard of the law here,” he said.

Merkely summed up: “when the president says all members of Congress were briefed … well, I think a very small number of Senators in Congress had full details on these programs.”

Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL) said he only knew about the program after asking for a briefing under “classified circumstances.” The “average member,” he said, had no access to this information. “They don’t receive this kind of briefing.”

Senators Mike Lee (R-UT) and Jim Inhofe (R-OK) said they had not been briefed on the phone surveillance program, either. “Not quite!” Rep. Billy Long (R-LA) tweeted after hearing about Obama’s claim.

Obama’s claim was not a slip of the tongue. On Friday, Obama’s White House spokesman Josh Earnest said, “In December of 2009 and in February of 2011, the Department of Justice and the intelligence community provided a document to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees to be made available to all members of the House and Senate, describing the classified uses of Section 215 in detail.”

The original explanation of the Sept. 11, 2012, attacks on the U.S. outpost in Benghazi, Libya, was written by CIA officials, then revised by State Department and White House officials, according to news reports and witness testimony made available to Fox News.

Removed from the CIA's so-called talking points were references to “Islamic extremists” and Al Qaeda in Libya. And five days later, Susan Rice, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, made the Sunday talk show rounds to say the attacks were “demonstrations” sparked by protests in Egypt over an anti-Islamic video on YouTube.

However, the video is never mentioned in the numerous talking-points drafts, according to a Weekly Standard story last week, based in part on a 43-page House report and records of official emails.

“Well, it was scrubbed,” Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Steve Lynch told “Fox News Sunday.” “It was totally inaccurate. There's no excuse for that. It was false information. And what they try to do is harmonize what happened in Benghazi with what happened everywhere else across the Middle East.”

More On This...

Lynch also acknowledged the talking points were likely revised to reflect President Obama’s decry – with his re-election bid in the balance -- that “Al Qaeda is on the run.”

Maryland Democratic Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, also acknowledged Sunday the facts as told by Rice were wrong.

“At the time, as it turns out” the information was incorrect, he said on CBS’ “Face the Nation”

Ruppersberger, who was briefed by the CIA about the attacks in immediate aftermath, asked agency officials what congressional leaders could tell the public, according to The Weekly Standard story.

On Sunday, he also said he welcomes a House Oversight and Government Affairs Committee hearing this week in which Greg Hicks, the deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Libya at the time of attacks, is expected to say Rice said the attacks didn’t appear to be “pre-meditated or pre-planned,” despite having information suggesting they were.

“That's what an investigation is about,” Ruppersberger told CBS. “Let's get the facts.”"

Sanger'],"A Step, if Modest, Toward Slowing Iran’s Weapons Capability","Mr. Steinitz was referring to a 2003 agreement in which Libya gave up all of its nuclear equipment and was left with no ability to make nuclear fuel. But Libya had barely managed to unpack its equipment, purchased from Pakistan; it had invested far less than Iran and was nowhere near enriching nuclear fuel. In reality, no one imagines the Iranians will give up everything. The question is, how much is enough?

The complexity of the task ahead is evident from a glance at the main measurements of Iran’s progress since Mr. Obama took office in 2009, promising a new opening to the Iranians — an opening they had largely rejected until this summer, when the mounting toll of economic sanctions helped Mr. Rouhani win the presidential election.

At the beginning of Mr. Obama’s presidency, Iran had roughly 2,000 kilograms of low-enriched uranium, barely enough for a bomb. It now has about 9,000 kilograms, by the estimates of the International Atomic Energy Agency. A few thousand centrifuges were spinning in 2009; today there are 18,000, including new models that are far more efficient and can produce bomb-grade uranium faster. A new heavy water reactor outside the city of Arak promises a new pathway to a bomb, using plutonium, if it goes online next year as Iran says it will.

True rollback would mean dismantling many of those centrifuges, shipping much of the fuel out of the country or converting it into a state that could not be easily adapted to bomb use, and allowing inspections of many underground sites where the C.I.A., Europe and Israel believe hidden enrichment facilities may exist. There is no evidence of those facilities now, but, as a former senior Obama administration official said recently, speaking anonymously to discuss intelligence, “there has never been a time in the past 15 years or so when Iran didn’t have a hidden facility in construction.”

There is also the problem of forcing Iran to reveal what kind of progress it has made toward designing a weapon. For years, its leaders have refused to answer questions about documents, slipped out of the country by a renegade scientist nearly eight years ago, that strongly suggest work on a nuclear warhead. Inspectors have never been able to interview Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, the academic believed to be in charge of a series of weapons development projects.

The good news for the American negotiators is that if there are no hidden facilities, it will take Iran several months to produce weapons-grade fuel from its current stocks, and perhaps a year or more to fashion that fuel into a usable weapon and shrink it to fit atop one of the country’s Shahab missiles.

Even then, a single weapon would do Iran little good next to Israel’s 100 or more and the United States’ thousands, as Mr. Zarif, the foreign minister, often points out. But the mere knowledge that Iran was on the cusp of a weapon would affect the perception of its power around the world, and that may be all its leaders seek."

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

All presidential decisions are, in the end, difficult and complex. And under any circumstance, the decisions on issues of war (surgical strikes included) are agonizing. The decision to use force -- the repercussions, the cost in blood and treasure, the geostrategic implications -- is complicated and the implications obviously immense.

But as the Syria story unfolds, there is an almost Shakespearean drama beneath the surface -- one of political careers made and broken, of past positions held and almost abandoned. Not to mention the political enemies now finding themselves -- awkwardly -- on the same side of history.

As the public debate plays out, the political past lingers, and haunts every moment.

First consider the irony of Barack Obama himself. It's no surprise to anyone that this president is a reluctant warrior. His rise to national prominence was based, in part, on his antiwar sentiment on Iraq.

Gloria Borger

In the past, he's been a forceful proponent of the need for congressional authorization for the use of force. He tells the American people, at every opportunity, that he is extracting us from two wars. That was at the top of his to-do list, and he's doing it.

So now this, er, wrinkle in which Obama becomes the conscientious aggressor. He is the president who defends his National Security Agency surveillance strategy and his frequent use of drones to an unhappy Democratic base. He drew the red line on chemical weapons (which he now explains was also the world's red line).

He's certain we need to hit Bashar al-Assad but seeks support from a Congress he generally disdains. Like Lewis Carroll's Alice in ""Through the Looking Glass,"" Obama could well be asking, ""I know who I WAS when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then.""

Indeed.

As the president himself pointed out Wednesday in Sweden, ""had I been in the Senate, I would have suggested Congress have the ability to weigh in."" It was hardly lost on him that it would seem, well, a tad hypocritical that someone who had spoken repeatedly about a congressional buy-in on the use of force was now willing to go it alone. So after the British said no, the president looked homeward for a coalition of the willing.

And so, another irony: The president's legacy now is in the hands of a notoriously paralyzed and partisan Congress -- a Congress that hasn't exactly friended him.

And that brings us to the agony part of this drama -- Sen. John McCain. Here's the man who lost to Obama in 2008 and remains his foreign policy nemesis. McCain is the GOP's major (and increasingly lonely) hawk-in-residence. He thinks Obama made a huge mistake in not arming the Syrian rebels and charges the president with dawdling for two years while this civil war intensified. Oh, and by the way, he believes Obama's surgical strike is too little, too late.

And yet, here he is, on the verge of supporting Obama—and taking on the libertarians in his own party. And not because he likes him, and not because he likes the policy—but because he believes that a congressional no-vote could be ""catastrophic"" for the nation. In the end, he may still balk because the mission, as defined by Congress, is too narrow. But he clearly wants to find a way to stand with the president.

""Alice in Wonderland"" would be right at home. ""I can't go back to yesterday,"" she understood. ""Because I was a different person then."""

Professional staff members at the National Security Agency and other U.S. intelligence agencies are angry, these officials say, believing the president has cast them adrift as he tries to distance himself from the disclosures by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden that have strained ties with close allies.

The resistance emerged as the White House said it would curtail foreign intelligence collection in some cases and two senior U.S. senators called for investigations of the practice.

France, Germany, Italy, Mexico and Sweden have all publicly complained about the NSA surveillance operations, which reportedly captured private cellphone conversations by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, among other foreign leaders.

FOR THE RECORD:

U.S. spying: An article in the Oct. 29 front section about U.S. spying on foreign leaders misidentified Sen. John McCain as the ranking minority member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. He is a member of the committee, but no longer the ranking member.



On Monday, as Spain joined the protest, the fallout also spread to Capitol Hill.

Until now, members of Congress have chiefly focused their attention on Snowden’s disclosures about the NSA’s collection of U.S. telephone and email records under secret court orders.

“With respect to NSA collection of intelligence on leaders of U.S. allies — including France, Spain, Mexico and Germany — let me state unequivocally: I am totally opposed,” said Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee.

“Unless the United States is engaged in hostilities against a country or there is an emergency need for this type of surveillance, I do not believe the United States should be collecting phone calls or emails of friendly presidents and prime ministers,” she said in a statement.

Feinstein said the Intelligence Committee had not been told of “certain surveillance activities” for more than a decade, and she said she would initiate a major review of the NSA operation. She added that the White House had informed her that “collection on our allies will not continue,” although other officials said most U.S. surveillance overseas would not be affected.

Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), ranking minority member of the Armed Services Committee, said Congress should consider creating a special select committee to examine U.S. eavesdropping on foreign leaders.

“Obviously, we’re going to want to know exactly what the president knew and when he knew it,” McCain told reporters in Chicago. “We have always eavesdropped on people around the world. But the advance of technology has given us enormous capabilities, and I think you might make an argument that some of this capability has been very offensive both to us and to our allies.”

In Madrid, Spanish Foreign Ministry officials summoned the U.S. ambassador to object to the alleged NSA communications net in Spain. Citing documents leaked by Snowden, El Mundo, a major Spanish daily, said the U.S. spy agency had collected data on more than 60 million phone calls made in just 30 days, from early December 2012 to early January 2013.

Precisely how the surveillance is conducted is unclear. But if a foreign leader is targeted for eavesdropping, the relevant U.S. ambassador and the National Security Council staffer at the White House who deals with the country are given regular reports, said two former senior intelligence officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity in discussing classified information.

Obama may not have been specifically briefed on NSA operations targeting a foreign leader’s cellphone or email communications, one of the officials said. “But certainly the National Security Council and senior people across the intelligence community knew exactly what was going on, and to suggest otherwise is ridiculous.”

If U.S. spying on key foreign leaders was news to the White House, current and former officials said, then White House officials have not been reading their briefing books.

Some U.S. intelligence officials said they were being blamed by the White House for conducting surveillance that was authorized under the law and utilized at the White House.

“People are furious,” said a senior intelligence official who would not be identified discussing classified information. “This is officially the White House cutting off the intelligence community.”

Any decision to spy on friendly foreign leaders is made with input from the State Department, which considers the political risk, the official said. Any useful intelligence is then given to the president’s counter-terrorism advisor, Lisa Monaco, among other White House officials.

Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, said Monday that Obama had ordered a review of surveillance capabilities, including those affecting America’s closest foreign partners and allies.

“Our review is looking across the board at our intelligence gathering to ensure that as we gather intelligence, we are properly accounting for both the security of our citizens and our allies and the privacy concerns shared by Americans and citizens around the world,” Carney said.

Caitlin Hayden, spokeswoman for the National Security Council, said the review would examine “whether we have the appropriate posture when it comes to heads of state, how we coordinate with our closest allies and partners, and what further guiding principles or constraints might be appropriate for our efforts.”

She said the review should be completed this year.

Citing documents from Snowden, the German news magazine Der Spiegel reported last week that the NSA’s Special Collection Service had monitored Merkel’s cellphone since 2002. Obama subsequently called Merkel and told her he was not aware her phone had been hacked, U.S. officials said.

Intelligence officials also disputed a Wall Street Journal article Monday that said the White House had learned only this summer — during a review of surveillance operations that might be exposed by Snowden — about an NSA program to monitor communications of 35 world leaders. Since then, officials said, several of the eavesdropping operations have been stopped because of political sensitivities.

President Obama met with his National Security Council on Saturday to review the Boston Marathon bombings and discuss the way forward.

""The president commended the work that was done to pursue justice in the Boston Marathon bombing, and underscored the need to continue gathering intelligence to answer the remaining questions about this terrorist attack going forward,"" said a White House statement.

The Situation Room conference took place as suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev remained hospitalized in Boston after he was caught Friday; a second suspect, brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev, was killed during a police shootout earlier.

In remarks Friday night at the White House, Obama vowed to get to the bottom of the reasons for the Boston attack. He also urged Americans to be patient, making apparent references to reports that the suspect are Muslim and have ties to the troubled Russian republic of Chechnya.

""It's important that we do this right,"" Obama said. ""That's why we have investigations. That's why we relentlessly gather the facts. That's why we have courts. And that's why we take care not to rush to judgment -- not about the motivations of these individuals; certainly not about entire groups of people.""

A White House readout:

""President Obama convened the National Security Council in the Situation Room (on Saturday) from 11:30 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. to review the events in Boston.

""The president was updated by Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Monaco, National Security Adviser Donilon, Attorney General Holder, FBI Director Mueller, and Secretary of Homeland Security Napolitano on the apprehension of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, and the related investigation.

""He was also briefed by the leadership of the intelligence community, including DNI Clapper and Director Brennan, about our ongoing efforts to combat terrorism and protect the American people.

""The president commended the work that was done to pursue justice in the Boston Marathon bombing, and underscored the need to continue gathering intelligence to answer the remaining questions about this terrorist attack going forward.

""As he did last night, the president also expressed appreciation for the efforts made by state and local officials, and law enforcement, in Boston and Massachusetts. Vice President Biden joined the meeting via video-conference."""

Chuck Hagel should he get nominated for secretary of defense, while Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said he is reserving judgment.

Texas Sen. John Cornyn had the most strident remarks, saying President Obama nominating Hagel sends “the worst possible message” to Israel and other U.S. allies in the Middle East.

“I will not support Chuck Hagel’s nomination,” Cornyn said in a release, citing in part Hagel’s views on Israel and his opposition to Iranian sanctions.

However, he did not say whether he would try to block Hagel’s potential nomination during a Senate confirmation hearing.

A congressional aide said Senate Democrats have been given a heads-up from the White House that Hagel's selection is imminent. And an administration official told Fox News the announcement will be made Monday.

Hagel, a decorated Vietnam combat veteran, would replace Pentagon chief Leon Panetta in Obama's second-term Cabinet.

Newly-elected Texas Sen. Ted Cruz told “Fox News Sunday” that “it is very difficult to imagine the circumstance in which I could support his confirmation.”

Cruz also cited Hagel’s views and statements about Israel and Iran and questioned why Obama might pick Hagel in the face of tough opposition.

“The president seems bound and determined to proceed down this path despite the fact that Hagel's record is very, very troubling on the nation of Israel,” Cruz told Fox. “I do think it is interesting that the president seems hell-bent on nominating him despite the fact that a number of prominent Republicans have criticized him and the Democratic senators have been surprisingly silent on it.”

Hagel said in 2006 that ""the Jewish lobby intimidates a lot of people"" on Capitol Hill, then added, ""I'm not an Israeli senator, I'm a United States senator.""

McConnell, R-Ky., said any defense nominee must have ""a full understanding of our close relationship with our Israeli allies, the Iranian threat and the importance of having a robust military.""

McConnell told ABC's ""This Week"" that Hagel, a Nebraska Republican who left the Senate in 2009, has ""certainly been outspoken in foreign policy and defense over the years. The question we will be answering, if he's the nominee, is do his views make sense for that particular job?""

McConnell said he would ""wait and see how the hearings go and see whether Chuck's views square with the job he would be nominated to do.""

He added: ""I'm going to take a look at all the things that Chuck has said over the years and review that, and in terms of his qualifications to lead our nation's military.""

Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the second-ranking Senate Democrat, told CNN's ""State of the Union"" that Hagel ""is a serious candidate if the president chooses to name him.""

Hagel has criticized discussion of a military strike by either the U.S. or Israel against Iran. He also has backed efforts to bring Iran to the table for talks on future peace in Afghanistan.

""This is a controversial pick,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told CNN. ""He is an antagonistic figure when it comes to the state of Israel. It's a signal you're sending to Iran at the worst possible time and to our allies.""

Officials close to the White House have talked up Hagel as a patriot who served in the military with distinction during Vietnam and someone who shares the president's skepticism about potential conflict with Iran and a large U.S. footprint in Afghanistan.

Liberals have expressed anger over an anti-gay remark Hagel made in the Clinton administration for which he recently apologized.

Federal Times

Inspectors have uncovered improprieties by company that conducted background checks

Some investigators falsified information

Snowden leaked documents on U.S. government surveillance programs

A 2011 re-investigation of Edward Snowden's background check may have been faulty, Office of Personnel Management Inspector General Patrick McFarland told Congress on Thursday. Snowden is a former National Security Agency contract employee who leaked details of a top-secret spying program at NSA.

""We do believe that there may be some problems"" with the re-investigation, McFarland said when Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., asked him whether he had concerns about whether Snowden's reinvestigation may not have been carried out in an appropriate or thorough manner. McFarland was testifying before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs subcommittee on the federal workforce, which Tester chairs.

McFarland said that U.S. Investigative Services, a company that handles 45% of the federal government's contracted background checks, conducted the 2011 re-investigation into Snowden. Later that year, McFarland's office began investigating USIS for contract fraud. That investigation is still ongoing.

In a statement, USIS said it received a subpoena for records from McFarland's office in January 2012, with which it complied. USIS said it has cooperated fully with the government's civil investigation, but said it has not been told it is under criminal investigation.

USIS would not confirm or deny whether it had conducted any investigations into Snowden, saying those investigations are confidential.

McFarland told the subcommittee that 18 background investigators and record searchers — 11 federal employees and seven contractors — have been convicted for falsifying background investigation reports since the IG began investigating so-called fabrication cases in 2006. The abuses included interviews that never occurred, answers to questions that were never asked, and record checks that were never conducted, McFarland said.

A 19th investigator pled guilty last month, McFarland said, and a 20th is expected to plead guilty this week. Both investigators are contractors, he said.

Snowden was fired from his job as a Booz Allen Hamilton contractor after revealing NSA programs that collect private online communications from companies such as Microsoft, Facebook and Google, and phone records and metadata from Verizon.

Meanwhile, Icelandic business executive said Friday that a private plane is on standby to transport National Security Agency secrets leaker Edward Snowden from Hong Kong to Iceland.

Olafur Vignir Sigurvinsson said he has not spoken directly with Snowden but has been in touch with a third party representing him.

The businessman, who has connections to the WikiLeaks secret-spilling organization, said he has access to planes in Hong Kong and mainland China that Snowden could use.

But Iceland's government says it has not received an asylum request from Snowden, who has revealed his role in providing secret NSA documents about widespread surveillance programs.

Iceland Interior Ministry spokesman Johannes Tomasson said Snowden hasn't approached the ministry and could initiate an asylum request if he was already in Iceland.

When asked about the reports of Sigurvinsson chartering a private plane to fly Snowden to Iceland, Tomasson said: ""We don't object to that. But we don't have any knowledge other than what has been in the news. We can't comment any further on that.""

U.S. officials have expressed an interest in prosecuting Snowden for his admitted role in the publication of the documents. Snowden fled to Hong Kong and is hiding.

Sigurvinsson said that Snowden's potential private flight is being funded by private donations.

""There are a number of people that are interested in freedom of speech and recognize the importance of knowing who is spying on us,"" he said. ""We are people that care about privacy.""

Money is being raised on Snowden's behalf by the Progressive Change Campaign Committee based in the United States, but it was not expected to be tapped to help with the cost of a possible flight to Iceland.

Spokesman Matt Wall said Friday that more than $20,800 had been raised so far to pay for possible legal fees but that this would not be put to use for Snowden's personal expenses.

Sigurvinsson is a former director of DataCell, a data hosting service provider that, as one of its services, processed donations for WikiLeaks. He previously worked for investment and technology companies, including Baugur Group, MerkurPoint and iCell.

He said his group hopes to obtain Icelandic citizenship for Snowden.

""We are hoping that the government does what they did with Bobby Fischer,"" he said, referring to the late chess master who went to Iceland to escape U.S. prosecution for breaking sanctions imposed on the former Yugoslavia. ""We will see what happens."""

So it made a certain amount of sense for Edward J. Snowden to announce over the weekend that he was the one who blew the whistle on the National Security Agency’s classified and extraordinarily broad surveillance program.

I mean, why spend sleepless nights worrying about being discovered when it’s just a matter of time? Might as well drop the veil and get on with the fight to stay out of jail.

Snowden has relocated to Hong Kong, hoping to avoid facing the music in the United States. He’s almost certain to be indicted for something; the documents he released to the Guardian newspaper in London and the Washington Post include a classified court order and two top secret PowerPoint decks. The Obama administration has already referred the case to the Justice Department, and a spokesman for Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said, ominously, that “the intelligence community is currently reviewing the damage that has been done by these recent disclosures.”

Reaction has been predictably mixed and extreme, with Fox News analyst Ralph Peters calling for Snowden to be executed and previous national security whistle-blowers, Ellsberg included, practically calling for a statue to be erected in his honor. Some cyber civil libertarians argue that the revelations should cause heads to roll within the administration because they appear to have lied to Congress about the surveillance; the Electronic Frontier Federation wants Congress to appoint a blue-ribbon panel to “conduct a full, public investigation into the domestic surveillance of Americans by the intelligence communities ... [and] make changes in the law to stop the spying and ensure that it does not happen again.”

One interesting question, though, is whether Snowden is entitled to protection as a whistle-blower. The administration argues that its data-gathering efforts on phone networks and online have all fallen within the bounds of the Patriot Act and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. In fact, the hoovering of data from phone companies has been done under the auspices of regular orders from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. If that’s true -- and granted, that’s a sizable “if” -- Snowden has disclosed things that the government has been doing legally.

On the other hand, it’s impossible to have a real discussion of the pros and cons of government data-mining if it’s all done in secret. President Obama has said we should have a national conversation about how to balance privacy and security, but the issue wouldn’t be on the table if not for Snowden.

But the United States government quickly found itself entangled, once again, in a misunderstood land dominated by squabbling tribes and petty vengeances.

Agents first arrested an Elvis impersonator, released him, then on Saturday arrested his nemesis, a karate instructor. Gradually investigators concluded that what they had descended upon was probably less about the president — or the U.S. senator and retired state judge who also received letters — than a serious case of indigenous bickering.

That shocks no one here. “Tupelo is a kaleidoscope,” said sociologist Mark Franks, who grew up in nearby Booneville. There are true geniuses walking the streets of Tupelo, he said, and incredibly wealthy, generous people. But also, “every wall-eyed uncle and ‘yard cousin’ — just referencing the local pejorative — makes it into Tupelo, Miss. It creates a peculiar culture.”

Tupelo is best known as the hometown of Elvis Presley, after whom it has named streets, waterways and dry cleaners.

Unlike many other Southern towns its size, it boasts several excellent museums, street art and a large public arena. An arena large enough, in fact, to attract the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus this month. That’s when someone shot Carol, a circus elephant, in what seems to be the first elephantine drive-by ever. Carol is recovering, but Tupelo Police Capt. Rusty Haynes said his investigation has stalled. “Because, to be honest, there are a lot of possible perpetrators.”

So people in the area were bemused more than surprised when the FBI, Secret Service and other agencies showed up looking for the soul who had sent letters laced with ricin to President Obama, Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) and retired Mississippi judge Sadie Holland.

Advertisement

The agents quickly nabbed an odd character in nearby Corinth named Paul Kevin Curtis. He worked as an Elvis impersonator, spun wild conspiracies about the local hospital selling body parts and apparently signed the poisoned letters with his own initials.

But the FBI found no evidence of ricin in Curtis’ home. No incriminating research on his computer. They decided he hadn’t sent the letters after all and released him Tuesday. Within hours agents had raided the home of his archenemy: J. Everett Dutschke, karate instructor.

Advertisement

Curtis claimed Dutschke wanted to frame him. It wouldn’t be the first skirmish between Tupelo’s most famous son and a karate man. In 1973, several men climbed on stage during a concert by the actual Elvis. Elvis felt threatened and fought the men, alongside his bodyguards. He felt sure the men had been sent by estranged wife Priscilla’s new boyfriend, his own personal nemesis: Mike Stone, karate instructor.

Curtis, 45, and Dutschke, 41, seem locked in an elaborate piece of tribute performance art. Their lives have entwined for years, feuding over small-town grievances as labyrinthine and intricate as any global conspiracy. They met in 2005, and were friendly for a time. When he wasn’t teaching karate, Dutschke worked for Curtis’ brother Jack at an insurance office. Both men knew Sen. Wicker, and both had connections to the 80-year-old Judge Holland.

Advertisement

It’s unclear at what moment the hostilities began, but a few years ago Curtis, who worked at the local hospital, developed a theory that doctors were harvesting organs to sell on the black market. He wrote a book about it called “Missing Pieces.” Dutschke published a local newsletter at the time, and after some negotiations apparently rejected Curtis’ writings.

There was the question, too, of who had the bigger intellect. Dutschke was a member of Mensa, the club for people with high IQs. A few years ago, Curtis posted a fake Mensa certificate on his Facebook page, which sent Dutschke into a rage. “I threatened to sue him for fraud for posting a Mensa certificate that is a lie,” Dutschke told Tupelo’s newspaper, the Daily Journal. “That certificate is a lie.”

Advertisement

“Aw, yeah. I don’t know why Kevin did that,” Curtis’ father, Jack, said recently in Cleveland, Miss. “These boys were just after each other.”

Both men have made multiple trips to jail. Curtis was arrested for, among other things, assaulting a Tupelo lawyer — for which he received a six-month sentence from Judge Holland. In January, Tupelo authorities charged Dutschke with molesting children. He pleaded not guilty, but he shut down his karate school, called Tupelo Taekwondo Plus, while awaiting trial.

Advertisement

After the FBI released Curtis, the two enemies’ paths diverged. Curtis headed for New York. “Can you believe that?” Jack Curtis said. “Now he’s got publishers all trying to jump the gun on each other to publish his book first. Isn’t that something?”

Dutschke, meanwhile, watched federal agents in protective masks search his home, his karate studio and his van.

Advertisement

On Wednesday, Dutschke slipped from sight, traveling with his friend Kirk Kitchens to a remote house in neighboring Itawamba County.

They entered the house and turned on the television, then slipped out the back door and down a wooded path, where they met a waiting car, Kitchens later told a Memphis television station.

Advertisement

Itawamba County Sheriff Chris Dickinson said Dutschke had escaped surveillance.

But the next evening, Dutschke pulled into the driveway at his house and stepped from his minivan like a man returning from routine errands.

Advertisement

On Saturday the U.S. attorney charged him with “knowingly developing, producing” and stockpiling ricin. If convicted he faces maximum penalties of life imprisonment and a $250,000 fine.

Hours before his arrest, Dutschke answered his door by opening it just enough to look out with one dark eye. He held a kitten, which also looked outside. “I’m sorry, I just...,” he started. His voice was soft. “I can’t talk. I’m so, so sorry.”

Could he say, at least, what started this mess?

“Just look around you,” he said. “This place is crazy.”

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

GAO says no action taken on lab safety recommendations from 2009

USDA inspector general found significant violations of bioterror lab regulations went undetected

Key members of Congress call the issues %22troubling%2C%22 and say more oversight is needed

The United States is at increased risk for accidents at laboratories conducting research on potential bioterror germs, such as anthrax, because federal officials have failed to develop national standards for lab design, construction and operation, according to a report to be released Monday by the Government Accountability Office. The GAO called for the standards more than three years ago.

Meanwhile, another recent government audit has found significant failures by federal officials to detect security and safety violations during inspections of bioterror labs. The undetected issues included the transfer of anthrax and plague to an unauthorized facility, and allowing workers at multiple research facilities to remain on the job with expired security risk assessments.

""As a result, there is increased risk of the misuse of select agents and the potential for serious security violations going undetected,"" says the November2012 report by inspector general auditors at the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Security at bioterror labs has been an issue of particular concern since the 2001 anthrax letter attacks that killed five and sickened 17; a scientist at an Army biodefense lab was later implicated.

USDA inspection program officials disputed many of the auditors' findings, called the report's language ""unduly alarming,"" and refused to adopt many of the auditors' recommendations, the report says.

Officials in USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service declined to be interviewed. In a statement issued Friday, spokeswoman Lyndsay Cole said that in January the inspection program agreed to take actions to address all of the auditors' concerns. Cole said ""our inspections are effective at identifying deficiencies.""

The USDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) share responsibility for inspecting numerous individual labs at about 350 government, academic and commercial organizations registered to work with dangerous germs and toxins that have bioterror potential.

The USDA was put in charge of inspecting labs operated by the CDC last summer, in the wake of USA TODAY's reports about safety and security problems at CDC labs in Atlanta.

U.S. Rep. Fred Upton, chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, called the USDA inspector general's findings ""very troubling"" and said they show the need for oversight. He said the committee will be investigating.

""The inadequate and lax inspection practices of USDA raise additional concerns about their ability and independence to conduct effective inspections of CDC's labs to ensure safety,"" said Upton, R-Mich.

U.S. Rep. Henry Waxman of California, the committee's ranking Democrat, said: ""It is troubling that safety and security risks that were identified years ago have still not been fixed, and that the USDA IG has identified additional new vulnerabilities.""

Safety experts also expressed concerns.

Najmedin Meshkati, an engineering professor at the University of Southern California, said the USDA lab inspection program ""may be suffering from a serious safety-culture problem,"" based on his quick review of the audit report.

Richard Ebright, a biosafety expert at Rutgers university in New Jersey, said the repeated failures by USDA inspectors to detect problems is ""significant"" and it ""erodes confidence"" that regulations are being effectively monitored and enforced. Ebright noted that the USDA ""rebuffed"" auditors' recommendations. ""This is one of the most striking parts of the report,"" he said.

CDC officials declined to be interviewed or to discuss audits of their inspection program. In a statement, the CDC said: ""The record stands for itself,"" noting that the agency has performed more than 1,500 inspections over the past 10 years. ""The public should be confident that the critical research and development work to treat and prevent disease associated with select agents in the U.S. is done in a safe and secure manner.""

The USDA generally oversees about 50 organizations with labs that work with pathogens that primarily pose a risk to livestock and crops, and the CDC has primary responsibility for inspecting those at about 300 entities that work with germs that are dangerous to people.

It's unclear what government auditors have found recently in similar audits of the effectiveness of CDC's inspection program. The CDC is audited by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services inspector general, which is still processing USA TODAY's Freedom of Information Act request for the reports.

Incidents involving bioterror agents are rare, according to a CDC report last year in the journal Applied Biosafety. Between 2004 and 2010, there were no reports of thefts and only one confirmed loss, which occurred during the shipment of a fungus that can cause a type of pneumonia called Valley Fever. An FBI investigation of the lost fungus package concluded it was ""apparently destroyed during processing at a commercial shipping facility,"" the CDC researchers' article said.

The CDC report said there were 11 laboratory-acquired infections among 639 potential release incidents reported to the agency during those years among more than 10,000 people with approved access at organizations working with ""select agents,"" the government's term for germs and toxins that have the potential to be used as bioweapons. None of the infections was fatal or involved the disease spreading to others.

USA TODAY reported last month that the HHS inspector general has repeatedly cited the CDC for safety and security problems in the operation of its own labs in Atlanta and Fort Collins, Colo., including failing to secure potential bioterror agents and not properly training employees who work with them. At the time of those reports, issued in 2008 through 2010, the CDC was responsible for inspecting its own labs.

CDC officials have said nobody has been endangered by the lapses because their labs have redundant layers of safety and security to protect employees and the public. When issues arise, they are fixed immediately, the agency says.

Other incidents have also caused concern, including power outages at CDC labs in Atlanta in 2007 and 2008. In 2007, a leaky drainage system was suspected in the release of foot-and-mouth disease virus — a highly infectious livestock disease that can have significant economic consequences — from a vaccine research facility in the United Kingdom and an outbreak on nearby farms, according to the GAO, the investigative arm of Congress.

In 2009, the GAO examined the potential risks posed by the proliferation of ""high-containment labs"" experimenting with dangerous germs, including bioterror agents, in the wake of the 2001 terrorist attacks and increased biodefense funding. The labs' research focuses on such things as developing treatments, vaccines, diagnostic tests and other countermeasures. The GAO concluded that a national oversight strategy was needed, including a periodic assessment of the nation's need for the labs. The report also said national construction, operation and maintenance standards were needed.

But federal security and science officials in the Executive Office of the President have not acted on the recommendations, the GAO said in its new report scheduled to be released Monday. ""There is still no one agency or group that knows the nation's need for all U.S. high-containment laboratories,"" the report said, noting that budget constraints make the need for a national strategy and prioritization ""more critical today than 3years ago.""

The GAO said it remains concerned that there continue to be no national standards for lab design, construction and operation. ""This will make it difficult to be able to assess and guarantee safety,"" the report said.

According to the report, officials in the president's Office of Science and Technology Policy disagreed with the GAO's conclusion that there is an increased risk associated with the increased number of labs and said several actions have been taken since 2009 to strengthen lab security, including the creation of new regulations and committees focused on managing risks. White House officials did not respond to USA TODAY's requests for interviews or comment.

Upton said the lack of action is ""not acceptable"" and that the ""GAO recommendations merit action and engagement by the administration."""

""The American global domination project is bound to generate all kinds of resistance in the post-colonial world,"" Richard Falk, the UN Human Rights Council's Palestine monitor, wrote in an article for Foreign Policy Journal titled, “A Commentary on the Marathon Murders.""

""It is soon to tell, and the somewhat hysterical Boston dragnet for the remaining at large and alive suspect does suggest that the wounds of 9/11 are far from healed,"" he wrote. ""We should be asking ourselves at this moment, 'How many canaries will have to die before we awaken from our geopolitical fantasy of global domination?'”

Falk also blamed Israel for the unrest he believes prompted two brothers of Chechen descent to set bombs that killed three innocent people and injure nearly 200, then kill a police officer.

[pullquote]

""The war drums are beating at this moment in relation to both North Korea and Iran, and as long as Tel Aviv has the compliant ear of the American political establishment, those who wish for peace and justice in the world should not rest easy,"" he wrote.

The comments drew a sharp rebuke from Hillel Neuer, executive director of UN Watch. In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and Ambassador Susan Rice, the Geneva-based monitoring organization's chief expressed outrage.

“First, its thesis is that America is to blame for last week’s atrocity,” the letter reads. “Falk approvingly cites comments justifying the Boston Marathon bombings as ‘retribution’ for actions of the U.S. military in Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan.”

Neuer’s letter, which also referenced Falk's past promotion of conspiracy theories following the Sept. 11 terror attacks on his personal blog, called on Ban to condemn Falk.

“Mr. Falk’s odious and preposterous remarks insult last week’s victims and discredit the cause of human rights and the founding principles of the United Nations,” Neuer’s letter concludes. “We urge you to speak out.”

Calls seeking comment from UN officials were not immediately returned. UN spokesman Farhan Haq told UN Watch that Falk is an independent expert.

“The secretary-general did not appoint him and is not responsible for his views,” Haq told UN Watch. “Mr. Falk reports to the Human Rights Council, which is comprised of different member states.”

Haq’s comment came in a reply to an inquiry by David Bedein, director of the Center for Near East Policy Research.

Neuer said he was confused by the UN chief’s silence.

“The secretary-general has rightly rebuked Falk in the past for promoting 9/11 conspiracy on his personal blog, and the outrage this time is far more substantial, offensive and repugnant,” he said in a statement. “We indeed urge all UN Human Rights Council member states to condemn Falk, and we have appealed for US Ambassador Susan Rice in particular, but Mr. Ban should use his moral pulpit to show leadership in the world body.”"

After NSA systems analyst Edward Snowden leaked documents revealing the NSA's monitoring of American's telephone records, Leahy introduced legislation that would increase congressional oversight of the program. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)

Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) said Sunday that Democratic aides in the Senate are drafting new language for an authorization of military force in Syria, Politico reports.

Speaking after some members of Congress returned early from recess to attend closed-door briefings on the situation in Syria, Leahy said the draft legislation offered by President Barack Obama on Saturday was too broad.

“I know it’s going to be amended in the Senate,” Leahy said, according to Politico.

On Saturday, Obama submitted to Congress a draft resolution authorizing the use of military force in response to Syrian President Bashar Assad's suspected use of chemical weapons on innocent civilians. The measure would allow the president to use force in a “necessary and appropriate” way.

""While I believe I have the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization, I know that the country will be stronger if we take this course, and our actions will be even more effective,"" Obama said during a Saturday statement.

According to the Washington Post, Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) also expressed hesitation over the draft's language.

“I think the biggest question I heard is that the president’s request is open-ended,” Roberts said. “That has to be rectified, and they simply said in answer to that that they would work with the Congress and try to come back with a more prescribed resolution. But I’m not too sure that the people who answered that are the people that have that decision to make.”

According to Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.), about 100 to 150 lawmakers attended the classified briefing."

A stenographer for the House apparently lost it Wednesday night as lawmakers passed a government funding and debt limit deal, Roll Call reports. The stenographer began shouting about God and the Freemasons as the vote took place.

""He will not be mocked. He will not be mocked. Don't touch me. He will not be mocked,"" the stenographer shouted as she was taken away by U.S. Capitol Police. ""The greatest deception here is not 'one nation under God.' It never was. Had it been, it would not have been.""

She went on, ""You cannot serve two masters. Praise be to God, Lord Jesus Christ.""

Lawmakers watched silently as the scene unfolded before them. After the stenographer was removed from the chamber, House members turned to each other.

Racism?,"











The following irresponsible police action reported by KHOU’s Rucks Russell should scare many. Here is the story as reported.

A young 13 year old dancer, Landry Thompson, came to Houston from Oklahoma. She travelled with her two dance instructors over the weekend. The intent of their visit was to train all weekend with some of the best in dance industry.

When they left the studio Saturday night they stopped at a gas station very exhausted as they searched for their lodging. They were trying to locate their hotel on the GPS. Out of nowhere they were surrounded by the Houston police.

The Houston police dragged them out of the car and handcuffed them all.

“I was kind of freaked out and surprised by it,” said Landry Thompson.

“They just pulled us out of the car. Put our hands behind out backs like we were criminals,” said Landry’s dance instructor Emmanuel Hurd. “He asked me; who is the girl? She is my student. I said I have a notarized letter from her parents stating that I have full guardianship over her while we are here.”

Landry Thompson and the instructors said they pleaded with the police and told the police their story repeatedly. It did not matter to the Houston police. Landry Thompson said, “They still put handcuffs on me. And it really scared me. And they put me in the back of the cop car. I was terrified.” Landry Thompson was taken to Protective Services.

“I was horrified. She was with the people I wanted her to be with. She was with people who were safe who I knew would take care of her,” said Her mother, Destiny Thompson. “Yet they had taken her away from those people and now she was in a shelter, wherever she was with people I didn’t know.”

Protective Services told Destiny Thompson that she would have to fly to Houston to get her daughter. After many phone calls with various officials, Landry Thompson was released back into the custody of her dance instructors.

“I would love an apology,” said Landry Thompson’s mother. “They owe her an apology.”

Soon after, the trio was back at the dance studio. They intend to leave Houston on Monday afternoon.

The Houston police (HPD) has not been responding to inquiries as to what happened.

Were Landry Thompson and dance instructors victims of stereotyping and racism?

Why did the Houston police believe they had to react as they did? Does it have anything to do with the young dancer being a young white girl and the two dance instructors being young black males? If the two instructors were white males would the police officers have reacted in the same manner? The dance instructors had notarized document detailing that they were the young girl’s guardian. What else were they expected to do to ensure they would not be treated like common criminals but the productive human beings they are?

“The fact that the president and the vice president are hosting illegal immigrants in the White House while constricting citizen tours and refusing to meet with immigration officers says it all,” Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., said in a statement to FoxNews.com Friday. “The White House will not even grant ICE officers a low-level White House meeting but invites illegal immigrants into the Oval Office.”

Obama and Vice President Biden met Tuesday with eight advocates of immigration legislation, which is making its way through Congress. Three of the participants were listed in the White House readout as having “deferred action” -- a term that means they were granted a reprieve, likely via the administration directive last year that allowed some illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. as children to avoid deportation and seek work authorization.

Some Republicans are open to ultimately granting permanent legal status to these and other undocumented immigrants. But Sessions, and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., both complained that the president is at the same time snubbing the law enforcement officials tasked with enforcing U.S. border policies.

Sessions and Goodlatte sent a letter to Obama Thursday asking why the White House had not responded to repeated requests to meet with representatives from the National ICE Council, the union that represents more than 7,000 customs enforcement officers.

More On This...

According to the letter, the ICE union has been trying to snag a meeting at the White House for three months to discuss the immigration overhaul, to no avail.

“To be effective any immigration reform bill must heed the warnings from our federal immigration agents,” the lawmakers wrote. “Unfortunately, far from being included in the process, ICE officers have been shut out and have even had their day-to-day operations handcuffed by DHS officials to the point of being unable to carry out their sworn duties.”

The White House refutes the claims, though, and says it has made itself available to multiple immigration enforcement officers over the past few months -- if not the ICE union specifically.

On May 14, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and Director of National Drug Control Policy R. Gil Kerlikowske were among administration officials who sat down with law enforcement officers from across the country. During the meeting, Napolitano and Kerlikowske pushed for broad immigration reform and touted the White House’s investments in personnel and technology targeted to keep the borders safe.

The meeting came three months after another Washington gathering with Napolitano and White House Domestic Policy Council Director Cecilia Munoz. In that meeting, Munoz outlined the principles at the heart of Obama’s immigration proposal which included cracking down on employers who hire undocumented workers and creating a pathway to citizenship.

But Chris Crane, president of the ICE union, has made clear dating back to February that he wants his group to be as involved with immigration legislation as other business and advocacy groups have been.

Obama may have other reasons for avoiding a meeting -- members of the union have filed suit against Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, claiming they're being prevented from doing their jobs.

The union has started to actively lobby against the current Senate bill, citing concerns that current gaps in enforcement will only be perpetuated. They were joined this week by the National Citizenship and Immigration Services Council, which represents 12,000 federal immigration officers at the USCIS.

On Tuesday, a Senate committee passed the so-called Gang of Eight immigration bill. The legislation would still have to be approved by the full Senate.

On the House side, Speaker John Boehner and Majority Leader Eric Cantor warned Thursday that they would not rubber-stamp the legislation.

“The House remains committed to fixing our broken immigration system, but we will not simply take up and accept the bill that is emerging in the Senate if it passes,” Boehner and Cantor said in a joint statement."

Neighbors in Connecticut said Ms. Carey had a child, but it was unclear if the toddler in the car was hers.

The chase began at 2:12 p.m. when Ms. Carey, who was driving a black two-door Infiniti with Connecticut plates, tried to ram through a White House checkpoint at 15th and E Streets Northwest. “The guys ran to try to stop her, and she wasn’t going to slow down, so they jumped aside,” said B. J. Campbell, a tourist from Portland, Ore., who was standing near the White House. “One of the guys grabbed one of those little metal fence sections and shoved it in front of her, across the driveway. She hit the brakes slightly and tried to get around it on the right, but the guy shoved it in front of her again, to try to keep her in.”

Mr. Campbell said the woman “hit the gas, ran over the barricade” and hit the officer, who flipped onto the hood of the car and “rolled off into the gutter.”

“After she ran him down, she gunned it, and she just went screaming down Pennsylvania Avenue,” he said. “They were busy calling on their phones, on the radios. It was like poking a hornet nest. There were guys everywhere. I didn’t see anyone with their guns out, but they were sure busy.”"

Shapiro says that TruthRevolt.org is launching by targeting Al Sharpton of MSNBC’s PoliticsNation. Their petition, which will be sent to stockholders and board members of Sharpton’s advertisers, states:

Al Sharpton is one of the greatest race hoaxers and divisive demagogues of the last half-century….Now it’s time to let his advertisers know that we won’t stand for our purchases backing his propaganda. TruthRevolt is leading the fight to inform Sharpton’s financial backers just who Sharpton is – and what the consequences will be for continuing to support his race-baiting.

TruthRevolt.org has launched a Twitter campaign to tweet @RitzCrackers with hashtag #SharptonsCrackers.

The Daily Beast reports:

The first Sharpton sponsor the group is targeting is Ritz Crackers, owned by Chicago-based Mondelez International. Shapiro said Truth Revolt chose Mondelez because it bills itself as a “family-friendly company” and because it was one of the few advertisers to respond to the group’s inquiries about why it supports the Sharpton show.

As part of its response, Mondelez International said in a statement to Truth Revolt: “At Mondelez International we demonstrate our commitment to responsible corporate citizenship by participating in programs that best serve a wide range of local communities and their interests and needs. We extend our responsibility to the sponsorship of tasteful, believable television programming and we avoid sponsorship of programs that would be unacceptable in terms of generally accepted social or community standards.”

Shapiro says, “If anyone believes that Al Sharpton is tasteful and believable, they are delusional. The American people must wake Sharpton’s advertisers to their delusions. This is war – and for the left, the shock troops are those in the media who live off of advertiser and donor dollars. We must not be afraid to go after their funding sources. And we will.”"

It tends to confirm findings by political scientists that ideological voting is less common on federal appeals courts than on the Supreme Court. And it illustrates the breadth and importance of the District of Columbia Circuit’s docket.

It may also undercut the Republican critique that the court is underworked. As a matter of raw numbers, there is some support for the charge. But it fails to take account of the court’s distinctive docket.

“Comparing the number of cases it hears to other courts just doesn’t work,” said Eric M. Fraser, an author, with three colleagues, of a new study of the court’s work to be published in the Cornell Journal of Law and Public Policy. Mr. Fraser is a former law clerk to Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg, who was appointed to the District of Columbia Circuit by Reagan.

On the one hand, the study found, “a typical federal appellate judge may expect to participate in nearly three times the number of merits cases per year than a judge on the D.C. Circuit” — 168 versus 495 in a recent year, by one measure.

On the other hand, Mr. Fraser said, “the types of cases and the types of opinions the court issues are very different.”

Tracey E. George, an expert on the federal appeals courts who teaches law and political science at Vanderbilt University, said assessing judicial productivity was hard.

PolitiFact rated two of her claims during her CPAC speech last Saturday as “pants on fire” false. The first was that 70 cents of every dollar that’s supposed to go to the poor actually goes to salaries and pensions of bureaucrats. The second was that scientists could have a cure for Alzheimer’s in 10 years if it were not for “a cadre of overzealous regulators, excessive taxation and greedy litigators.”

She also said during that speech that President Obama was living “a lifestyle that is one of excess” in the White House, detailing how many chefs he had, and so on.

The Washington Post gave that claim four Pinocchios, and pointed out that “during last year’s G.O.P. presidential race, Bachmann racked up the highest ratio of Four-Pinocchio comments, so just about everything she says needs to be checked and double-checked before it is reported.”

And in a speech Thursday on the House floor, she said of the federal health care law:

“The American people, especially vulnerable women, vulnerable children, vulnerable senior citizens, now get to pay more and they get less. That’s why we’re here, because we’re saying let’s repeal this failure before it literally kills women, kills children, kills senior citizens.”

Factcheck.org pointed out that her “facts” didn’t match her hyperbole.

It noted arrests in Saudi Arabia, which prohibits all faiths except Islam, and in Iran, where adherents of Bahaism faced arbitrary arrests and imprisonment. In Pakistan, blasphemy laws “have been abused to settle personal disputes and silence legitimate political discourse,” the report said. It cited the widely publicized case of Rimsha Masih, a Christian girl who faced blasphemy charges last year that were dropped only after national and international protests.

Another troubling new trend the report cited was growing religious intolerance in countries that have experienced at least nominally democratic transitions. Egypt, Tunisia and Libya — all countries that have overthrown autocratic governments with American support since 2011 — adopted restrictive new laws or carried out prosecutions against minority faiths.

Egypt’s new Constitution prohibits “undermining or subjecting to prejudice all messengers and prophets,” but does not extend explicit protections to Christianity or Judaism. Defamation against all three major faiths – Islam, Christianity and Judaism — was explicitly prohibited by statute under the rule of Hosni Mubarak. The constitution declares Islam the official state religion, and it recognizes Christianity and Judaism in personal and religious matters. Egypt’s new government, dominated by members of the Muslim Brotherhood, also has done little to prosecute those involved in religious violence against Christians, creating an atmosphere of impunity that the report noted in many countries facing strife among different believers.

The report is an annual exercise to highlight the priority of religious freedom in American foreign policy. Freedom of religion is not “an American invention,” Mr. Kerry said, but rather a “universal value.”

“And when necessary, yes, it does directly call out some of our close friends, as well as some countries with whom we seek stronger ties, and it does so in order to try to make progress, even though we know it may cause some discomfort,” Mr. Kerry said, referring to the report. “But when countries undermine or attack religious freedom, they not only unjustly threaten those whom they target. They also threaten their countries’ own stability.”"

From the Arizona Republic:

Obama foes at one point sang, ""Bye Bye Black Sheep,"" a derogatory reference to the president's skin color, while protesters like Deanne Bartram raised a sign saying, ""Impeach the Half-White Muslim!""

The Republic reported that hundreds of people gathered outside Desert Vista High School as Obama unveiled a plan to overhaul the nation's mortgage finance system. Some protesters came from Obama's left, urging him to reject the Keystone XL oil pipeline and take other actions on climate change. But a prevailing theme among many in the protest appeared to be issues of race. Some even suggested that Obama himself was to blame for racial tensions.

“We have gone back so many years,” Judy Burris told the Republic, arguing Obama had taken the nation back to pre-Civil Rights era levels of racism. “He’s divided all the races. I hate him for that.”

Others carried signs calling for Obama to be impeached, Tucson News Now reported, though despite the negativity, the majority of those in attendance were Obama fans.

Inside, Obama's speech focused primarily on the housing market, though he did at one point attempt to link his proposal to immigration reform, arguing that Congress -- which is now in recess -- could help housing prices rebound by finalizing legislation that has already been passed by the Senate."

It was the loss of working class voters in swing states that cost us the 2012 election, not the Hispanic vote.... You disrespect Hispanics with your assumption that they desire ignoring the rule of law.”

— Former Alaska governor Sarah Palin (R) in a Facebook post titled “Great Job, GOP Establishment, June 28, 2013

Given how many variables can affect a national election, it is sometimes foolhardy to suggest one group or another swung the election. For instance, President Obama and former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney split 49-49 percent among heterosexuals, while Obama overwhelmingly (76-22 percent) won the votes of gays. But just focusing on that fact would ignore the efforts made by Obama to reach out to other groups to build his winning coalition.

Palin’s comment, posted in response to bipartisan passage of a comprehensive immigration bill in the Senate, struck us as interesting because it assumed Romney lost the so-called Reagan Democrats and that Hispanic voters do not favor a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. What do the data show? (We were assisted by Scott Clement, analyst at The Washington Post’s Capital Insight, in finding some of these data.)

The Facts

First of all, there have been a whole series of polls asking Hispanics about their views on overhauling immigration laws. Excluding advocacy polls with loaded questions, there is a consensus that Hispanics overwhelmingly support a path to citizenship. Here are two key samples:

Voter exit poll, 2012: 77 percent of Hispanics believe illegal immigrants should be offered a chance to apply for legal status.

WSJ-NBC poll, April 2013: 82 percent of Hispanics either strongly favor or somewhat favor a pathway to citizenship.

The 2012 exit poll of voters also found that Americans, by a margin of 65 to 29 percent, believe illegal immigrants should be offered a chance to apply for legal status. The WSJ-NBC poll found 64 percent of all Americans favor a pathway to citizenship.

Okay, so a core part of Palin’s assumption is just simply wrong. What about her notion that the loss of “working class voters” in swing states cost the GOP the election? That is a bit more fuzzy, in part because it depends on the definition of “working class” — Clement says there are a dozen different ways to define the term — but Palin’s reasoning is also debatable.

The most basic way to define a working-class voter is someone who lacks a college degree. In 2012, Obama won 51 percent of the national popular vote among non-college voters, 50 percent among college voters. The gap, in fact, has been fairly narrow over the last eight elections, with Democrats doing better among non-college voters than college graduates four times, Republicans four times.

But note that Palin referred to “Reagan Democrats.” This generally refers to white working-class Northern voters. Again, there are different ways to slice this. The National Journal has a handy interactive which allows you to examine the results of the elections between 1980 and 2008, slicing and dicing various categories.

You can see that Republicans already had an edge among white non-college voters — but not among white Democratic non-college voters. Even Reagan lost those voters by a margin of 68 to 27 percent, and the gap only increased in later elections. In fact, many of statistics showing how poorly Democrats do among white voters change substantially when Southern voters are removed; Democrats are competitive with Republicans in winning white voters, especially working-class voters, in New England, the Midwest and the West Coast.

Palin specifically mentioned the loss of Reagan Democrats in swing states. Let’s take a look at Ohio, the ultimate swing state, which Obama won 51 to 48 percent. Using an interactive that shows the difference between 2008 and 2012, you can see that Romney improved over John McCain’s share of white voters, by 5 percentage points, and among people with incomes of less than $30,000 a year; Obama slightly improved among voters with no college degree.

So why did Romney lose even after apparently improving his share of white working class voters? The reason is that white voters made up a smaller percentage of the overall vote in Ohio, falling four percentage points to 79 percent, while the African American vote increased four percentage points, to 15 percent.

A similar dynamic took place in Pennsylvania, where Obama experienced a six percentage point decline in the share of the white vote, but still won because Latinos and other voters of color increased their share of the vote — and went overwhelmingly for the president.

Another key swing state was Colorado, where again Obama lost ground among white voters but minority voters bolstered their share of the electorate and carried the president to victory. In Colorado, Obama’s share of the Hispanic vote was an astonishing 87 percent. (These figures come from an interesting analysis, “The Obama Coalition in the 2012 Election and Beyond,” by Ruy Teixeira and John Halpin.)

Overall, in fact, Obama lost ground among white working-class voters, garnering 36 percent in 2012, compared to 40 percent in 2008, according to a recent article in the New Republic by Teixeira and Andrew Levison. The article notes that even these results may have been distorted by unique events, giving Obama a greater share of such voters than might ordinarily be expected: “In 2008 the financial crisis and a desire to ‘clean house’ boosted white working class support for Obama. In 2012, the GOP fielded a uniquely aloof and unsympathetic Republican candidate.”

In a fascinating article titled “The Case of the Missing White Voters, Revisited,” for Real Clear Politics, Sean Trende concludes, based on population growth, that there were about 6 million white voters who failed to come to the polls. He identifies them as “H. Ross Perot voters” — largely downscale, Northern, rural whites. That may not be quite the same as “Reagan Democrats,” but close enough.

But Trende also concludes that these missing voters, by themselves, were not enough to cost Romney the election because he would have needed to win almost 90 percent of these votes; Trende estimated that Romney at best would have won 70 percent.

The Pinocchio Test

Even given the different ways one can slice poll data, we see little evidence for Palin’s assertions.

If anything, Obama did more poorly among white working-class voters in 2012 than in 2008, even in key swing states. Palin could be talking about the fact that not as many anticipated white voters showed up at the polls, but as Trende shows, even if those missing voters had cast ballots, it would not have made a difference in 2012 election result.

Meanwhile, her claim on Hispanic voters is not borne out by the data that show overwhelming support for policies that would provide a path to citizenship.

The response made clear that she maintains huge political capital with the conservative base.

She also hit Obama for his and the first lady's many appearances on television.

""Remember no-drama Obama? If only. Now it’s all-drama Obama,"" Palin said. ""We don’t have leadership coming out of Washington. We have reality television. Except it’s really bad TV, and America tuned out a long time ago.”

Turning to guns, Palin criticized the background-checks bill that passed through a Senate committee this week and Obama's push for more gun control.

“More background checks?"" Palin said. ""Dandy idea, Mr. President. Shoulda started with yours.”

Palin reserved some of her jabs for other politicians, though, focusing specifically on New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg's (I) ban on sugary beverages over 16 ounces -- she paused to take a sip of a Big Gulp midway through her speech, mugging while the crowd applauded -- and Karl Rove's effort to find more electable Republican candidates.

Without naming Rove, Palin said that the architects of the GOP's nascent electability effort should ""come back to the Lone Star State and put their name on the ballot."" (Rove is from Texas and got his start in that state's politics.)

Obama was the biggest target of Palin's speech, though, and she got her biggest applause lines when she took on the incumbent president, often addressing him directly.

“You won. We get it. Now step away from the teleprompter and do your job,"" she said."

But this week, Lewinsky is back in the headlines after the National Enquirer claimed it had obtained a ""sex tape"" recorded for Clinton by Lewinsky around November 1997.

In typical tabloid style, the magazine describes the ""bombshell"" tape as ""steamy"" and ""sensational,"" and claims it obtained the audio from a source who disobeyed orders to destroy it.

""I was supposed to shred everything in late 1998,"" the unnamed ""cleaner"" told the National Enquirer. ""But for some reason I kept this material.""

According to CNN, Lewinsky and Clinton began their sexual relationship in November of 1995, two years before this tape was allegedly recorded. The scandal broke in 1998, however, after Linda Tripp contacted the office of Whitewater Independent Counsel Ken Starr and revealed she had recorded Lewinsky allegedly talking about the affair.

The magazine also published what it says is a complete transcript of the allegedly 3 minute, 47 second audiotape.

""Hi handsome,"" the reported transcript begins. ""I couldn't bear the idea of sitting down to write you another note. So I though I would tape it, hope that's ok.""

In the transcript, Lewinsky goes on to say she has ""two proposals"" for Clinton, ""neither of which is you not seeing me.""

""You can't refuse me because I'm too cute and adorable and soon I won't be here anymore to pop over,"" she continues, according to the transcript. ""I could take all my clothes off and start... well.. I know you wouldn't enjoy that? But, I hope to see you later, and I hope you will just follow my script and do what I want.""

Although the National Enquirer is often written off as a salacious spreader of gossip and unsubstantiated tall tales, it should be noted that the tabloid has broken some national scandals -- perhaps most notably one-time presidential candidate John Edward's 2006 affair."

The US government has begun a partial shutdown after the two houses of Congress failed to agree a new budget.

The Republican-led House of Representatives insisted on delaying President Barack Obama's healthcare reform - dubbed Obamacare - as a condition for passing a bill.

More than 800,000 federal employees face unpaid leave with no guarantee of back pay once the deadlock is over, as certain agencies and national parks also close.

Under the US presidential system, different branches of government can be controlled by opposing parties. Currently the Senate is controlled by the Democrats, while the Republicans control the House of Representatives.

This legislative conflict has led to the current gridlock and subsequent partial shutdown of government, the first for 17 years.

With the US political system seemingly in legislative paralysis, is American politics broken? Experts give their views below.

Darrell M West, vice president of Governance Studies at the Brookings Institution

The problem with American politics is that Tea Party activists have taken over the Republican Party.

They come from small, rural districts and now are demanding that House Speaker John Boehner practises extremist politics.

Boehner could end this stalemate today by allowing a continuing resolution to go to the floor for a vote without repealing Obamacare. It would pass and this crisis would be resolved.

However, conservatives have warned that if Mr Boehner allows a floor vote without their support, they will depose him and elect another Speaker.

This crisis is not so much a governability problem as a war within the Republican Party. It won't be resolved until prominent Republicans demand that the House takes action.

media caption What does shutdown mean for two million federal employees, agencies and tourist destinations?

Prof Iwan Morgan, head of US Programmes at the Institute of the Americas, University College London

""Broken"" is a very strong word. In one way American politics is working exactly how the founding fathers intended when they created the separation of powers.

But they always assumed that at times of need, the ""energy"" of government would overcome the separation of government. They never anticipated that there would be this polarisation of politics.

We're now in a situation where the intentions of the founders are being overcome by the nature of the political parties and the lack of middle ground between them, so you could say American politics is broken.

I don't think it's irreparable but you now have to have a supermajority [60 out of 100] in the Senate [to pass legislation], and the Republicans showed in 2009-10 how the lack of 60 Democrats in the Senate could be exploited to tie up the work of the upper house.

I don't imagine the Democrats will lie down and play dead even were the Republicans to become the single party of government in 2016.

Angelia R Wilson, professor of politics at the University of Manchester

Charges that America is broken are a longstanding trope of the US Christian Right. Such charges harken back to a fictitious 1950s shared cultural values.

Employing this measure, changes of the last 60 years indicate that American is ""broken"". But that fictitious narrative fails to include those on the socio-economic margins eg women, African-Americans, Latinos, and LGBTs, who are now moving at pace into the mainstream.

For these benefactors of change, America is not broken - it is increasingly realising its potential as a representative democracy based on justice and equality.

Change has left those previously occupying places of privilege outraged.

With more states allowing same-sex marriage, the working class accessing affordable healthcare, immigration reform afoot and a black man in the White House, the Tea Party has had enough. This government shutdown is not the culmination of their outrage, it is only a beginning.

Chris Edwards, editor of the Cato Institute's website DownsizingGovernment.org

There's no doubt that the federal budget process is broken, and there is wide acceptance of that. The federal budget system doesn't work. Congress hasn't passed a regular budget in many years now, [instead] they've appropriated money based on continuing resolutions and other special procedures.

The instability caused by the Obamacare health law is because it was passed in 2010 on a wholly partisan basis. Not a single Republican voted for the law in either the House or the Senate.

In recent decades the most enduring federal legislation has been bipartisan. So I would blame President Obama for ramming through legislation that only his party supported.

The battle over Obamacare is unique and has been poisoned, initially by President Obama.

That said, it used to be that both parties had both liberal and conservatives. But over the last few decades the Republican Party has become more conservative and the Democratic Party has moved far to the left.

Prof Stefan Halper, director of American studies at the University of Cambridge

In the UK, where you have a parliamentary system, if the prime minister's party loses a floor vote in parliament you have to have a new election - it's a vote of no confidence.

In the US, we have a situation where the administration's proposed policies can be blockaded by a minority in either House of Congress - and that can bring the government to a standstill.

The unusual thing in this case is that this radical faction, the Tea Party, have chosen to use the national budget [and] are demanding that the healthcare programme be modified or abandoned in return for funding government.

It's a form of political extortion.

It is broadly unacceptable to the American people, and the Tea Party will be hurt by it.

The system is stretched, the system is challenged. But the system itself is not broken. Eventually public pressure will come to play on the Republicans and will force them to accept some compromise solution. Both sides must find a face-saving way through this conundrum.

The House Speaker, Mr Boehner, has chosen not to confront the radical minority in his party, but rather to accommodate them.

A stronger or more principled House leader would've said ""enough is enough"". But he hasn't done that. So another reason the system is not broken is because it is a personality in a critical position who is not doing his job properly.

Hans A von Spakovsky, manager of the Election Law Reform Initiative at the Heritage Foundation

I don't think the system is broken, the system works. The problem right now is that the two political parties, who are fairly evenly matched in political support across the country, are having a crucial argument about the direction of the country.

This is not unusual; there have been prior times in American history where there have been substantive and critical fights over different issues.

We have an out of control federal budget, we have a gigantic deficit, and we're having a critical debate over what to do about those problems.

I don't think there is a serious structural problem in the US political system, we've just come to a fork in the road about the direction that the country should move in. The system is handling it, we're just at loggerheads over what to do about it - in particular where we should go with the growth and size of the federal government.

John E Owens, professor of US government and politics at University of Westminster

The [shutdown] goes to the basic structural problem in the US constitution.

It's a separated system with separate institutions sharing in power, so that means that each of the major institutions of national government can exercise a veto against any decision they don't like - and that's exactly what's happening.

Historically compromise has usually been available. [But] now you have an extremist group in the Republican Party holding the system to ransom.

What you have seen over the last 20 years in Congress is a kind of procedural arms race, and this is the latest example of it - one party, and it's usually the Republicans, finding some procedural device, [and] attaching this rider to a resolution to throw a spanner in the works and stop the government working."

Monday morning began with the top spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) accusing House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) of having a “credibility problem” for denying that a “clean” spending bill — one without any proposals to alter the healthcare law — could win a bipartisan majority in the House.

The tête-à-tête between leadership aides comes as lawmakers return from their one day off this weekend with only a light schedule. While the Senate holds votes on a pair of lower-court nominations, the House will vote on another in a series of targeted spending bills they’ve offered to resume certain high-profile government functions, this time the Food and Drug Administration.

FULL COVERAGE: The U.S. government shutdown

The House voted unanimously Saturday to provide back pay for hundreds of thousands of furloughed federal workers. They’ve also voted to resume veterans benefits and a supplemental nutrition program for women, infants and children (known as WIC), pay National Guard members and reservists, reopen national parks and museums, and fund the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

Despite the “rifle-shot” approach to extend funding in certain areas, Boehner said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week” that “there are not the votes in the House to pass a clean CR” — or continuing resolution, a broader government funding bill.

“We’re interested in having a conversation about how we open the government and how we begin to pay our bills. But it begins with a simple conversation,” Boehner said, criticizing what he called President Obama’s “my way or the highway” approach.

“That’s what he’s saying. Complete surrender and then we’ll talk to you,” the speaker said.

Adam Jentleson, the Reid spokesman, pointed to reports indicating as many as two dozen Republicans could join a near-unanimous Democratic minority to pass a clean spending bill.

“There is now a consistent pattern of Speaker Boehner saying things that fly in the face of the facts or stand at odds with his past actions,” Jentleson said. “Today, Speaker Boehner should stop the games and let the House vote on the Senate’s clean CR so that the entire federal government can reopen within 24 hours.”

Michael Steel, Boehner’s spokesman, said the shutdown was caused by Democrats’ refusal to negotiate. “It’s time for some Washington Democrat to step up, act like an adult, and start talking about how we reopen the government, provide fairness for the American people under Obamacare and deal with the drivers of our debt and deficits.”

(CNN) —

Chiara de Blasio, daughter of New York City Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio, has struggled with clinical depression and drug abuse, the 19-year-old revealed in a YouTube video posted Christmas Eve.

“I’ve had depression, like clinical depression, for my entire adolescence,” de Blasio says in the video. “It made it easier, the more I drank and did drugs, to share some common ground with people that I wouldn’t have. It didn’t start out as a huge thing for me but then it became a really huge thing for me.”

In the video, de Blasio speaks about drinking and smoking marijuana when she was in college, as well as the outpatient treatment that started her on the road to recovery.

De Blasio’s father sailed to a landslide victory last month over Republican candidate Joe Lhota to become New York’s first Democratic mayor in more than 20 years. One key to his victory was a connection with voters, formed in part via his mixed-race family, particularly his son, Dante, and wife, Chirlane McCray, who played a prominent role on the campaign trail.

Chiara’s story has until now stayed out of the public eye.

“As parents, our instinct has been to protect our daughter and privately help her through a deeply personal struggle,” her parents said in an e-mail to supporters that linked to the video. “But not only has Chiara committed to her own health, she is also committed to helping young people everywhere who face similar challenges.”

Professionally shot and edited, the YouTube video was released under an account bearing Chiara de Blasio’s name. It directs viewers to visit ok2talk.org, an organization that encourages youth who struggle with mental illness to talk about their experiences.

According to the video, Chiara de Blasio has completed treatment and is now trying to reach out to others.

“It’s just important for people to realize, anybody who is watching this, that if you’re suffering and if you’re depressed, you’re dealing with mental illness, and you think that it might have something to do with your drug abuse or drinking, or if you’re just suffering from both of those at the same time and you think that they’re completely unrelated to one another,” she says, “getting sober is always a positive thing.”

De Blasio makes minimal reference to her parents, not naming either and mentioning only that both were “very emotionally committed to try to figure out some way to get me better.”

Participating in her father’s campaign after completing treatment “was like the greatest thing ever,” de Blasio says, although she doesn’t specify that it was the mayoral race.

White House Drug Policy Director Gil Kerlikowske issued a statement Tuesday afternoon praising the young de Blasio for speaking out.

“Chiara is giving a voice to the millions who suffer from substance use and mental health disorders, and we encourage others to join her,” he said.

“By talking about addiction in the light of day – and by celebrating recovery out loud – we can help correct the misinformation and stigma that too often become obstacles for the millions of Americans who deserve to live healthy, productive lives,” Kerlikowske said.

De Blasio decided to speak out “because people are suffering from this disease and dying from this disease every day. And we really can’t do anything as a society to help those people until we start talking about it,” she says. “And nobody can do sobriety on their own.”"

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Unfortunately for the White House, the American people are not (for the most part) stupid; they immediately saw the ""deal"" for what it is—a smokescreen.

And so, this week, the administration was forced to up its game.

By arranging the calendar in such a way that Thanksgiving and the start of Hanukkah fell on the same day, they hoped to finally put Obama's second-term woes behind them.

However, all they ended up doing is proving how awesome modern conservatism is.

His Latest Book Is', 'Code Red', 'How Progressives', 'Moderates Can Unite To Save Our Country.']",E.J. Dionne: Obama needs to ask himself why even his supporters are growing impatient,"President Obama got roughed up by the pundit class last week. The question is what lessons he draws from the going-over. Here’s one he should take: The nation’s political conversation has grown stale, and many Americans have lost the sense of what he is doing to improve their lives.

You can argue that this perception isn’t fair. The Affordable Care Act, if it’s implemented well, will improve a lot of lives. The economy is adding jobs, not shedding them. The deficit is coming down. Two front-burner initiatives, immigration reform and broader background checks for guns — yes, they’ll be voted on again — really do matter.

But the fact is that the talk in Washington has been dominated by the same stuff we obsessed over in 2010, 2011 and 2012: a monotonous, uninspiring, insider clash over budgets. Even in that context, we barely discuss what government can do that would be helpful (except to air travelers).

Obama’s defenders say that D.C. dysfunction should be laid at the feet of Republicans in Congress who are so invested in his failure that they even vote against things they are for. That’s what Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) says happened on background checks.

Rather than criticize the president, says former chief White House speechwriter Jon Favreau, those who want him to succeed need to hold Republicans in the House and Senate accountable. The president can’t do it by himself, Favreau said in the Daily Beast. He needs help from his supporters.

Well, sure. To pretend that the president can magically get an increasingly right-wing Republican House and Senate contingent to do his bidding is either naive or willfully misleading. The GOP really does hope that blocking whatever Obama wants will steadily weaken him.

But the president also needs to ask himself why even his supporters are growing impatient. His whole budget strategy, after all, is directed almost entirely toward gently coaxing Republicans his way, without any concern as to whether what he is doing is demobilizing the very people he needs on his side now.

When, in pursuit of tax reform, he explicitly offered a compromise to change the index that determines Social Security benefits as part of his budget, he did so against the advice of many of his most loyal backers in Congress. That includes Democrats who would be willing to vote for that cut to Social Security benefits as part of a serious budget deal. But they insist that such a major step toward the Republicans should be taken only in return for concrete concessions from them on the need for more revenue.

If Obama wants to underscore that his problem is Republican obstruction, he should tell those GOP senators he likes to dine with that they need to come up with revenue very soon or else he’ll withdraw that “chained CPI” offer he claims not to like much anyway. Put up or shut up is a cliche, but a useful one.

Similarly, it’s worth asking why so many of Obama’s initiatives have dropped out of public view. Obama has called for raising the minimum wage to $9 an hour. Many Democrats in Congress think, correctly, that it should be set at $10. Would it be so hard for Obama to come out fighting for the minimum-wage increase — and for other steps to bolster the incomes of those stuck at the bottom of the economy? Why not expose that none of this is happening because of GOP opposition?

Obama wants to provide universal pre-K education. That ought to be a bipartisan idea. Many Republican governors have embraced the concept in their states. Shouldn’t the president be pushing harder to get it on the media’s radar by way of forcing a debate in Congress?

The president believes we need to spend more on our infrastructure to boost job creation now and to make us competitive for the long run. He’s right. But he needs to make clear it is something that’s genuinely important to him.

It’s true that Obama spoke about both his investment agenda and preschool plans at last week’s much-maligned news conference. And the White House announced on Sunday that he would embark on a series of “middle class jobs and opportunity tours.” These should be shaped by a consistent, driving theme: that the stakes in this debate are larger than the day-to-day drone of partisan invective suggests.

Remember the Mark Twain line that Wagner’s music was better than it sounded? Obama’s program has more to do with growth and opportunity than he usually lets on. If he wants to rally us, he might want to change that.

The presidential library could transform whatever community is chosen as its site

Chicago politicians and activists make pitches to locate Obama%27s library in their neighborhoods

The University of Hawaii is also launching a bid

CHICAGO — President Obama probably won't make a final decision on where his presidential library and museum will be located until near the end of his second term in the White House.

But here In his adopted hometown — particularly the neighborhoods where Obama made a name for himself as a community organizer before entering politics — the issues of race and class play a central role in the debate over where in the city the shrine to the first African-American president's legacy belongs.

""I think he has certainly benefited from his ties to the African-American community in terms of how of how he built his political career,"" said John Owens, a community organizer on the city's South Side who worked closely with a young Obama when he arrived in Chicago in the 1980s. ""I am not saying that he owes everything to the African-American community, but he did get his start here, and this community was his political base. This is an opportunity for him to help the community where he started from.""

There's no guarantee that Obama will even settle on the Windy City to host the library and museum. The president grew up in Honolulu, and the University of Hawaii has launched its own bid to win the library. The state has set aside one of the last undeveloped oceanfront plots in Honolulu to try to lure Obama.

What is clear to politicians and activists here is that the library has the potential to offer a huge economic boom that could transform whatever community the president settles on.

The William J. Clinton Presidential Library and Museum spurred $1 billion in real estate investment in downtown Little Rock. The George W. Bush Presidential Center on the Southern Methodist University campus, which opened in April, is projected to inject $50 million annually into the local economy, said Phillip Jones, chief executive officer of the Dallas Visitors and Convention Bureau.

It's that potential that draws activists and politicians in Obama's old stomping grounds to make the case that the president should remember the economically deprived neighborhoods he sought to change as a young man.

The University of Illinois-Chicago — the state's second-largest university on the city's Near West Side — confirmed last week that it has launched an exploratory committee to see how it might persuade Obama to build his library there. University officials declined to speak in detail about the effort.

Chicago State University, which is in the heart of the South Side neighborhood where Obama worked as a community organizer in the 1980s, announced in May it would make a spirited pitch to Obama that the school — a historically black university that draws students from some of the city's most impoverished communities — was the perfect place for Obama to bring his library.

Wayne Watson, Chicago State's president, recruited former state senator Emil Jones, who served as Obama's mentor when he was in the state Legislature, to join the exploratory committee. Watson dispatched one of his deans to Washington to talk to National Archives officials about the process and to Little Rock to pick the brains of the Clinton library officials.

The area around Chicago State, which has an unemployment rate that hovers around 30% and is among the city's most violent neighborhoods, would be resurrected by the economic jolt that would come from the hotels, restaurants and other economic development that would follow the library, Watson said.

""His political roots are right here on the South Side, pretty much in a 2-mile radius of where we are,"" Watson said. ""Secondly, President Obama represents hope. … If there is one community in Chicago that needs to have hope reinforced, it's the community where the president got his start.""

The private University of Chicago, a leafy island in the city's Hyde Park neighborhood on the hard-scrabble South Side, is running a quiet campaign for the library with the assistance of Susan Sher, a former chief of staff to first lady Michelle Obama.

The Obamas have deep ties to the university. The president worked there for 12 years as a senior lecturer at its law school, and the first lady served as an executive at the university's medical center. In addition to Sher, David Axelrod, Obama's former political adviser, was hired by the university to lead a program intended to encourage students' interest in politics and public service.

The university declined to comment about its bid, saying it is premature to discuss the library. Sher and other university leaders have met with officials at the National Archives and Records Administration and have visited with officials at the recently opened George W. Bush library in Dallas.

Don Rose, a Chicago political consultant, said the University of Chicago has a long, complicated history with the surrounding poor and working-class African-American communities that have been pushed out as the university has expanded over the years. Rose suggested that the university, with its deep ties to the Obamas and proximity to downtown, is the favorite to win the library.

""From a practical sense, the University of Chicago seems like the logical choice,"" Rose said. ""But on the other hand, if he wanted to make a bolder stroke, he could place it elsewhere on the South Side.""

Anthony Beale, an alderman on the city's far South Side, said Obama choosing the University of Chicago — which boasted a $6.57 billion endowment at the end of the past fiscal year — was tantamount to ""fattening up the frog.""

""I think it would send a wonderful message if he could bring it on home and reward the community where he got his start rather than just giving it to the University of Chicago that already has everything,"" said Beale, who is on the Chicago State University exploratory committee.

Beale advocates for the project to be built a few miles off the Chicago State campus on the grounds of the dilapidated George Pullman state historic site, where the relics of the 19th-century sleeper car factory sit behind a chain-link fence.

Lester Coney, who helped raise more than $1 million for Obama's two presidential campaigns, has suggested building the library on yet another site on the South Side, the grounds of the former U.S. Steel plant , an enormous site several miles south of downtown that developers are eyeing to turn into a residential and retail hub.

Coney said the University of Chicago — with its political clout and track record on handling projects of this magnitude — is the right partner for Obama to work with on the library, ""but I just struggle with seeing it as the right place to have that grand effect that his library can have.""

Some residents in the city's Bronzeville neighborhood — an area steeped in the city's blues and jazz scene — want the library to be built on the site of a shuttered hospital.

The site, near the McCormick Place convention center and about 2 miles north of the University of Chicago, had been floated as the site to build the Olympic Village when the city made an unsuccessful bid for the 2016 Olympics.

More recently, during a community meeting, developers floated the possibility of building a casino there, said Harold Lucas, president of the Black Metropolis Convention & Tourism Council.

""Obama came to Chicago to learn how to be a community organizer,"" said Lucas, who wants the presidential library to be built on the old hospital site. ""If he's truly that, the least he could do is put the presidential library somewhere in the black community where it can act as a catalyst."""

USA TODAY

USA TODAY Review%3A ** out of four

Stars%3A Armie Hammer%2C Johnny Depp%2C Helena Bonham Carter%2C Tom Wilkinson%2C William Fichtner

Rated PG-13%3B runtime%3A 2 hours%2C 29 minutes%3B opens limited Tuesday night and nationwide on Wednesday

The Lone Ranger might as well be Pirates of the Caribbean run aground in the dusty wild west.

Director Gore Verbinski has choreographed a movie (** out of four; rated PG-13; opening Tuesday night in some theaters and Wednesday nationwide) too similar in style and energy to his high-seas franchise films. The likeness is intensified by Johnny Depp's turn as Tonto, who seems related to Jack Sparrow, at least in the smirking comic relief department.

That's not to say Depp isn't good in the role — he's the best thing about the movie. But it's a 2½-hour slog, with tonal inconsistencies and monotonous, drawn-out action sequences. Scenes alternate between frenetic and tedious.

Armie Hammer plays the legendary hero as the alter ego of lawman John Reid. In his spotless white hat, he cuts a dashing figure. But it's a mystery why Verbinski makes the audience wait more than 2 hours for the money shot and signature tune. When the masked fighter of injustice finally gallops triumphantly on his white stallion to the blaring strains of William Tell's overture it feels long overdue.

By this point the audience has had to endure a bloated tale of bad guys robbing, shooting and blowing up trains and good guys trying to fend them off and forestall disaster.

The movie's framing device kicks in early and often.

A boy wanders into a traveling carnival exhibition in 1933 and encounters a desert tableau with a sign that reads ""The Noble Savage."" What appears to be a statue of an aged Native American comes to life before the incredulous lad's eyes. The elderly fellow recounts a yarn of derring-do, set 60 years previously. The storyteller is none other than the all-but-forgotten octogenarian Tonto, played poignantly by Depp underneath effectively rendered makeup.

But then it cuts to the convoluted, overstuffed adventure. Prosecutor John Reid meets Tonto when they're shackled together on a train by gun-slinging villains. This yoking leads to an intricately choreographed escape and sets up an expectation for rollicking fun. But their ensuing escapades never come off as entertaining as that initial go-round.

Too much is thrown at the audience. A couple of villains do their darnedest to amp up the tension. There's the deformed outlaw Butch Cavendish (William Fichtner), then the slicker Latham Cole (Tom Wilkinson), a railroad executive with megalomaniacal intentions. Along the way, the pair stop at a house of ill repute and meet Helena Bonham Carter as a ginger-haired madam packing heat in a wooden leg.

With his clean-cut good looks, Hammer is appealing as Reid/Lone Ranger. Avowedly anti-gun, he proclaims the law as his religion. Reid becomes the reluctant sole ranger after his ranger brother Dan (James Badge Dale) and a team of other law enforcers are killed by Cavendish. Reid's dreams of due process must be set aside.

The movie's titular character is second fiddle to Depp's slyly clever Tonto in this reboot. That would seem a reasonable storytelling device, but their bond never feels fully developed. It's as if their sense of loyalty is modified for a contemporary, self-centered era.

Geographic and historical details are glossed over. The distinctive rocky Utah desert landscape subs in for Texas, and the Lone Ranger actually utters the modern over-used action phrase ""Let's do this."" Was that necessary?

The Lone Ranger is a boisterous, relentless production, long on action but short on fun."

Rep. Steve Stockman (R-Texas), who claimed earlier this year that he'd be willing to file articles of impeachment over Obama's gun control push, addressed the development in a statement, stressing that Nugent would be available for media interviews after Obama's speech.

""I am excited to have a patriot like Ted Nugent joining me in the House Chamber to hear from President Obama,"" the congressman said. ""After the address I'm sure Ted will have plenty to say.""

Nugent has been one of Obama's most inflammatory critics, taking an increasingly combative tone in the wake of the president's new push to reduce gun violence. He drew nationwide backlash for comments made last year in which he called for attendees at a National Rifle Association rally to ""ride into that battlefield and chop [Democrats'] heads off in November."" He also said he would be ""dead or in jail by this time next year"" if Obama is re-elected. The Secret Service later visited the entertainer and said they had resolved the issue, but an unbowed Nugent didn't tone down his rhetoric.

There’s no question. It’s the mayor.

Kevin Johnson — K.J. as he became known during his pro basketball playing days — is indisputably the right mayor at the right time.

It’s impossible to imagine any other mayor anywhere — let alone from Sacramento — who would have such entree into the National Basketball Assn. as the city struggles to keep Seattle from pilfering its beloved Kings.

Johnson recently concluded a successful whale-hunting expedition — whale being the synonym for billionaires willing to buy the team and invest in a new downtown arena.

“Whales are not indigenous to Sacramento,” says Chris Lehane, a political consultant who has worked with the mayor on the arena project.

Yes, that has been a huge Sacramento dilemma in its efforts to keep the Kings from bolting — the scarcity of very rich people and lack of a strong corporate base.

But Johnson, 47, a former all-star point guard for the Phoenix Suns, has used his star power and competitive tenacity to keep the Kings alive in the city where he grew up.

“I’m a Sacramentan,” he says. “You don’t ever like to see a team leave a city where you’re from. As a player, I traveled around to 29 other cities and saw how much basketball meant. It was about civic pride and economic development. I saw public-private partnerships work. This can be a game-changer.”

Johnson has recruited an impressive pod of whales:

Beverly Hills investor Ron Burkle, co-owner of the Pittsburgh Penguins hockey team; 24-Hour Fitness founder Mark Mastrov, who once tried to buy the NBA’s Golden State Warriors; Silicon Valley software tycoon Vivek Ranadive, a part owner of the Warriors; and the Jacobs family of San Diego, founders of Qualcomm.

“We have a dream team of investors,” Johnson says.

Ranadive, who emigrated from India with $50 in his pocket, apparently would write the biggest check and be the lead owner. The bidding price hasn’t been announced. But presumably it’s close to Seattle’s offer: $341 million for 65% of the team, placing the franchise’s overall value at $525 million, an NBA record sale price.

Burkle would focus on developing the $448-million, 18,500-seat arena and surrounding office space, housing units, stores and a hotel. The city would contribute $258 million, mostly from parking fees.

At the mayor’s urging, the City Council voted 7 to 2 for the arena deal last week, culminating a decade-long effort to replace the crumbling old barn where the Kings have played for most of their 28 seasons in Sacramento.

The Seattle poachers are led by multibillionaire hedge-fund manager Chris Hansen and Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer. Seattle has been without an NBA team since the SuperSonics fled to Oklahoma City in 2008 and became the Thunder.

The Seattle group already has a signed agreement with the Kings owners — the locally despised Maloof family — to buy the team and ship it. But it’s subject to NBA approval.

“We want the folks of Seattle to get a team,” Johnson told the City Council. “We wish them well. But we want to keep what’s ours.”

Crucial meetings are scheduled in New York on Wednesday between a committee of NBA owners and the two sides. Then all the owners will vote April 18.

Johnson will lead the Sacramento delegation, as he did two years ago when the Maloofs tried to move the Kings to Anaheim. Johnson then was able to persuade the NBA to back down the Maloofs — helped by the fact that the Lakers and Clippers didn’t want more competition for L.A. fans.

“I’ve never seen a more organized, articulate and compassionate speech” than Johnson’s to the NBA owners, says lobbyist, investor and sports junkie Darius Anderson. “He played on every owner’s heartstrings.”

Anderson, a longtime Democratic fundraiser, originally solicited Burkle to buy the Kings two years ago. But the Maloofs angrily insisted the team wasn’t for sale.

The Maloofs then negotiated an arena agreement with the city, aided by NBA Commissioner David Stern. One Maloof brother, Gavin, even wept as the family made a long-term commitment to Sacramento. But later, the Maloofs backed out.

Soon afterward, they began negotiating with Virginia Beach, Va., to move the team there. But Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell rejected the town’s request for a $150-million subsidy.

Enter Seattle.

Advertisement

Those weren’t the only times the Maloofs back-stabbed Sacramento. In 2006, they negotiated a sales tax increase to pay for a new arena. But they reneged on the deal just as the ballot measure campaign kicked off.

In fact, they were suspected of sabotaging the measure. The Maloof brothers appeared in a Carl’s Jr. TV ad, washing down burgers with a $6,000 bottle of wine — a display of extravagance that infuriated voters.

Advertisement

In the early years of the Maloof ownership, starting in 1999, the Kings were very competitive and played some thrilling playoff games with the Lakers. The Kings sold out every game for 19 seasons.

But in recent years, the team has become crummy. It now ranks at the bottom of NBA attendance. And there’s little effort to maintain an arena that’s falling apart.

Advertisement

In fact, the last time I attended a game a few years ago my $115 seat collapsed. Ushers couldn’t find me another. They provided a couple of cushions to sit on. That’s when I decided not to renew my partial season ticket plan.

It’s the kind of neglect that makes a sports franchise vulnerable — and a city and mayor crying out for new owners.

If Johnson can pull this off, it will be the biggest come-from-behind win of his career.

http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/05/29/1212417/-Tea-Party-ties-to-Koch-Brothers-Ignored-by-Media-in-IRS-Scandal,2013-05-29 00:00:00,"['This Content Is Not Subject To Review Daily Kos Staff Prior To Publication.', 'Backgroundurl Avatar_Large', 'Nickname', 'Joined', 'Created_At', 'Story Count', 'N_Stories', 'Comment Count', 'N_Comments', 'Popular Tags']",Tea Party ties to Koch Brothers Ignored by Media in IRS Scandal,"10 out of 11 Tea Party spokespeople quoted in major news outlets regarding the IRS scandal have ties to the Koch funded Americans for Prosperity.

The Internal Revenue Service, not the most popular government agency to begin with, has been in the midst of a scatological squall for the past 3 weeks over their treatment of tea party groups. According to an agency spokesperson, organizations garnered additional scrutiny of their applications for non-profit status for having “Tea Party, Patriot, or 9/12” in the application materials. Non-profit status is granted by the IRS for “social welfare organizations” and federal law puts legal limits to the amount of overtly political things you can do if you are applying to be a non-profit, and thus tax-exempt.

In the coverage of this story, now a scandal, there are a couple of important facts that some of the reporting has missed.

First is the fact that the tea party is a creation of enterprising political and public relations professionals, constructed to accomplish a political purpose. A study published in the Tobacco Control Journal actually traced the origins of the tea party to “free-market” groups founded by tobacco corporations and the oil industry billionaires David and Charles Koch.

According to researchers at UC San Francisco:

“Rather than being a grassroots movement that spontaneously developed in 2009, the Tea Party organizations have had connections to the tobacco companies since the 1980s. The cigarette companies funded and worked through Citizens for a Sound Economy (CSE), the predecessor of Tea Party organizations, Americans for Prosperity and FreedomWorks, to accomplish their economic and political agenda.”

Citizens for a Sound Economy (CSE), was founded in 1984 by the Koch brothers.

There is even a tea party website registered to a Koch group in 2005, long before the conservative outcry we now know as the tea party began.

The second thing to keep in mind is that the tea party is still controlled by enterprising political and public relations professionals, funded by the David and Charles Koch. In coverage of the IRS scandal, there were 11 people who were involved in tea party groups quoted about IRS scrutiny. Of those 11, 10 have substantial ties to Americans for Prosperity (AFP). AFP (also founded and funded by the Kochs), is the direct descendent of CSE - one of the groups who registered a tea party site in 2005. Of those 10 with ties to AFP, 2 actually work for the organization currently. All 10 have received aid from AFP which included help with messaging and communication.

The tea party groups that were scrutinized by the IRS are not just separate grassroots citizen groups unfairly accused of political shenanigans, as the Koch associated spokespeople in the media would have you believe. They are one part of a wider political strategy, funded and managed by a very wealthy few. they have uniform and coordinated messages, such as attacking climate science andopposing environmental regulations.

As this IRS scandal progresses, it is important to keep in mind that many of the tea party groups in question deserve to have their non-profit, tax-exempt status questioned. The New York Times has already found that several tea party groups investigated by the IRS were engaged in activities that are illegal for tax exempt groups.

For the record, Greenpeace and Rainforest Action Network experienced expensive and debilitating audits by the IRS during George W Bush’s presidency. Those audits were most likely at the behest of an Exxon funded front group.

Earlier this month, 38 news organizations, including the Associated Press, ABC News, The Washington Post, and Reuters demanded more photojournalist access to the president. The White House responded with what one reporter described as a middle finger. Now some news organizations are responding by formalizing policies not to publish White House-distributed photographs.

Last week the USA Today announced that it will not use “handout photos originating from the White House Press Office, except in very extraordinary circumstances.” The next day McClatchy joined the conditional boycott:

“The editors of McClatchy newspapers have agreed not to publish photography issued by the White House,” McClatchy Vice President for News/Washington Editor Anders Gyllenhaal told staffers in an email Tuesday night. The policy is not “a significant departure from current practices,” he says.

Both McClatchy and USA Today claim that these were their policies anyway, which makes one wonder what the point is.

For those of us outside the DC-Manhattan bubble, it is really quite incredible to watch the elite media crybaby in this way. Our media has extraordinary power, when they choose to use it. The problem is that, when it comes to this president, they rarely choose to use it.

No one respects their sycophants, which is why this White House is so comfortable ignoring, dismissing, and even ridiculing the mainstream media.

This whole brouhaha surrounding photojournalist access is a perfect example. Nothing changes and what happens? The White House receives a strongly worded internal policy affirmation.

If the media want some respect from this White House, they need to start doing something as simple as their jobs. But the White House knows that no matter how shabbily they treat the media, the media will still carry their water. For example, the ObamaCare cover ups continue to this day. Sure, the media is covering the smoking guns as they become too obvious to ignore, but they still refuse to warn the public that millions more insurance cancellations are coming.

The media’s laughable and humiliating impotence will continue until they man up and stop running point for Obama’s agenda.

Personally, I don’t believe the media’s protests about a lack of photojournalist access have anything to do with journalistic integrity. I think the media’s upset because they can’t get close to their sun king.

Elected to a second term earlier in the year in a campaign devoid of much of the racial heat that marked the 1983 contest, Washington had a majority of the city's 50 aldermen working with him. He was a Democratic political power, helping forge election tickets and exerting influence over careers. A racially divided city seemed to be accepting the reality of a black mayor.

Sitting in his fifth-floor office in City Hall on this morning, talking to a press aide, he suddenly slumped over, his face resting on the desktop. He had suffered a heart attack. Although he was rushed to a hospital emergency room, it was clear to all that Washington was dead. In the days that followed, the city came together as it never really had when he was alive. Thousands lined the frigid sidewalks outside City Hall, waiting to file through the rotunda where his body lay in state. The lines contained blacks, whites, Hispanics, friends, foes, the entire spectrum of Chicago's population.

During his time as mayor, Washington had chipped away at the Democratic machine's patronage system by appointing professionals, minorities and women to city positions. He had worked for economic development in neighborhoods rather than just downtown. But the bulk of his time had been spent fighting his opponents in the City Council.

The days following Washington's death were as raucous as the days of ""Council Wars,"" culminating in a marathon City Council session to name a new mayor. Finally, in the early-morning hours, the white aldermanic bloc chose Eugene Sawyer, a black alderman from the South Side, to take over as mayor until a special election could be held in 1989."

The book, “Barack Obama,” was published by Lerner Publishing in 2010 as part of their series “History Maker Bios.” All presidents going back to Richard Nixon -- except George W. Bush -- were the subjects of similar biographies published by Lerner, which did not respond to questions from FoxNews.com.

Critics also say the new Obama book is biased, pointing to a passage that reads, “but some people said Americans weren’t ready for that much change. Sure Barack was a nice fellow, they said. But white voters would never vote for a black president.”

[pullquote]

Kyle Olson, founder of the conservative Education Action Group Foundation and EAGnews.org, said that is a problem.

“I have no problem with kids learning about Barack Obama ... he’s the President of the United States,"" said Olson. ""However, the book teaches fourth graders that white voters didn’t want to vote for black men.”

Asked whether the sentence could also be interpreted as simply noting that some people said that white voters would be racist, he agreed but said such nuance could easily be lost on fourth-graders.

Another passage of the book discusses Obama’s youthful identity crisis and drug use, which Obama himself wrote about in his own biography. One passage reads, “When Barry looked in the mirror, he saw a young black man. But he didn't know how to be black. And no one was there to teach him. He decided to act like the black characters he saw on TV. He started acting tough. He cursed. Was that what it meant to be black? As he got older, he started smoking and drinking. Was that what it meant to be black?""

Some parents also found the content of the book problematic.

“The content of this book should be found objectionable by everyone in the country. America is a melting pot - it's not made up of hyphenated Americans (African-American for example) separated by those who like to foment discord,” Oklahoma mother of five Jenni White told FoxNews.com.

Olson also took issue with book’s general tone.

“I’m not saying fourth-graders shouldn’t know about drugs – I think what I find troubling about books like these is they’re kind of like the Oliver Stone version of history, where kids are not getting an accurate picture of his background and his policies – it’s generating a mythical character of the man,” Olson said.

Much of the book is publicly viewable on Google Books. The author, Jane Sutcliffe, did not respond to a request for comment.

Olson added that depictions of Republican presidents, by the same publisher, have had different tones.

“The George H. W. Bush book had lines about how wealthy he was, how many maids he had, all of those sorts of things,” Olson said.

Specifically, the book about the elder President Bush reads in one part:

“The Bushes had money for a cook, two maids, a chauffeur (driver), and private schools,” it reads on page 8."

Rand Paul won last weekend’s presidential straw poll, cementing the Kentucky Republican’s status as a favorite of the conservative movement.

So it’s with some trepidation that I confess that I, too, Stand with Rand.

For the moment, I am Standing with Rand on one leg only; his isolationist foreign policy and his calamitous plan to eliminate federal deficits in five years make it imprudent to jump in with both feet. But consider:

On Tuesday, Paul endorsed a version of immigration reform that would allow the 11 million or so undocumented immigrants in this country to become legal.

Last week, he outlined an idea that would end government discrimination against gay marriage.

March 16, 2013 Jenny Beth Martin, co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots, speaks at the 40th annual Conservative Political Action Conference at National Harbor. Pete Marovich/Getty Images Wait 1 second to continue.

The week before, Paul defied the hawks in his party to lead a 13-hour filibuster in protest of the Obama administration’s secrecy over its drone warfare program — a stance Democrats would have championed if a Republican were president.

And the week before that, he was one of only four Republicans voting to confirm Chuck Hagel as defense secretary.

Taken together, these pleasant surprises suggest that Paul is more complex than his tea-party caricature and more savvy than the libertarian gadfly his father had been. In his speech to CPAC, the younger Paul didn’t even mention the Federal Reserve or the gold standard. He has spoken, instead, of reaching out to minorities, young voters and other Democratic constituencies.

“I’ve never met a new immigrant looking for a free lunch,” he told the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce on Tuesday, calling on his party to embrace higher levels of immigration. Paul proposed “acknowledging we aren’t going to deport 12 million illegal immigrants. If you wish to work, if you wish to live and work in America, then we will find a place for you.”

At CPAC, Paul told the activists: “We must stand for something so powerful and so popular that it brings together people from the left and the right and the middle. We need a Republican Party that shows up on the South Side of Chicago and shouts at the top of our lungs: ‘We are the party of jobs and opportunity.’ ”

It would be naive to think that Paul, as he prepares for a 2016 presidential run, will pull off a mass conversion of Republicans to his libertarianism. But the senator, if he chooses, has the potential to build a force that could shake up politics — not a third party but perhaps an informal coalition that occupies a space between religious conservatives and tax-and-spend liberals.

Paul won’t get far if he persists with the foreign policy he laid out earlier this year at the Heritage Foundation; he describes himself as a “realist,” but his form of realism might have sounded good to Senate Republicans in the 1930s. And, like his father, he makes politically expedient exceptions to his libertarianism; last week he introduced the Life at Conception Act, which would effectively outlaw abortion.

Still, his message has the power of the early tea party’s theme before the movement was hijacked by religious and corporate interests. And it is powerful enough to have Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader, fearing the junior senator from his home state. “Rand reminded the world that politics isn’t just about tactics,” McConnell gushed at CPAC, praising the filibuster he belatedly supported. “It’s about standing up for your values and your principles. It’s about courage. . . . It was truly inspiring.”

But will McConnell be inspired by the principles Paul advocated last week? That’s when Paul told reporters, in a session hosted by National Review, that even though he supports the “historical definition” of marriage, “I’m not for limiting contracts between adults.” He floated an idea “to make the tax code more neutral, where it doesn’t mention the word marriage.”

And will McConnell praise the courage and values Paul showed Tuesday, when he proposed legal status for illegal immigrants? Paul outlined a probationary system under which they could “get in line” for citizenship. “This is where prudence, compassion and thrift all point us toward the same goal: bringing these workers out of the shadows and into being taxpaying members of society.”

Paul said that Republicans, in “our zeal for border control,” have “sometimes obscured our respect and admiration for immigrants.” This was similar to his CPAC speech, in which he charged that “the GOP of old has grown stale and moss-covered.”

It’s not yet clear how dedicated Paul really is to moss removal. But as long as he’s scrubbing, I’ll Stand with Rand.

Shear', 'Annie Lowrey']","In Tech Buying, U.S. Still Stuck in Last Century","WASHINGTON — Four years after President Obama vowed to “dramatically reform the way we do business on contracts,” the spectacular failure of the HealthCare.gov website has renewed calls for changes in how the government hires and manages private technology companies.

But despite Mr. Obama’s promises in the last two months to “leap into the 21st century,” there is little evidence that the administration is moving quickly to pursue an overhaul of the current system in the coming year.

Outside experts, members of Congress, technology executives and former government officials say the botched rollout of the Affordable Care Act’s website is the nearly inevitable result of a procurement process that stifles innovation and wastes taxpayer dollars. The Air Force last year scrapped a $1 billion supply management system. Officials abandoned a new F.B.I. system after spending $170 million on it. And a $438 million air traffic control systems update, a critical part of a $45 billion nationwide upgrade that is years behind schedule, is expected to go at least $270 million over budget.

Longstanding laws intended to prevent corruption and conflict of interest often saddle agencies with vendors selected by distant committees and contracts that stretch for years, even as technology changes rapidly. The rules frequently leave the government officials in charge of a project with little choice over their suppliers, little control over the project’s execution and almost no authority to terminate a contract that is failing."

US President Harry S Truman has dismissed General Douglas MacArthur as commander of United Nations and US forces in the Far East after disagreements over foreign policy in Korea. General MacArthur will be replaced by Lieutenant-General Matthew Ridgway, appointed as head of the 8th Army in Korea by General MacArthur himself last December. At 0100 local time, Washington issued the official announcement of the general's dismissal along with several documents showing he had ignored orders to refrain from making political statements. The move has shocked the American public and angered Republican politicians who revere General MacArthur as a distinguished soldier and leader. In a broadcast to the nation tonight, the president acknowledged the general was one of America's greatest military commanders. But he added: ""The cause of world peace is more important than any individual."" The cause of world peace is more important than any individual.

President Harry S Truman

Last month, General MacArthur called for an attack on China itself unless Communist forces laid down their arms in Korea. Tonight President Truman re-affirmed his belief that extending the battle beyond Korea could lead to a third world war if the Soviet Union decided to enter the fray. ""A number of events have made it evident that General MacArthur did not agree with that policy,"" he said. ""I have therefore considered it essential to relieve General MacArthur so that there would be no doubt or confusion as to the real purpose and aim of our policy."" He also made it clear he was ready to negotiate with the North Koreans on a peace settlement as long as fighting stopped. Republican leaders in Congress and the Senate expressed their anger saying the dismissal had endangered national unity and they called for Congress to investigate foreign policy in Korea. General MacArthur's successor, Lt-General Ridgway, is a highly respected paratrooper commander who jumped with his men in World War II during the invasion of Sicily and on D-Day. He earned many awards for bravery along with the nickname ""the fighting and jumping general"". Since his arrival in Korea last year, Lt-Gen Ridgway has regrouped retreating allied forces, boosted army morale and hit back at the enemy in what he calls a ""limited offensive"" pushing the Communists back north across the 38th parallel. British troops have compared him to General Montgomery in the way he inspires his men on the battlefield. His habit of wearing a hand grenade at his shoulder is as familiar to the troops as Montgomery's beret. Your Memories?

In Context When General MacArthur returned to the US he received a hero's welcome, and told Congress, ""Old soldiers never die; they only fade away."" He had been sent to Korea to stop North Koreans under Kim Il-Sung taking over the South. He succeeded in driving back the enemy beyond the 38th parallel but UN and US troops were pushed back south when Chinese Communist forces joined the war. General Ridgway agreed to ceasefire talks in July 1951 but they broke down. In 1952, some Republicans tried but failed to nominate General MacArthur for the US presidency after which he retired from public life. It was General Dwight D Eisenhower who was elected US President that year and General Ridgway took over his job as supreme commander of the Allied forces in Europe (Nato). Fighting did not stop until 1953 with the signing of the armistice on 27 July. But a peace deal has never been reached. American troops remain stationed in the de-militarized zone on and around the 38th parallel separating North and South Korea.

Boeing’s warning came in response to comments by the local president for the group, Tom Wroblewski, who tore up a copy of the proposed deal at the end of a union meeting Thursday night.

More than 200 people have been arrested after thousands of demonstrators clashed in an anti-Vietnam war protest outside the United States embassy in London.

The St John Ambulance Brigade said it treated 86 people for injuries. Fifty were taken to hospital including up to 25 police officers.

The trouble followed a big rally in Trafalgar square, when an estimated 10,000 demonstrated against American action in Vietnam and British support for the United States.

The mood at the rally was described as good humoured. The violence broke out when the protesters marched to the US embassy in Grosvenor Square.

The embassy was surrounded by hundreds of police. They stood shoulder to shoulder to cordon off the part of the square closest to the embassy.

Tensions rose as the crowd refused to back off and mounted officers rode at the demonstrators.

The protesters broke through the police ranks onto the lawn of the embassy, tearing up the plastic fence and uprooting parts of a hedge.

During a protracted battle, stones, earth, firecrackers and smoke bombs were thrown.

One officer was treated for a reported serious spinal injury, another for a neck injury.

One officer had his hat knocked off and was struck continuously on the back of the head with a stick from a banner as he clung, head down, to his horse's neck.

Earlier the actress Vanessa Redgrave was allowed to enter the embassy with three supporters to deliver a protest.

She had been one of the speakers at the rally in Trafalgar Square.

Labour MP Peter Jackson, has said he will be tabling a private question for answer by the Home Secretary about what he called ""police violence"".

He told The Times newspaper: ""I was particularly outraged by the violent use of police horses, who charged into the crowd even after they had cleared the street in front of the embassy."""

House Speaker Thom Tillis (R-Charlotte) announced Thursday afternoon that the bill would not be receiving a vote in the full House, effectively dropping the measure. Loretta Boniti, a reporter for News 14 Carolina, broke the news on Twitter, and it was confirmed in a breaking news alert posted on the home page of wral.com, a Raleigh-based television station. Tillis' decision followed several days of national media attention on the bill, which also said that the state government did not have to listen to federal court rulings and was exempt from the requirements of the First Amendment.

The bill, which was drafted by state Reps. Carl Ford (R-China Grove) and Harry Warren (R-Salisbury), was intended to address an issue in Rowan County, where the ACLU has filed a lawsuit against the county commission in an attempt to block commissioners from having a Christian prayer at the beginning of meetings.

The North Carolina measure responds to the ACLU suit by declaring that each state is ""sovereign"" and no federal court can prevent a state from ""from making laws respecting an establishment of religion."" Though Warren, one of the bill's authors, told HuffPost Live that the measure was not seeking to create a state religion, the drafted legislation would clearly allow for such an action.

SECTION 1. The North Carolina General Assembly asserts that the Constitution of the United States of America does not prohibit states or their subsidiaries from making laws respecting an establishment of religion. SECTION 2. The North Carolina General Assembly does not recognize federal court rulings which prohibit and otherwise regulate the State of North Carolina, its public schools, or any political subdivisions of the State from making laws respecting an establishment of religion.

The North Carolina bill seeks to play the First Amendment both ways. It says that the state is exempted from the establishment clause under the First Amendment, which establishes the ""separation of church and state."" The clause reads that ""Congress shall make no law respecting an Establishment of Religion."" But the North Carolina bill asserts that prohibition does not apply ""to states, municipalities, or schools,"" and that North Carolina could establish a state religion. The bill then goes further, portraying this reasoning as a protection of the freedom of religion, including the state lawmakers' right to exercise their own religious beliefs.

In fact, in a series of cases stretching back nearly a century, the Supreme Court has ruled that the First Amendment does cover state governments. Judicial precedent has held that any such proposals on the establishment of religion must have secular, legislative purpose; cannot inhibit or advance religion; and cannot be ""an excessive government entanglement with religion.""

An explanation on why Tillis decided to kill the measure was not posted and a Tillis spokesman was not immediately available for comment. The media firestorm regarding the legislation comes as Tillis is considering a bid for the U.S. Senate against Sen. Kay Hagan (D-N.C.) next year. Tillis was not a co-sponsor of the bill, which originally drew 11 GOP supporters, including Tillis' deputy, Majority Leader Edgar Starnes (R-Hickory) and House Appropriations Committee Chairman Justin Burr (R-Albemarle). Three additional Republicans had signed on as co-sponsors since the bill was first introduced on Monday."

One headline reads, ""US deploys 25,000 troops in Syria,"" and text in the e-mail points to links to breaking news stories about the ""invasion"" and current upheaval in Syria. A few of the headlines even suggest that this may indeed be the start of World War III.

“The granting of citizenship is the most solemn honor this country can confer,” TheTeaParty.Net founder Todd Cefaratti said in a statement obtained by Breitbart News. “It is not something that ought to be used to score political points or to win the next election.”

“Before the American people extend this gift they must be assured that verifiable border security has preeminent priority. The Senate bill currently does not have it,” he explained. “Americans will not be bullied, intimidated and steamrolled into accepting this legislation.”

“We have proposed a conservative alternative at secureamericanow.us for which we will be rallying Congressional support in the coming days.”

The group said in its release it will be briefing members of Congress on the alternative immigration reform plan in the coming days and weeks.

TheTeaParty.Net’s chief strategist Niger Innis added that he thinks the “Senate amnesty bill is a non-starter.”

“But instead of just saying we’re against something, we have put forward eight principles that we believe are the necessary pillars of an America First Immigration alternative,” Innis said. “Over the coming days we will be meeting with conservative Senate and House members about getting them to support the plan.”

“We will not be bullied by a Harry Reid-Chuck Schumer agenda that undermines the Constitution by ramming through a bill that the American people do not support,” Innis promised. “The only way to stop a bully is to confront them.”

Many other Tea Party organizations, like Tea Party Patriots, have already announced their opposition to the Gang of Eight bill. More than 150 of them banded together in recent months to sign a letter sent to members of Congress announcing their ardent opposition to the legislation.

TheTeaParty.net did not sign that letter at the time and was fighting suggestions from the office of Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) that it may support the legislation.

Politico previously erroneously claimed that TheTeaParty.net was among groups that had become an “ally” of the Gang of Eight. Politico later quietly edited the story after Breitbart News discovered the groups it claimed supported the bill had not expressed support for the legislation. Rather, the groups had me with Rubio’s team to get his take on the bill before they made a decision.

“We are going to hear him out, rather than rely on the liberal media interpretation of his legislation,” Innis told Breitbart News at the time. “Reports that we have agreed to support the Gang of Eight bill are utter make-believe.”"

Talk about a dynamic duo.

President Obama, the nation's first golfer, teed it up Sunday with Tiger Woods, their first golf outing together.

Tim Rosaforte of Golf Digest and Golf Channel called it a historic moment, watching Obama and Woods ride off in a golf cart, headed for perhaps 27 holes.

The duo were playing at The Floridan Golf Club in Palm City, Fla.

This comes a day after Obama spent some time getting tips from Woods' former swing coach, Butch Harmon, and his son Claude.

Here are a couple of tweets from Rosaforte:

""Not going to turn this into Tiger Tracker, but from pro shop at Floridian we received word TW holed out greenside bunker No. 1 for birdie.""

""The President is arriving at The Floridian range. Awaiting is Tiger Woods and club owner Jim Crane. Historic day in golf. Their first round.""

Rosaforte also said, in an interview on Golf Channel, Woods was putting on a show, even driving the green on a 378-yard par-4.

""We had a big day today,"" Crane, who owns the Houston Astros, told MLB.com.

""Well, when you get to play with the president and Tiger Woods in the same round, that's one that doesn't happen every day and it might not happen again,"" Crane said. ""It was a lot of fun. The President was very cordial, and Tiger had a lot of fun and hit some great shots. We had a lot of fun.""

About Obama's golf game, Crane said: ""He played well today. He made some good shots and had some pars, and I think he shot in the 80s. The weather was nice and we had fun. I think he really enjoyed his visit and we really enjoyed having him in the Floridian, and hopefully we'll have him back some day.""

The recent news about the FBI’s seizure of the phone and email records of Fox News employees, including James Rosen, calls into question whether the federal government is meeting its constitutional obligation to preserve and protect a free press in the United States. We reject the government's efforts to criminalize the pursuit of investigative journalism and falsely characterize a Fox News reporter to a Federal judge as a ""co-conspirator"" in a crime. I know how concerned you are because so many of you have asked me: why should the government make me afraid to use a work phone or email account to gather news or even call a friend or family member? Well, they shouldn’t have done it. The administration’s attempt to intimidate Fox News and its employees will not succeed and their excuses will stand neither the test of law, the test of decency, nor the test of time. We will not allow a climate of press intimidation, unseen since the McCarthy era, to frighten any of us away from the truth.

I am proud of your tireless effort to report the news over the last 17 years. I stand with you, I support you and I thank you for your reporting with courageous optimism. Too many Americans fought and died to protect our unique American right of press freedom. We can’t and we won’t forget that. To be an American journalist is not only a great responsibility, but also a great honor. To be a Fox journalist is a high honor, not a high crime. Even this memo of support will cause some to demonize us and try to find irrelevant things to cause us to waver. We will not waver.

As Fox News employees, we sometimes are forced to stand alone, but even then when we know we are reporting what is true and what is right, we stand proud and fearless. Thank you for your hard work and all your efforts.

Lawmakers can't seem to agree on anything these days. Except ... sugar? Here's how a relatively small industry manages to win big in Washington. (The Washington Post)

Washington politicians facing a year-end deadline to cut billions in agriculture spending are feuding over the future of food aid for the poor and crop subsidies for farmers.

There is, however, one area of agreement in the contentious negotiations: sugar.

Lawmakers decided to preserve the decades-old government safety net that boosts profits for a relatively small group of growers and has cost consumers billions through artificially high prices.

The special protection is a testament to the enduring Washington clout of one of the country’s wealthiest farming interests, including the politically connected Florida family that controls a substantial share of the world’s sugar market.

Sugar makers succeeded by gaining the support of a wildly divergent collection of lawmakers — rural and urban, tea party and liberal — who have little in common other than the presence of sugar operations in their states.

View Graphic Legislative backing for sugar policy

The industry doles out generous campaign contributions that outstrip those from other agriculture sectors. Its leaders have forged personal ties with senior lawmakers, congressional staffers and high-ranking officials in the executive branch.

A pivotal player is the Fanjul family of Palm Beach, Fla., which commands the world’s biggest refining operation, owns the ubiquitous brands Domino and C&H, and raises millions of dollars for politicians from both parties.

Sugar-beet farmers in the upper Midwest, responsible for about half of the country’s sugar production, have also enhanced the industry’s clout, funding political action committees and leaning on home-state lawmakers from a dozen states.

House and Senate negotiators, after months of struggling, are rushing to reach a farm-bill deal as early as this coming week. The talks have been stymied by rancor over how deeply to cut food benefits for millions of poor Americans and how to curb subsidies for hundreds of thousands of farmers.

Big candymakers and food manufacturers such as Hershey, Mars and Kraft — whose costs rise with sugar prices — waged a lobbying campaign to put sugar on the farm-bill casualty list as well.

But sugar has already won.

Wide range of support

The industry’s power was evident in the unusual alliances that formed in the House and Senate to thwart sugar-related measures over the past two years, turning ideological adversaries such as Sens. Al Franken (D-Minn.) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) into teammates operating from the same playbook.

“Removing the protections we have for our domestic sugar producers will do nothing but kill an American industry and outsource jobs to our competitors,” Franken said during a Senate floor debate this spring. Rubio, in the same debate, warned colleagues of the “risks to American jobs if reforms to our sugar program were to pass.”

The program, which has existed in various forms since the Great Depression, uses an elaborate system of import quotas, price floors and taxpayer-backed loans designed to prop up domestic growers, which number about 4,500.

Industry officials and their allies in Congress say the sugar program is needed to protect producers from a world market heavily distorted by subsidies from Brazil, Mexico and other major exporters. Without the program, the industry says, the U.S. economy would lose tens of thousands of jobs and become dependent on foreign sources to meet the nation’s sugar needs.

“It clearly is in the national interest to defend efficient American farmers against subsidized foreign producers,” said Jack Roney, an economist for the American Sugar Alliance, the Washington trade group whose primary mission is defending the sugar program.

Roney said lawmakers have supported the program because of its limited price to taxpayers. The industry has used the slogan “cost-free” as a mantra for years, and sugar backers in Congress frequently adopt it in their floor speeches and conversations with colleagues.

Still, the program does come at a cost. Government and academic studies, often disputed by the sugar industry, have estimated that elevated prices have cost foodmakers and consumers at least $1.9 billion a year.

In addition, taxpayers are on the hook for government loans that companies can choose to pay back in the form of excess sugar instead of cash and interest if prices drop below a certain point. That happened in fiscal 2013 for the first time in more than a decade, costing taxpayers $278 million in direct expenditures to sugar companies.

This year, a well-heeled coalition of sugar-using companies stepped up their lobbying efforts to portray the program as costly to consumers and American workers. Newly elected tea party conservatives vowing to crusade against government meddling in free markets also provided fresh potential support.

“You would have thought that this would have been the year for reform,” said Rep. Joe Pitts (R-Pa.), whose state is home to Hershey and who sponsored measures to roll back sugar support. But, he added, “we were up against a force.”

Liberal sugar advocates included Franken, whose state is home to a large concentration of sugar-beet farmers, along with Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) and Rep. Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.), whose home areas include Fanjul-controlled refineries.

Nearly the entire Florida delegation — from Rubio, a potential 2016 GOP presidential candidate, to Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee — voted to keep sugar protections in place.

Strong support has come from House conservatives, as well, including Rep. Michael K. Conaway (R-Tex.), chairman of a key agriculture subcommittee.

“The sugar guys win votes because they are better at politics than anyone else,” said one lobbyist who is close to sugar executives and requested anonymity to discuss industry thinking. “What other interest group in town do you know that can consistently draw support from hard-core conservatives, ethnic liberals and cost-conscious moderates?”

Campaign spending

The industry is tiny in comparison to other agricultural commodities, but it outspends all other crop sectors combined on political-action-committee contributions to federal candidates. Sugar interests have spent $49 million on federal campaign donations and lobbying over the past five years.

On average, sugar farmers and employees gave more than five times as much money to members of Congress who sided with the industry than to members who did not, according to an analysis of key votes conducted for The Washington Post by the Center for Responsive Politics.

The Fanjuls are the most influential of the growers, according to lawmakers and lobbyists, exerting pressure through political fundraising and personal connections that belie their low public profile.

The family patriarchs, José “Pepe” Fanjul and Alfonso “Alfy” Fanjul, built their empire after fleeing the regime of Fidel Castro, which seized the family’s sugar business in Cuba after coming to power in 1959. Now the brothers grow and process cane sugar on 160,000 acres they own in Florida. Their holdings include refineries in Baltimore, New York, Louisiana and California, and plants in Mexico, Belize and Europe. They control much of the Dominican Republic’s sugar production.

They have also built an unusually broad power base on Capitol Hill. Pepe has donated and raised millions for Republicans; Alfy has done the same for Democrats.

“They come to Washington often, meet quietly with individual members, usually without staff present,” said the lobbyist close to industry executives.

Their high-level access drew rare public notice in the 1990s when Monica Lewinsky described a phone call to the Oval Office from Alfy during one of her private encounters with President Bill Clinton. Under the George W. Bush administration, White House officials expended effort trying to mollify the Fanjuls, who were personally persuading members of Congress to oppose a free-trade pact with sugar-producing Caribbean nations.

Rubio paid tribute to the Fanjuls in his autobiography, crediting Pepe and his wife for a “crown jewel” fundraising event and for hosting a dinner on his boat to introduce Rubio to former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. Pepe Fanjul hosted a series of fundraisers for Rubio in March of this year, including a $10,000-per-person dinner at his Palm Beach estate.

Gaston Cantens, a lobbyist for the Fanjuls, said the brothers advocate for their business just as any industry executives would.

Political friendships are built over many years, Cantens said, and do not always result in the family getting what it wants. He said the family supported Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), a Cuban American conservative who voted this year to roll back the sugar program.

In addition to the Fanjuls, the industry has retained a core of lobbyists, experts and other advocates that could “fill a stadium,” as one lobbyist put it. Former congressman and House Agriculture Committee chairman Larry Combest (R-Tex.) and former committee deputy chief of staff Tom Sell run a lobbying firm that represents sugar interests.

Independent cane and beet growers from Louisiana and the Red River Valley of North Dakota and Minnesota fly to Washington regularly to walk the halls of Congress and make the case for sugar, emphasizing that the program helps family-owned farms stay in operation.

“These guys are disciplined, they know the arguments, and they are organized,” said Rep. Collin C. Peterson (D-Minn.), the ranking Democrat on the House Agriculture Committee. His district includes the country’s largest concentration of sugar-beet farmers.

As a rule, the industry meets with every incoming freshman member of a new Congress. This year the list included Rep. Ted Yoho (R-Fla.), elected in 2012 on a tea party platform.

Yoho quickly gained national recognition for, among other things, pressing House Republicans to cut deeply into farm bill programs such as food stamps.

But on sugar subsidies, the livestock veterinarian said he has grown to support the industry view. He is sponsoring a sugar-backed resolution that favors giving up the sugar program only when other countries end their subsidies.

“I ran on limited government, fiscal responsibility and free enterprise,” Yoho said, “but when you’ve got programs that have been in place and it’s the accepted norm, to just go in there and stop it would be detrimental to our sugar growers.”

http://news.yahoo.com/texas-actress-charged-obama-ricin-threat-230606198.html,,[],Texas actress charged in Obama ricin threat,"TEXARKANA, Texas (AP) — A pregnant Texas actress who first told the FBI that her husband sent ricin-tainted letters to President Barack Obama and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, then allegedly said she sent them because her husband ""made her"" do it, was charged Friday with threatening the president.

Shannon Guess Richardson, 35, appeared in a Texarkana courtroom after being charged with mailing a threatening communication to the president. The federal charge carries up to 10 years in prison, U.S. attorney's office spokeswoman Davilyn Walston said.

Richardson, a mother of five who has played bit roles on television and in movies, was arrested earlier Friday for allegedly mailing the ricin-laced letters last month to the White House, Bloomberg and the mayor's Washington gun-control group. The letters — which authorities determined were mailed from Richardson's hometown of New Boston or nearby Texarkana and postmarked in Shreveport, La. — threatened violence against gun-control advocates, authorities said.

However, Richardson's court-appointed attorney, Tonda Curry, said there was no intention to harm anyone. She noted that it's common knowledge that the mail is checked before it reaches the person to whom these letters were addressed.

""From what I can say, based on what evidence I've seen, whoever did this crime never intended for ricin to reach the people to which the letters were addressed,"" said Curry.

Curry said she has met with Richardson only briefly and has had no extensive talks with her.

According to an FBI affidavit, Richardson contacted authorities on May 30 to implicate her estranged husband, Nathaniel Richardson. She later failed a polygraph test, and investigators looking into her story found numerous inconsistencies, the document said.

Among the inconsistencies: Nathaniel Richardson would have been at work at a time when Internet searches tied to the letters were made on the couple's laptop and at the time they were postmarked.

Story continues

During an interview with authorities Thursday, Shannon Richardson admitted mailing the letters knowing they contained ricin, but she said her husband had typed them and made her print and send them, the affidavit said.

No charges have been filed against Nathaniel Richardson. His attorney, John Delk, told The Associated Press Friday that his client was pleased with his wife's arrest and was working with authorities to prove his innocence.

Delk said he wasn't anticipating that Nathanial Richardson would be arrested. ""But until I'm sure they're not looking at him being involved, I can't say much more,"" he said.

Delk previously told the AP that the couple is going through a divorce and that the 33-year-old Army veteran may have been ""set up"" by his wife.

FBI agents wearing hazardous material suits were seen going in and out of the Richardsons' house on Wednesday in nearby New Boston, about 150 miles northeast of Dallas near the Arkansas and Oklahoma borders. Authorities conducted a similar search on May 31.

The house is now under quarantine for ""environmental or toxic agents,"" according to a posting at the residence. Multiple samples taken from the couples' home tested positive for ricin, according to the affidavit. Federal agents also found castor beans — the key ingredient in ricin — along with syringes and other items that could be used to extract the lethal poison, the affidavit says.

Bloomberg issued a statement Friday thanking local and federal law enforcement agencies ""for their outstanding work in apprehending a suspect,"" saying they worked collaboratively from the outset ""and will continue to do so as the investigation continues.""

Shannon Richardson appears in movies and on TV under the name Shannon Guess. Her resume on the Internet movie database IMDb said she has had small television roles in ""The Vampire Diaries"" and ""The Walking Dead."" She had a minor role in the movie ""The Blind Side"" and appeared in an Avis commercial, according to the resume.

She was seen leaving a Texarkana hospital on Friday shortly before the court hearing. A hospital spokeswoman didn't return a phone message seeking comment. Curry, her attorney, said she was taken to the hospital because it's federal marshals' standard procedure to have pregnant prisoners examined by doctors.

She also said it's her understanding that authorities have no intention of arresting Nathaniel Richardson at this point.

Delk said the Richardsons were expecting their first child in October. Shannon Richardson also has five children ranging in age from 4 to 19 from other relationships, four of whom had been living with the couple in the New Boston home, the attorney said.

Nathaniel Richardson works as a mechanic at the Red River Army Depot in Texarkana, Texas, a facility that repairs tanks, Humvees and other mobile military equipment. He and Shannon were married in October 2011.

According to court records, Shannon Richardson is in federal custody. The government is requesting that she be held without bond, and a detention hearing is scheduled for next Friday, the records show.

The FBI is investigating at least three cases over the past two months in which ricin was mailed to Obama and other public figures. Ricin has been sent to officials sporadically over the years, but experts say that there seems to be a recent uptick and that copycat attacks — made possible by the relative ease of extracting the poison — may be the reason.

If inhaled, ricin can cause respiratory failure, among other symptoms. If swallowed, it can shut down the liver and other organs, resulting in death. The amount of ricin that can fit on the head of a pin is said to be enough to kill an adult if properly prepared. No antidote is available, though researchers are trying to develop one.

USA TODAY

University of Illinois-Chicago has begun exploring bidding for the future Obama presidential library

Presidential libraries draw hundreds of thousands of visitors each year

Obama hasn%27t offered any clues on where he might like the library to end up

The University of Illinois at Chicago wants President Obama to bring his future presidential library to the city campus, USA TODAY has learned.

Bill Burton, a spokesman for UIC, confirmed to USA TODAY on Friday that Chancellor Paula Allen-Meares decided in May to form a university exploratory committee to look into bidding for the library and museum that will be built after Obama leaves office. Burton said he had no details about who is on the exploratory committee or what, if any, actions they have taken thus far in their pursuit.

Allen-Meares declined to comment.

So far Obama hasn't offered any clues as to where he'd like to locate his library. Typically, sitting presidents don't signal to supporters to begin fundraising for the libraries — which are administered by National Archives and Records Administration but whose construction is privately funded — until the latter part of their time in office.

But because the libraries, which serve as repositories for the president's records as well as museums chronicling their time in office, have become such huge undertakings, universities need to show their interest early.

The libraries, which potentially can draw hundreds of thousands of visitors each year, can also provide an economic boom for the community that hosts them. The William J. Clinton Library and Museum, which opened in 2004, spurred $1 billion in real estate investment in downtown Little Rock, Ark. The George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum, which opened in April, is projected to drive $50 million into the local economy annually, according to Phillip Jones, chief executive officer of the Dallas Visitors and Convention Bureau.

UIC, the state's second largest school, is the latest in a growing list of universities in the president's adopted hometown and in his birthplace of Hawaii that have shown interest in hosting his presidential center and museum.

In May, Chicago State University — a historically black university in the heart of the neighborhood where Obama worked as community organizers in the 1980s before attending law school — announced the formation of a presidential library exploratory committee.

Wayne Watson, Chicago State's president, said he has dispatched senior university officials to discuss the process with National Archives and Records Administration Officials as well as pick the brains of operators at some of the 13 libraries administered by the National Archives.

""His political roots are right here on the South Side, pretty much in a 2-mile radius of where we are,"" Watson said in an interview earlier this week. ""Secondly, President Obama represents hope … If there is one community in Chicago that needs to have hope reinforced, it's the community where the president got his start.""

The University of Chicago, where Obama taught law, said in a statement that it is premature to talk about any bid for the library. But in December, top officials traveled to Dallas and met with archivists at The George W. Bush Presidential Library at Southern Methodist University. Among the University of Chicago representatives at the Dallas meeting was Susan Sher, a former chief of staff to first lady Michelle Obama, according to the Associated Press. Sher is now a senior adviser to the University of Chicago's president.

The University of Hawaii launched the Hawaii Presidential Center Initiative last year in hopes of luring Obama to bring his library to his birthplace.

Robert Perkinson, who is directing the initiative, said in a May interview that the state has set aside oceanfront property in Honolulu that could be used for the library."

Radel rips Minnesota governor's 'snowbird' tax plan, welcomes refugees","A Florida Republican congressman is welcoming to his home state Minnesota residents who migrate south to escape the Midwest’s notoriously cold, harsh winters -- now that their governor is trying to impose a so-called “snowbird tax” on them.

“Dear Governor Mark Dayton,” Rep. Trey Radel wrote Friday. “I'm writing today to thank you. As a Floridian, I am overjoyed to hear about your plan to raise taxes on Minnesotans, most especially the so-called ‘snowbirds.’ Your proposal gives us a chance to shine here in the Sunshine State.”

Dayton, a Democrat, proposed the idea last week when announcing key parts of his proposed $37.9 billion budget. He made a similar proposal last year that was defeated by the then-Republican-controlled legislature.

The plan would purportedly raise no more than $30 million over two years from all Minnesota residents who live 60 days to just under six months in Minnesota by taxing their capital gains and dividends as well as income from stocks and bonds.

However, the prorated income tax would largely hit older residents and retirees, known as “snowbirds” because they leave northern states to establish residency in such warmer places as Arizona and Florida.

Dalton said it’s unfair that somebody can live six months and a day outside of Minnesota and pay no state personal income taxes, then come back and take advantage of “all the state has to offer for five months and 29 days.”

“There is a snowbird tax -- absolutely,” he told reporters.

The purportedly first-of-its-kind tax would be difficult to enforce and is already facing opposing from state Republicans.

“I don’t even think that’s constitutional,” Senate Minority Leader David Hann told the MinnPost.com. “I don’t even know how you’d do that. (And) as far as I can see, there’s not a lot of money attached to it.”

Radel, argues in the letter, which appear written with pointed sarcasm to skewer higher taxes, that southwest Florida would welcome more entrepreneurs and philanthropists investing in the region. And he cited such incentives as no income taxes, investment incentives for big and small businesses and “great” public, charter and private schools.

“It's my sincere hope your plan has just driven many Minnesotans to become year-round residents of our great state,” he wrote. “I thank you for your policy. It draws the contrast of what is happening not only in United States today, but the world.”"

He Sketches The Foolish', 'The Fallacious', 'The Felonious In Politics.']",Dana Milbank: The McWeiners of the world,"Over two decades of covering politicians’ scandals, I’ve often been asked a version of this question: What makes them do such stupid things?

Based on my extensive experience, I respond with a version of this answer: I don’t know.

But I do have theories. And that brings me to this week’s McWeiner controversy.

Most news accounts treated these as two separate scandals: Anthony Weiner, the disgraced Democratic congressman and would-be mayor of New York, had been exposed again as a digital flasher, sending “selfie” pictures of his privates to women. Bob McDonnell, the Republican governor of Virginia, was found to be taking gifts and loans from a businessman McDonnell had helped.

Their offenses — particularly their responses upon being caught — are much the same.

By coincidence, both men found themselves apologizing for their misdeeds on the same day, July 23. McDonnell’s was cowardly, done via Twitter while he was out of the country; Weiner’s was handled in yet another bizarre news conference. But both were reluctant, their statements less expressions of contrition than naked efforts to make the problems go away. These were the apologies of narcissists.

“I want you to know that I broke no laws,” McDonnell wrote in a statement expressing regret not for the gifts he took but for “the embarrassment” — which occurred when he was found out.

Weiner, though acknowledging his misbehavior, quickly pivoted to blaming others. “With 49 days left until primary day, perhaps I’m surprised that more things didn’t come out sooner,” he said. “This was a very public thing that we had happen to us,” he added, as if somebody else had forced him to send out photos of his genitals.

Their offenses are similarly pointless: Weiner threw away a promising career by exchanging smut with women he claims he never met. McDonnell, once mentioned as a possible presidential candidate, undid his reputation by accepting sums — a $6,500 Rolex, a $15,000 splurge at Bergdorf Goodman — that were trivial compared to those he could have earned after leaving office.

Both men seem to have the condition that afflicts so many officeholders who get into trouble, from Clinton to Foley to Sanford to Spitzer: a sense of invincibility, and a belief that the usual rules don’t apply to them. They take ever bigger risks, as if it is a form of thrill-seeking, or they can no longer gauge risk.

Weiner’s was particularly flamboyant: On the day in 2010 when the House voted to approve Obamacare, and Republican lawmakers stood on the House balcony riling a tea party crowd below, Weiner showed up and taunted the gathering. “I feel like Mussolini now!” he said.

The narcissistic strain is common, and it predates the rise to power. It takes a certain personality to believe that one is meant to lead. This is reinforced once in power by sycophantic staffers. The problem has become worse as congressional redistricting leaves more lawmakers with safe seats, but the phenomenon is not Washington’s alone: McDonnell honed his invincibility in Richmond, and Weiner continued his behavior after resigning his House seat.

Whatever the origins, the McWeiner apologies show what happens when the lawmaker’s innate grandiosity is nurtured. From McDonnell’s Twitter account came this message: “Gov Bob McDonnell releases important statement: Repaid loans, apologized,” as if checking boxes. The tweet also cited a “report” — issued by one of McDonnell’s lawyers — saying the company of the businessman who sponsored McDonnell received “no benefit.”

It later emerged that McDonnell was in Kuwait and Afghanistan when the perfunctory apologizing was occurring. He gave a satellite interview to a Washington TV station, saying with a smile, “I’m not going anywhere. I love this job.”

Likewise, when Weiner was asked at his news conference what he would say to “those people who want you to drop out of the race,” he shot back: “I’m sure many of my opponents would like me to drop out of the race.”

McDonnell padded his brief statement with a proclamation that “Virginia has never been stronger and I plan to focus on creating even more jobs.”

Weiner, in turn, said the new revelations -- that he continued sexting even after his wife told People magazine last summer that he had reformed himself -- doesn’t change “the fundamentals of my feelings here, and that is that I want to bring my vision to the people of the city of New York. I hope they’re willing to still continue to give me a second chance.”

Or a third chance. Whatever the number, the McWeiners will always think they deserve it.

Jim DeMint, now the president of the conservative Heritage Foundation, said Tuesday that his former colleagues’ largely secret negotiations about immigration reform are troubling. A bipartisan group, dubbed the “Gang of Eight,” has been spearheading immigration reform efforts for months, and no legislative text has been presented to date. When it is presented, Democratic leadership in the Senate and Republican leadership in the House are expected to try to rush the bill through to passage.

In remarks to the Heritage Foundation’s Blogger’s Briefing on Tuesday, DeMint expressed concern over the behind-closed-doors formulation of legislation, which he knows from experience is actually being written by special interests and staffers. “And the members who are involved with this haven’t seen it or read it. They’re being told what’s going to be in it,” he said.

“What we believe at Heritage is that this should be an open and transparent process, and it should be step-by-step so Americans can be brought along with what needs to be changed,” DeMint added. “In 1986 we had three million unlawful folks in our country, promises were made on the floor of the House and Senate that if we gave an amnesty this would never happen again. We would secure our borders, we would fix our system.” Neither of these promises were kept.

The Heritage Foundation is currently drafting a peer-reviewed research analysis aimed at discovering the true cost of immigration reform to taxpayers. Details of the Heritage analysis, being conducted by Robert Rector, have not been made public yet. But the Senate Budget Committee Republican staff estimates immigration reform will cost taxpayers trillions more in entitlement and welfare spending. “What Heritage is doing right now and we’re working with some of best guys in the business, scholars like Robert Rector who developed the groundbreaking welfare reform research and policy work and he developed the cost that a lot of us used back in 2007 that helped us realize that this was not free,” DeMint said, referring to Rector’s report “The Fiscal Cost of Low-Skill Immigrants to the U.S. Taxpayer.”

The former Senator drew a distinction between the average taxpayer and representatives of labor and business who are involved in drafting the legislation. “Amnesty is not a free proposition to taxpayers. So we’re going to quantify that cost. I can guarantee you Heritage will be the only organization in the country that is looking at the true cost of a blanket amnesty proposal.”

Americans for Tax Report and the Cato Institute have already attacked Heritage and Rector, claiming that Rector’s 2007 study was flawed. When asked about the preemptive strike, DeMint replied: “Criticism of a report they hadn’t seen yet? Sounds like Washington.”"
"http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-supreme-court-patents-human-genes-20130415,0,2991661.story",2013-04-15 07:00:00,"['David G. Savage Has Covered The Supreme Court', 'Legal Issues For The Los Angeles Times In The Washington Bureau Since']",Supreme Court critical of patents on human genes,"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court justices said Monday they were highly skeptical of the idea that a company or a scientist can hold a patent on human genes and prevent others from testing or using them.

“What about the first person who found a liver?” asked Justice Elena Kagan.

She was agreeing with other justices who said patents should not be given for “products of nature,” whether they are plant leaves that cure a disease or tiny parts of the human body.

Justice Stephen Breyer said patent law involves an “uneasy compromise” because it seeks to advance science and innovation by giving an inventor a temporary monopoly to profit from an advance.

If inventors devise a new use for a substance, they can patent this use, he said. But they cannot patent the underlying substance, he added. “It’s important to keep products of nature free” for use by all, he said.

During the argument Monday, most of the justices questioned the decision of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to grant Myriad Genetics a patent on two isolated gene sequences that signal a high risk of breast or ovarian cancer.

Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said Myriad had simply “snipped” part of the gene sequence. It did not invent a new product, but simply found a way to isolate part of the human DNA, he said.

Because of Myriad’s patents, the Utah company has been able to profit from testing women who are concerned about their inherited risk of the two cancers.

Four years ago, breast cancer patients and medical researchers sued to challenge Myriad’s patents, arguing that human genes themselves could not be subject to patent protection.

These patents “cover the genes of every man, woman and child,” Christoper Hansen of the American Civil Liberties Union told the court. It “can’t be right,” he said, that a private company can hold monopoly control over genes from the human body.

A lawyer from Myriad argued that the company had devoted years of research to isolating the human genes and the mutations that are correlated with a high risk of cancer. “It would be dangerous,” he said, for the court to backtrack and to deny patents to innovators who make scientific advances using natural products.

But the justices did not sound convinced. “I don’t see how this is different from snipping,” Roberts said. If snipping the leaf of a medicinal plant could not be patented, snipping a gene sequence is not enough to obtain a patent either, he said.

This case of patients versus patents has drawn extraordinary interest because of its potential to reshape the law on biotechnology and personalized medicine.

For more than 30 years, the U.S. patent office has been granting patents to those who isolate living cells and make new uses of them, whether they are bacteria, plant seeds or human cells.

The biotech industry says these patents have spurred advances in medicine and agriculture. About half of the drugs in modern use and most anti-cancer drugs are derived from natural organisms, they say.

Advertisement

But the Supreme Court has grown increasing skeptical of patents and the apparent willingness of the U.S. patent office to grant inventors and innovators a 20-year monopoly over the use of formulas and processes.

Last year, the high court unanimously rejected a patent for a personalized medicine dosing formula that was held by Prometheus Labs. The justices said this formula, which relied on a blood test to guide doctors on the proper dose of a drug that treats auto-immune disorders, rested on a “law of nature” and therefore, could not be patented.

“Einstein could not patent his celebrated law that E=mc2, nor could Newton have patented the law of gravity,” said Justice Stephen Breyer. “Such discoveries are ‘manifestations of ... nature, free to all men and reserved exclusively to none’,” he added, quoting from a 1948 opinion.

The justices then issued a one-line order telling a federal patent court to take another look at the gene patents held by Myriad Genetics, the company based in Salt Lake City.

In 2009, the American Civil Liberties Union and Public Patent Foundation had sued on behalf of the cancer patients and medical professionals to challenge the validity of Myriad’s gene patents. They argued that giving one company a monopoly over a distinctive gene sequence resulted in patients paying too much for testing, and it prevented them from getting a second opinion from other medical experts.

But they lost in the federal circuit court that oversees patent appeals. It upheld Myriad’s patents in 2011, and it did so again last year, despite the warning from the high court. The patent judges held that the isolating of the particular gene mutation that signals a risk of cancer was a “new and useful” invention that can be patented.

Even though Myriad’s patents are due to expire within two years, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the ACLU’s contention that genes cannot be patented.

A decision in the case of Assn. for Molecular Pathology vs. Myriad Genetics can be expected by the end of June.

Fire Chief Brian Cummings to step down, mayor says","Los Angeles Fire Chief Brian Cummings will retire from his position as head of the city Fire Department, according to Mayor Eric Garcetti and a department spokesman.

Cummings had struggled to restore confidence in his management of the 3,500-employee department after officials admitted last year to misstating emergency-response times, making it appear that rescuers arrived faster than they actually did.

During his campaign, Garcetti said he lacked confidence in the fire chief’s leadership and second-guessed a series of the chief’s management decisions.

“By mutual agreement, we’ve come to an understanding on a leadership change with Chief Cummings,” Garcetti said in a brief interview as he walked into City Hall on Thursday morning. “He’ll be stepping aside as chief.”

Cummings previously said he would like to remain chief until at least 2018. His retirement was confirmed by an LAFD spokesman, Battalion Chief Armando Hogan.

When he took office, Garcetti called on the city’s top department heads to reapply for their jobs and explain how they would achieve key goals. So far, he has told at least seven they will get to stay, including Gina Marie Lindsey at Los Angeles World Airports and Michael LoGrande at the Department of City Planning.

One high-level executive, Geraldine Knatz at the Port of Los Angeles, announced last week that she will retire at the end of the year.

A second-generation firefighter with more than 30 years of service with the LAFD, Cummings was appointed chief by then-Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa in 2011. Last year he earned nearly $300,000 as the agency’s top officer, city records show.

As an assistant chief, Cummings helped devise a data-heavy, cost-cutting plan to trim LAFD resources to help cope with fiscal constraints caused by the economic downturn, a measure Garcetti supported when he was president of the City Council.

When the previous fire chief retired, Villaraigosa picked Cummings to fill the job, praising him as the “visionary architect” of the new staffing plan.

That reputation was undermined after last year’s admission of faulty response times when a task force of experts concluded that fire officials charged with managing department statistics under Cummings were poorly qualified and that previous LAFD data analysis “should not be relied upon.”

Times investigations found delays in processing 911 calls and summoning the nearest medical rescuers from other jurisdictions, as well as wide gaps in response times in different parts of the city.

Many of those problems have been blamed on the department’s often outdated technology. Members of the city Fire Commission, the county’s Civil Grand Jury and the City Council have called for a sweeping overhaul of the department’s data systems.

Expensive upgrades are already in the works, including the installation of GPS devices on rescue vehicles, the replacement of the 911 call center’s faulty dispatch database and fixes to the alarm system that alerts rescuers at the department’s 106 fire stations.

The department is also developing a new data analysis unit, modeled on a highly-touted team at the Los Angeles Police Department.

With more than 3,500 employees, the LAFD is one of the largest municipal fire departments in the United States.

In the city budget, the amount of money directed to the Fire Department is second only to the LAPD. The department spends more than $500 million a year to pay and train firefighters, maintain a fleet with hundreds of special rescue apparatus, answer 911 calls, enforce fire codes and monitor hazardous waste.

Former Alaska governor accuses Obama of failing to lead

She says the GOP needs to turn away from Washington consultants

Palin reprises her folksy%2C down-home %22hockey mom%22 theme

OXON HILL, Md. — Former GOP vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin mocked President Obama, GOP consultant Karl Rove and the mainstream media in a folksy speech to a gathering of conservative activists outside Washington Saturday.

During her address to the Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, Palin accused Obama of failing to lead, instead maintaining a permanent campaign approach of demonizing the opposition.

True leadership, she said, means ""ending the poisonous practice of treating members of different social, ethnic and religious groups as different electorates, pandered to with different promises."" If all men are created equal, as the Declaration of Independence states, Palin said, then there are ""no Hispanic issues or African-American issues or women's issues — there are only American issues.""

The former Alaska governor also mocked Obama's proposals for stricter gun rules, tying the issue to conspiracy theories about the president's own citizenship. ""More background checks? Dandy idea, Mr. President — should have started with yours.""

But Palin also turned on Republican leaders such as Rove, who President George W. Bush once called the architect of his electoral victories. Rove has recently said Republicans need to choose candidates who are more ""electable"" and less ideologically contentious.

""The last thing we need is Washington, D.C., vetting our candidates,"" Palin said. ""The architects can head on back to the great Lone Star state and put their names on some ballot.""

Palin's speech was full of the kind of down-home humor and references to her life as a ""hockey mom from Wasilla"" that made her a star during the 2008 election season. Her biggest applause line Saturday was a double-entendre about the Christmas gifts she exchanged with her husband, Todd. She said he bought her a gun locker to put on a truck, and she bought him a gun. So, ""he's got the rifle, I've got the rack,"" she said.

While the crowd stood and cheered at the line from a country song, Palin took a Big Gulp soda from behind the lectern and sipped from a straw, noting that it was OK since New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg was not around. Bloomberg, an independent, has tried to ban the sale of large-size sugary sodas in the Big Apple, a move that drew outrage from the soft drink industry and civil libertarians who charged it was an overreach of authority.

Palin's selection as the GOP vice presidential nominee in 2008 ignited the Republican base, and her speech at the Republican convention — her first major national appearance — made her an instant hero to conservatives. But during the campaign she appeared at times confused or unprepared, and Democrats pounced on her gaffes.

After the campaign, Palin remained a force in Republican politics, and in several 2010 campaigns, her endorsement was critical in raising the public profile and the fundraising efforts of conservative candidates. Freshman Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who was scheduled to give the keynote address at CPAC Saturday night, introduced Palin on Saturday, saying, ""I would not be in the U.S. Senate today if it were not for Gov. Sarah Palin.""

In 2010, Palin signed on as a commentator with Fox News, but that relationship ended at the beginning of this year. She has since seen her public profile wane.

She toyed with the idea of a possible presidential campaign in 2012, but ultimately decided not to run.

During a hearing in Sacramento, several justices of the state high court indicated they were not convinced that Stephen Glass, 41, who concocted articles for the New Republic and other magazines in the mid-1990s, had shown enough evidence of rehabilitation to be permitted to practice law.

Justice Joyce L. Kennard spoke at length of articles that Glass had fabricated and the importance of honesty in the law.

Chief Justice Tani Cantil-Sakauye observed that Glass was involved in a “a depth of deception that was pretty sophisticated.”

Justice Marvin Baxter noted that Glass’ prior conduct was not an isolated incident, but a pattern “over a long period of time.”

Justice Ming W. Chin said Glass had benefited from his misconduct by earning money from a novel he wrote about his experience.

As the court’s leanings became increasingly clear, Glass appeared to slump in his chair. Dressed in a suit and tie, he was seated near the front of the ornate courtroom next to his fiancee. He declined to comment afterward and left the courthouse alone with his girlfriend, his hands in his pockets and his head down.

Glass wrote 42 magazine stories that were wholly or partially fabricated before he was caught in 1998. He was in his mid-20s. He made up phony notes, a fictional website, fake business cards and bogus voice-mail messages to try to cover up his fabrications.

After leaving journalism in disgrace, Glass graduated from Georgetown Law School and applied for admission to the New York bar but withdrew that application after learning he would be rejected on moral grounds. He eventually moved to California, settling in Los Angeles, and landed a job at a personal injury law firm.

The California bar denied Glass a law license in 2009, but a state bar court approved him for admission after a 10-day confidential bar trial. A bar committee in charge of admissions appealed, and a bar appeals court also ruled for him. The bar committee then asked the California Supreme Court to deny him a license.

The Supreme Court is to rule on Glass’ case within 90 days.

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

(CNN) —

A row of 12 coffins, each draped with a flag, symbolizes the human cost of an explosion that destroyed much of a small Texas town and left the residents of that town searching for answers.

Hundreds of firefighters from across the nation and other first-responders joined grieving families and President Barack Obama and the first lady at the Ferrell Center in Waco, site of a memorial service Thursday for some of the people killed in a fertilizer plant explosion last week in the nearby town of West.

The president told the crowd that no words adequately describe the courage displayed by those who died.

“What I can do is offer the love and support and prayers of the nation,” Obama said.

Obama told the families and friends of the those killed that they were not forgotten, saying “our hearts have been here in your time of tribulation.”

He promised them the nation will help them rebuild and reclaim their small community of about 3,000 people.

Before the president and first lady Michelle Obama joined the residents of West at the service at Baylor University, the president’s helicopter flew over West and circled several times over the flattened structures and scarred earth.

The Obamas met privately with the families after the service.

Texas Gov. Rick Perry promised the families of the first-responders who died that their loved ones would not be forgotten.

“First-responders know better than anyone that there’s no such thing as a routine emergency,” Perry told the crowd, “but it didn’t slow them down as they raced toward that burning factory.”

Perry urged the families to remember that “the spirit that drove those men we love – they live on” and asked the crowd to “let their deeds serve as an inspiration” to service of others.

The families of the victims recorded emotional video tributes that were played during the service. Some were somber, some were mixed with light-hearted memories. All drew tears.

“Cyrus always hated the word ‘hero,’” said Bryce Reed, whose brother was attending a EMT class when the fire that preceded the explosion began. “He and I shared the belief that heroes are persons (whose names) are etched in marble. And that a hero is a sacred and solemn term reserved for only those who paid the ultimate price when others would falter or run.

“My brother would disagree, but I firmly believe that all privy to this incident can attest that my brother and all those who lay with him are heroes now and forever.”

Earlier, as the service began, everyone in the arena stood in complete silence as family and friends of the victims filed in. Some of the family members wept as they passed the flag-draped coffins – 10 with American flags and two with Texas flags – and photos in front of each one.

Family members hugged one another when they arrived at their seats.

The service – which honored the 10 first-responders killed April 17 and two friends of first-responders who also answered the call – included roll call as the name of each victim was read, followed by one toll from a bell. An officer at the foot of each coffin saluted.

Then the bell rang five times, paused, rang five more times, paused again, and rang a final five times to signal the fallen had answered their final call.

Each family was given a flag and a helmet in remembrance. A bagpiper played “Amazing Grace.”

In all, 14 people were killed by the blast, including two other people who died in their apartment nearby.

Before Thursday’s service, emotions were raw in Waco, the central Texas city about 20 miles south of the scene of the blast.

Many onlookers cried as they lined the street outside as a procession of fire trucks slowly passed. One man held a large Texas flag, bowed his head and rested a cowboy hat over his heart.

Hundreds of bikers from the Patriot Guard stood at attention as the rescue vehicles passed by.

Before leaving Washington, Obama signed a proclamation ordering all flags in the state to be flown at half-staff for the day.

City workers from Waco replaced West workers Thursday so they could attend funerals and take a break from trying to repair the city’s water system and cleaning up the town.

On Wednesday, an American flag was raised and a bugler played taps at a memorial service at the blast site. A few miles away, one of the victims, Kenneth “Luckey” Harris Jr., was laid to rest. Harris, a 52-year-old Dallas firefighter who lived in West, was one of the first-responders who died. One of the coffins at Thursday’s service represented Harris.

Hundreds of firefighters from Dallas and other areas surrounding West came for the funeral, the first to be held for the responders killed in the blast. Firefighters lined the sidewalk as Harris’ flag-draped coffin was carried out and loaded into the back of a Dallas fire truck to be carried to the cemetery. Bagpipes played as the coffin went through the crowd.

Before and after: Texas plant explosion

The investigation continues

“Shovel by shovel,” investigators are combing through the charred remains of the leveled fertilizer distributor after the April 17 explosion in West.

Much of the landscape surrounding the West Fertilizer Co. in West, Texas, is unrecognizable. What was once a corn silo appears to have crumpled in the force of the blast. A blue tarp covers the shell of a rail car.

Left is a crater nearly 100 feet wide and 10 feet deep that was once the site of a building. The crater is now filled with mangled metal and crumbs of mortar. Concrete chunks – some the size of shopping carts – are strewn hundreds of yards away from the blast site.

Losses from the explosion will probably top $100 million, said Mark Hanna, a spokesman for the Insurance Council of Texas.

But amid the devastation, forensic mappers are hoping to find clues.

Hundreds of small pink flags indicate anything on the ground that crews want forensic investigators to take a closer look at.

Officials face a difficult task in reconstructing the fire that preceded the deadly explosion. Still unknown: what types of chemicals and in what quantities were stored at the facility.

Putting the pieces together

One official likened the investigation to a jigsaw puzzle.

“Right now, think of that coffee table where all 100 pieces are gathered around,” Brian Hoback, an official with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, told the San-Antonio Express News. “Now, we’re going to pull them together.”

ATF Special Agent in Charge Robert Champion said determining what started the initial fire is “the key.”

“We feel the explosion was caused by the fire so we’ve got to determine what the cause and the origin of the fire was, and that’s why we’re … attempting to re-enact that fire scene,” Champion said. “A fire scene is complicated in itself. But you compound that with an explosion and it really complicates the issue.”

So far, investigators have ruled out the possibility that natural causes ignited the fire.

MR. VENTRELL: Well, again, first of all, as I’ve said repeatedly here, there’s an ongoing FBI investigation. The Secretary was simply expressing broad concern about radicalism and not necessarily offering any more specific information about this case. But the context of how that came up was really – radicalism broadly, I understand, is how the question came up. But this isn’t about any new information or conclusion about law enforcement details of this case.

QUESTION: Let me just – because I want to be clear on this point. From reading the transcript – no U.S. press were present, so we are reading the transcript – it seems that Kerry is suggesting that Tamerlan was radicalized during his time in Russia. You’re saying that that is not what he meant to say and that he was speaking more broadly about radicalization.

MR. VENTRELL: Right. I’m clarifying his remarks and saying that he was simply expressing broad concern about radicalism. This isn’t about new details about the ongoing investigation.

QUESTION: So when he learned something, it was about radicalism, but he learned about radicalism; he wasn’t radicalized? That doesn’t make too much sense to me.

MR. VENTRELL: Again, my understanding of this informal press availability is that there was a question broadly about terrorism and foreign fighters, and it was in that context that he was saying that people can be radicalized by extremism. But this isn’t about drawing any conclusions about the specific law enforcement investigation.

QUESTION: So what did he learn? He learned something.

MR. VENTRELL: Again, we’re not getting into any more details about the —

QUESTION: Right. But you put out a statement and the clarification doesn’t clarify anything. So did he learn – was he radicalized in Russia?

She denounced ads that use cartoon characters to push junk food. She bluntly told executives “to step it up” to improve the foods they market to children.

And she promoted a White House “action plan” on obesity that praised a federal effort to come up with voluntary marketing guidelines — the most significant attempt in decades to limit ads targeting children.

But when food and media companies — including many that supported her anti-obesity campaign — mounted a fierce lobbying battle against the guidelines in 2011, the first lady went silent.

It wasn’t until earlier this year, after the guidelines had been blocked, that Obama resumed her call for more responsible food marketing.

Nutrition advocates disagree over how to rein in food and beverage company practices that they believe contribute to obesity, including the roughly $1.8 billion spent each year on marketing to kids: Will companies respond to voluntary efforts or only to government pressure?

Obama has come down on the side of persuasion. She has used her celebrity to reward corporations that join her campaign to encourage children to eat better and exercise more. And she has largely avoided public policy fights that could pit her against the companies, arguing that obesity cannot be eradicated “by passing a bunch of laws in Washington.”

Administration officials say she has notched some notable successes, and they blame Congress for killing the marketing guidelines.

But some who see themselves as Obama’s allies in the fight against obesity believe her desire to create partnerships with industry kept her quiet when her voice would have counted most. Fourteen companies that back Obama’s anti-obesity campaign helped kill the voluntary advertising guidelines, lobbying reports and other records show.

“The White House got cold feet,” said Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), who had championed the guidelines. “It sort of undermines everything that the first lady was doing.”

Since Obama launched “Let’s Move!” in February 2010, White House officials have insisted that working with industry is the only way to achieve the first lady’s goal of ending the epidemic of childhood obesity in a generation.

“Business and business leaders are a vital component of the solution,” said Sam Kass, the executive director of Let’s Move! and the first lady’s senior policy advisor on nutrition. Obama declined a request for an interview.

The administration did secure industry backing for a requirement that restaurant menus list calorie information. And the first lady rallied support for a 2010 law that expanded the free school lunch program and set nutritional standards for food sold in schools.

But many public health advocates believe a more forceful approach is needed to limit food marketing.

“The industry has proven itself untrustworthy,” said Kelly D. Brownell of Duke University, a leading expert on obesity who has sometimes advised Obama’s program. “Somebody needs to lean on these companies more strongly.”

Obama has worked through the Partnership for a Healthier America; she is honorary chairwoman of the nonprofit group, which was set up to negotiate pledges from food providers to fight childhood obesity.

Wal-Mart has agreed to promote more healthful foods and build grocery stores in underserved neighborhoods. Darden, owner of the Olive Garden and other restaurants, promised to improve its children’s menus. And 16 food and beverage manufacturers, including Kraft, General Mills and Nestle, pledged to cut calories from their products.

The organization, however, has secured only a few pledges to change the way companies market food.

As she stepped up her campaign, the first lady had forcefully urged companies to limit advertising to kids.

“What does it mean when so many parents are finding that their best efforts are undermined by an avalanche of advertisements aimed at their kids?” she asked in a speech to the Grocery Manufacturers Assn. in March 2010. “And what are these ads teaching kids about food and nutrition ... that it’s OK to eat unhealthy foods because they’re endorsed by the cartoon characters our children love and the celebrities our teenagers look up to?”

Public health advocates thought Obama would lead a change in how products were marketed to children. As far back as 2005, a report by the prestigious Institute of Medicine had found that television advertising influenced children, even toddlers, to seek out foods high in sugar, salt and fat, making the issue a central one for nutrition advocates.

“This is one of the easiest areas where we could take action and have a very powerful effect,” said Dale Kunkel, a University of Arizona communications professor who studies the effect of advertising on children.

In 2009, Congress approved a Harkin-sponsored measure to set up an interagency working group to write voluntary nutrition standards for products advertised to children.

The White House monitored the group’s progress, said Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, a brother of then-Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel and a physician who helped develop the Let’s Move! campaign. “A number of us at the White House were obviously interested in this,” he said.

So were the food and media industries. General Mills Chief Executive Kendall J. Powell met with White House officials, including senior advisor Valerie Jarrett. In a letter to the White House in September 2010, he argued that no evidence linked obesity to ads.

Powell suggested the working group should “be put on hold” while food companies improved the Children’s Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative, a self-regulatory effort they set up in 2006.

The working group released draft guidelines in April 2011, acknowledging that its voluntary standards were ambitious: Foods advertised to children should have minimal levels of sugar, salt and fat, and make a “meaningful contribution” to diets by containing nutrients, they said.

The group proposed that its standards apply to all ads aimed at children 17 and younger. “A large percentage” of products advertised to children would not meet the guidelines, the panel noted, suggesting the standards be phased in over at least five years.

Public health groups such as the American Academy of Pediatrics embraced the guidelines, but food manufacturers, media companies and trade associations mounted a furious pushback.

“This was just such a dramatic overreach,” said Louis Finkel, the top lobbyist for the Grocery Manufacturers Assn. “There would have been thousands of products swept into this.”

Top food and media corporations hired the firm of former White House communications director Anita Dunn to develop a public relations campaign. Dunn said she did not contact the White House on the issue, noting that federal ethics rules barred her from such communications at the time. About 30 companies flooded Capitol Hill with lobbyists, spending four times as much in 2011 as they had the year before.

“It was probably the most opposition I’ve ever seen mounted against any nutrition policy I’ve worked on in 20 years,” said Margo Wootan, director of nutrition policy at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer group pushing for the guidelines.

::

The lobbying included a July 2011 meeting at the White House, again with Jarrett, which included General Mills’ Powell and top executives from Nestle, Kellogg, Disney, Time Warner and Viacom, the parent company of the Nickelodeon network. The companies all supported the first lady’s anti-obesity initiative.

Jarrett declined to comment. A General Mills spokeswoman said Powell did not discuss the company’s participation in Obama’s effort at the meetings.

Two days later, top food manufacturers rolled out a more rigorous version of their self-regulatory effort. The companies pledged to follow a single nutrition standard that limits the levels of sugar, salt and fat in products targeted at children.

The group, which now comprises 17 companies, gave itself until the end of this year to make the changes.

Elaine Kolish, a former Federal Trade Commission official who directs the effort, said about one-third of the products those companies market to children have to be reformulated. “They’re on track,” she said.

The industry’s actions could significantly improve the nutritional value of food marketed to children, but still allows many products to be fortified with vitamins, rather than use ingredients that naturally provide nutrients, experts said.

Advertisement

It also does not limit appeals in sponsorships of after-school events or on product packages, as the working group guidelines had proposed. And it applies only to foods advertised on programs for which at least 35% of viewers are under 12.

A study by Yale University’s Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity found that half the food and drink ads seen by children in 2011 were not covered by the pledge because they aired on shows with broader demographics, such as “Family Guy.”

A week after the chief executives’ July 2011 meeting with Jarrett, their chief lobbyists were invited to the White House to attend an event with the first lady, who announced a commitment from Wal-Mart and other companies to open new stores in neighborhoods that lack full-scale grocers, so-called food deserts.

Obama promoted Nickelodeon’s “Worldwide Day of Play” that September at an event hosted by the network. Nickelodeon — which licenses SpongeBob SquarePants to market Popsicles — in 2011 aired a quarter of food ads viewed by children ages 2 to 11, according to the Yale Rudd Center. The network recently rebuffed a request by four Democratic senators to set stricter nutrition standards for the products advertised.

In November 2011, Obama spoke at the inaugural summit of the Partnership for a Healthier America, praising food manufacturers for cutting sugar, salt and fat from their products. She did not mention marketing.

“The first lady was completely disengaged,” said Wootan, who has advised the Partnership. “It was disappointing.”

The working group proposed concessions to industry, but in December the guidelines were effectively killed when Congress required a cost-benefit analysis that officials said was too onerous to perform.

Harkin said he tried to rally administration support. “It was always, ‘We’re looking at it, we’ll see what we can do. The industry, you know, is working with us, and they have their own little deal that they came up with,’” the senator said. “It became clear to me that they just weren’t going to do it.”

::

Dr. William Dietz, a member of the working group who recently retired as head of the nutrition division at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said he believed the White House stayed out of the fight for political reasons.

“The whole work of the interagency working group was going on at the same time that the Partnership for a Healthier America was building relationships with industry,” he said. “I suspect those two things were a bit at odds with one another.”

White House officials pointed the finger at lawmakers. “We were very disappointed when Congress granted the food industry’s request and placed new demands on the working group,” Kass said.

Still, the first lady has continued to share the stage with companies that worked to kill the guidelines.

Last year, she appeared with Walt Disney Co.'s CEO and teamed up with Nickelodeon for an event at the Olympics.

This February, she promoted a new effort to increase exercise in schools, an initiative backed in part by $10 million from the General Mills Foundation. The company makes some of the cereals most heavily advertised to children, including Cinnamon Toast Crunch and Lucky Charms, as well as gummy snacks branded with the preschool character Dora the Explorer.

At a summit in March, Obama returned to her tough talk on ads that target children. “Our kids are surrounded by food advertisements on TV and the Internet, on billboards and in stores, and even in their schools,” she said.

With leaders of major food, beverage and media companies in the audience, Obama didn’t single out any for criticism. But she did praise by name those that had “stepped up to set new standards for responsible marketing.”

“While we’re seeing some progress,” the first lady said, “we know that we still have a lot of work to do.”

Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (R) called out President Barack Obama for closing the U.S. embassy to the Vatican, questioning whether the decision was political ""retribution"" for Catholic opposition to the Affordable Care Act.

Bush tweeted about the closure on Wednesday evening:

Why would our President close our Embassy to the Vatican? Hopefully, it is not retribution for Catholic organizations opposing Obamacare. — Jeb Bush (@JebBush) November 27, 2013

Last week, the State Department announced that it would be moving the embassy from its standalone Vatican facility to a larger compound shared with the U.S. Embassy in Italy, as well as the U.S. Mission to the United Nations. According to Religion News Service, the move is anticipated to save the government $1.4 million a year.

Conservatives were quick to criticize Obama on the move.

As CNN reports, the National Republican Senatorial Committee described the relocation as ""the latest anti-religion pursuit of this Administration, a slap in the face to Catholic-Americans around the country that weakens America’s position as a global leader.""

""It's not just those who bomb churches and kill Catholics in the Middle East who are our antagonists, but it's also those who restrict our religious freedoms and want to close down our embassy to the Holy See,"" Raymond Flynn, a former envoy to the Vatican, told the National Catholic Reporter.

The administration, however, maintains that the move is not indicative of any strain on the United States' relationship with the Vatican.

According to CNN, a State Department official said the move will result in ""no reduction in diplomatic staff, there’s no reduction in ambassadors, there’s no reduction in mission.""

Obviously.And they would've gotten away with it too, if it wasn't for these dastardly Free Republic kids!No freakin' clue. None! For example, who knows why I call my son Aristotle ""Ari""? And no one has a clue why we call my daughter Elisandra ""Eli"". These are deep, deep mysteries.

So it's probably because they're deep undercover spies.



At least they didn’t name her Tawanna or Tasheka.

Malia . . . Malcolm X?

... because then you'd have a real reason to hate them?Sure. You go with that.

Or, you could stick with reality. Your choice.



do any of these people use their real names?

Sasha never was short for Natasha in Russian, that part is nonsense. Sasha is short for Alexandra, and Natasha is short for Nataliya. Then why, in the Obamas' minds, is Sasha the short form of Natahsa? It could not be an affinity for things Russian, since that would imply ignorance. I think 'Sasha' is simply their nickname for her.

My dog was named Sasha...She was a fluffy, snow white cockapoo. Not sure why I decided on that name...but it must have come from my somewhere in my Russian background. Both my grandparents were Russian.

I’ve been talking that up for some time as yet another symbol of obozo’s loyalty to the communist agenda (as if we needed one).

Natasha spelled backwards is Ah Satan!

When did the Obamas change their daughters names from Malaria and Sharia?

Natasha is also an Arabic Muslim name, which means gift of their moon idol.

obummer is fair game. IMHO, the girls aren’t.

It was Barky and Mantoinette's adult decision to choose a Russian name for their baby so that is certainly fair game. They made many calculated political decisions including later not using her given name. One of the reasons thin skinned Barky absolutely hates Mittens is that Mittens has 5 sons and he has none.

It is the fact they have been lying about this and everything else since this all started that is the issue.

Lets ask everyone named Bob, Bill, Jen, Dick, Mike, and Liz, for starters. Also, why is Mitch McConnell hiding his real name, in plain sight? (Addison Mitchell, by the way.)Holy crap, could that be it? Seems like a craaaaaazy theory!Your dog was a KGB spy. Admit it!Uh oh, is someone trying to bogart your credit for cracking this mystery?Case closed!A look at their birth certificates should clear tha... what, now they're questioningMake up your minds! Commie or terrorist!Sensible, except ...What the-- That sound was my jaw hitting the floor. I'm serious. It was a five-foot drop.My jaw ain't leaving the floor."

U.S. Capitol Hill Police and the FBI are looking into series posts made against the Texas Republican by a person identifying himself as Troy Gilmore Jr., who used the Twitter handle @ArmyVet54 and described himself as a military veteran.

""Take down Ted Cruz, at his home,"" read one post. Another post said, ""What goes around comes around CRUZ!!""

Many of the messages were posted while Congress was negotiating to raise the nation's borrowing authority and to find a way to reopen the government after a two-week shutdown.

Cruz, a favorite of the conservative Tea Party movement, has been a leading critic of President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law which was a focal point of the fiscal fight in Congress.

""It's an active investigation,"" said Officer Shennell Antrobus, a spokesman for the Capitol Police. He declined to elaborate on the credibility of the threats.

It is often routine policy for authorities to look into potential threats that are made on social media sites and directed at members of Congress.

Cruz's office confirmed that they had referred the matter to the police last week.

""We're aware of the situation and have alerted the proper authorities,"" said Sean Rushton, a Cruz spokesman. (Reporting By Margaret Chadbourn; Editing by David Brunnstrom)"

Serrano Was A Federal Law Enforcement', 'Terrorism Reporter In The Los Angeles Times', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'Bureau. He Left The Times In']",George Zimmerman unlikely to face federal charges,"WASHINGTON — George Zimmerman is unlikely to face federal charges for killing black teenager Trayvon Martin because it would be difficult to prove he acted out of racial bias, Justice Department officials said Tuesday.

Four years ago, Congress adopted a stronger federal hate crimes act to empower federal prosecutors to go after violent crimes of bias. Since then, the Obama administration has won convictions against more than 140 defendants who chose their victims because they were gay, disabled or members of racial or religious minorities.

But a successful federal prosecution of Zimmerman would require clear evidence that he set out to attack the unarmed Martin because he was black.

Although that is exactly what many Americans see in the fatal shooting of the 17-year-old, it can be very hard to prove in court, legal experts said. So far, prosecutors have not shown evidence that Zimmerman acted out of racial bias.

“I’d be very, very surprised if we took it,” said one federal civil rights prosecutor, speaking anonymously because no decision had been made. “It’s a very tough, tough case to sell” because of the lack of witnesses.

“The difficult element would be proving racial motivation beyond a reasonable doubt,” said University of Michigan law professor Samuel Bagenstos, a former civil rights attorney in the Obama administration. “In most of these [hate crime] cases, you have someone who had made racial statements or you have a group who goes looking to attack a person based on their race.”

But in the confrontation between Zimmerman and Martin, “no one else was there who could testify about the motivation,” he said.

Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. said at the NAACP convention in Orlando, Fla., on Tuesday: “We are mindful of the tragic and unnecessary shooting death of Trayvon Martin last year — in Sanford, just a short distance from here.”

He reiterated that federal prosecutors had an “open investigation” into the shooting. “While that inquiry is ongoing, I can promise that the Department of Justice will consider all available information before determining what action to take,” he said.

Holder said laws like Florida’s “stand your ground” statute, which allow someone who feels in danger to respond with violence without retreating, must be “examined” because they eliminate “the common-sense and age-old requirement that people who feel threatened have a duty to retreat, outside their home, if they can do so safely.”

Benjamin Todd Jealous, president of the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People, has called on Holder and the Justice Department to prosecute Zimmerman on a hate crime charge.

“It is clear George Zimmerman’s bias played a major role in the events that led” to the shooting, Jealous said. He noted that Zimmerman had made dozens of calls to police, “disproportionately about young men of color who he thought were suspect.” He also noted that Zimmerman said on the night of attack, “These punks always get away with this.”

Jealous agreed the law required evidence of racial bias. “We believe there was enough evidence to satisfy that standard,” he said.

Some advocates also have called for charging Zimmerman with violating Martin’s civil rights. But a civil rights count is limited to defendants who act “under color of law” — that is, wielding government authority.

One such example involved four Los Angeles police officers who were acquitted in 1992 in the beating of motorist Rodney King. Federal officials later charged them with violating King’s constitutional rights; two officers were convicted. Zimmerman was not a police officer when he got out of his car to pursue Martin.

The 2009 hate crimes act was named for Matthew Shepard, a young Wyoming man who was brutally beaten and left to die because he was gay. The law made it a federal crime to “willfully cause bodily injury to any person” with a weapon or explosive device “because of” the person’s race, religion, national origin, disability, gender, gender identity or sexual orientation.

In early July, the U.S. court of appeals in Denver upheld the law as constitutional. That ruling came in the case of three white supremacists who had abducted a developmentally disabled Native American and brutally abused him, including branding a swastika on his skin with a hot coat hanger. Two of the men were sentenced to 8 1/2 years in prison, while the third received a lesser sentence.

Professor Bagenstos was the deputy to the Justice Department’s civil rights chief, Thomas E. Perez, during Obama’s first term. He said a successful prosecution would require more evidence than has come to light.

“Unless there is significant new evidence, I’d say it would be unlikely the department would bring a hate crimes charge,” Bagenstos said. “It would be very difficult to win, and they don’t bring charges they don’t think they can prove.”

Pawlowski'],Florida celebrates 500th anniversary,"Magic kingdoms, princesses and roller coasters usually dominate the itineraries of Florida visitors, but this week a Spanish explorer and a big moment in history are overshadowing them all.

Tuesday marks the 500th anniversary of Juan Ponce de León becoming the first recorded European to land on Florida's shores, or anywhere else in the current United States. Historians believe the event happened on or around April 2, 1513.

Arriving right around Easter, Ponce de León named the new land La Florida, meaning the ""land of flowers” and a reference to “Pascua Florida,” the Feast of Flowers -- Spain’s Easter celebration.

The state is marking the occasion with Viva Florida 500, a year-long celebration that began in January and is hitting a crescendo right now with “Viva Florida 500 Week.”

“We’re highlighting this to really stand out as the week within the year when that important moment in history occurred,” Chris Cate, a spokesman for the Florida Department of State, told NBC News.

“We think it’s a big deal not just from a tourism standpoint but an educational standpoint as well.”

A re-enactment of Ponce de León’s landing and the unveiling of a 10-foot statue of the explorer is taking place in Melbourne Beach on Tuesday.

If you missed that celebration, another re-enactment of the landing will take place in St. Augustine on Wednesday, complete with the firing of cannons from the Castillo de San Marcos. Meanwhile, the U.S. Post Office will commemorate the anniversary with the unveiling of the “La Florida” Forever stamp.

On Thursday, historical documents rarely glimpsed by the public -- including the state’s original 1838 Constitution and a 1586 map of Sir Francis Drake's West Indian voyage -- will go on display in the Department of State's Museum of Florida History.

But perhaps the most anticipated event is the arrival of “El Galeón,” a 170-foot, 495-ton wooden replica of a 16-century Spanish galleon. The ship left Puerto Rico on Monday and is sailing toward Florida, where it will call on ports in Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Cape Canaveral and St. Augustine later this month.

Tourism officials hope all that focus on history will expand travelers’ perceptions of the state, showing them it’s not all just about beaches and theme parks.

“By offering visitors a whole new reason to explore the Sunshine State in 2013 with events such as the upcoming arrival of El Galeon, we are continuing to increase the economic impact of travelers to Florida,” said Will Seccombe, president and CEO of Visit Florida, in a statement.

The goal is not just to attract more travelers, but to also convince the tourists who have come to visit a theme park to stay an extra day to explore Florida’s historic sites, Cate said. The state is reaching out to international visitors as well.

“This is a message we really want to carry world-wide… I do think there’s a lot of interest for overseas visitors to come to Florida and see how they helped shape our state,” Cate said, noting that beyond Spanish rule, the region was also under the British flag and the French flag during its history.

You can check out all of the events taking place as part of Viva Florida 500 on the initiative’s official website."

He Has Previously Covered Sports', 'Education', 'City Government', 'Reported Afghanistan', 'Pakistan']","Obama to announce his immigration reform plan, said to lean left of Senate effort","The Obama administration has developed its own proposals for immigration reform that are more liberal than a separate bipartisan effort in the Senate, including a quicker path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, people with knowledge of the proposals said.

President Obama is expected to provide some details of the White House plans during a Tuesday appearance in Las Vegas, where he will call for broad changes to the nation’s immigration laws. The speech will kick off a public push by the administration in support of the broadest overhaul of immigration law in nearly three decades.

Obama plans to praise the proposals laid out Monday by an eight-member Senate working group, saying they reflect the core tenets of the administration’s immigration blueprint developed in 2011, a senior administration official said.

But the president’s remarks also are likely to emphasize differences that could foreshadow roadblocks to passage in Congress at a time when both parties say there is momentum for a comprehensive deal.

For example, the Senate proposal would let illegal immigrants obtain legal residency quickly. But it would not allow them to seek full citizenship until border security had been improved and a new system was in place for employers to verify the employment status of workers.

Obama will not endorse such a proposal, the administration official said. The president intends to make clear the need for a more straightforward route for un­documented workers and students to obtain citizenship, reflecting fears among advocates that a cumbersome process would create a decades-long wait for some migrants.

“We see the Senate principles as a centrist set of principles, but we expect the administration to be more detailed to the left,” said Frank Sharry, executive director of America’s Voice, a leading immigration advocacy group. “I don’t think it’ll be an immigration advocate’s dream, but it will be a solid left-of-center proposal.”

White House press secretary Jay Carney sought to close the gap between the White House and the Senate group during his daily briefing with reporters Monday, calling the Capitol Hill announcement “a big deal” because it includes a path to citizenship supported by four senators from each party. Similar provisions — opposed by many Republicans who think they would reward lawbreakers over those who come to the country legally — helped doom previous attempts to overhaul immigration in 2007 and 2010.

“This is in keeping with the principles the president has been espousing for a long time, in keeping with bipartisan efforts in the past and with the effort this president believes has to end in a law that he can sign,” Carney said.

He declined to say whether the White House objects to the proposal from the Senate group that would tie citizenship to border security and employment-verification measures. But he noted the administration’s focus on border-security issues, which included deporting nearly 410,000 immigrants in 2012, an all-time high.

The borders “have never been better enforced than they are now,” Carney said.

Months of development

The White House’s immigration plans have been in the works for months. Senior administration officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal deliberations, said the White House has developed specific legislative language spelling out Obama’s proposals. But they said they are not going to make the language public at this point because the administration is encouraged by the Senate group’s progress.

The president also is likely to support treating same-sex couples in which one partner is an immigrant the same as married heterosexual couples — meaning gay and lesbian immigrants in relationships with U.S. citizens could apply for citizenship. Such a provision is almost certain to draw opposition from Catholic and Baptist groups that have been supportive of comprehensive reform.

Immigration advocates said they expect Obama to be forceful in his public remarks Tuesday and offer details that go beyond the blueprint on the White House Web site. But there are risks for the president, who has accused Republicans of opposing his initiatives to avoid giving him political credit.

If Obama’s speech in Las Vegas, in a state with a growing number of Hispanic voters, is too tri­umphant or too hectoring, he could risk alienating Republicans whose support will be necessary, some lawmakers have said. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) warned Obama against delivering a “divisive, partisan speech.”

Yet the White House also is mindful that Latino and Asian voters expect him to follow through on an immigration overhaul after failing to achieve it in his first term. Obama had promised to make immigration the key initiative of his second term, but it took a back seat to gun control in the wake of the mass shooting in Newtown, Conn., in December.

Talks without White House

In the meantime, the Senate working group, which had originally targeted its announcement for Friday, moved it up in advance of Obama’s speech. Senate aides said the White House had minimal involvement in the bipartisan talks, preferring a hands-off approach, in part because of failed bipartisan efforts on deficit reduction and other issues.

One White House official said Obama spoke Sunday to Senate Democrats who briefed him on the group’s progress, which came more quickly than the White House expected.

Despite the optimism of Monday’s announcement, senators on both sides acknowledged that they must settle several thorny issues before drafting a bill. They aim to introduce legislation by the end of March.

Democratic aides said the process could receive a boost if Obama champions a framework that provides a smoother path to citizenship. The Senate outline would appear more centrist by comparison, potentially making it easier for Republicans to support. A progressive White House plan would also help prevent the Senate effort from getting pushed much further to the right over time.

Angela Kelley, an immigration expert at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, called the parallel efforts “a healthy competition” between the White House and the Senate.

“The inevitable question for the White House was: How does a legislative initiative get underway?” Kelley said. “To some extent, the senators answered that, so it’s a nice coupling of developments.”"

Fighting fires with aging tankers from another era Many of the tankers used by the Forest Service are retired military aircraft that are costly to maintain and dangerous to fly. Wings break off, engines catch fire and parts must be scrounged.

T

he blaze near Yosemite National Park had incinerated scores of acres and was spreading fast. It was time, federal officials decided, to attack it from the air with all the resources at their command.

As the nation's armada of air tankers began landing at a staging area near here, it was clear that this was a fleet from another era.

The planes showed their age. Propellers coughed to a stop and smoke spewed from their piston engines. Many of these restored tankers were built during the Eisenhower administration.

The Forest Service fleet, which drops retardant to give firefighters on the ground crucial time to put out raging wildfires, is too old, industry and government officials say. Because there are so few planes, critics contend, the fleet is no longer capable of doing all it should to contain fires. Over the last decade, the service reduced its fleet from 47 to just 12, all operated by businesses under federal contract.

Critics also say the planes are dangerous. Since 2001, tanker crashes have killed 22 aviators. Six died last year.

""It's pathetic,"" said Tony Kern, former Forest Service chief of aviation. ""We have brave aviators using ancient technologies and as a result they're losing their lives. It's a horrifying fact that won't change unless government action is taken.""

Demands that the Forest Service replace these planes have come from former pilots, government officials, firefighter advocacy groups and the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.

Half-century-old aircraft are difficult to keep flight-ready, and these tankers take an extra beating from the turbulence, updrafts and hot ash they encounter on firefighting missions.

Wings break off. Engines catch fire. And, in those conditions, stressed pilots make mistakes.

A few of the tankers started out as airliners. Nearly all the rest are retired military aircraft that were refurbished after being culled from the Pentagon's boneyard of discarded planes in Arizona.

Maintenance is a challenge. Engine parts are scrounged from warehouses. In one instance, a propeller was pulled from storage at a museum. If parts can't be found, technicians machine their own from blueprints drawn up around 1950.

At the air attack base near Yosemite in August, the challenges the Forest Service faces were apparent. After one of the tankers rumbled in for a landing, mechanics scurried to replace a blown engine.

It happens so often that the crew hauls a trailer full of spare parts from fire to fire.

Nothing can match the speed and power of a large tanker, the Forest Service says.

An all-out air attack to slow a fire includes helicopters and smaller single-engine tankers. But their capacity to carry retardant is much less than the Forest Service's larger tankers, which can drop 2,000 to 10,000 gallons ahead of the fire.

Aging air tankers Neptune Aviation Services Inc. is the Forest Service's biggest air tanker contractor. The company flies the P-2V Neptune, a Navy sub hunter that first flew in 1947.

""That's the best way to get a lot of retardant delivered,"" said Jeanne Pincha-Tulley, a fire commander who oversees planning for some of California's largest fires. ""When you're trying to hold a ridge and you see it coming, it definitely settles your stomach a bit.""

California, with 23 smaller air tankers, is one of four states that have their own fleets to supplement the Forest Service's armada.

These days, firefighters know they can't count on aerial support; there are too few planes. Half the times a Forest Service air tanker was requested last year, the answer was no: They were all fighting fires elsewhere.

Christian Holm, 55, is a former wildland firefighter who became a tanker pilot in 1998. At the time, he was stationed at an air attack base for four months a year and would swarm a fire with as many as 10 other planes. Now he works nearly year round.

""A lot of times, I'm the only guy out there,"" he said.

The Forest Service quickly suppresses more than 95% of wildfires. The ones that escape immediate containment, like the Rim fire in Yosemite, take longer to put out, and costs can skyrocket.

One plane, 112 days, about 160 fires From April 28 to Aug. 17, Neptune Aviation's 55-year-old P-2V air tanker flew 243 times, dropping retardant on about 160 fires.

The agency has exceeded its $1-billion annual budget for fighting wildfires seven times since 2002. Aviation accounts for about a fourth of that budget. Most of the aviation expenditure goes for helicopters; about $50 million a year is spent on deploying the large tankers.

Nearly all of the nation's firefighting aircraft are owned and operated by private companies, and the bill starts mounting when an incident commander calls aircraft to a fire.

Aviation companies have to keep bids low to win government contracts, and old military aircraft come cheap. Neptune Aviation Services Inc. of Missoula, Mont., has a Forest Service contract to operate eight large air tankers, the most of any company. It flies Lockheed P-2Vs, an aircraft first built in 1946 to hunt for Soviet submarines.

Walking into the company's engine room is like walking into a World War II aircraft hangar. Mechanics sort through oil-smeared parts as they refurbish hulking piston-powered engines and hefty propellers.

""We have had Navy officials walk through here, and they're absolutely shocked that we keep these things flying,"" said Gavin Mouse, 43, overhaul specialist with Neptune.

The company is now modifying the BAe-146, a regional airliner produced in Britain in the 1980s. Neptune officials say it makes a great tanker, but it's more expensive to operate. The daily rate for keeping one of the military planes available is about $14,500, with an average flight rate of $8,000 per hour. The airliner runs about $25,000 daily, plus $10,000 an hour in flight.

""We're doing the best we can, realizing we can't do it on the cheap,"" said Tom Harbour, the Forest Service's director of fire and aviation management. ""When you look forward, by golly, do we have a problem. We need more aircraft and much more capability.""

There are few federal standards regulating the safety of these planes. The Federal Aviation Administration sets standards for aircraft airworthiness and flight crew competency. But once the aircraft begins to fight forest fires, the FAA does not have authority or responsibility to enforce its rules.

Contractors hire outside engineering firms to set safety guidelines for the planes.

""That's problematic,"" said Michael Barr, a former accident investigation officer who now teaches aviation safety at USC. ""It's a little like shooting an arrow from a bow, then drawing the target around the arrow.""

Eleven studies since 1995 have concluded that the Forest Service needs to replace its tankers.

In 2009, the service sought $2.5 billion to buy 18 to 28 aircraft. The funding was denied by its parent agency, the Department of Agriculture.

The department's inspector general acknowledged that the Forest Service needed new planes but said the proposal was poorly prepared and did not include enough data. The Government Accountability Office reached similar conclusions last month.

Walt Darran, chairman of the advocacy group Associated Aerial Firefighters and a former tanker pilot, said the problems stem from a lack of leadership.

""The Forest Service only changes the way it does business after a high-profile death,"" he said. ""Any improvements that have been made in this industry have been bought with blood.""

In 2002, a 46-year-old Lockheed C-130 tanker dropping retardant on a fire near Lake Tahoe broke apart when its wings folded up like a bird's. The crash killed the three crew members. A camera crew captured the accident and the footage was shown on the nightly news across the nation.

Another fire plane, this one 57 years old, broke apart during a Colorado fire one month later, and an investigative panel was convened to examine the industry.

The panel's 60-page report released in 2002 said that the Forest Service's safety standard was unacceptable and that its oversight was lacking. It recommended that the agency foster a closer relationship with the aviation industry to improve the safety of its fleet. By 2004, the Forest Service had removed 33 tankers from its fleet.

The Forest Service says it is trying to modernize. It issued contracts to seven companies this year; most of those planes are not yet ready to enter service. Although the contracts call them ""next-generation"" planes, they aren't so new.

One of them was pulled from an aviation museum in San Bernardino, where it had been on display for 10 years.

Updated at 2:46 p.m. ET on 7/29



(CNN) – As the nation's top diplomat, Hillary Clinton used to be a regular presence at the White House, but since leaving her post as secretary of state earlier this year, Clinton has been busy delivering speeches and launching her post-government initiatives.

On Monday, however, Clinton made a return to the building for lunch with President Barack Obama.





Plenty of issues – ranging from health care to Middle East peace talks – could have been conversation starters for the pair, though on Monday, Deputy Press Secretary Josh Earnest said it was ""largely friendship that's on the agenda for the lunch today.""

""Much has been written about over the last four years how Secretary Clinton and the president have developed not just a strong working relationship, but also a genuine friendship,"" Earnest said, adding the lunch was an ""opportunity for the two, who saw each other on a pretty frequent basis over the course of the last four years, to have the chance to catch up.""

Clinton will also meet with Vice President Joe Biden Tuesday at his residence, the Naval Observatory, Clinton aides, as well as a White House official, told CNN. One person with knowledge said the meeting was ""long scheduled.""

As for her Monday meeting with Obama, Earnest said the president invited Clinton to the lunch, which had grilled chicken, pasta jambalaya and salad on the menu.

Current Secretary of State John Kerry was spotted arriving at the White House around the same time as Clinton, though Earnest said he believed Kerry did not join his predecessor and Obama for the lunchtime meeting. Clinton, however, did stop by to say hello while Kerry met with National Security Adviser Susan Rice, according to Clinton aides.

The White House is preparing for Middle East peace negotiations in Washington Monday night, and Earnest indicated it was more than possible that the talks could have come up come during the meal.

""The purpose of the lunch was chiefly social, but given that the president and Secretary Clinton worked on this pretty closely together over the course of the last four years, I'd be surprised if they didn't,"" he said.

According to Clinton aides, the lunch came together when Obama and Clinton saw each other at the George W. Bush Presidential Center dedication ceremony in April, where Obama and former President Bill Clinton gave brief remarks. With the president and the former secretary of state having busy schedules this summer, July 29th became the agreed upon date, the aides said.

Former rivals during their marathon battle for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination, Obama and Clinton forged what most parties say was a strong working relationship during her years at the State Department. Since her departure, the pair met for dinner at the White House along with her husband, and for the dedication of the Bush library in Texas.

Clinton, a potential candidate for the White House in 2016, has spent her months post-State appearing at events focused on women's empowerment, as well as maintaining a healthy roster of paid speaking engagements.

She launched an initiative through the Clinton Foundation dedicated to early childhood development, and signed a book deal in April for a diplomacy-centered memoir to be released in 2014.

He Died On June']",Charles Krauthammer: Obama the oblivious,"In explaining the disastrous rollout of Obamacare, President Obama told Chris Matthews he had discovered that “we have these big agencies, some of which are outdated, some of which are not designed properly.”

An interesting discovery to make after having consigned the vast universe of American medicine, one-sixth of the U.S. economy, to the tender mercies of the agency bureaucrats at the Department of Health and Human Services and the Internal Revenue Service.

Most people become aware of the hopeless inefficiency of sclerotic government by, oh, age 17 at the department of motor vehicles. Obama’s late discovery is especially remarkable considering that he built his entire political philosophy on the rock of Big Government, on the fervent belief in the state as the very engine of collective action and the ultimate source of national greatness. (Indeed, of individual success as well, as in “If you’ve got a business — you didn’t build that. Somebody else made that happen.”)

This blinding revelation of the ponderous incompetence of bureaucratic government came just a few weeks after Obama confessed that “what we’re also discovering is that insurance is complicated to buy.” Another light bulb goes off, this one three years after passing a law designed to force millions of Americans to shop for new health plans via the maze of untried, untested, insecure, unreliable online “exchanges.”

This discovery joins a long list that includes Obama’s rueful admission that there really are no shovel-ready jobs. That one came after having passed his monstrous $830 billion stimulus on the argument that the weakened economy would be “jump-started” by a massive infusion of shovel-ready jobs. Now known to be fictional.

Barack Obama is not just late to discover the most elementary workings of government. With alarming regularity, he professes obliviousness to the workings of his own government. He claims, for example, to have known nothing about the IRS targeting scandal, the AP phone records scandal, the NSA tapping of Angela Merkel. And had not a clue that the centerpiece of his signature legislative achievement — the online Obamacare exchange, three years in the making — would fail catastrophically upon launch. Or that Obamacare would cause millions of Americans to lose their private health plans.

Hence the odd spectacle of a president expressing surprise and disappointment in the federal government — as if he’s not the one running it. Hence the repeated no-one-is-more-upset-than-me posture upon deploring the nonfunctioning Web site, the IRS outrage, the AP intrusions and any number of scandals from which Obama tries to create safe distance by posing as an observer. He gives the impression of a man on a West Wing tour trying out the desk in the Oval Office, only to be told that he is president of the United States.

The paradox of this presidency is that this most passive bystander president is at the same time the most ideologically ambitious in decades. The sweep and scope of his health-care legislation alone are unprecedented. He’s spent billions of tax money attempting to create, by fiat and ex nihilo, a new green economy. His (failed) cap-and-trade bill would have given him regulatory control of the energy economy. He wants universal preschool and has just announced his unwavering commitment to slaying the dragon of economic inequality, which, like the poor, has always been with us.

Obama’s discovery that government bureaucracies don’t do things very well creates a breathtaking disconnect between his transformative ambitions and his detachment from the job itself. How does his Olympian vision coexist with the lassitude of his actual governance, a passivity that verges on absenteeism?

What bridges that gap is rhetoric. Barack Obama is a master rhetorician. It’s allowed him to move crowds, rise inexorably and twice win the most glittering prize of all. Rhetoric has changed his reality. For Obama, it can change the country’s. Hope and change, after all, is a rhetorical device. Of the kind Obama has always imagined can move mountains.

That’s why his reaction to the Obamacare Web site’s crash-on-takeoff is so telling. His remedy? A cross-country campaign-style speaking tour. As if rhetoric could repeal that reality.

Managing, governing, negotiating, cajoling, crafting legislation, forging compromise. For these — this stuff of governance — Obama has shown little aptitude and even less interest. Perhaps, as Valerie Jarrett has suggested, he is simply too easily bored to invest his greatness in such mundanity.

WASHINGTON (AP) - Former senator. Richard Lugar is being knighted on orders from the queen of England, joining a select list of Americans to receive the distinction.

The Indiana Republican, who this year left the Senate after serving 36 years, will receive the rank of honorary Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire during a ceremony at the British Embassy in Washington on Tuesday. The British ambassador, Sir Peter Westmacott, is set to preside.

Since leaving the Senate, Lugar has taken on various roles, including leading the Richard G. Lugar Institute for Diplomacy and Congress with the German Marshall Fund. He also serves as a distinguished scholar and professor at the Indiana University School of Global and International Studies.

Lugar said he is deeply honored to be knighted. ""I will focus my service on solving our most serious challenges in a spirit of cooperation between our countries,"" he said in a statement Monday.

He said he was first inspired by Queen Elizabeth's leadership ""when she received me as the young Rhodes Scholar in London, 58 years ago and asked me about Indiana.""

Lugar's studies at Oxford University were his first outside of the United States. He went on to become one of the Senate's foremost foreign policy experts, focusing much of his work on nuclear proliferation issues and relations with Europe. Along with former Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., Lugar crafted legislation that helped eliminate nuclear warheads in the former Soviet Union.

Lugar will not be known as ""sir"" Lugar - only royal subjects can carry that title. But few Americans have received honorary knighthood, including Presidents Dwight Eisenhower, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush.

Lugar was defeated in a Republican primary in 2012, finishing his sixth term in office early this year. Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly won the race to replace him."

The Republican-controlled legislature has sent a bill to Gov. Rick Scott that, if signed, would require the governor to sign execution warrants 30 days after the state Supreme Court reviews cases. It would require the state to execute a prisoner within 180 days of a warrant being signed.

The legislation also sets new deadlines for death row appeals.

The bill arrives on Scott’s desk just days after Maryland became the sixth state in as many years -- and the 18th state overall -- to abolish the death penalty. Democratic Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley signed the bill Thursday, ending what supporters said was decades of racial and socio-economic disparity in death penalty sentencing.

Supporters of the Florida legislation claimed their bill was aimed at improving -- rather than abolishing -- a broken system. They argue it puts an end to condemned prisoners sitting for years on death row -- often through what they consider unnecessary delays in the so-called “post conviction” process.

Republican state Sen. Joe Negron, the bill's sponsor, on Monday called that situation a “mockery” of the criminal justice system.

“We believe in due process,” Negron told FoxNews.com. “But this is about cases in which there is no allegation of innocence and a succession of motion after motion.”

He and fellow state Sen. Rob Bradley also argue the bill ends the long waits that surviving families and others must endure between a murder and the justice they seek.

“This bill is about closure,” Bradley told The Florida Courier.

The average stay on Florida’s death row before being executed is roughly 13 years, according to state records.

Critics of the legislation, however, question why legislators would want to, in effect, accelerate the appeals process, considering 24 people on death row have been exonerated since Florida resumed executions in the 1970s, which is more exonerations than in any other state.

“It is both tragic and ironic that the state that sends the highest number of wrongfully convicted people to death row is considering speeding up executions,” said Mark Elliott, of the group Innocent on Death Row. “Speeding up executions virtually guarantees that innocent people will be executed.”

The legislation attempts to fix the problem of the accused getting shoddy legal services by suspending lawyers for five years from handling death appeals if they are found twice to have provided deficient representation.

In Maryland, those who advocated for the abolition of the death penalty argued the drawn-out execution process was more expensive for the state. They cited a 2008 Urban Institute study that found it costs $1.1 million to prosecute a death penalty-eligible case in which execution is not sought, compared with $3 million to prosecute a case that resulted in the death penalty.

Some Republicans in the Democrat-controlled legislature argued that ending the death penalty entirely was tantamount to putting out a welcome sign for killers.

“I made the argument: What if a terrorist came to Maryland and killed a million residents with a dirty bomb or something like that? Will you keep the death penalty just for that?” Republican Delegate Michael Smigiel told FoxNews.com on Monday. “They wouldn’t do it.”"

The list of federal and state programs he would end, given a chance, is considerable: food stamps, subsidized housing, free school lunches, unemployment insurance.

But Wright, who owns the 1,300-acre V&W; Farms here and is president of the 300-farm Southeast Milk Cooperative, says he’s about ready to leave the Republican Party if it doesn’t push hard for immigration reform this year.

“This is an issue where the conservative Republicans are just plain wrong,” he said recently as a steady trail of 1,500-pound Jersey-Holstein crossbreeds plodded toward the milking parlor, bellowing on their way. “We cannot milk cows without Hispanic labor, period.”

Business owners like Wright have emerged as a significant force in negotiations over immigration reform this year, reaching an important agreement with labor groups this week about how to ensure workers continue coming into the U.S. This issue was one of many stumbling blocks in the 2007 debate over immigration reform, and may indicate that business is ready to support reform more vocally.

“There’s no question that businesses are going to be more out there — everyone from the big guys to the little guys,” said Tamar Jacoby, president and chief executive of ImmigrationWorks USA, a federation of state-based pro-immigration coalitions. “Business has learned over these past five, six, seven years more and more that it needs to engage.”

To be sure, more outspoken businesses doesn’t necessarily mean reform will come more easily. Businesses still have to find a way to agree with labor on the details, and different types of businesses want different bills. Many in agriculture favor a guest worker program that allows farmers to hire migrant workers with minimal red tape, while technology companies want a way for high-skilled foreign workers to stay in the United States. Hotels and restaurants, as well as dairy farmers such as Wright, want a year-round labor supply to fill undesirable jobs.

Wright says it will be much harder to operate his farm if Congress doesn’t pass an immigration overhaul. The work is dirty: herding cows at dawn, milking 144 an hour with the help of machines, giving them shots, sticking a hand into a cow to check whether she is pregnant, while she defecates on you. And though the job comes with housing, it calls upon employees to be available at all hours should a cow get sick or go into labor.

Americans don’t apply for the jobs, he said, even though they can earn $10 or more an hour. One year he was so short of labor that he got foreign veterinary students from Croatia, Uruguay and Zimbabwe to help him run the farm.

“I hired an Anglo once,” Wright said, watching as two Latino workers moved quickly down an aisle of cows, hooking milking devices to their udders. “He made it 30 days, but he didn’t make it 60.”

For many businesses, the stakes are higher this time around, as they see states adopt stricter immigration policies and vow to make mandatory e-Verify, a government program that allows employers to check a worker’s status.

In Georgia, where the Legislature passed a measure in 2011 requiring police to check the immigration status of criminal suspects, growers lost 40% of crops because farmers didn’t have the labor to harvest them, said Charles Hall, executive director of the state’s Fruit and Vegetable Growers Assn.

In Arizona, where the passage of a similar measure, SB 1070, drew national attention in 2010, some construction companies can no longer find enough workers because so many Latinos have left the state, said Todd Landfried, executive director of Arizona Employers for Immigration Reform.

Many businesses have formed advocacy groups in response to these laws, but having them as such active players in the pro-reform coalition also gives rise to friction.

“Business can play an important function and likely will, but their inclusion in the coalition creates a lot of tension,” said Steve Camarota, director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports tighter controls on immigration. “Will the coalition hold together and be large enough to overcome opposition? I don’t know.”

Labor wants both undocumented immigrants and legal guest workers to eventually have a path to citizenship. But business owners say that if migrant workers become U.S. citizens right away, they’ll leave the low-paying and grueling jobs at farms and restaurants.

“One of the areas of most concern in immigration reform is whether business and labor can both get on board on a proposal for future flow,” said Madeleine Sumption, senior policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. “The fact that they’re still at the table and able to come up with these proposals is very encouraging.”

Having business owners involved in negotiations might also help quiet some of the opposition that contributed to the derailment of immigration reform in 2007, when anti-immigration callers overwhelmed and shut down the Senate switchboard.

“In order to get the votes we need, we have to think about who can move House Republicans — and business is a big part of that,” said Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, which brings together different factions on immigration, including business and labor.

Business owners are also often influential community leaders who, from firsthand experience with immigrants, can help explain to neighbors the benefits of immigration reform.

“On a local level, who is a voter going to believe?” Noorani said. “Their local business owner, their pastor, and their police chief.”

In 2006, the mayor of Wright’s hometown of Avon Park made headlines when he proposed strict measures to root out undocumented immigrants from the small Florida city. He wanted to fine landlords $1,000 for renting to them, deny business permits to companies that knowingly hired them, and remove Spanish from all city documents and phone messages.

Advertisement

The proposal enraged Wright, who has been hiring immigrants for two decades. He began to speak up against the bill, as did other local business owners. The City Council, which originally voted 3 to 2 in support of the bill, reversed itself after business owners became more vocal.

“We had people screaming over illegal immigration, but they didn’t have a clue over how their own lifestyle was dependent on these immigrants for food and hospitality,” said Wright, who remembers trying to patiently explain the issues to his neighbors. “The people complaining seemed to be totally out of touch with how our Florida economy works.”

It’s unlikely that the Supreme Court will get its hands on Federal District Judge Shira A. Scheindlin’s ruling that New York City’s aggressive stop-and-frisk police tactics violated the constitutional rights of the minorities whose communities the police targeted. The Democratic candidates running to succeed Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who is appealing the decision, have vowed to overhaul the stop-and-frisk approach and end the city’s appeal. Because the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, Floyd v. City of New York, requested only an injunction and not monetary damages, in all likelihood there will be no case left after Inauguration Day.

Given that Judge Scheindlin may therefore have the last word, I decided to look at her decision through the Supreme Court’s lens and imagine how the justices would have viewed it.

Obviously, Judge Scheindlin did the same thing; her 198-page opinion with its 783 footnotes is chock-full of citations to Supreme Court precedents bearing on the Fourth Amendment search-and-seizure and 14th Amendment equal-protection issues posed by the case. Her role, as the district judge trying the case without a jury, was to find the facts and fit them into the existing legal framework.

But as the Supreme Court’s many 5-to-4 decisions demonstrate, different judges can look at the same facts and the same law and come to very different conclusions. There is often more than one way to look at a Supreme Court precedent, with competing messages to be extracted. Judging really is something more than the robotic paint-by-numbers exercise so drearily depicted in Supreme Court confirmation hearings.

A good example of a case with dual messages is Whren v. United States, a 1996 Supreme Court decision that figured in Judge Scheindlin’s analysis. Whren is a little-known but hugely important case, decided unanimously with an opinion by Justice Antonin Scalia. It presented what might be called a vehicular stop-and-frisk issue: a challenge to a practice by the Washington, D.C., police department of patrolling “high drug” neighborhoods in unmarked cars, stopping drivers for minor traffic violations, ordering them out of the car and looking for anything of interest that might be visible. In this case, what was visible when the officers stopped a car for speeding and failing to signal were two bags of crack cocaine in the driver’s hands.

The argument was that this stop, and others like it, were pretextual, that the police were pretending to be on routine traffic patrol but were really trying to catch drug dealers — impermissibly so, the argument went, because the police had no reason to suspect that a car with a broken taillight was carrying drugs.

It didn’t matter, the court said; the objective reasonableness of the stop, not the subjective motivation of the police, was all that counted for Fourth Amendment purposes. Toward the end of his opinion for the court, Justice Scalia added that “we of course agree” that “the Constitution prohibits selective enforcement of the law based on considerations such as race.” But that, he said, would be a different case under a different constitutional heading: one to bring under the Equal Protection Clause rather than the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition of unreasonable search and seizure. “Subjective intentions play no role in ordinary, probable-cause Fourth Amendment analysis,” Justice Scalia concluded.

So Whren v. United States stands for two propositions — one, that police officers’ real motive doesn’t matter as long as their actions are objectively reasonable, and two, that racially selective law enforcement (racial profiling, although that phrase wasn’t in such currency 17 years ago) is constitutionally impermissible. Which was germane to Judge Scheindlin’s case? Both, of course. She insisted (citing Whren in a footnote) “that stops be conducted in a racially neutral manner.” She found that “the city’s highest officials have turned a blind eye to the evidence that officers are conducting stops in a racially discriminatory manner.” Proof of this, she said, was “overwhelming.”

As to whether particular stops and frisks were based on the requisite “reasonable suspicion,” Judge Scheindlin made no assumptions one way or the other. Rather, she closely examined each of the 19 individual cases that were part of the lawsuit, categorizing them this way: nine stops were unconstitutional; five stops, while constitutional, were followed by unconstitutional frisks; and the remaining five, based on reasonable suspicion, were constitutional.

(As an aside, Mayor Bloomberg’s intemperate attacks on Judge Scheindlin, whom he denounced in a Washington Post op-ed this week as an “ideologically driven federal judge” who engaged in “brazen activism” and “showed disdain for our police officers and the dangerous work they do,” are preposterous and demeaning — not only to the judge but to the mayor himself, who surely knows better. Judge Scheindlin, 67, is a former federal prosecutor who later served as general counsel to the New York City Department of Investigation. Before becoming a federal district judge in 1994, she spent four years as a federal magistrate judge in Brooklyn. Magistrate judges are the officials who handle much of the nitty-gritty of the federal courts’ caseload. The notion that Judge Scheindlin is engaged in some kind of radical vendetta against New York City is beyond absurd.)

To return to my initial question, what would the Supreme Court have made of Floyd v. City of New York? When I embarked on this exercise, I thought I would conclude that the decision would be easy pickings for a Supreme Court that has shifted notably to the right since it issued a number of the decisions that Judge Scheindlin cited. But instead, I found that — well, it’s complicated.

On the one hand, the court is capable of displaying an almost goofy disregard for the realities of police-citizen encounters. My favorite recent example was a 2011 decision, Kentucky v. King, that upheld the warrantless search of an apartment that the police happened upon by mistake, having taken a turn down the wrong corridor while chasing a suspected drug dealer. From under the closed door, they smelled marijuana. After knocking and announcing themselves, the only response they got was the sound of people and objects moving around. So they kicked the door in, saw drugs in plain view, conducted a search and found more drugs.

None of this violated the Fourth Amendment, the court held by a vote of 8 to 1. Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. wrote the majority opinion, with Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg the lone dissenter. The apartment’s tenants could simply have told the police to go away, Justice Alito said; it was the sound of furtive movement that led the officers to believe that evidence was being destroyed, justifying their violent, uninvited entry.

“Occupants who choose not to stand on their constitutional rights but instead elect to attempt to destroy evidence have only themselves to blame,” Justice Alito wrote. Maybe so — but did the seven justices who signed his opinion actually agree with Justice Alito’s paean to the prospect that the police officer banging on your door might really be your friend? “Citizens who are startled by an unexpected knock on the door or by the sight of unknown persons in plain clothes on their doorstep may be relieved to learn that these persons are police officers,” he wrote.

While this decision, addressing another part of the Fourth Amendment forest, isn’t directly on point for the New York City case, it does raise the question of whether this is a court that could “recognize the human toll of unconstitutional stops,” in Judge Scheindlin’s words.

But then there are other cases that suggest a different outcome. In 2000, the court unanimously rejected the argument that an anonymous tip justified the police in stopping and frisking a man who looked as described by the informant, standing in the place the informant had specified. The call to the police said that a young black man, dressed in a plaid shirt, standing at a particular bus stop, was carrying a gun. This proved to be true.

But it wasn’t good enough, Justice Ginsburg said for the court in Florida v. J.L., because the anonymous tip lacked the “indicia of reliability” necessary to provide reasonable suspicion. If a stop-and-frisk based on a very specifically worded tip didn’t make the Fourth Amendment grade, then logically neither should stops based on nothing but location and ethnicity.

As I said, it’s complicated. Under the Supreme Court’s precedents governing municipal liability for constitutional violations, it isn’t enough to prove that egregious violations occurred. Plaintiffs must show that the violations occurred as the result of an official policy, which Judge Scheindlin found. Of course, New York officials deny that there was any policy other than good police work. What makes a “policy” is a question the Supreme Court has stumbled over for decades without conclusively resolving.

And then there’s the question of racial discrimination. Supreme Court precedents since the 1970s have required evidence of intentional discrimination in order to prove a violation of the 14th Amendment’s equal protection guarantee. Evidence that a policy — the death penalty is a prime example — has a disproportionate impact on people of one race is not sufficient. In a sense, this is a conundrum at the heart of the New York case. Questions of a police officer’s real motives are out of bounds when it comes to the Fourth Amendment, yet proof of a discriminatory motive is required for proving a 14th Amendment violation.

Judge Scheindlin addressed the discriminatory intent question at several points in her opinion. She said that plaintiffs had to prove that a discriminatory purpose was “a motivating factor,” but not necessarily “the sole, predominant, or determinative factor in a police enforcement action.” The plaintiffs in this case met that test, she concluded.

Whether the current Supreme Court would accept this generous gloss on the discriminatory intent standard — a “motivating factor” but not the only factor — is, I think, an open question. It’s safe to say that the court’s equal protection jurisprudence is currently in flux, heading in the direction of making 14th Amendment violations harder, not easier, to prove.

How would Floyd v. City of New York have fared at the Supreme Court? The answer is I’m not sure. Pondering the question has been an abstract exercise, in the absence of a Court of Appeals decision that would precede any Supreme Court appeal, and without the briefs that would define and sharpen the issues. But with only six weeks to go before the first Monday in October and the court’s return, it’s worth trying to limber up for the justices’ return by looking at this case through their eyes.

To the question of whether I’m glad the case will likely not find its way to the Supreme Court’s door, the answer is yes."

Over the years, Vice President Biden has shown he has an interesting way with words.

When President Obama signed his signature Affordable Care Act into law, the microphones caught an exuberant Biden tossing an expletive to describe the magnitude of the moment. In remarks honoring Ireland's Prime Minister Brian Cowen, he said the premier's mother had passed away, when she was very much alive. And during this campaign season, Biden raised Republican ire when he told a largely African-American audience in Virginia that Mitt Romney and the Republican party are going ""to put y'all back in chains.""

Earlier today, Biden delivered another cringe-worthy moment as he posed for photos with newly sworn-in senators and their families.

When a photographer told the husband of Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., to drop his hands to his sides, Biden chimed in, ""Spread your legs: You're going to be frisked."" The vice president then explained, ""You say that to somebody in North Dakota, they think it's a frisk.""

""They think you're in trouble, right?"" he asked Heitkamp's husband, Darwin Lange.

Lange shrugged at the awkward moment, while Heitkamp laughed through the short photo session

""I'm a little too formal, I know,"" Biden added.

Throughout the photo shoot with lawmakers, Biden—a veteran of the upper chamber—was jovial with lawmakers from both sides of the aisle, and he took extra moments to chat up the mothers and children of the newly-minted senators.

He joked with a fit relative of Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., that he could help him work on his ""pecks."" With the family of Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, he was quick with a joke when the senator's toddler fussed as the vice president held her.

""It's a Democrat, I know,"" Biden cooed."

The more time we spend on pointless disputes about budget cuts no one is expected to make soon, the less we spend trying to solve the problems that confront us today — and, God forbid, thinking about the future.

The 2012 election gave President Obama new authority and new energy. Republicans want to place as much distance between themselves and that election as they possibly can. From their perspective, the more months we fritter away on these dumb, fake emergencies, the better. As Obama’s clout slowly diminishes, so will his opportunities to press his priorities.

If Washington can be kept in a state of partisan paralysis, Republicans stand to gain more. The voters hoped that by settling certain questions in 2012, they could push the politicians toward problem-solving. Some Republicans, in their heart of hearts, even want this to happen. But if gridlock retains its icy grip on government, the president will ultimately suffer because it is members of his constituency who will be most demoralized by the failure of their votes to change anything.

The confrontation over the sequester should be seen for what it is: a hangover from a different period, when a different political majority was temporarily ascendant. In 2011, Obama was fighting for his political life. Republicans had just seized the House and cut into the Democrats’ majority in the Senate.

The debt-ceiling clash was the product of that midterm election and of a victorious tea party that made slashing federal spending the one and only priority. The sequester was a temporary way out of the impasse that political moment created. Both sides agreed to a package of cuts in domestic and military spending assumed to be so unpalatable that eventually the contending parties would come to their senses and make a deal.

As a short-term measure, it was brilliant, particularly for the president. He got the debt-ceiling issue behind him and was free to wage a campaign in which he took on the tea party’s view frontally and defeated it. His party also gained Senate seats, and Republicans held the House (we should always remember this) only by virtue of skewed congressional districts and the concentration of Democratic votes in large metropolitan areas.

But now, the sequester is allowing the tea party’s ghost to haunt Washington. It is as if the election never happened. We are back to exactly the same deficit conversations we were having in 2010 and 2011. We are not pondering ways of helping the economy to grow faster, or how we might reduce joblessness, or how we can usefully invest in the future. We are not discussing what to do about deepening economic inequality.

No, the earlier story line is extended as if 2012 never happened. The return of Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles to Washington’s public stage this week was a reminder that we are trapped in the same old play with the same characters and the same themes.

On the merits, Obama has public opinion in his corner. His proposal to avoid the economic drag of the sequester with a reasonable amount of deficit reduction built on a mix of spending cuts and revenue increases through tax reform occupies the debate’s broad middle ground. If the GOP wanted, based on its past positions, it could take a deal of this sort and declare victory, given all the cuts that have already passed.

But that is not the victory the Republicans seek. The sequester game is a contest in which their side wins simply by running out the clock, no matter what the score is. Thus, Obama can’t just score points. He needs to figure out how to end this game so he can play the one he promised us when he said his reelection could “break the fever” in Washington. Alas, it has not broken yet.

However, the OBL bump lasted barely 10 days before the slog of the negotiations started eroding his numbers. We all remember those painful weeks—Obama begging the GOP to make a deal, making concession after concession with nothing in return from the other side. He looked weak because heweak. And the American people don't like weak. No one does, really.

Indeed, by the time Obama capitulated in late July, giving House Speaker John Boehner 95 percent of what he wanted, he was already at the lowest approval ratings of his presidency, and they fell even further in the weeks after. The White House thought that by looking ""reasonable"" and willing to compromise, the ""adult in the room"" as many of Obama's strongest partisans put it, that the American people would reward him. Well, they didn't. Indeed, Obama's numbers didn't head back into solidly positive territory until after the Democratic convention in September 2012, over a year later, and only after he took a more stridently partisan tone ahead of the the November elections.

In fact, 2012 exit polling confirmed that voters stopped seeing Obama as a strong leader.



Those who voted on leadership qualities opted for Mitt Romney by a whopping 61-38 percent. And yet here we are again, with Obama and his team deluded into thinking people want him to look ""reasonable"". No, Americans re-elected him to protect their interests. Among people who expected the president to look out for their interests, Obama won by a crazy 81-18. Those are the voters that gave him four more years, and right now he's inexplicably failing their trust.

If Republicans are so hell-bent on destroying our safety net, and they are, then make them put those proposals in their budget. Yet even Rep. Paul Ryan's draconian budget didn't touch Social Security. (And for good reason!)

Republicans released their ideal budget. It was Obama's turn to release his ideal budget. Then they'd go to the table to try and hammer out a compromise that would theoretically be somewhere in the middle. But as always Obama negotiated against himself, made concessions without corresponding Republican ones, became the only elected official in Washington, D.C., to put Social Security benefits cuts in a formal proposal (thus owning them), and then ... what?

Republicans dismissed everything out of hand, progressive groups went to war against the White House, Congressional Democrats distanced themselves from the proposal save for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (ever the loyal lieutenant), and seniors certainly weren't impressed.

If Obama's goal was to look weak and isolate himself, generating bipartisan scorn and ridicule while giving Republicans a chance to claim Democrats want to cut Social Security during 2014 elections, then sure, mission accomplished.

If he actually thought he was accomplishing something useful, however ... the mind reels.

Job approval ratings for the former senator and first lady are at stratospheric levels, suggesting that her four years as chief U.S. diplomat could be an important asset if she runs for president in 2016.

But scholars and diplomatic insiders say she has never dominated issues of war and peace in the manner of predecessors Dean Acheson or Henry Kissinger, or laid down an enduring diplomatic doctrine.

President Obama has tightly controlled foreign policy in the last four years — more so even than his recent predecessors. Clinton has had a seat at the table on every key issue, officials say, but she did not “own” any of them.

She devoted long hours to signatures issues, including empowerment of women and girls, gay rights, Third World development, health and Internet freedoms. Clinton lent her support to a wide range of new projects and organizations, and she appointed new officials in the State Department to shepherd them. Some of these may eventually have huge effects, but many are at an early stage.

At the same time, the most important and toughest foreign policy issues of the day — Iran, North Korea, Afghanistan-Pakistan, the Arab-Israeli standoff — weren’t resolved during the four years. Some grew more intractable. Though none of that may be Clinton’s fault, the lack of diplomatic breakthroughs on her watch limits her legacy.

“She’s coming away with a stellar reputation that seems to have put her almost above criticism,” said Aaron David Miller, a longtime U.S. peace negotiator who is a vice president at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. “But you can’t say that she’s really led on any of the big issues for this administration or made a major mark on high strategy.”

Expectations ran high that Clinton would be a heavyweight — maybe even a “co-president” on foreign policy — from the time Obama picked his bitter rival in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary campaign to take the Cabinet’s senior spot. She had star power from 20 years in national life that dazzled foreign audiences and guaranteed worldwide attention to whatever issue she focused on.

“She’s the first secretary who’s also been a global rock star,” said a senior State Department official who was not authorized to be quoted by name. “It’s allowed her to raise issues on the global agenda in a way that no one before her has been able to do.”

Obama praised her performance Sunday in a joint interview with Clinton that he proposed to CBS’ “60 Minutes.” Obama described her as “one of our finest” secretaries of State and one of his most important advisors on a range of issues, including Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and Al Qaeda.

In the interview, Clinton brushed aside questions about her future in politics and pronounced her health as good — although she said she had some “lingering effects” from a concussion she suffered in December when she fainted and hit her head after suffering from a virus that left her dehydrated. The concussion led to a blood clot behind her right ear, for which she was hospitalized.

“The doctors tell me that will all recede,” she said, referring to the continued symptoms. “And so, thankfully, I’m looking forward to being at full speed.”

As secretary of State, Clinton has shared Obama’s democratic take on the proper role of American diplomats, believing that the world is no longer a place where a handful of powers can dictate the terms of the world order. Rather, the job of U.S. diplomats is collaborating with dozens of other countries in the “constant gardening and tending” of institutions and projects that advance common goals, the senior State Department official said.

Foreign audiences warmed to this attitude, which they found appealing after eight years of a George W. Bush administration many associated with a go-it-alone approach. As they did, the American image abroad improved.

At the same time, Clinton quickly removed a potential internal stumbling block, insisting on no infighting between her loyalists at the State Department and Obama’s team. Former President Bill Clinton’s kibitzing on foreign policy never became the problem some had predicted.

A hard worker and team player, Clinton won praise from many in Obama’s circle who had initially doubted her.

Advertisement

But as time passed, it became clear that she wouldn’t have the lead role on key issues of war and peace.

Clinton’s original plan was to have three powerful “special envoys” in charge of key security issues and reporting to her — a flow chart that would have enabled her to tightly control the biggest security issues.

Advertisement

But Richard C. Holbrooke, in charge of the Afghanistan-Pakistan militant threat, was marginalized after clashing with White House officials. Former Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell resigned in May 2011 after the painful collapse of the administration’s opening Middle East peace initiative; and diplomat Dennis Ross, the envoy for Iran, moved to the White House in June 2009 to better help manage the range of Mideast problems that were bubbling over.

“She was a fully functioning member of the team,” said a former administration official, who asked to remain anonymous speaking about a former colleague. “But not a first among equals.”

Advertisement

“If you go down the line, it’s tough to see what’s happened in world politics over the last four years that wouldn’t have happened without her,” the official said. “So it’s tough to see how she gets into that category of truly great, transformational secretaries, like Acheson and [George] Marshall,” who presided over U.S. foreign policy in the years after World War II.

On Libya, for example, Clinton helped persuade Obama to support a NATO military intervention in March 2011. But her voice was one of several, including those of Susan Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations; Samantha Power, a human rights advocate at the White House; and a group of younger staffers at the National Security Council.

Clinton decided in February 2011 that the United States needed to urge its longtime ally, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, to leave office after weeks of angry “Arab Spring” demonstrations against him. But again, she was one of a crowd: Other members of the foreign policy team took the same view.

Key decisions on another top security threat, Iran’s nuclear program, were made largely by Obama and the White House inner circle. Clinton ably led administration efforts to round up international support for economic sanctions aimed at forcing Iran to accept curbs on the nuclear program.

Through most of the four years, she seemed immune to criticism. The most notable exception came near the end, with the death of four Americans at the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya, in September. Although Clinton said she took responsibility for security weaknesses there, Republican criticism largely focused not on her, but on Rice, who had appeared on a Sunday morning talk show a few days after the killings to defend the administration’s handling of the matter.

Rice’s appearance helped sink her chances to succeed Clinton at the State Department. Clinton, who had stayed away from the talk show circuit, saw her approval rating remain about 70% — an all-time high.

Advertisement

Similarly, although Clinton has been the administration’s point person on the Syrian civil war and the becalmed Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts, criticism of administration efforts on those have rarely found their way to her.

Walter Russell Mead, a foreign policy specialist and historian with the Council on Foreign Relations, said Clinton was like James A. Baker III, secretary of State to President George H.W. Bush, in her ability to avoid association with the administration’s perceived failures.

Advertisement

“Trouble was always where Baker wasn’t,” he said.

Despite the glow, however, there have been limits to her impact.

Issues of global poverty or the plight of women “showed limited movement due to any idea of hers while secretary of State,” Michael O’Hanlon, a Brookings Institution foreign policy and defense analyst, wrote in a recent evaluation.

“Even an admirer, such as myself, must acknowledge that few big problems were solved on her watch, few victories achieved,” he wrote. Clinton, he added, has been “more solid than spectacular.”

Obama’s election was a symbol of reconciliation in America’s longest, bloodiest conflict — the one that produced Antietam. It was followed by a partisan lunge to fulfill the dreams of the Great Society by delivering universal health care. Which was followed by an ideological backlash that shifted control of the House, led by activists who talked as if the whole welfare state might be undone. Which was followed by Obama’s victorious reelection campaign, which turned the mobilization of partisans and ethnic groups into an exact science and reengaged the culture war on abortion.

The compression of these ideological mood swings into four years has left an impression of political instability, perhaps bipolarity. Both parties overreach. Their tone is often frantic and overheated. They focus mainly on energizing the faithful rather than persuading the undecided.

Such polarization has deep roots. Parties, communities and regions have sorted themselves by ideology, producing citizens who operate in separate partisan worlds. Partisan media outlets succeed through the reinforcement and exaggeration of grievances. Most House members represent safe districts in which their greatest political fear is offending those who vote in primaries.

What can a presidential inaugural address do to oppose these centrifugal forces? Probably not much. Maybe admit some mutual fault and call for a new beginning. Maybe direct attention to unifying national values beyond current controversies. Maybe just assert the moral duties of kindness and civility we owe each other in a democracy.

This year, however, the influence of such a speech remains untested because it was not attempted. President Obama set an unobjectionable goal: “a nation that rewards the effort and determination of every single American.” He asserted that this objective can only be achieved “together, as one nation, and one people.” But he proceeded to define an agenda, in some detail, that could have been taken from any campaign speech of the 2012 election. It involves the building of roads and research labs, promoting clean-energy technology, protecting entitlements from significant change, passing equal-pay legislation and immigration reform.

Those who oppose this agenda, in Obama’s view, are not a very admirable lot. They evidently don’t want our wives, mothers and daughters to “earn a living equal to their efforts.” They would cause some citizens “to wait for hours to exercise the right to vote.” They mistake “absolutism for principle” and “substitute spectacle for politics” and “treat name-calling as reasoned debate.” They would have people’s “twilight years . . . spent in poverty” and ensure that the parents of disabled children have “nowhere to turn.” They would reserve freedom “for the lucky” and believe that Medicare and Social Security “sap our initiative,” and they see this as “a nation of takers.” They “deny the overwhelming judgment of science” on climate change, don’t want love to be “equal” and apparently contemplate “perpetual war.”

For Abraham Lincoln, even the gravest national crimes involved shared fault. For Obama, even the most commonplace policy disagreements indicate the bad faith of his opponents. In his first inaugural address, George Washington described the “sacred fire of liberty.” In his second, Obama constructed a raging bonfire of straw men.

This will, no doubt, please the president’s strongest supporters, who are grateful that he has given up the pious balderdash of bipartisanship. They welcome his sharper political edge. They describe him as “wiser,” “wary” and more realistic about the unchangeable obstructionism of his opponents.

It is not the first time a president has been indicted by the praise of his courtiers. Obama arrived with limited experience on the national stage — only to find himself in the fight from the last act of Hamlet. He seemed surprised that Washington could not be changed by the force of his personality. He has become a sobered and hardened figure. A former public official who often interacted with Obama put it this way to me: “Obama disdains politicians and the art of politics, but he is highly competitive and wants to beat them at their own game.”

This is not a problem if the president is merely one participant among many in a series of zero-sum political battles. But this approach has serious drawbacks if a president is called to play a leadership role in reforms that require both parties to trust each other and take simultaneous risks. On the evidence of his second inaugural, Obama has moved beyond such idealism."

USA TODAY

House bill offered by Republican leader doubled the cuts approved by the Agriculture Committee

Democrats%2C including President Obama%2C are strongly opposed to the bill

Bill must be reconciled with Senate bill that cuts %244.5 billion from food stamps

The House approved a Republican plan Thursday to cut food stamps by $39 billion during the next decade, setting up a showdown with Democrats over the program used by nearly 48 million low-income Americans.

The House voted 217-210 for the bill that cuts nearly twice as much from food stamps as a bill the House rejected in June. It is also far more than a Senate measure passed earlier this year that would trim about $4.5 billion in spending. The bill failed to draw the support of a single Democrat, many of whom have said the steep cuts would erode a key safety net depended upon by families with children, seniors, veterans and people looking for work.

Fifteen Republicans also voted against the bill.

Republicans argued that the bill would restore the program's original eligibility limits and preserve the safety net for the truly needy.

The bill would cause 3 million people to lose benefits while another 850,000 would see their benefits cut, according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office. The White House threatened Wednesday to veto the bill, calling food stamps one of the ""nation's strongest defenses against hunger and poverty.""

The battle over food stamps has left in limbo the future of farm policy, and slowed efforts to write a new five-year, $500 billion farm bill. The current law expires on Sept. 30.

In June, the House rejected the farm bill in a floor vote that was seen as a major setback to House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. Democrats argued that the cuts in the bill were too severe, and Republicans opposed the bill because of costs they said were still too high.

A few weeks later, the House broke the farm bill into two separate chunks, narrowly approving the subsidy and conservation section but reserving the food stamp portion for later.

The cost of food stamps — officially called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — has exploded over the past decade, according to the Department of Agriculture. In 2001, the program served 17 million people at a cost of just over $15 billion. By June of this year, there were 47.8 million people enrolled in the program, and annual costs were about $75 billion.

Republicans argue that the growth has been fueled by allowing states to waive eligibility requirements, allowing more people to enroll in the program than the law originally intended.

The bill originally passed by the House Agriculture Committee would have cut $20 billion from the program over 10 years, in large part by limiting the ability of states to automatically qualify people who are already enrolled in other anti-poverty programs. Earlier this week, Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., introduced a new version of the bill that boosts the cuts to nearly $40 billion by adding stiffer requirements for many able-bodied recipients to be working or looking for work or in a job-training program. The bill does not include new funding for job training.

The Congressional Budget Office estimated that under current law, ""spending for SNAP would total $764 billion over the 2014-2023 period."" Passage of the House bill would reduce those costs by $39 billion or about a 5%.

Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, told USA TODAY's Capital Download on Thursday that Democrats are not opposed to food stamp cuts.

""I'm certain that we could embrace as House Democrats some measure of cuts,"" she said. ""I mean, every program can benefit from some savings. But the first go-round the Republicans' proposed cut was $20 billion. Then they passed an amendment that was $31.4 billion. And now that still isn't good enough for the Tea Partiers. Now we're at $40 billion. What they're saying is that in America it's OK for people to go hungry.""

But Agriculture Committee member Mike Conaway, R-Texas, said Thursday ""we are not talking about eliminating the SNAP program."" The goal of the bill, he said, is to ""limit the public assistance program to those who qualify and close loopholes that have allowed people to game the system."" The changes will help ""keep the safety net intact for qualified families,"" he said.

Despite the divide between Republicans and Democrats over food stamps, lawmakers in the House and the Senate are expected to move quickly to try to write a farm bill that includes both food stamps and agricultural programs.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev, said Thursday, """"House Republicans' vote to deny nutrition assistance to hungry, low-income Americans is shameful. The Senate will never pass such hateful, punitive legislation.""

If Congress cannot pass a bill, the food stamp program would continue in its present state, with no cuts."

(CNN) – Despite signs from House Republicans they'll oppose any immigration measure that includes a pathway to citizenship, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi remained optimistic Tuesday that a bill overhauling the nation's immigration laws could pass the lower chamber.

Speaking on CNN's ""New Day,"" the California Democrat said Republicans looking to improve their electoral outlook among Latino voters will ultimately line up behind a bill that creates a fairer system for people who want to come to the United States.



""One of the reasons this bill is a priority for the Republicans in Congress and especially in the Senate is because in the last election, Hispanic voters went 70% for President Obama,"" Pelosi told CNN's Kate Bolduan. ""That sent an eloquent message to them that if they wanted to be relevant as they went down the road, they had to attract Hispanic voters, and not only Hispanic but other immigrant voters to our country.""

The Senate passed a key test vote on a border security amendment Monday to a larger bipartisan immigration reform bill supporters hope to approve by the end of the week. The 67-27 vote needed at least 60 votes to move forward.

Backers of the bill were hoping to win about 70 votes to demonstrate growing bipartisan momentum for the larger proposal as it nears final passage in the Democratic-controlled Senate and heads to the GOP-controlled House of Representatives.

In that chamber, a separate bipartisan group has been working on drafting immigration reform legislation, yet some Republicans have labeled any pathway to citizenship as ""amnesty,"" and vowed to oppose it.

But Pelosi predicted Tuesday that pressure to become more attractive to Latino voters would outweigh GOP opposition to the bill.

""Now they've had an epiphany on the subject…hopefully, they'll urge the Senate, the House Democrats and the House Republicans, to work together to get a bill,"" Pelosi said.

For three years, Adrian Zackheim, the publisher and president of three imprints at Penguin Random House, and Elizabeth Lunney, co-founder of ABC Languages, a foreign language school, fled Manhattan for weekends to the same house owned by Nancy Winston in Westport, Conn.

Mr. Zackheim, a New Yorker who was divorced, was renting a space in Westport so he could spend alternate weekends, as specified in the divorce decree, with his son David, then a high school sophomore. Ms. Lunney, a Californian who had never married, had been a serial moocher and weekend visitor once she had moved to New York in 1995.

“If it had a backyard, I’d take it,” she said. She settled into a routine of visiting the home of Ms. Winston, who was part of a multigenerational group of friends who connected through the California teaching center for Gestalt therapy known as Esalen, where Ms. Lunney’s mother and stepfather, Gordon Wheeler, worked.

But there was no spark between Mr. Zackheim, now 61, and Ms. Lunney, now 45.

Second-term Obama is noticeably quicker to speak his mind and get personal on subjects he once avoided. His schedule at times ignores concerns about “optics,” Washington-speak for what voters might perceive.

On Friday, for example, the president delivered an unexpectedly personal, and at times off-the-cuff, speech in Chicago about the root causes of urban violence. The famously reserved president spoke bluntly about the Kenyan-born father whom he barely knew, and his wayward high school days in Hawaii.

“I wish I had had a father who was around and involved,” he said.

In the past, Obama typically wove the uplifting version of his personal narrative — raised by a single mother, loved by doting grandparents — into his campaign message. He rarely admitted to having “issues,” as he did in Chicago.

Then, over the Presidents Day weekend, Obama headed to Florida for a golf outing with the guys. The president stayed in an exclusive resort near West Palm Beach, Fla., and hit the course with several friends and high-power donors, plus Tiger Woods. The president’s wife and two daughters, meanwhile, jetted west to ski in Aspen, Colo.

Obama’s vacations have been rare, brief and regularly interrupted by crises at home and overseas. Most recently, he suspended his Christmas holiday in Hawaii to rush back to Washington for a few days to deal with congressional negotiations over the so-called fiscal cliff.

The White House stressed that the president took his work to the Floridian Yacht and Golf Club.

“The president traveled to Florida for the weekend to spend some time with friends on the golf course, but the military aides, White House staffers and Secret Service agents who traveled with him are a reminder that he’s never far from the responsibilities of his job,” said spokesman Josh Earnest.

Still, it is hard to imagine Obama taking that sort of getaway before the election, particularly after a week when he delivered his State of the Union speech and unveiled an economic plan aimed at fighting poverty and providing relief for the middle class. It’s harder still to imagine him golfing with Woods — who saw his marriage, endorsement contracts and career tank in 2009 amid disclosures of sexual infidelities — while trying to woo female voters.

Obama’s Valentine’s Day date with First Lady Michelle Obama almost certainly would have become campaign fodder a few months ago. The first couple went to minibar, a Washington restaurant so avant-garde it doesn’t use capital letters, where the nightly prix fixe dinner for two runs $450, not including drinks, taxes and tips, according to its website. That’s more than a week’s pay at the $9-per-hour minimum wage Obama is advocating (and which is unlikely to go anywhere in Congress).

Presidential historians typically focus on the so-called second-term curse, the seemingly inevitable and usually self-created calamity that befalls many a president after reelection. But historian Gil Troy says a less-discussed phenomenon is the “second-term blessing.”

“In a lot of presidential biographies and memoirs, they talk about the night before the second reelection campaign ends. There’s always a touch of nostalgia, but far more than nostalgia, there’s a tremendous sense of relief when you get a sense that you don’t have to justify yourself anymore in that way and you’re not under that kind of scrutiny,” said Troy, a presidential historian at McGill University. “And that’s the basis of the second-term blessing.”

Troy says presidents tend to ease up, stop living by the polls and start thinking about their legacy.

There’s no doubt Obama has loosened up. He shed tears at his final campaign rally, a show of emotion that was rare in his first term but has happened several times since.

Long a stickler for adhering to his prepared remarks, Obama now sometimes goes off-script. As he announced his new public preschool program last week, he cracked himself up with an ad-libbed joke at Congress’ expense.

“That whole playing well with others, by the way, is a trait we could use more in Washington,” Obama said. “So maybe we need to bring the teachers up every once in a while, have some quiet time. Time out.”

“He definitely appears to be a lot more relaxed in his comments and seems more freewheeling in the way he addresses issues,” said Tony Fratto, a White House spokesman during President George W. Bush’s second term. “I feel like that has been a change we’ve seen since election day. There’s no question about that.”

Obama may be buoyed by his polls, which show his public approval rating has inched up since his reelection, his battles with House Republicans over taxes, and his efforts to reduce gun violence since the elementary school shooting in Newtown, Conn.

Still, historians say overconfidence can quickly turn the second-term blessing into the presidential curse.

Franklin D. Roosevelt’s failed attempt to pack the Supreme Court with extra justices in 1936 is the most often cited example, along with Bill Clinton’s impeachment by the House of Representatives for perjury and obstruction of justice in 1998.

“Sometimes it has led to hubris and overreach,” Troy said.

Browsing the library, you wonder if these two presidents are complete opposites after all, as you see how history was shaped by an arrogant, press-averse, father-fixated, history-obsessed, strangely introverted chief executive.

Robert Draper, the author of “Dead Certain: The Presidency of George W. Bush,” perused the library with me and observed: “So 43 grew up entitled but could display a commoner’s touch, while 44 grew up hardscrabble yet developed this imperial mien. The former is defined by incuriosity, the latter by self-absorption. One is a late-blooming artist, the other a precocious writer. They can each make you kind of miss the other.”

Obama’s compelling speech on Thursday was his way of saying he didn’t want the seductive but morally dicey drone program he inherited from W. to define his own presidency. The way it had been going, one of the killer robots, hanging from the ceiling, might have made a fitting centerpiece for an Obama library.

W.’s library highlights his role in launching the Global War on Terror, an Orwellian phrase designed to conflate the sins of Osama, who was responsible for 9/11, and the sins of Saddam, who was not. That was the fatal mistake and hallmark of the Bush era. W., Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld declared war on a tactic, stoked fear as a smokescreen and treated pre-emptive attacks as just.

Better late than never, Obama brought his lapidary logic and legal cautions to bear. “Neither I nor any president can promise the total defeat of terror,” he said. “We will never erase the evil that lies in the hearts of some human beings nor stamp out every danger to our open society.”"

Obama, even invoking former President Bush, said it's critical to ""change the way that Washington is doing business.""

But Republicans and even some Democrats warned that the Senate may have just opened a Pandora's box -- and with little debate, approved a change that could haunt the chamber for years to come.

""This was nothing more than a power grab,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said.

In a rapid-fire set of developments on Thursday, the Senate narrowly approved a rule change that would limit the ability of the minority party to block key presidential appointments. Instead of needing 60 votes to break a filibuster, Democrats will now need only 51.

More On This...

Speaking Thursday from the White House briefing room, Obama said the change was needed to deal with Republicans' ""unprecedented pattern of obstruction."" He cited the record of George W. Bush, claiming his predecessor had an easier time getting nominees confirmed.

Obama cited, among other stand-offs, the bid by Republicans to filibuster his nomination of Chuck Hagel, a former GOP senator, for Defense secretary.

""For the sake of future generations, we can't let it become normal,"" he said.

Republicans, though, argued that while it took Bush an average of 211 days to get a nominee confirmed, it's taken Obama 228 days -- just 17 days more. Judicial nomination statistics show that Obama has a confirmation percentage of 76 percent -- though majority leaders have had to try to break a filibuster far more in the last five years than in recent decades.

Following the vote Thursday, even some Democrats emerged as tough critics of the decision.

While Republicans were furious that their ability to hold up appointments had been scrambled, moderate Democrats were concerned more about how Reid was able to pull off the maneuver.

Sen. Mark Pryor, D-Ark., one of three Democrats who opposed the move, said it could ""permanently damage"" the Senate.

""This institution was designed to protect -- not stamp out -- the voices of the minority,"" he said.

Reid used what is known in Senate slang as the ""nuclear option."" To change Senate rules of this kind, it typically takes 67 votes. But Reid used a highly controversial shortcut and did it with just 51 votes.

Retiring Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., a prominent and influential moderate, put out a 2,300-word statement explaining in great detail why Reid's action Thursday could cause lasting damage.

""Changing the rules, in violation of the rules, by a simple majority vote is not a one-time action,"" he warned. ""If a Senate majority demonstrates it can make such a change once, there are no rules that bind a majority, and all future majorities will feel free to exercise the same power, not just on judges and executive appointments but on legislation.""

Levin argued that the move opened the floodgates for the majority to change important rules on a whim going forward.

""Today, we once again are moving down a destructive path,"" he said. ""Pursuing the nuclear option in this manner removes an important check on majority overreach which is central to our system of government.""

Levin made clear that he thinks Republicans were acting irresponsibly by blocking Obama's judicial nominees, and supports getting those nominees an up-or-down vote.

But he said there were other ways for Reid to achieve that, including by forcing GOP foes to stage an old-fashioned filibuster on the floor.

Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., was the other Democrat to oppose the rule change.

The filibuster, for better or worse, has been a defining feature of the Senate for decades. While this makes the Senate one of the slowest-moving legislative bodies in the world, it also prevents legislation and appointments from moving too fast.

The vote on Thursday vastly reduces the power of the minority to stall nominations and makes it easier for federal judges to get lifetime appointments. The move would not affect Supreme Court nominees.

The late Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., presented a powerful case against changing the rules back in 2010, when he said doing so would ""destroy the uniqueness of this institution.""

""In the hands of a tyrannical majority and leadership, that kind of emasculation of the cloture rule would mean that minority rights would cease to exist in the U.S. Senate,"" he said."

It differed from phone to phone, but sometime between late Monday and early Tuesday many mobile phones across Southern California received an Amber Alert related to two missing children in San Diego.

James Lee DiMaggio is suspected of killing Christina Anderson, 44, of Lakeside and kidnapping one or both of her children: Hannah Anderson, 16, and Ethan Anderson, 8.

Amber Alert Q&A: Why it happens, how to turn it off

Christina Anderson’s body was found Sunday night in the burning rubble of a house in the rural community of Boulevard in eastern San Diego County, authorities said.

The two children were likely abducted about 5 p.m. on Saturday, authorities said.

Amber Alerts sent out overnight described the vehicle DiMaggio is believed to be traveling in: a blue Nissan Versa with California license plate 6WCU986. Authorities believe he may be making his way north to Canada.

Some cellphones received only a text message, others buzzed and beeped. Some people got more than one alert.

It’s all thanks to the Wireless Emergency Alert program, a cellphone version of the Emergency Alert System that gives you the high-pitched test tone on your television.

Cellphone owners receive messages automatically, based on their proximity to the emergency, not based on their phone number.

“If you’re from Texas and that’s where your phone number is based and you’re traveling in California at the time of the Amber Alert, you’ll receive the text message about the Amber Alert in California on your Texas-based phone,” said CHP spokeswoman Fran Clader.

The messages go out over a special wireless carrier channel called Cell Broadcast and aren’t affected by regular cellphone traffic that might disrupt calls and text messages during times of heavy usage, according to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, which has teamed with the government in the program.

The signal is transmitted simultaneously to all mobile devices within the range of cell towers in the affected area. There are no texting charges. The system does not track phones’ whereabouts.

The system is a second-generation Amber Alert and replaces the Wireless Amber Alert program that sent text alerts only to cellphone users who subscribed to the service. The new system began Jan. 1 and requires cellphone customers to opt out to stop receiving alerts.

Hannah Anderson is described as 5-foot-7, 115 pounds with blond hair, blue eyes, a belly button ring, nose stud and pierced ears.

Ethan Anderson is described as 4-foot-11, 65 pounds with sandy blond hair.

DiMaggio is described as 5-foot-9, 150 pounds with brown hair and brown eyes.

Anyone with information on the case is asked to call the homicide detail at (858) 974-2321 or (858) 565-5200, or San Diego County Crime Stoppers at (888) 580-8477.

The Amber Alert program was created in 1996 in honor of 9-year-old Amber Hagerman, who was abducted and murdered near her home in Arlington, Texas.

To opt-out of the emergency alerts, change your phone’s message or alert message settings. They’re automatically included on phones that receive the alerts.

Christie says National Flood Insurance Program has been too slow in resolving claims from Sandy

New Jersey lost 346%2C000 housing units to the storm

The state and charities are waiting for federal settlements to know how much to award in grants

UNION BEACH, N.J. (AP) - Gov. Chris Christie said Tuesday the National Flood Insurance Program's handling of claims in New Jersey has been ""a disgrace,"" complaining that the program has been far too slow to resolve claims from Superstorm Sandy, with 70% of cases unresolved three months after the disaster.

The Republican governor said excessive paperwork, inadequate staffing, cumbersome audits and the threat of financial penalties to carriers and adjusters is interfering with the issuance of payments and prolonging the suffering of the thousands of New Jerseyans hurt by Sandy.

""I've been as patient as I'm going to be with the National Flood Insurance Program,"" Christie said. ""They need to get more people into New Jersey. They need to get to work. They need to get to processing these things. People need to know how much money they're going to have.""

Sandy damaged or destroyed about 346,000 housing units in New Jersey, resulting in estimated damage and storm-mitigation costs of $37 billion.

The state and charities are waiting for the federal settlements so they can know how much to award in grants to help people rebuild, Christie said during a briefing in the heavily damaged Jersey Shore community of Union Beach.

Christie said he is asking New Jersey's congressional delegation to pressure the Federal Emergency Management Agency to improve the performance of the flood insurance program. A FEMA spokesman said he had no immediate comment.

The governor complained that only about 30% of flood claims have been settled, or closed, compared with nearly 80% of the more than 430,000 other insurance claims filed by residents and businesses.

He said ""it is imperative that insurance claims be brought to final resolution so that residents can make critical decisions on if and how to rebuild.""

Christie also announced that the state Department of Banking and Insurance will start requiring private insurers to respond within five days to Sandy-related complaints filed with state. Insurance companies currently have 15 business days to respond to the department."

To attend a taping of TNT's ""Christmas in Washington"" yesterday, the first lady opted to wear her white embroidered J. Mendel crepe jacket -- the very same garment that caused uproar during President Obama's 2012 election. Michelle had first worn the Resort 2013 piece to the pre-Olympics Opening Ceremony reception at Buckingham Palace back in July 2012, prompting criticism for the jacket's $6,800 price tag.

Mrs. O was labeled ""out of touch"" by media outlets, which cited that the average American family was making $4,284 a month, only slightly more than half the cost of FLOTUS' jacket.

News sources like Fox pointed to the fact that Ann Romney, the wife of then-presidential candidate Mitt Romney, was condemned for wearing a $990 Reed Krakoff top for a television interview, asserting that a possible bias existed in Michelle's favor. Other outlets pointed to the fact that nobody seemed to be tallying the prices of the men's clothing during the presidential race.

Whatever side you take in this argument, Michelle certainly risks reigniting the debate by bringing back the now-infamous jacket. But hey, can you blame her for wanting to get another wear out of the thing after dropping that much cash?

This is not a man who is going to shrink from a fight with the chicken hawks of the Senate.

President Obama hit the right theme in nominating Hagel on Monday to be secretary of defense — the first enlisted man and the first Vietnam veteran to be so honored. “To this day, Chuck bears the scars — and the shrapnel —from the battles he fought in our name,” Obama said during an appearance with Hagel and other officials in the East Room.

“Maybe most importantly,” Obama added, “Chuck knows that war is not an abstraction. He understands that sending young Americans to fight and bleed in the dirt and mud, that’s something we only do when it’s absolutely necessary.”

Behind the men was the Washington Monument, concealed by the East Room’s gold curtains. In front of them, on Pennsylvania Avenue, workers were finishing the parade reviewing stand for Obama’s second inauguration. For the president, who has too often shied from forceful leadership, the Hagel nomination was a welcome sign that he is willing to pick a fight in his second term.

And Hagel is worth fighting for. The Republican former senator from Nebraska should and probably will be confirmed by the Senate, despite irresponsible claims that he is anti-Semitic, anti-Israel, anti-gay and a coddler of Iran. Most of that is false and the rest is irrelevant: As head of the Pentagon, Hagel would not determine foreign policy.

What he would do is lead the people who fight wars — and for that, the old infantry sergeant is uniquely qualified. When he says that war should be the last resort, he speaks with a moral authority that few of those senators who would judge him can match.

In accepting the nomination, Hagel spoke of the troops as his top priority, the “men and women in uniform and their families . . . who have sacrificed so much over more than a decade of war.” The only agenda item he mentioned was to “strengthen our country and strengthen our country’s alliances.”

Alliances were a Hagel trademark in the Senate, where, although he voted to authorize the Iraq war, he became a scalding critic of the George W. Bush administration’s unilateralist policies and bungled prosecution of the conflict. His criticism of the administration antagonized many of his Republican colleagues, who are now returning the favor.

Sen. John Cornyn (Tex.) called Hagel’s record “extremely concerning.” Sen. David Vitter (La.) said Hagel’s confirmation “would send exactly the wrong message.” Sen. Lindsey Graham (S.C.) said Hagel’s views send “the worst possible signal.”

Neither Cornyn nor Vitter lists military service in his biography. Graham was an Air Force lawyer.

Even some Republicans who once praised Hagel view him differently now that Obama has embraced him. When Hagel left the Senate four years ago, Sen. Mitch McConnell (Ky.) praised his “clear voice and stature on national security and foreign policy.” But on Sunday, the Senate minority leader retreated, telling ABC News’s George Stephanopoulos only that Hagel is “outspoken” and that it is necessary to “take a look at all the things that Chuck has said over the years.”

Before he can become Secretary of Defense, Chuck Hagel will likely face sharp questioning in his upcoming confirmation hearings. Post columnist David Ignatius says the confirmation battle could serve as a preview of the most important foriegn policy debates of 2013. (The Fold/The Washington Post)

Hagel, who fought from foxholes, knows better than to expect loyalty from former Senate colleagues, and he reacted with equanimity when neoconservative critics, hearing rumors of his nomination, put out word that he is anti-Semitic. “What a town!” he remarked at the time.

Standing to Obama’s right in the East Room on Monday, Hagel wore a slight frown beneath his droopy eyes as the president lavished praise on him. “As a young private, and then a sergeant, he served with honor alongside his own brother,” Obama recounted. “When Chuck was hit by shrapnel, his brother saved him. When his brother was injured by a mine, Chuck risked his life to pull him to safety.”

Hagel, hands at his side, continued to wear his unimpressed frown as the man he would succeed, Leon Panetta, said Hagel is “a patriot, he’s a decorated combat veteran, and . . . his deep understanding of the security issues facing this country make him the right choice to be secretary of defense.”

Panetta said he will return home to his California walnut farm to deal “with a different set of nuts.”

It will now be Hagel’s task to crack the nuts Panetta leaves behind — beginning with those in the Senate.

Two days from its implementation, little has changed.

Many remain skeptical and confused about the law. Critics are convinced it will curb consumers' choices while plunging the country deeper into debt.

But to millions who can't afford health insurance or were denied coverage because of pre-existing conditions, the law represents a new hope — both because of its aim to virtually guarantee access to all Americans and the pledge it would rein in spiraling health care costs.

The law, known colloquially by both detractors and supporters as Obamacare, now faces its ultimate test: whether it will work.

Barring an unlikely last-minute derailment in Congress, which may force a federal government shutdown as part of a Republican battle to block the law's implementation, more than 40 million Americans who don't have health insurance will have their first shot at signing up for coverage Tuesday.

Many of them will be doing so for the first time.

""These are our aunts, uncles, grandmas, parents and our neighbors who will now have an opportunity to seek the best health care available, an option they didn't have before,"" said Lee Francis, president and chief executive of Erie Family Health Center, one of the state's largest networks of community heath clinics.

For people who lost their jobs and benefits during the Great Recession, the new coverage offers a chance to regain some security.

""It's a blessing,"" said Debra Douglas, a Far South Side 52-year-old who last year lost her job as a certified nurse's assistant and the health insurance that came with it.

Of the more than 1.6 million uninsured Illinoisans, some 342,000 will be newly eligible for Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for the poor and disabled. Nearly 1 million others are expected to qualify for new federal tax credits to help offset the cost of buying private insurance on new health insurance exchanges. State officials expect about 337,000 to sign up in the first year.

Nationwide, the Congressional Budget Office projects that about 7 million will buy coverage for next year through exchanges, online marketplaces where consumers can compare health insurance plans and determine whether they're eligible for federal assistance.

As with many big programs, there have been setbacks.

Late last week, it was made clear that some portions of the system wouldn't be ready. Federal officials said Thursday that small-business and Spanish-language health insurance enrollment services would not begin Tuesday as planned.

That announcement came on the heels of a one-year delay on a mandate that large employers provide coverage to all full-time workers or pay a penalty.

Critics have seized on the stumbles as more proof that the law was ill-conceived, poorly executed and doomed for failure.

State and federal officials acknowledge that the enrollment systems are largely untested — at least with mass audiences. Illinois officials also had warned that a state call center to help guide consumers through the sign-up process might not be ready on time, but said late Saturday that it would.

""This is a very complex operation that we're putting up. We are coming down to the wire on it,"" said Cristal Thomas, one of Gov. Pat Quinn's deputy governors. ""We are sitting here pretty confident that we are launching on Oct. 1. Even if not everything (will have) full functionality, we will have something up and running for people to access.""

But the law itself is no panacea for solving America's problem with the uninsured, who drive up costs for others because they often put off going to the doctor until problems are so severe they must be admitted into the hospital. Those costs then get passed along to taxpayers and people with insurance, who pay higher health care premiums.

Millions of Americans are expected to remain uninsured, including more than 1 million in Illinois, at least in the first year, according to state and federal estimates.

Some of them are expected to knowingly forgo buying coverage and instead pay a less-costly tax penalty. Others, particularly those eligible for free Medicaid coverage, will remain uninsured because they'll remain in the dark about the law or have no immediate health issues that will spur them to sign up.

An estimated 525,000 immigrants living in the state illegally are barred from enrolling.

""It's a big problem,"" said Julie Hamos, director of the Illinois Healthcare and Family Services Department. ""They're going to be the uninsured in our society, and they're still going to be the charity cases in hospitals and clinics. It's very unfortunate because they also need health care.""

Illinois is one of seven states to operate its marketplace in a partnership with the federal government. Sixteen other states and the District of Columbia opted to run their own.

While the Quinn administration sought legislation to authorize setting up its own marketplace, state lawmakers shot down the bill, forcing Illinois into the federal partnership, at least for 2014.

Administration officials say the partnership hamstrung certain efforts, including consumer education and outreach, because federal money that funded those programs came later to Illinois than other states.

""We missed the steps this summer to educate people,"" said Kelly Sullivan, the chief marketing and communications officer for the Get Covered Illinois exchange. Therefore, the state made the decision to delay its advertising and marketing blitz until after the exchanges open and focus on education in the first few weeks.

The effect of the late advertising and marketing effort is apparent in poll after poll showing that a majority of Americans still know little about the law and how they may benefit.

Further adding to the uncertainty is limited information about how much the insurance plans on the exchanges will cost."

Rebello raised the point that even highly educated people, including Barack Obama, consciously drop g's from words in order to sound more like the average Joe.

""First of all, we know it ain’t because of his blackness, so I say stop trying to 'relate,'"" Jackson replied while chatting with the men's magazine in West Hollywood. ""Be a leader. Be f--king presidential. Look, I grew up in a society where I could say 'It ain’t' or 'What it be' to my friends. But when I’m out presenting myself to the world as me, who graduated from college, who had family who cared about me, who has a well-read background, I f--king conjugate.""

He then addressed comments he made last year to Ebony magazine, saying he hopes ""Obama gets scary in the next four years."" Alas, he doesn't think much has changed since then, due to the political deadlock in Washington.

""He got a little heated about the kids getting killed in Newtown and about the gun law,"" he told Playboy. ""He’s still a safe dude. But with those Republicans, we’re now in a situation where even if he said, 'I want to give you motherf--kers a raise,' they’d go, 'F--k you! We don’t want a raise!' ... How do we fix the fact that politicians aren’t trying to serve the people, they’re just trying to serve their party and their closed ideals?""

(The actor's use of the f-word is not out of anger. He has said that using the term ""motherf**kers"" helped stop his stutter.)

Despite his harsh words, Jackson has long been an Obama supporter. Last September, before the 2012 election, he starred in an ad telling people to ""Wake the F--k Up"" and vote for Obama, dubbing Mitt Romney an ""out-of-touch millionaire.""

In 2008, Jackson helped raise $10 million for Obama, according to The Hill. Both he and Sharon Stone donated $50,000. Other donors included Halle Berry, Jamie Lee Curtis and Jamie Foxx."

President Obama is expected to provide some details of the White House plans during a Tuesday appearance in Las Vegas, where he will call for broad changes to the nation’s immigration laws. The speech will kick off a public push by the administration in support of the broadest overhaul of immigration law in nearly three decades.

Obama plans to praise the proposals laid out Monday by an eight-member Senate working group, saying they reflect the core tenets of the administration’s immigration blueprint developed in 2011, a senior administration official said.

But the president’s remarks also are likely to emphasize differences that could foreshadow roadblocks to passage in Congress at a time when both parties say there is momentum for a comprehensive deal.

For example, the Senate proposal would let illegal immigrants obtain legal residency quickly. But it would not allow them to seek full citizenship until border security had been improved and a new system was in place for employers to verify the employment status of workers.

Obama will not endorse such a proposal, the administration official said. The president intends to make clear the need for a more straightforward route for un­documented workers and students to obtain citizenship, reflecting fears among advocates that a cumbersome process would create a decades-long wait for some migrants.

“We see the Senate principles as a centrist set of principles, but we expect the administration to be more detailed to the left,” said Frank Sharry, executive director of America’s Voice, a leading immigration advocacy group. “I don’t think it’ll be an immigration advocate’s dream, but it will be a solid left-of-center proposal.”

White House press secretary Jay Carney sought to close the gap between the White House and the Senate group during his daily briefing with reporters Monday, calling the Capitol Hill announcement “a big deal” because it includes a path to citizenship supported by four senators from each party. Similar provisions — opposed by many Republicans who think they would reward lawbreakers over those who come to the country legally — helped doom previous attempts to overhaul immigration in 2007 and 2010.

“This is in keeping with the principles the president has been espousing for a long time, in keeping with bipartisan efforts in the past and with the effort this president believes has to end in a law that he can sign,” Carney said.

He declined to say whether the White House objects to the proposal from the Senate group that would tie citizenship to border security and employment-verification measures. But he noted the administration’s focus on border-security issues, which included deporting nearly 410,000 immigrants in 2012, an all-time high.

The borders “have never been better enforced than they are now,” Carney said.

Months of development

The White House’s immigration plans have been in the works for months. Senior administration officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal deliberations, said the White House has developed specific legislative language spelling out Obama’s proposals. But they said they are not going to make the language public at this point because the administration is encouraged by the Senate group’s progress.

The president also is likely to support treating same-sex couples in which one partner is an immigrant the same as married heterosexual couples — meaning gay and lesbian immigrants in relationships with U.S. citizens could apply for citizenship. Such a provision is almost certain to draw opposition from Catholic and Baptist groups that have been supportive of comprehensive reform.

Immigration advocates said they expect Obama to be forceful in his public remarks Tuesday and offer details that go beyond the blueprint on the White House Web site. But there are risks for the president, who has accused Republicans of opposing his initiatives to avoid giving him political credit.

If Obama’s speech in Las Vegas, in a state with a growing number of Hispanic voters, is too tri­umphant or too hectoring, he could risk alienating Republicans whose support will be necessary, some lawmakers have said. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) warned Obama against delivering a “divisive, partisan speech.”

Yet the White House also is mindful that Latino and Asian voters expect him to follow through on an immigration overhaul after failing to achieve it in his first term. Obama had promised to make immigration the key initiative of his second term, but it took a back seat to gun control in the wake of the mass shooting in Newtown, Conn., in December.

Talks without White House

In the meantime, the Senate working group, which had originally targeted its announcement for Friday, moved it up in advance of Obama’s speech. Senate aides said the White House had minimal involvement in the bipartisan talks, preferring a hands-off approach, in part because of failed bipartisan efforts on deficit reduction and other issues.

One White House official said Obama spoke Sunday to Senate Democrats who briefed him on the group’s progress, which came more quickly than the White House expected.

Despite the optimism of Monday’s announcement, senators on both sides acknowledged that they must settle several thorny issues before drafting a bill. They aim to introduce legislation by the end of March.

Democratic aides said the process could receive a boost if Obama champions a framework that provides a smoother path to citizenship. The Senate outline would appear more centrist by comparison, potentially making it easier for Republicans to support. A progressive White House plan would also help prevent the Senate effort from getting pushed much further to the right over time.

Angela Kelley, an immigration expert at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, called the parallel efforts “a healthy competition” between the White House and the Senate.

“The inevitable question for the White House was: How does a legislative initiative get underway?” Kelley said. “To some extent, the senators answered that, so it’s a nice coupling of developments.”"

(Marlon Correa/The Washington Post)

The illuminated billboard in the Judiciary Square Metro station near the F Street entrance was strategically placed.

Prospective jurors who take the subway to D.C. Superior Court and exit near the National Building Museum see these words: “Good jurors nullify bad laws” and “You have the right to ‘hang’ the jury with your vote if you cannot agree with other jurors.”

Since the billboard went up this month, District prosecutors have been worried that the message could sway their cases. In the past week alone, they have asked judges in three ­cases to ensure that jurors had neither seen nor been influenced by the billboard.

The billboard is part of a growing national campaign to encourage jurors who disagree with a law, or think a punishment is too harsh, to vote for acquittal. Kirsten Tynan of the Montana-based Fully Informed Jury Association, whose name and Web address is included on the billboard, said the nonprofit group generally challenges crimes it calls “victimless,” such as vandalism by graffiti or gun possession.

James Babb, a Philadelphia-based graphics artist who organized a fundraising campaign to put up the billboard, said he raised $3,000 in about a week through Facebook and other ­social-media sites. He said he is concerned about laws that he thinks are too restrictive.

“People are going to jail for weed,” Babb said. “Things are getting so weird. There needs to be this final safeguard to protect us from a tyrannical government.”

Babb’s group has added a similar message on two pillars in Archives station, another Metro stop near the courthouse. Both displays are scheduled to be up for about a month. Babb said he also plans to place signs in other cities, including Chicago and Los Angeles.

Supporters of jury nullification in several cities have raised the ire of judges and prosecutors. In New York last year, an 80-year-old man was charged with jury tampering after passing out fliers about jury nullification to courthouse visitors; the case was later dismissed by a federal judge.

Locally, prosecutors have been scrambling to ensure that the billboard’s message doesn’t influence their ­cases.

In a gang-related murder trial set to begin this week, prosecutors filed a motion asking the judge to question potential jurors about whether they had seen the billboard. They also requested that the judge remind jurors that their verdict should not be influenced by whether they agree or disagree with the law.

In their memo, prosecutors Todd Gee and Emily Miller wrote that jurors who see the billboard may think “they don’t have to abide by an oath” and that it could encourage them “to hang and to learn about the concept of jury nullification.”

In another recent murder case, the jury had already been sworn in and the trial was underway when prosecutors alerted Superior Court Judge Herbert Dixon to the billboard. Dixon, according to people familiar with the case, then asked the jurors if they had seen the billboard. No one said they had.

Days later, the jury found the defendant, Grant Johnson, 39, of Bladensburg, Md., guilty of first-degree murder in the slaying of 32-year-old Ricardo Lancaster during a drug deal in 2012, prosecutors said.

And in a trial involving an assault with a deadly weapon, Assistant U.S. Attorney Brittain Shaw asked the judge to question potential jurors about the billboard. Days later, the jury found the defendant, Charles Link, 53, guilty in a knife attack in November that left one man injured.

The billboard also comes as Adam Kokesh, a Fairfax County-based gun rights activist, is preparing to go to trial after posting an Independence Day video on YouTube of himself apparently loading a shotgun in Freedom Plaza. He had been scheduled to go to trial Thursday, but the case was pushed back to at least Nov. 18.

Kokesh’s supporters have advocated for jury nullification in his case.

Tynan said the Metro billboard was not directly aimed at the Kokesh, who pleaded not guilty to carrying a pistol without a license, but she said that his case was the kind her organization targeted. “It’s a victimless trial,” Tynan said.

A spokesman for the U.S. attorney’s office said there has been no organized effort by prosecutors to address the billboard, but instead prosecutors have raised the issue on a case-by-case basis.

“Jurors in the District of Columbia play an important role in holding accountable the criminals who threaten and harm the people who live, work and visit our city,” U.S. Attorney Ronald C. Machen Jr. said in a statement. But he added, “Jurors who ignore the law or refuse to follow the judge’s instructions embolden criminals who believe that they can get away with breaking the law and do harm to the community without any repercussion.”"

When former White House physician Dr. Connie Mariano expressed concern that Chris Christie's weight may make him unfit for office and could be a deciding factor in his potential presidential candidacy in 2016, the New Jersey Governor came out swinging.

During an interview with CNN, Mariano said that Christie could suffer a heart attack or stroke during his tenure. ""I'm worried about this man dying in office,"" she said.

His response? Take a family history. According to an AP and HuffPost report, Christie told the doctor to ""shut up"" unless she had personally examined him and learned about his family history of heart risk. Undeterred, Mariano responded (via an interview with Bloomberg), saying that ""you don't have to be a doctor to see that he is obese.""

Who is right? And is it possible to be healthy and obese? As Christie said on The Late Show with David Letterman, ""I'm basically the healthiest fat guy you've ever seen in your life.""

""Obesity leads to an increase risk of diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol. Those are risk factors for heart disease, but so is smoking and family history,"" Dr. Robert Michler, chairman of Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery at Montefiore Medical Center, told HuffPost. ""Hundreds of thousands of people who are obese reach old age and even die without having a heart attack or stroke.""

It's an important distinction: Obesity is not a condition that causes heart attacks directly. Instead, it increases the risk of developing chronic conditions like major heart disease, high cholesterol and hypertension and those, in turn, often result in heart attack and stroke. Does the obese Christie, 50, have a higher chance of developing one of these conditions and of subsequently dying of a cardiac event? Yes. But that doesn't mean he will.

According to New York University's Langone Weight Management Center, about 300,000 Americans die each year from obesity-related complications, though 35.7 percent of the U.S. population is obese (about 112 million people), according to the latest estimates from the CDC.

And, as a recent study in the Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine found, obesity in and of itself is not a good predictor of health status. They found that during a six year period, obese study participants were no more likely to die than their healthy-weight counterparts if they didn't have one of the chronic diseases associated with obesity, like Type 2 diabetes or hypertension.

Early death may not be the primary outcome of obesity, but illness abounds. Obesity is associated with heart failure, coronary heart disease, hypertension, Type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol, sleep apnea and other respiratory problems, and even some cancers. It also exacerbates other conditions, like asthma, for which Christie has previously been hospitalized.

Although we don't know the governor's BMI or weight information, it is relevant to his overall heart attack risk. According to NYU Langone, an obese person has an average of six times the heart disease risk as a non-obese person. And that risk increases depending on how obese you are. In the Framingham Heart Study, a famous, longitudinal study of overall cardiac risk, researchers found that for every increment increase in an adult man's BMI, there was an associated five percent increased risk of heart failure.

What's interesting is that obese heart failure patients have better outcomes and are less likely to die than heart failure patients with a healthy weight -- something that doctors refer to as the ""heart failure paradox,"" explains Michler.

Stroke risk, which Mariano also expressed concern about, increases with BMI, as well: for every increment increase of BMI, the risk of ischemic stroke goes up four percent and the risk of hemorrhagic stroke increases six percent.

Despite his bluster and understandable dismay that a doctor who hasn't examined him would speculate about his health, it seems as though the risks of remaining so profoundly overweight have begun to sink in. ""I have been remarkably healthy,"" Christie told Letterman. ""My doctor continues to warn me my luck is going to run out relatively soon. So, believe me, it is something that I am very conscious of."""

"http://www.latimes.com/business/realestate/la-fi-harney-20130113,0,6931945.story",2013-01-13 08:00:00,[],Homeowners and sellers escape ‘fiscal cliff’ with key benefits,"WASHINGTON — Although it wasn’t a total win for homeowners and sellers, the patchwork legislation that emerged from the “fiscal cliff” fracas on Capitol Hill came pretty close. In fact, it even reached back and resuscitated two key tax benefits for housing that had expired more than a year ago. Now homeowners will be able to take deductions on their 2012 tax returns that they assumed were no longer available.

Here’s a quick tally sheet on what the new legislation could mean for you as a buyer, seller or owner.

• Do you, like millions of Americans, pay mortgage insurance premiums or guarantee fees on an FHA, VA, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Rural Housing loan? The American Taxpayer Relief Act — the fiscal cliff compromise bill — allows you to write off the insurance premiums you paid during 2012 along with your mortgage interest, provided your household income does not exceed $110,000. Legal authorization for this deduction expired at the end of 2011. But the new bill retroactively permits write-offs for 2012 and 2013 for qualified borrowers.

• Did you do some energy efficiency renovations in your home during 2012, installing insulation, energy-saving windows, doors, roofing material, non-solar water heaters and the like? Maybe you’re thinking about doing a little green rehab in 2013? For either year, you may be able to claim up to a $500 tax credit thanks to the revival of a home energy improvement incentive that lapsed in 2011. Five hundred bucks may not sound huge, but remember: It’s a credit, not a deduction, so it means $500 off the bottom line of your federal tax return.

• Are you planning a short sale of your underwater home this year or hoping to receive a principal reduction on your loan as a result of a mortgage modification by your lender? The new legislation reauthorized the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act that had been scheduled to terminate Dec. 31, and spares you potentially punitive federal taxes on the amount forgiven. Had the debt relief exception in the tax code not been renewed, large numbers of underwater owners participating in short sales — in which banks agree to accept less than the full amounts owed on a loan as part of a sale to a new buyer or investor — would have faced taxation on the full amount forgiven, as if it were regular income.

Lenders and real estate brokers say thousands of financially distressed homeowners would have been devastated by the expiration. Alexis Eldorrado, a Chicago-area real estate specialist in short sales, says she has five clients who are underwater on their mortgages by an average of $100,000 and awaiting short sale closings in the coming weeks. They probably would have had to file for bankruptcy had Congress not renewed the debt forgiveness law, she said, because none of them could afford to pay taxes on $100,000 they never actually received.

What’s in the legislation that some buyers or sellers might not like? Start with steeper capital gains taxes for high-income sellers with big gains that exceed current federal exclusion limits of $250,000 (single tax filers) and $500,000 (married joint filers). Say you are single and earn more than $400,000, or you’re married, file jointly and earn more than $450,000. Under the new legislation, you can expect to pay 20% on capital gains. So if you sell your principal residence this year and your gain on the sale is $750,000, the capital gains tax rate on the amount in excess of the exclusion limit will be 20%, rather than 15%. Sellers below the income thresholds will still pay capital gains taxes at 15%, and earners at the two lowest tax brackets will pay nothing on capital gains.

Another negative: The fiscal cliff deal limits deductions for mortgage interest, property taxes, charitable donations and other write-offs for single-filing taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes above $250,000 and married joint filers above $300,000. The formula it uses is complex, but it could amount to about $1,000 in additional tax liability for a couple with an income around $400,000, according to housing industry estimates.

All in all, not so bad. Then again, major tax reform efforts are coming this spring, with mortgage interest and other real estate write-offs prominent among the targets. So enjoy the fiscal cliff bill results — at least for a little while.

Overview

Laura visited a lab in Oxfordshire, where mice are being used to try to work out a cure for glue ear - a problem which affects many children.

Using animals for experiments is a big issue, causing lots of debate.

Students debate the issues surrounding animal testing.

Learning aims

Cruelty arguments

Scientific progress arguments

Ice-breaker

Open the debate by reading out some of these comments:

Main activity

Class debate

Explain that the class is going to debate the issues surrounding animal testing.

A debate is based around a suggestion or motion.

The motion is:

This house believes that animal testing should continue.

Divide the class into proposers (for the motion) and opposers (against the motion).

Students research and write down arguments which either support or oppose the motion.

A summary of arguments and a guide can be found by clicking on the links in the blue box.

Select seven students to be:

Speaker. This person chairs the debate but cannot take part or vote.

First proposer to speak

First opposer to speak

Opposer to sum up

Proposer to sum up

Two tellers to count the votes

The Speaker presents the motion.

The first proposer presents the arguments for the motion.

The first opposer presents the arguments against the motion.

One of the proposers presents their arguments for the motion.

An opposer presents their arguments against the motion.

This side to side motion continues until everyone has had their say.

An opposer sums up their group's main argument.

A proposer sums up their group's main argument.

Name one side of the classroom the 'aye' wall and the opposite side the 'no' wall.

The Speaker re-reads the motion.

Hold the debate in this order:

Students vote twice:

1. Students vote to support or oppose the motion, depending on which they thought were the most convincing and well-constructed arguments. This may not necessarily be what they believe personally. The Speaker can't vote.

They do so by going to the 'aye' or 'no' side of the classroom.

The two tellers count up the votes (bodies), on either side of the room.

The Speaker announces the result of the vote.

2. Students vote according to their beliefs. The Speaker is no longer in role and can therefore vote.

As before, the two tellers count up the votes (bodies), on either side of the room and the Speaker announces the result of the vote.

Extension activity

Students write a personal statement of their opinions. They pick the five arguments they find the most convincing and include them in a report that starts:

I support/I oppose animal testing because...

Plenary

If students had to experiment on animals themselves, how many students would still vote for animal testing?

Teachers' Background

The mouse is the most widely used animal in research labs. In the UK 1,607,000 mice underwent experiments in 2000.

More than 2.5 million live animal experiments were authorised in Great Britain in 2000. This number has halved since the 1970s.

Around the world, animals are used to test products ranging from shampoo to new cancer drugs.

British law requires that any new drug must be tested on at least two different species of live mammal. One must be a large non-rodent.

Almost every medical treatment you use has been tested on animals. Animals were also used to develop anaesthetics to prevent human pain and suffering during surgery.

At least that's what happened in Australia when 65-year-old Bruce Dusting proposed to 42-year-old single mom Marie Lacombe and she shot him down. After the rejection, Dusting sent Lacombe a $200,000 bill accounting for every dime he spent on her during their alleged four-year courtship, as reported by A Current Affair in Australia.

The enormous bill includes money for Zumba classes, dental appointments, cash for Lacombe's kid's birthday party, a tummy tuck and even breast implants. Apparently Dusting expected to be paid back, telling ACA, ""She will not get away with this.""

But Lacombe tells ACA a different story, saying, ""He's a shark.""

In fact, the single mom claims the two were never romantically involved, explaining she was his dance teacher and they became friends. She says any money Dusting gave her was his choice and the bill is an act of revenge.

Of course, Dusting isn't the first to look for revenge post-breakup.

Recently a man in New York filed a lawsuit against his ex after he dumped her, claiming she blasted bogus information about their sex life all over the Internet. She accused him of ""rape play"", ""auto-erotic asphyxiation,"" and having a ""micro penis,"" according to Gawker.

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Movie stars and athletes joined children in the festivities

This year%27s theme was a healthy one%2C in keeping with Michelle Obama%27s fight against obesity

The budget crunch led to canceling White House tours but not the annual egg roll

WASHINGTON -- For President Obama, the White House Easter Egg Roll on Monday turned into one of those ""best of times, worst of times"" kinds of deals.

The best: Hanging out with the Easter Bunny.

The worst: Going only 2-of-22 on the basketball court.

Obama grimaced repeatedly as shot after shot clanged off the rim. Eventually, the president asked 10-year-old Kahron Campbell of Landover, Md., for help, and the boy made a layup.

""He couldn't make one,"" young Kahron later told reporters. ""I had to help him out.""

On a happier note, Obama got to introduce the Easter Bunny to thousands of children who gathered on the South Lawn for the 135th annual White House Easter Egg Roll. ""Give the Easter Bunny a big round of applause!"" the president told the crowd.

First lady Michelle Obama urged the children to have fun and ""run around,"" but also to learn something about nutrition and exercise, pursuant to the theme of this year's egg roll: ""Be Healthy, Be Active, Be You!""

""We want you guys to have a good time and keep moving and be healthy,"" the first lady said. ""And, kids, eat your vegetables, okay?""

Mascots with names like Colby Carrot and Erica Eggplant helped drive home the healthy eating message.

In addition to the traditional egg rolling and egg hunting, visitors could listen to music, dance at the ""Hop To It Stage,"" and learn sports from professional athletes.

More than 30,000 people from all 50 states and the District of Columbia -- winners of a special lottery -- swarmed the White House lawn throughout the day.

Among the guests: Relatives of children killed during the Dec. 14 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. The White House did not provide names, citing privacy concerns.

The mother and brother of Hadiya Pendleton -- a 15-year-old killed by gunfire shortly after attending Obama inauguration ceremonies in Washington -- also attended the egg roll. Ten-year-old Nathaniel Pendleton, Jr., played tennis with Obama.

In her remarks to the crowd, Mrs. Obama noted that ""the Easter Egg Roll is the biggest event that we have here on the South Lawn of the White House each year.""

After a heavy morning fog gave way to bright sunshine, Obama congratulated his guests on bringing good weather, saying they did ""a great job sending a message upstairs.""

Both Obamas later cheered on groups of egg rollers, who were deploying some of 19,000 eggs provided for the event. The White House said 14,500 hard-boiled eggs were dyed for rolls and hunts, while 4,500 others were available for children to decorate.

Some special eggs made a bird chirping sound so that children with poor eyesight could participate.

Children at the White House Egg Roll could also listen to story readings -- including one from the president himself, accompanied by the family dog Bo.

Obama's selection: Chicka, Chicka, Boom Boom, a rhyming alphabet story involving the climbing of a tree. (""A told B/ and B told C/ ""I'll meet you at the top/ of the coconut tree."")

""If you know how to read, then the whole world opens to you,"" Obama told children who attended his performance.

The president then headed for the basketball court for his 2-of-22 performance.

Meanwhile, Mrs. Obama at one point visited the ""Kids' Kitchen,"" where Al Roker of the Today show helped chef Anne Burrell make a broccoli rabe pesto with spicy Italian sausage. Burrell said the dish reflected a balanced diet that included nuts, vegetables, dairy, and extra virgin olive oil.

Applying the taste test, Mrs. Obama said: ""Mmmm, it's good.""

In addition to the famous bunny, the event featured Robby Novak, who plays ""Kid President"" in a series of popular YouTube videos, and who introduced the first couple. Oscar-nominated actress Quvenzhane Wallis ( Beasts of the Southern Wild ) and muppets from Sesame Street also made appearances.

A number of sport stars worked with children in the ""Eggtivity Zone."" They included Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson, NASCAR driver Danica Patrick and Washington Wizards point guard John Wall.

Some ticket recipients had worried that the egg roll might be canceled, either because of sequestration -- the series of automatic budget cuts that led to the cancellation of White House public tours -- or the threat of a government shutdown.

But Congress and the White House struck a short term budget deal last week, and Obama administration officials said the egg roll was never subject to the sequester.

The National Park Service, which organizes the event, says it's largely funded by sales of commemorative wooden eggs, as well as some private donations. The park service has not announced the full cost of the event."

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/02/25/Obama-s-Organizing-For-Action-Files-Complaints-Against-Website-Owners,2013-02-25 00:00:00,['Warner Todd Huston'],Obama Fails to Register 'OrganizingForAction.net'; Site Points to NRA Home Page,"At the beginning of the year, President Barack Obama’s new 501(c)4 political nonprofit, Organizing For Action, was launched with all the usual bells and whistles. But the tech wizards at OFA forgot one important rule in today’s Internet world: Register all the iterations of your website address before someone else does.

Now Obama’s team is filing complaints against the folks smart enough to get the addresses before he did.

As Obama’s OFA made its debut, no one in his purportedly Internet-savvy campaign had obtained the corresponding .com, .net, .org or .us sites, nor did OFA register other names that are close to its official one, as is the sensible practice. In the case of the .net address, a fellow named Derek Bovard had already registered the .net address by the time Obama’s team took notice.

Bovard has routed his new site to the homepage of the National Rifle Association.

So, whenever anyone goes to www.organizingforaction.net they end up seeing the homepage of the NRA.

Naturally, Obama and his fellow community organizers were furious. So furious, in fact, that they have replied by filing complaints against Bovard–and, apparently, a variety of other people who had registered domain names that OFA now wants.

Obama’s group filed the complaints with the authority that governs website domain addresses, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). The complaints were filed under Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (UDRP) rules. Obama’s case number is 1483257 and was filed on Feb 6. UDRP cases are usually decided within one to two months after first filing.

Bovard told Breitbart that he feels he has a solid case that he owns the .net address fair, square, and legally.

“We have been granted ‘Service Mark’ #85838531 from the United States Patent and Trademark Office for the website as ‘Providing an on-line website featuring information on the United States Constitution and Conservative values’ and we were also the first to use it in ‘commerce.’ So I don’t believe they have any valid legal ground to stand on in regards to this website name. Before purchasing this site I had checked TESS (Trademark Electronic Search System) for any existing Trademarks or Service Marks and found none. I also searched for any existing companies called Organizing for Action and found none. So I bought it, legally.”

Bovard said he intends to use the site address to provide “information on the United States Constitution and Conservative values.”

“This site is going to be used strictly to discuss political views and ideas based on Conservative Values, the US Constitution, the Bill of Rights and Freedom of Speech in the USA which seems to be overlooked quite often. My partner and I are firm believers in not only the First and Second Amendment Rights, but in ALL Rights granted to us by our country, my country.”

Bovard also disputed several reports that he offered the address for sale to team Obama.

“I also want to make it perfectly clear that I have no intentions of selling this website name to Obama’s group nor did I purchase it with the intent of selling it to them or anyone else. It’s never been for sale, I’ve never solicited it for sale. I have indicated a personal opinion about it’s worth but that’s it.”

“We have taken what little action we could to contribute to the fight against anyone who attempts to defy or go against the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the rights contained within them. We are sickened by the mockery being made of our country and our government and then advertising this mess to our fellow citizens and the rest of the world,” Bovard said in an email."

The impression conveyed was of a president as manager, one without much of an agenda or the political wherewithal for new initiatives that could make it through a Congress where Republicans are more determined than ever to thwart him before next year’s midterm elections. He ends the first year of his second term — typically the best chance for policy achievements before lame-duck status sets in — with his approval ratings having hit a record low and many Democrats disillusioned by the controversies over the health insurance law and disclosures about widespread intelligence surveillance of phone records.

From the news conference’s first question — “Has this been the worst year of your presidency?” — Mr. Obama offered a sobering review of a year that had begun, after his decisive re-election, with the expansive language, high hopes and summons to political unity contained in his second Inaugural Address. “For now decisions are upon us,” he said in wrapping up that speech, “and we cannot afford delay.”

Eleven months later, Mr. Obama was prepared as reporters drilled him on the disappointments he has suffered since that January celebration. He laughed at that first question, and said that reporters had chronicled “at least 15 near-death experiences” during his tenure. He maintained a game face, if a haggard one, as he acknowledged the frustrations and failures on immigration, budget policy, gun violence and health care that were part of his second-term agenda — one that, while ambitious, was not nearly as sweeping as his first."

Now, notice the scant attention being given to an assault on civil liberties by the misconceived Education Department’s misnamed Office for Civil Rights (OCR).

Responding to what it considers the University of Montana’s defective handling of complaints about sexual assaults, OCR, in conjunction with the Justice Department, sent the university a letter intended as a “blueprint” for institutions nationwide when handling sexual harassment, too. The letter, sent on May 9, encourages (see below) adoption of speech codes — actually, censorship regimes — to punish students who:

Make “sexual or dirty jokes” that are “unwelcome.” Or disseminate “sexual rumors” (even if true) that are “unwelcome.” Or make “unwelcome” sexual invitations. Or engage in the “unwelcome” circulation or showing of “e-mails or Web sites of a sexual nature.” Or display or distribute “sexually explicit drawings, pictures, or written materials” that are “unwelcome.”

UCLA law professor Eugene Volokh, a specialist in First Amendment jurisprudence, notes (on the indispensable Volokh Conspiracy blog) that the OCR-DOJ’s proscriptions are “not limited to material that a reasonable person would find offensive.” The Supreme Court has held that for speech or conduct in schools to lead to a successful sexual harassment lawsuit, it must be sufficiently severe and pervasive to create a hostile environment. And it must be “objectively offensive” to a reasonable person. But, Volokh notes, the OCR-DOJ rules would mandate punishment for any individual’s “conduct of a sexual nature,” conduct “verbal, nonverbal or physical,” that is not objectively offensive to a normal person. This means any conduct “unwelcome” by anyone.

Greg Lukianoff, president of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, says a single hypersensitive person could declare herself sexually harassed because she considers “unwelcome” a classroom lecture on the novel “Lolita” or a campus performance of “The Vagina Monologues.” Do not even attempt a sex education class.

Wendy Kaminer, a civil liberties lawyer who writes for the Atlantic, traces the pedigree of the OCR-DOJ thinking to the attempt by some feminists in the 1980s to define pornography as a form of sexual assault and hence a civil rights violation. Volokh, too, believes that the government is blurring the distinction between physical assaults and “sexually themed” speech in order to justify censoring and punishing the latter.

The OCR-DOJ “blueprint” requires, Kaminer says, colleges and universities to hear harassment complaints under quasi-judicial procedures “that favor complainants.” Under 2011 rules that establish a low standard of proof, Kaminer says, “students accused of harassment are to be convicted in the absence of clear and convincing evidence of guilt, if guilt merely seems more likely than not.” And schools are enjoined to “take immediate steps to protect the complainant from further harassment,” including “taking disciplinary action against the harasser” prior to adjudication. So the OCR-DOJ “blueprint” and related rules not only violate the First Amendment guarantee of free speech but are, to be polite, casual about due process.

Hans Bader, a former OCR lawyer now with the limited-government Competitive Enterprise Institute, notes that this “Alice in Wonderland” — “sentence first, verdict afterwards” — system “casts a cloud over academic freedom and the ability to discuss topics that are offensive to some listeners.” Indeed, to one listener.

When the Education Department was created in 1980 (Jimmy Carter’s payment to the National Education Association, the largest teachers union, for its first presidential endorsement), conservatives warned that it would be used for ideological aggression to break state and local schools to the federal saddle. Lukianoff says:

“Given that the [OCR-DOJ] letter represents an interpretation of federal law by major federal agencies, most colleges will regard it as binding. Noncompliance threatens federal funding, including Pell grants and Stafford loans.”

Most of academia’s leadership is too invertebrate and too soggy with political correctness to fight the OCR-DOJ mischief. But someone will. And it is so patently unconstitutional that it will be swiftly swatted down by the courts. Still, it is useful idiocy because, coming right now, it underscores today’s widespread government impulse for lawless coercion — the impulse that produced the Internal Revenue Service’s suppression of political speech that annoys the Obama administration.

Like the IRS abuses of power, the OCR-DOJ initiative demonstrates how permeated this administration is with disagreeable people with dangerous intentions. So the administration is making conservatism’s case against the unlimited arrogance that is both a cause and a consequence of unlimited government.

Gregory Mankiw'],"From Summer Camp, a Parable for Washington","During the first week of camp, the groups were separated. The boys within each group participated in various activities together, like hiking and swimming. They bonded with one another, and each group developed its own norms of behavior. The two groups named themselves the Eagles and the Rattlers.

In the second week of camp, the Eagles and the Rattlers were brought together for competitive team activities like baseball and tug-of-war. Even though the boys had similar backgrounds, the competition was far from friendly. Taunting, name-calling and vandalizing the other team’s property were common. The teams were so aggressive that the researchers sometimes had to physically separate them. When the boys were later asked about the experience, they described their own team as virtuous and the opposing team in much more negative terms.

In short, group identity and competition led to irrational and self-righteous hostility. Doesn’t that sound like the political rhetoric we hear on the daily news?

Now imagine that Mr. Sherif had added a wrinkle to his experiment. Suppose that one of the boys had been required to switch teams every day. It seems likely that this boy would have developed friendships in both groups and, at the same time, would have been viewed by both with suspicion. He probably would have said: “Hey, guys, the other team really isn’t so bad. They’re a lot like us.” But his words would most likely have been ignored.

That is how I feel every day. While among Republicans, I want to say President Obama’s goal of universal health insurance has a noble motivation, and it is impossible to achieve without a significant expansion in the role of government. While among Democrats, I want to say President Obama has vastly oversold the Affordable Care Act. The law is unlikely to reduce the cost of health care as promised, will shrink the economy by increasing implicit marginal tax rates and will, by virtue of its scope and complexity, lead to numerous other unintended consequences.

Mr. Sherif did not try my hypothetical wrinkle to his experiment, but he did manage to return some harmony to the Eagles and the Rattlers. After the period of zero-sum competition was over, the boys faced a series of “superordinate” goals that transcended group concerns. For example, the boys had to deal with an interruption in their water supply, a problem that could be solved only if the two groups worked cooperatively. After several joint activities, the animosity lessened. When the camp was over, the boys agreed to return home on a single bus, and they happily socialized with members of the other group."

“President Obama had another tough week in a second term filled with bad news and blunders — and he’s only 10 weeks in,” Curl wrote. “While the White House suddenly decided to drop its budget Friday in an effort to control the news, there was no covering up the disastrous jobless numbers: 90 million Americans out of the workforce, the highest level since 1979; another 663,000 joining the ranks of the long-term unemployed; a measly 88,000 jobs ‘created.'”

Curl points out though that, while those economic numbers are catastrophic for this administration, “what seems stuck in the craw of a lot of you readers out there” was his column from the week before “on the Obamas’ 1 percent lifestyle — the endless ski and beach vacations for the couple and their daughters, Vice President Joseph R. Biden’s nights in London and Paris that cost you more than $1 million, even the president’s 118th round of golf while in office.”

Most mainstream media outlets completely ignored the report, first broken by Breitbart News, that first daughters Sasha and Malia were vacationing in the Bahamas at the luxurious Atlantis resort for Spring Break. The story starkly exemplified that President Obama decided Secret Service should be used for that vacation and not for ordinary kids’ tours of the White House. To top matters off, for what Curl calls the Obama family’s “royal lifestyle,” Sasha and Malia sprung from the Bahamas to ritzy Sun Valley, Idaho mid-Spring Break week to get in some skiing before heading back to school.

Curl quoted many of his readers, who wrote to him expressing outrage at the way the first family handles themselves–and taxpayer resources–while most other Americans continue hurting economically.

Curl said, too, that Obama’s decision this past week “to forgo 5 percent of his salary” is not any “coincidence.”"

Just a giant stage on which a play of deception is played on the American people to believe we still live in a Democracy.

What it really is, is a game of Masters and Serfs.

Those ""conspiracy theorists"" don't sound so crazy anymore to me. Maybe their name is not ""Illuminati"", but it seems ""they"" are really there. In secret board rooms and meeting rooms, conjuring the strategems on how best to extract subservience and resources from the massses.

They get us all crazy about abortion, gay rights, prayer in schools, ACORN, Planned Parenthood, Britney Spears' couchie peeks, Beyonce's side-boobs while they steal, hoard, subvert and leech the lifeblood from the ideals this country was founded on-- a land by the people, for the people. They hit the hot buttons in all of us, liberals and tea baggers alike so we can waste our precious passions and energies in angry food fights about who's moralities are better than whom.

While they surely and clearly turn us all into sheeple...chewing on our artificially manufactured feed, inside our fenced world of corporate retail Disney worlds where they milk us and slaughter us to feed their insatiable greed for more.

This country is so sick, run by psychopaths who worship the holy god of wealth. They run or academic centers, our government, our churches, our media.

And Obama, after promising straight-talk and a man-for-the-people assurances if he could just get our cash and votes, now turns out to be just another puppet. Unable to change what is really diseased about our institutions. So it's only two possibilities: he's an impotent president, or one who is complicit in the game.

You know I seem to remember a recent village idiot president who got everything he wanted, when he wanted it regardless which party had what majority. If his decisions made some corporate entity shitwads of money, it got done.

And Obama? Those same entities making even bigger shitwads of cash than even Village idiot.

Follow the money, that's the answer to every question you have about politics and the US government.

Unlike better-known programs in which law students take on longer-term pro bono work that focuses on single cases, students at UCLA and Southwestern law schools will write amicus briefs, often known as “friend of the court” documents.

“I have not heard of law schools doing anything quite like this,” said Eugene Volokh, a UCLA law professor who will head the university’s First Amendment Amicus Brief Clinic this fall.

Law schools nationwide have come under fire for graduating too many students who are saddled with debt and unable to find jobs. Michael Epstein, the Southwestern law professor heading the program, said it could make participants more marketable.

“Lots of students do moot court, but this isn’t moot,” he said. “This is the real world.”

Volokh agreed, saying students would get valuable experience.

“For quite a while, law schools have been thinking about how they can teach their students other skills,” Volokh said.

Amicus briefs are filed on behalf of one side of a lawsuit by a third party. They are intended to educate the court about an aspect of the law that might not be well known or to raise awareness about an issue in the case. Judges, often those in appeals courts, consider the documents as they make their decisions.

The students will research and write the papers, but attorneys will sign them and students will be acknowledged in the text.

Students at both schools will receive academic credit. Southwestern’s participants will receive letter grades and UCLA students will get pass or fail marks.

Professors at both schools have begun looking for potential students and cases. UCLA students will focus on 1st Amendment work, and the Southwestern project will consider other parts of the law.

“The ideal case is one that will serve the public interest,” Epstein said.

Volokh said he believes writing amicus briefs will fit better into an academic schedule because the papers have deadlines and are often narrowly focused, making it easier to fit them into one semester.

When Epstein was in law school, he spent one summer interning at the Media Access Project in Washington, D.C., and wrote an amicus brief for a telecommunications case that went before the U.S. Supreme Court.

Epstein wrote most of the nearly 60-page document under the supervision of an attorney and received only a one-line credit. Still, he said, the experience was invaluable.

“It helped me professionally in an intangible way. It showed I had what it took to tackle an issue and to advocate an issue that needed to be addressed,” Epstein said.

Students in both programs will work closely with professors or working attorneys. “It’s going to be a one-on-one experience that should be very intense,” Epstein said.

Volokh said he was looking for about nine students and Epstein had even fewer spots.

“This isn’t for the average student,” Epstein said. “The criteria is not only academic excellence and first-rate writing skills. I’m also looking for demonstrable commitment to public interest.”

One of the best known pro bono programs, the Innocence Project, is affiliated with the Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University in New York, and students there work on criminal cases. Many other law schools have courses or clinics in which students research and sometimes even argue cases.

Obama will make the announcement at 12:10 p.m. in the East Room. McDonough, who is currently Obama's deputy national security adviser, will replace Jack Lew, who the president has tapped to be his Treasury secretary.

In a statement, the official described McDonough as one of Obama's ""closest and most trusted advisors for nearly a decade, dating back to when he helped set up then Senator Barack Obama’s Senator office."" The official also praised McDonough's role on Obama's national security team, and his experience in working with Congress:

Denis has played a key role in all of the major national security decisions--from ending the war in Iraq to winding down the war in Afghanistan; from our response to natural disasters in Haiti and Japan; to the repeal of ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.' As a veteran of Capitol Hill, Denis understands the importance of reaching across the aisle to make progress for the American people--whether it’s on jobs and economy, health care or education, reducing the deficit or addressing climate change.



Later Friday, the White House will also announce nine aides taking new positions at senior levels at the White House. Here is a breakdown of their new roles:

Rob Nabors - Assistant to the president and deputy white house chief of staff for policy

Dan Pfeiffer – Assistant to the president and senior adviser

Jennifer Palmieri – Assistant to the president and communications director

Tony Blinken – Assistant to the president and deputy national security adviser

Danielle Gray – Assistant to the president and cabinet secretary

Katy Kale – Assistant to the president for management and administration

Lisa Monaco – Assistant to the president and deputy national security adviser for homeland security and counterterrorism (upon confirmation of John Brennan as DCIA)

Miguel Rodriguez – Assistant to the president and director of legislative affairs

David Simas – Assistant to the president and deputy senior adviser for communications and strategy"

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Pete Sessions (R-Texas) who allegedly told President Obama he could not bear to look at him at a meeting earlier this month.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) let his Democratic caucus know last week in a private meeting that a top House Republican told President Barack Obama, ""I cannot even stand to look at you,"" according to two Democratic senators who were present, and confirmed by two Senate Democratic aides who said they independently learned of the exchange from two other senators.

One of the two Democratic senators who spoke to HuffPost said that Reid told the caucus about the incident last Tuesday and named Sessions. He also told the caucus that he was ""sorry"" to have to tell them about it, per this senator, but gave Obama credit for his ""dignified"" response to Sessions. Reid reportedly told the caucus that Obama responded to Sessions by saying he understood they disagreed on many issues and he respected their differences.

More:Sessions' office is denying the charge and the WH is attributing the kerfuffle to a ""miscommunication"" made during the reading back of the meeting's transcript.

UPDATE 2: Hmmmm...now Chad Pergram of FOX is tweeting that he contacted Durbin's office and the Senator is sticking with his story:

Durbin's office says the sen stands by his comments that Hse ldrshp R said they can't stand to look at Obama, even after Carney debunked it

But two Democratic aides, both of whom requested anonymity, told The Huffington Post that the incident was relayed to members during a Senate Democratic Caucus meeting shortly after it allegedly happened. And Durbin isn’t backing down from the claims he originally made on his Facebook page on Sunday. “Sen. Durbin stands by his comments,” Durbin spokesman Max Gleischman told The Huffington Post.

TPM has it, too (h/t eztempo) as does Huffington Post, which included this tidbit in an article earlier this evening:Thanks for the find, PorridgeGun. The fact that Durbin discussed the incident with others just after it happened seems to indicate the story is legit.

IMPORTANT UPDATE: Thanks to hulibow and Paleo for pointing out WH spokesman Jay Carney denied Durbin's account at today's briefing. Here is the text:



QUESTION: Just to follow up on that. In terms of the president talking to Republicans, can you rule out -- there was the number two Senate Democrat, Dick Durbin, said on his Facebook page that someone in recent exchange with the president said he can't even stand, this member of Congress, that he can't even stand to look at the president. Can you say whether that happened? JAY CARNEY: I will say this, I spoke with somebody who was in that meeting and it did not happen. QUESTION: Did the White House speak to Senator Durbin about this? CARNEY: I don't know. My understanding is that, again, from participants in the meeting that that didn't happen. QUESTION: Did anything like it happen that would -- CARNEY: Not that I'm aware of, Jackie.

This is just a quick diary to call attention to a story published tonight on The Hill 's blog site.

To put it short, this story, if true, turns my stomach, and says a lot about why Obama needs to continue to stand strong against House Republicans and FOR Democratic priorities. And why we all need to stand with him.

http://news.yahoo.com/filibuster-reaction-harry-reid-nuclear-hypocrisy-184412234.html,,[],Filibuster Reaction: Harry Reid’s nuclear hypocrisy,"Editor’s note: This piece from Roger Pilon first appeared on the National Review Online website just before the Senate’s historic filibuster vote, and it appears with the CATO Institute’s permission.

Harry Reid is set to “go nuclear.” He wants to end the filibuster as it applies to appellate court nominations — not by a two-thirds vote of the Senate, as Senate rules require, but by a simple majority. And given the short memories now in evidence, he may just succeed.

On Monday, for the third time in less than a month, Senate Republicans filibustered an Obama nominee to the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. That’s the court that’s checked the president more than once, as when it said he couldn’t make “recess appointments” when the Senate wasn’t in recess. So in a Tuesday closed-door lunch, Reid moved closer to ending the practice, and it’s reported he picked up crucial support from California Democratic senators Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer along with Judiciary Committee chairman Patrick Leahy among others.

The hypocrisy here should not go unnoticed. Although the filibuster for legislation has a long history, prior to 2003 it was seldom used to block executive-branch nominations — and appellate-court nominees in particular. In fact, Democrats themselves began using it this way in the 108th Congress, after they lost the Senate in the 2002 midterm elections. Here’s the backstory.

Start with Bush v. Gore, the Supreme Court’s December 2000 decision that effectively decided the presidential outcome, creating a firestorm among Democrats, especially among the legal professoriate. On January 13, 2001, for example, 554 professors from 120 law schools took out a full-page ad in the New York Times condemning the Court’s majority for having acted not as judges but as “political proponents for candidate Bush.” And at a Democratic retreat a month later Yale’s Bruce Ackerman urged members not to confirm a single Bush nominee for the Supreme Court until after the 2004 elections.

Story continues

Democrats got their break in May when Vermont senator James Jeffords left the Republican party. That switched control of the Senate to the Democrats, who immediately turned their attention to the eleven appellate court nominees then before the Senate Judiciary Committee, two of them Democrats — a gesture from Bush. Those two were immediately confirmed. The rest would not even get hearings. Instead, Democrats began calling for “litmus tests” — explicit demands that nominees state their views on everything from abortion to affirmative action to Congress’s unquestioned power to regulate anything and everything.

But the near lock-down on appellate-court nominations did not end with the 2002 midterm elections, which switched control of the Senate back to the Republicans. It was then that Senate Democrats began the unprecedented filibustering of appellate-court nominations. The most egregious case was that of Miguel Estrada, whose life story was pure American dream. First nominated by President Bush in May 2001, Estrada finally withdrew his name from further consideration some 27 months later, after seven failed cloture votes in the next, 108th Congress.

Things came to a head early in the 109th Congress when Republicans themselves, still in control of the Senate, threatened finally to “go nuclear” — to end the appellate-court filibusters Democrats had introduced only in the previous Congress. That was headed off when the bipartisan “Gang of 14” reached a compromise: Democrats would filibuster nominees only in “extraordinary circumstances,” they agreed, and Republicans would not use the nuclear option. That compromise held for the rest of the 109th Congress — though not without difficulties — but it became moot after Democrats regained control of the Senate following the 2006 midterm elections since they no longer needed to filibuster Bush nominees.

In sum, after the 2000 election was decided, Senate Democrats sat on their hands for two years as Bush appellate-court nominees twisted in the wind. In the minority after the 2002 elections, those Democrats then initiated the filibuster for many of Bush’s nominees. Only after the 2005 Gang of 14 compromise was imposed did things settle down. And after the 2006 elections, Democrats no longer needed to filibuster.

So is the Republican use of the filibuster today simply fair turn-around — with Democrats in no position to complain when Republicans use tactics they themselves introduced? If so, that would be enough to illustrate the hypocrisy of today’s Democratic protests. But that’s not what’s at issue here. In the D.C. Circuit matter, which has driven Senator Reid to the nuclear option, Republicans are not raising ideological objections to Obama’s nominees — as Democrats did when they filibustered Bush’s picks. Their objection, rather, is that these judges are not needed, because the workload of the court is so light. In fact, speaking of hypocrisy, Democrats, in the minority in the 109th Congress, used that very rationale to urge Judiciary Committee chairman Arlen Specter in a July 2006 letter not to confirm any additional Bush nominees to the D.C. Circuit — and none was confirmed after that letter from Senators Leahy, Feinstein, Schumer, and Durbin was sent, all of whom are still on the committee. Yet now, when the court’s workload is even lighter, Democrats cry foul when Republicans point that out.

In fact, look at the numbers from the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. In 2006, written decisions per active judge had declined by 17 percent since 1997. Since 2006 they have declined another 27 percent. In 2006, the total number of appeals filed had declined by 10 percent since 1997. Since 2006 they have declined another 18 percent. The Administrative Office ranks the twelve circuits using various caseload benchmarks: 2013 is the 17th straight year that the office has ranked the D.C. Circuit last on both appeals being filed and appeals being terminated. There simply is no need for more judges on the D.C. Circuit when those there now do not have enough to do — unless, of course, the aim is to have a bench more sympathetic to rule by presidential diktat, which may be precisely why Senator Reid wants to go nuclear.

Police Academy Director Appalled And Embarrassed At Video

SCRANTON – Former Scranton Police Chief Dan Duffy says a video gone viral online shows exactly what not to do as a police officer. ----- “This is exactly what a law enforcement officer should not be doing out there publicly, especially identifying himself as a law enforcement officer. It`s an embarrassment to us,” said Duffy.

He can call for an armed march but he'd be down beating skulls and pepperspraying kids if any sort of peaceful protest occurred.

As I have been saying since before Obama's re-election these fuckwits are gearing up for a spasm of violence fueled in part by paranoid delusions, the ongoing unfettered racism promoted by right wing media and Republican/Teabagger politicians.

Florida has the SYG (shoot your gun) law, encouraging aggressive and predatory conduct by persons with such personality defects, here we have a friggin Chief of Police going fully unhinged, Rush Limbaugh with a badge and a gun. Collecting a paycheck derived from taxpayer money.

So it wasn’t a hoax after all?

Organizers of the “Truckers Ride for the Constitution” rally say they are indeed coming to Washington on Friday — but whether they will shut down the Beltway or just make a lot of noise remains to be seen.

Zeeda Andrews, one of the organizers of the event, said the ride is a go but emphasized that it will be peaceful. She said that Georgia trucker Earl Conlon “overstepped his boundaries” earlier this week in saying the event was just a ploy to get attention for the group’s agenda.

“Yes, it is happening,” she said about the rally. Andrews said she expects “a few thousand truckers” to descend on the District on Friday.



State police officials in the region said they will be prepared either way.

“Virginia State Police is aware of the proposed convoy of commercial vehicles and is preparing accordingly with the region’s law enforcement agencies and the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT), just as we have done in the past for similar demonstrations held within the National Capital Region,’’ said spokeswoman Corinne N. Geller in an e-mail statement.

Geller said additional troopers will be deployed Friday and through the weekend in case any incidents or problems tied to the rally occur. But as long as no one breaks the law, the truckers will be allowed to proceed with their activities — just as other groups have in the past. She said the additional staffing is to ensure that traffic continues to move safely through the region.

Sgt. Marc Black of the Maryland State Police said that the agency does not plan to add additional patrols, but that authorities will be watching the highways to ensure no traffic issues occur. Pennsylvania State Police will be doing the same, a spokesman said.

Andrews said truckers plan to meet in two spots Friday morning before convoying into Washington: at Exit 98 off Interstate 95 in Doswell, which is north of Richmond, and at Exit 77 off Interstate 81 in Pennsylvania. Beginning about rush hour, truckers will take shifts in circling the Beltway, driving at the speed limit — an action that might end up jamming the roadway, she said.

“It’s a minor inconvenience, but things could be a lot worse,” Andrews said.

Truckers and their supporters have been asked to post #T2SDA (Truckers to Shut Down America) on their vehicles to indicate their support. Even as the rally has picked up support with more than 136,000 Facebook likes and counting, industry groups have stepped forward to disavow the group’s action

The Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association, which represents small-business trucking professionals, said it does not support the group.

“The individuals leading this particular effort have no direct affiliation with trucking and appear to be using truckers in order to gain media attention and air other political grievances,” said Norita Taylor, who heads communications for the 150,000-member­ group, in a prepared statement. “We do not support assembling in an unlawful, unpermitted manner, committing crimes, making threats on our lawmakers, or behaving in such a way to cast safe, professional truck drivers in a negative light.”

Officials with the American Trucking Associations said their organization “is not a sponsor of this ‘strike’ nor do we endorse or condone the activities of these few individuals.”

The protest group’s agenda has evolved since the story began making the rounds of news outlets across the country early this week with a story in U.S. News & World Report, which said the truckers wanted members of Congress to be arrested while others called for the ouster of President Obama.

Andrews said the group still wants to get rid of Obama, but will do so by legal means. She said independent truckers also are upset about new regulations, including on idling and hours of service, that threaten to put them out of business."

USATODAY

Obama revels in his role as head of state%2C but it increasingly seems the only aspect of his job he relishes.

Rather than negotiating key aspects of his health care law%2C he outsourced that task to Nancy Pelosi.

Obama needs someone else to coordinate practical responses to mounting challenges.

During the early stages of the Obama administration, some of the president's harshest critics denounced him as a power-hungry autocrat: ""King Barack I."" Today, America's commander in chief resembles a very different sort of royalty: the elegant but irrelevant figurehead typical of modern constitutional monarchies.

Queen Elizabeth II enjoys considerable popularity as a symbol of the nation, but she exercises scant power over the direction of public affairs. She is merely head of state; it is Prime Minister David Cameron who runs the country as head of government. Many other nations, even those without traditional royal households, similarly divide the nation's two most significant roles between an above-the-fray head of state and an in-the-thick-of-things head of government. From Germany to Israel to Canada, a non-political eminence presides over patriotic occasions and draws bipartisan affection while tough political brawlers run the government.

Two leaders in one

In the United States, our Constitution fully merges the two functions. The most successful presidents, beginning with George Washington himself, excelled at both roles. Franklin Roosevelt completed three terms as an inspiring head of state with resonant voice and noble profile, while simultaneously dominating the scene as a wily party leader and head of government. FDR's protégé Lyndon Johnson certainly lived up to his hero's standards as a hands-on political operator, but as head of state LBJ struck many Americans as crass, a failing that helped doom his chances for another term in 1968.

In many ways, Barack Obama represents Johnson's polar opposite — cool rather than corny, glamorous rather than gauche, aloof rather than earthy. It's impossible to imagine Obama startling reporters as Johnson once did by lifting his shirt after surgery to expose the scar on his belly. But Obama is also unlikely to employ the famous ""Johnson treatment"" to force recalcitrant congressmen into line. LBJ reveled in twisting arms and cutting deals; Obama so much loathes that process, he seems to regard get-togethers with Capitol Hill leadership as onerous chores.

The current incumbent revels in his role as head of state, but it increasingly seems the only aspect of his job he relishes. Obama escapes Washington at every opportunity for worshipful crowds in campaign-style events and shines at big ceremonial occasions, but then mumbles and bumbles his way through news conferences with ill-disguised contempt for reporters' questions. His Tuesday speech in Tennessee on jobs is a perfect example of putting the grand gesture over the gritty details.

Big speeches over details

Rather than immersing himself in the grubby business of negotiating key aspects of his health care law, he outsourced that task to House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. On controversies regarding Benghazi, the IRS and Justice Department snooping, administration responses suggest that the disengaged president had no role in detailed implementation of his own policies.

Such reactions suggest the response of a reigning monarch far more than an embattled prime minister. When Cabinet ministers run into trouble in London, no one thinks to blame Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, even though those ministers may govern in her name. Applying the same logic to this president, why fault his Serene Highness, King Barack, when senior administration officials look inept and dishonest?

In the months remaining to his reign, the chief executive might rescue his presidency by continuing to emphasize the aspects of his job he performs well and foisting on someone else governmental responsibilities for which he has shown neither appetite nor aptitude.

The president, in other words, needs a prime minister.

In 1861, Secretary of State William Henry Seward offered to play that role for his less experienced boss, Abraham Lincoln, but Honest Abe quickly displayed his peerless ability to manage governmental details on his own.

Obama possesses no comparable skills and therefore needs someone else to coordinate practical responses to mounting challenges. During his first term, he employed chiefs of staff (Rahm Emanuel and Bill Daley) with Washington clout. His new top aide, Denis McDonough, counts as a lightweight who has had little impact.

As Obama jets around the country, disassociating himself from the hot mess of legislative logjam and administrative apocalypse, a powerful, well-publicized replacement as chief of staff might generate the needed ""energy in the executive"" to dissipate the atmosphere of drift and decay.

http://news.yahoo.com/top-talent-lined-obamas-inaugural-events-110217473--politics.html,,[],Top talent lined up for Obama's inaugural events,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama is drawing an A-list of performers for his inaugural festivities, including a massive ball expected to draw more than 35,000 revelers.

Katy Perry, Smokey Robinson, Usher, Alicia Keys and Brad Paisley are among the stars announced Friday to sing at Obama's inaugural balls Jan. 21 and a children's concert on Jan. 19. Also signed up are Marc Anthony, Stevie Wonder, John Legend and the cast of ""Glee.""

The concert and the two official inaugural balls are being held at the Washington Convention Center over the Martin Luther King holiday weekend when Obama begins his second term. The performers join Beyonce, Kelly Clarkson and James Taylor, already announced for Obama's signing ceremony Jan. 21 on the West Front of the Capitol.

Other event performers include pop-rap foursome Far East Movement, Grammy-nominated pop-rock trio fun., R&B boy band Mindless Behavior, rapper Nick Cannon and youth gospel choir Soul Children of Chicago. Inaugural organizers aren't saying yet which performances will be at which convention center event.

Robinson told The Associated Press he'll be at The Inaugural Ball with his own band, but he isn't sure yet which songs he'll sing. Robinson said he's always happy to perform when the president asks because he's so proud of the first family.

""I've been in the White House many, many, many times for many presidents and this is the first time for me that it's really felt like when I go to the White House or something like that, it feels like you're going to your family's,"" Robinson said. ""It feels like you're going home because that's how they treat me and that's how they treat my wife.""

While Obama has cut the number of inaugural balls lower than any president since Dwight Eisenhower was first sworn into office in 1953, the two celebrations will be elaborate. The larger of the events, simply called The Inaugural Ball, is expected to draw more than 35,000 in a reflection of the quadrennial demand in Washington to toast the president in person on such a historic day.

Story continues

The Inaugural Ball is being held across all 700,000 square feet of the Washington Convention Center's five exhibit halls, which four years ago held six separate balls.

The second gala is the Commander In Chief's Ball, a tradition started by President George W. Bush to honor the military. Doubling in size from four years ago to about 4,000, it's being held on the third-floor ballroom of the convention hall a mile from the White House. Tickets are free for invitees, including active-duty and reserve troops, Medal of Honor recipients and wounded warriors.

Demand has been high for entry to the two official affairs. Inaugural planners offered a limited number of tickets to The Inaugural Ball for sale at $60, and they sold out quickly Sunday night when Ticketmaster accidentally sent out an email ahead of time announcing they were available. Inaugural organizers are trying to stop a swift scalping business for the tickets, which have been cropping up for sale online.

That's even though city officials are predicting a drop in attendance to 600,000 to 800,000 for the inauguration this year compared with 2009, when a record 1.8 million crowded onto the National Mall to see the first black president sworn into office.

Those who can't get into the convention hall with the Obamas can still carouse into the night at several unofficial balls across Washington, including some drawing their own celebrity entertainment. Charity group Musicians On Call, when sends performers to play bedside for hospitalized patients, is being headlined by chart-topping singer Ke$ha.

Those who work for Obama will get their own chance to celebrate with the president, with a staff ball planned for the day after the inauguration. That celebration is kept private, but last year was reportedly quite a bash, according to one attendee, with rap star Jay-Z singing a riff on one of his hit songs, ""99 problems but George Bush ain't one,"" to the delight of the throngs of young staffers who worked so hard to turn the White House Democratic.

More tickets to The Inaugural Ball will be on sale, but not to the general public. They will go to campaign volunteers, community leaders, elected officials and other invitees, as well as donors being asked to contribute up to $250,000 individually or $1 million from corporations to pay for the festivities. Invitees will be sent an email in the next few days with personalized Ticketmaster account information they can use to purchase up to two tickets.

The Inaugural Ball's halls extend across two floors, so the president and first lady plan to spin on the dance floor of each level. At the Commander In Chief's Ball, the president and first lady plan to continue the tradition of dancing with members of the military.

Inaugural planners said the cut in the number of balls was to reflect tough economic times and minimize the burden on law enforcement, other security personnel and Washington residents. But could it also be an effort to give the president some relief from having to dance to the same song over and over again all across town on an already exhausting day?

President George W. Bush didn't hide his annoyance after his second inaugural at having to repeatedly sashay around to a musical medley that included ""I Could Have Danced All Night."" Could have, but did not: He and first lady Laura Bush danced for a cumulative total of just 8 minutes, 54 seconds across 10 galas.

On Apr. 28, Breitbart News broke the story of Pentagon brass meeting with anti-Christian activist Mikey Weinstein to discuss religious-liberty policies. Quoting Weinstein in his own printed words, this activist has a record of calling observant Christians “fundamentalist monsters” who seek impose “theocratic terror” on America, and that evangelizing (sharing the gospel of Jesus Christ) in the military is an act of “sedition and treason” against this country, making those who do it “enemies of the Constitution.” He says those who do so should be court-martialed (criminally prosecuted).

As this story developed, the Obama-Hagel Pentagon defended its policy, and changed its story several times, as it was revealed that these meetings with Weinstein had been going on for years. In the following months there were additional incidents, such as removing Christian patriotic artwork at a military base, censoring a Christian chaplain, and a Christian service member reportedly being relieved of duty by his lesbian commander because he refused her order to say that it is wrong not to support gay marriage.

Now leaders from Restore Military Religious Freedom–a coalition to protect service members of faith–met with Pentagon officials. Lt. Gen. Jerry Boykin (ret.) of the Family Research Council, Col. Ron Crews (ret.) of the Chaplains Alliance for Religious Liberty, Kellie Fiedorek of the Alliance Defending Freedom, and nationally-known Christian talk radio host Sandy Rios took with them two petitions calling on Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel to protect religious liberty. One was a general petition with 170,000 signatures, and the other–with 50,000 signatures–was sparked by the last incident mentioned above, where Air Force Senior Master Sergeant Phillip Monk was relieved of duty by Maj. Elisa Valenzuela, allegedly because of Monk’s Christian beliefs on marriage. Monk now faces possible court martial.

These Christian leaders met with Lt. Gen. Richard C. Harding, the three-star judge advocate general of the Air Force (the top lawyer in that branch of the military), and Maj. Gen. Howard D. Stendahl, the two-star Air Force chief of chaplains.

Gen. Boykin said after the meeting:

The meeting included a productive discussion on the issue of religious freedom in the military as a whole and not just the U.S. Air Force. After delivering the petitions, we explained our concerns regarding the trend towards infringements on the constitutional liberties of service members in all uniformed services. We appreciate their offer to review decisions that do not reflect Air Force policy made by commanders at various bases. At their request, we will report future events and concerns directly to Air Force leadership. After reviewing a series of troubling incidents involving chaplains, the coalition members were assured in the meeting that chaplains would not be forced to do anything that violates the tenets of their faith. We also requested that the Department of Defense and the Air Force issue a definitive statement regarding the ability of service members to share their faith publicly. Previous statements on the subject have been confusing and contradictory. Additionally, we asked that the Department of Defense move quickly to implement the religious freedom protections enacted in last year’s National Defense Authorization Act. Given new incidents of military personnel facing career reprisals for their religious beliefs, it is vital that regulations preventing discrimination be issued by the Secretary of Defense as demanded by law. We intend to remain in contact with the Air Force to ensure that the law’s implementation is consistent with the intent of Congress.

Congress is working on new statutory language to protect such religious speech in the military, which has passed the House and is pending in the Senate. President Obama threatens to veto this legislation.

What Communists?,"On Wednesday, Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL) joined nearly two thousand trade unionists, open communists, socialists, anarchists and illegal aliens at Chicago’s May Day march and rally.

Two large rally demonstrations that began at Union Park and Chicago’s Haymarket Riot monument converged into a giant march that shut down traffic for miles, and ended at Federal Plaza where they were joined by Senator Durbin.

Durbin made remarks to the red, yellow and black flag waving crowd about “immigration reform.” Opening with “My fellow immigrants,” Durbin told the crowd “this is a once in a lifetime chance” to get “immigration reform.”

Following his speech, I spoke to the senator about his participation:

(May Day is apparently also Law Day in America, but after covering the last three May Day marches in Chicago, I have never heard about Law Day, at any of the marches or elsewhere.)

Durbin then mounted a rather bizarre defense of his participation in the rally–on free speech grounds:

Rebelpundit: There is a large contingent of Communist Party USA, anarchists, international socialist groups here today that you just spoke to… Durbin: How do you know that? Rebelpundit: Because I’ve filmed them all day, and you just spoke to them, so I’d like to ask about your participation, why you decided to come out today? Durbin: Well let me just say something, because [pause] I believe in the Constitution. Do you believe in it? Rebelpundit: Because you believe in the Constitution you decided to come out to a rally full of communists and socialists? Durbin: And you know why? Rebelpundit: Why? Durbin: Because we have freedom of speech in America, and that’s why you can record this and not be arrested. RebelPundit: You think I should be arrested? Durbin: No, not at all, you have a right to your constitutional rights, and I do, too.

Of course, Durbin could go to a Nazi or KKK rally, too–but does that mean, as a United States Senator, he should?

President Obama discusses faith at National Prayer Breakfast

Obama says he hopes the prayers carry over from the event itself

Obama%3A %22Faith is not a possession%3B faith is a process.%22

President Obama told lawmakers Thursday he hopes the spiritual lessons of the National Prayer Breakfast carry over from the event -- something that hasn't really happened in years past, he confessed.

""You'd like to think that the shelf life wasn't so short,"" Obama joked.

After previous prayer breakfasts, he said, ""I go back to the Oval Office and I start watching the cable news networks -- and it's like we didn't pray!""

Making his fifth straight appearance at the annual National Prayer Breakfast in Washington, Obama told the bipartisan gathering that grappling with the nation's problems -- and with politicians of different parties -- requires a constant renewal of faith.

""Faith is not a possession,"" Obama said. ""Faith is a process.""

Referring to last month's inaugural ceremony, Obama noted that he took the oath of office with Bibles owned by two icons who relied on faith to face immense personal and national challenges: Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther King, Jr.

As the civil rights movement faced violent resistance in the 1950s and 1960s, Obama said, ""we know that in Scripture, Dr. King found strength.""

Lincoln also found ""solace in Scripture"" during the Civil War of the 1860s, Obama said, and ""that allowed him to become a better leader.""

""Today, the divisions in this country are, thankfully, not as deep or destructive as when Lincoln led, but they are real,"" Obama said. ""The differences in how we hope to move our nation forward are less pronounced than when King marched, but they do exist.""

Meeting them demands both faith and humility, Obama said, adding: ""Let me suggest that those of us with the most power and influence need to be the most humble.""

Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, prayer breakfast co-chair and a Republican who has clashed with Obama on many issues, concluded the event by saying ""we are one nation"" with one president.

""Thank you for being my president,"" Sessions said. ""Thank you for being our president."""
http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jan/02/nation/la-na-immigration-families-20130103,2013-01-02 00:00:00,"['Brian Bennett Previously Covered The White House', 'National Security', 'Immigration In The Los Angeles Times Washington Bureau', 'Where He Worked']",New rule makes residency easier for immigrants with U.S. kin,"WASHINGTON — Illegal immigrants who are immediate relatives of American citizens will have an easier path to permanent residency under a new Obama administration rule that could affect as many as 1 million of the estimated 11 million people unlawfully in the United States.

The rule issued Wednesday by the Department of Homeland Security aims to reduce the time illegal immigrants are separated from their U.S. families while seeking legal status, officials said.

Beginning March 4, illegal immigrants who can demonstrate that time apart from an American spouse, child or parent would create “extreme hardship” can apply for a visa without leaving the United States. Once approved, applicants would be required to leave briefly in order to return to their native country and pick up their visa.

Sources said that the administration might expand the changes to include relatives of lawful permanent residents.

The change, first proposed in April, is the latest move by the administration to use executive powers to revise immigration procedures without Congress passing a law. In August, the Obama administration began a program to halt the deportation of young people brought to the U.S. unlawfully as children.

“This is a continuation of usurping Congress’ control over immigration,” said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank in Washington that supports tighter controls on immigration. “This waiver rule is a small piece of this broader effort to go around Congress.”

The new procedures could reduce a family’s time apart to one week in some cases, officials said. In recent years, a few relatives of U.S. citizens have been killed in violence in foreign countries while waiting for their applications to be resolved, a process that could take a year or longer.

“It’s going to be a better future for me,” said Analy Olivas, 21, of Claremont, who crossed the border illegally from Mexico with her family when she was 8 and eventually married a U.S. citizen. She didn’t think she could bear to be separated from her 4-year-old son, Naythan, for an extended period, adding: “If I kept on going through the process, I was going to have to leave the country. I wasn’t ready for it.”

“The change will have a significant impact on American families by greatly reducing the time family members are separated from those they rely upon,” said Alejandro Mayorkas, director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Wait times will be “drastically reduced,” Mayorkas said.

The immigration agency does not provide applicants with a specific definition of “extreme hardship,” despite requests from legal aid organizations to clarify the phrase. The agency “looks at the totality of the applicant’s circumstances and any supporting evidence,” according to the final rule posted in the Federal Register on Wednesday.

Immigration officials said they had no plans to add staff to process what could be a large number of new hardship-waiver applications. The agency received 24,780 such applications between September 2011 and October 2012.

Until now, officials said, many immigrants who might have sought legal status have not pursued a hardship waiver of strict U.S. immigration laws out of fear they would be rejected and stuck outside the country.

Someone who has overstayed a visa for more than six months is barred from reentering the U.S. for three years; those who overstay more than a year are barred for 10 years.

Many Mexicans applying for a visa must report to the U.S. Consulate in Ciudad Juarez, one of Mexico’s most violent cities. Fearful applicants often spend weeks in hiding while waiting for appointments with consular officials. U.S.-born spouses also must travel to Juarez for interviews to determine whether marriages are valid.

The wait proved too long for Luis Luna, who was born in Mexico but crossed illegally into Southern California last year. He married his U.S.-born high school sweetheart, but became desperate as weeks in Juarez turned to months. He was bullied by thugs, harassed by cops and witnessed several fatal shootings.

“The days were so long,” said Luna, who rented a $70-per-month room for several months while waiting for his visa to be processed. Luna, penniless and fearful, finally tried to reenter the U.S. by falsely claiming American citizenship with a Washington state driver’s license. His application was eventually rejected. He is now back in California.

The possibility of having to leave the country for Juarez long kept Andrea from applying for U.S. residency, even though she is married to an American citizen and her 4-year-old daughter is also a citizen. The 30-year-old, who lives in Orange, asked not to be further identified because she is in the country illegally.

“I’d rather have a wife without papers than a dead wife,” Andrea said her husband often told her.

Those whose hardship waiver applications were denied in the past will be eligible to apply again under the new rule, officials said. Family members who have been in deportation proceedings that were suspended will also qualify. But someone who has been deported before, or is facing a final deportation order, is not eligible.

Los Angeles immigration attorney Carl Shusterman hailed the end of what he called a “totally crazy system.”

“It’s going to keep families together who otherwise would have to go out of the country and sometimes wait over a year, separated,” Shusterman said.

Jessica Dominguez, an immigration attorney whose clients are mostly from Mexico and Central America, said Latinos in Southern California were celebrating the change.

“This is going to affect thousands of families,” Dominguez said.

He doesn't live in Jersey ? As a stupid secretary of the state recently said , "" What difference does it make "" ?.

anything that would ""Complicate"" Christies re-election chances can't be risked by the Governor Fat Slob.........................It would be far too ""risky"" to grow a pair and appoint a Republican. After all, Christie is only about himself. Christie is staying Loyal to his butt buddy Obama, by not helping the GOP in any way. (Just like he did last October, when he helped Obama win.)

By not appointed a republican to the Senate which would term to August Christie has just confirmed that he is a full blown RINO. The Senate would have a two count swing for Republicans with this appointment but Christie chose to show his true colots.......................RINO. He should now be banned from all Republican events. He is a Democrat for all practical purposes!

This political stuff is easy. Christie's toughest choice comes at the doughnut shop. Unable to choose between a dozen chocolate eclairs, a dozen bear claws, and a dozen maple bars, he wisely opted for a dozen of each. And that was just for breakfast. And if anyone mentions the brown stuff on his nose, he can lie, and blame it on the eclairs.

Note to GOP and the despicable Karl Rove - Don't even consider nominating Christie OR Jeb Bush for president, because I guarantee you either one will lose.

Christie is a joke with all of his bullying and caustic remarks, etc. -- used to like him a lot -- now he looks just like another dem -- the dems ALWAYS take advantage of opportunities -- Obama must have hugged him extra hard when they did their love-in. I was suspicious and very disappointed with Christie at the RNC convention -- now, I know he is not to be trusted. Let NJ have him -- that's where he should stay.

Is anyone not clear on the concept that Christie is most definitely NOT a conservative? He can label himself as being affiliated with whatever party he'd like, but his actions are what important to observe. Christie is, as demonstrated by his actions, a Big Government Prog. If you like Christie and you want him to represent your interests from a place in public office, then YOU TOO are a prog.

Looks to me like the fat boy took the cowards way out. almost looks like his buddy , bambi, when says ""i see nothing"". Make a decesion porker stop hiding

He is terrified to do anything that might damage his run for the presidency. In his fat clogged mind, being a RINO who sucks obozo's a$$ is an admirable trait.

And you can be sure that RINO Christi, who is receiving huge campaign donations from DUMBOCRATS, will campaign for the dumbocrat candidate. If the people of NJ elect this Dumbama butt-kisser again, they are NUTS.

This LARD ASS, is NO Republican.....................I hope he loses the election for Governor........and the morbidly obese SHILL will NEVER be President ! He's only interested in his own election, spending 24 MILLION to get HIS FAT ASS re-elected. POX on this democRAT in the closet !

I figured it out. Christie is imitating the part played by Jackie Gleason on the Jackie Gleason Show years ago. He tries to play the part of the gruff, self centered, and bossy know it all who runs on bull and a big mouth. Unfortunately for Christie's imitating, Gleason was light years ahead of him. Gleason loved his country, didn't associate with Marxists, and had unlimited talent.

Morbid obesity statistics will catch up with Mr. Tough Talkin' Democrat Mafioso Boss from the Doughnut district of New Jersey

Phat phuck.

Bought and paid for.

This must be the price for his ascension to the national stage in 2016.

He is a stooge of the NY-DC Axis of Multinational Corruption.

Christie has entirely to much FAT IN HIS BRAIN, he will run in 2016 as a Democratic, no doubt in my mind. He is a piece of CRAP!!!

You know what else makes as much sense as nominating Allen West for this seat? Extra spaces. Lots of extra spaces.I agree! It would be so much nicer if Christie had a more complicated reelection bid.What is it with wingnuts and their mega-ellipses? But yeah, I agree! Ban him.Allen West won't lose, though. So nominate him. Please?He was awesome when he was a caustic bully. NO LONGER!!1!I don't like Christie and I don't want him to represent my interests. Can I still be a progressive?Yeah, I don't think Christie's problem is that he's ""hiding"".Using dollar signs makes ""ass"" sound classy.People who write ""DUMBOCRATS"" and ""Dumbama"" are so totallynuts!wish Christie would lose his reelection bid! I'm genuinely heartened by all the bipartisan agreement in this thread!If only it was 1956 all over again, then we wouldn't have to deal with Christie! Or uppity brown people.If he wasn't phat, this would all be okay.Multinational? Which part of the NY-DC Axis isn't America?Kinda like, ""no doubt in my mind Mitt Romney will crush Obummer?"""

Barksdale Maynard', 'July']",Rescuers rush to preserve TV shows shot on fragile videotape,"Walter Cronkite’s news broadcasts are among the videotaped programs that the Library of Congress is digitizing. (CBS PHOTO ARCHIVE/GETTY IMAGES)

At a Library of Congress facility in Culpeper, an effort is underway to convert old videotapes into digital files, ensuring the long-term survival of a host of 1950s-through-1970s TV shows, including the “CBS Evening News” with Walter Cronkite and “Rowan & Martin’s Laugh-In.”

Preserving these shows turns out to be a challenging and time-consuming task. But unless the videotapes are transformed, experts say, future generations will have a diminished appreciation of the era of JFK, flower power and Watergate.

Two-inch-wide quadruplex (or quad) videotape, which was the TV-industry standard from 1956 through the late 1970s, was never meant for long-term storage of sound and images. Developed by Ampex, a company based in California, it allowed network shows to be recorded while being broadcast in New York and then played back later the same evening for West Coast audiences.

Thrifty producers were grateful that videotape could easily be erased, then reused.They were slow to realize that the initial recordings might have value in the distant future.

The videotapes have delicate coatings — essentially “polyurethane paint with magnetic particles inside it,” says Jim Lindner of Media Matters, which specializes in transferring videotaped material to more stable formats. Over time, these coatings absorb moisture, grow sticky and sometimes separate from their backing. With every fleck that peels away, Lindner says, “a bit of recorded history does, too.”

At the Packard Campus of the Library of Congress’s National Audio-Visual Conservation Center, technicians often “bake the tape” in a 130-degree oven for days to resolidify these loose coatings. That is just one of the difficult steps in the tape-to-digital conversion.

Once resolidified, the tapes can be played back only on old video players as part of the conversion process. Doing so entails a risk that they will snap in two as the players’ magnetic heads whir across them at 88 mph. If the head encounters a bump, says Packard video-lab supervisor Paul Klamer, “it hits it like a Mack truck and saws directly through the tape — zing! These are scary to play back.”

Much of our video heritage is already lost to history. “A lot of things happened culturally because of TV, but in many cases we no longer have those tapes,” Lindner says. “What we have now is just what was left over” after routine erasures and discardings.

For example, the Vietnam War played out on nightly network news shows, but “we have very few [tapes of those shows] today,” according to Lindner. Did late-night humorists contribute to changing social mores in the ’60s? Hard to say, since episodes of “The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson” from 1962 to 1970 have almost totally disappeared. “It was only after Carson secured the rights to the show from NBC that he insisted on keeping copies for subsequent clip licensing,” says Mike Mashon, who heads the moving image section at the Packard Campus.

The archives of one major network, which Lindner declined to identify, contain fewer than 3,000 tapes of evening news broadcasts from the heyday of quad videotape; he says that is less than half of the shows that aired.

Because an hour of programming required nearly a mile of quad tape — four times more than today’s tape requires — preserving it is a major undertaking: Every inch must be carefully cleaned and inspected before playback is attempted.

And the tape can be played back only on pre-1980 equipment. “Keeping the equipment running is a big part of the problem,” Klamer says. If a part breaks in the Ampex machines that are required to play the “Laugh-In” tapes, a replacement can be almost impossible to find. Today there are barely 100 working Ampex units in the world, Klamer says, making them rarer than Edsels. Packard owns 27 of the machines (original price $100,000), only two of which are operational.

In fact, a shortage of parts may prove to be the most difficult problem for anyone interested in watch early videotapes. In storerooms heaped with obsolete technology, Packard staff members cannibalize parts from old video players. Only one company that refurbishes magnetic heads remains in business, charging about $5,000 per head.

The Library of Congress is hoping eventually to convert all of its 700,000 tapes to a digital format. Most of its holdings were deposits required by law: Any movie or TV show that is copyrighted must have a copy donated to the library. Once converted, the original tapes are kept for posterity.

Others are also trying to save tapes found in garages and basements, where conditions hasten their decomposition.

Working as a consultant to museums, corporations and other clients, Lindner often encounters discouraging masses of unlabeled tapes. In the 1990s, he came upon a tape belonging to a news company that bore the cryptic label “Resignation/Disneyland.” Was this tape worth spending $400 to convert? He nearly passed it over — but it turned out to be a speech that Ronald Reagan, then the governor of California, gave at Disneyland in 1974, in which he commented on Richard Nixon’s resignation that year as president.

Chris Lewis, a son of the entertainer Jerry Lewis, is working to preserve his father’s extensive quad tape collection, including a 1959 NBC show in which his father starred. Unseen since the Eisenhower era, the tape was “in a very delicate state,” according to David Crosthwait of DC Video, which is handling the digitization.

Chris Lewis calls “The Jazz Singer” — a TV remake of the famous 1927 film that ushered in the “talkie” era — especially rare for having been broadcast in color and for showing Jerry Lewis “in his first dramatic role.”

These efforts notwithstanding, quad tape “is a very endangered species,” says Ken Weissman, supervisor of the film preservation laboratory at Packard. “And things are absolutely going to disappear.”

(CNN) —

The Senate approved legislation on Wednesday that would fund the government through the end of September and avoid a partial federal shutdown, as well as soften the blow of sweeping spending cuts.

The measure, which passed the chamber in a 73-26 vote, now advances to the House.

Leaders of the Senate, run by Democrats, and the Republican-controlled House hope to avoid another saga like the fiscal showdowns that have come to define dysfunction in Congress.

“I hope that this practical, commonsense leadership will be a good sign for … other things in the future,” said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada. “The work done by (the managers of the bill) should be and it is exemplary for what needs to follow.”

Lawmakers want to get the bill, known as a continuing resolution, to President Barack Obama’s desk before leaving Washington for a two-week holiday break starting on Friday.

Failure to enact the measure before March 27 would result in a partial shutdown of federal agencies and other programs.

Justices warn spending cuts put critical legal services at risk

There has been a cavernous political divide between Democrats and Republicans over the role of government spending, taxes and the best way to deal with deficits and debt.

Lawmakers, however, want to find a way to lessen the impact of $85 billion in sweeping, automatic spending cuts that took effect at the beginning of this month after Congress failed to agree on a comprehensive approach for reducing the deficit.

Earlier this month, the House passed its own spending plan that incorporated the cuts – known as sequestration – but provided some leeway for the military and the Veterans administration.

The compromise Senate version, crafted primarily by Maryland Democrat Barbara Mikulski and Alabama Republican Richard Shelby, further reduces the impact of forced austerity by establishing stop-gap budgets for the departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Homeland Security and Justice, as well as NASA.

In its current form, the compromise bill would lock in $984 billion in spending – a notable drop from the $1.043 trillion initially approved before the forced sequestration cuts took effect.

A senior congressional GOP aide told CNN last week the House will probably approve the plan absent significant changes.

The head of the House Appropriations Committee – Kentucky GOP Rep. Harold Rogers – agreed, telling CNN Wednesday that the bill’s “in good shape” and the threat of a government shutdown is “off the table.”

By establishing new budgets for the targeted departments and programs, the bipartisan Senate proposal resets priorities and helps better manage the draconian formula of the spending cuts.

Despite the bill’s bipartisan nature, several senators were unhappy with their inability to offer amendments.

Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kansas, forced an extension of debate after being denied a vote on an amendment to protect rural airport control towers from closure due to the cuts.

“It’s always difficult to attribute motives but as I talk to my colleagues, the only explanation I ever get that has any semblance of truth is there is a point to be made here,” Moran said. “By denying the amendment’s passage, we prove that sequestration can’t work, that we can’t cut money from budgets.”

Obama administration officials have vehemently denied any political motivation to the cuts, arguing that their hands are tied by the across-the-board nature of the sequester.

Some conservative Republicans argue that, despite the cuts, the legislation is still loaded with wasteful spending.

Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, for example, questioned the inclusion of $154 million in Pentagon alternative energy research funding, $120 million for infrastructure improvements in Guam, and $65 million for Pacific coast salmon restoration.

“The bill contains numerous examples of egregious pork barrel projects,” McCain said last week.

McCain told CNN on Tuesday, however, that he would not stand in the way of final passage of the measure.

“I’m ready to vote right away,” he said. “I’ve made my point. I’ve made my speech. I’ve done what I can and I’m ready to move forward.”

John McCain spent the weekend negotiating with Majority Leader Harry Reid on a deal to avert Reid’s threatened use of the “nuclear option” to change Senate rules to eliminate filibusters on Presidential nominations. Through his efforts, McCain was able to secure a complete GOP capitulation on 7 pending nominations. Reid secured all the benefits of exercising the “nuclear option” without the political cost of actually using it.

Under the McCain deal, the GOP will provide enough votes to secure the 60 votes needed for cloture and proceed to final consideration of the 7 nominees. In exchange, Reid agreed to replace two current union attorney nominees with two alternative union attorney nominees. McCain’s swift surrender ensures that the “nuclear option” is a permanent fixture of the nomination process.

GOP objections to many of the pending nominations were not minor. The first nomination to be approved under the McCain deal was Richard Cordray to be the first Director of the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The CFPB was enacted under the Dodd-Frank legislation and holds sweeping powers over all aspects of the financial and credit sector.

When Cordray was first nominated two years ago, McCain and all but 2 GOP Senators signed a letter vowing to block any nomination unless reforms were made to the agency. A major concern was that Congress was specifically prohibited from exercising any oversight over the Agency’s budget. The promise to block that nomination wasn’t prompted by concerns about a specific nominee, but a fundamental political principle. McCain’s deal is further confirmation that principle are cheap in Washington.

Theoretically, McCain’s surrender preserves the right of Republicans to filibuster future nominations. Practically speaking, however, that right has been permanently ceded. If the GOP is willing to fold when it has serious objections to pending nominations, it will easily surrender again in the future the next time Reid threatens the “nuclear option.” If the GOP isn’t willing to draw a line over flawed nominees like Cordray or Thomas Perez, it never will be.

Reid believed that he could eliminate the filibuster for nominations with a simply majority vote. Democrat Sen. Carl Levin on Tuesday said he believed the change required 67 votes and stated he would vote against Reid’s rule change. It would have been better for the GOP to force Reid to vote on the change. Senators would have had to go on record whether they supported Reid or Levin’s interpretation of the rules. With a number of vulnerable Democrats up for reelection next year, a vote could have carried political consequences.

McCain, however, helped the Democrats avoid a risky political vote. He also ensured that he is on Harry Reid’s speed-dial the next time the GOP raises objections to an Obama nomination."

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Martin O'Malley speaks at a rally in support of repealing the state's death penalty in January. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)

The Maryland legislature voted Friday to abolish the death penalty, which would make the state the sixth in as many years to end capital punishment and add to a canon of liberal policies recently embraced by state leaders.

The 82 to 56 vote in the House of Delegates, which followed two hours of debate, reflected a growing unease among lawmakers in Maryland and across the country that the risk of putting an innocent person to death remains too great with the death penalty in place.

The legislation, which passed the Senate last week, now goes to the desk of Gov. Martin O’Malley (D), who claimed a long-sought victory. Aides said he will sign the bill in coming weeks.

Since taking office in 2007, O’Malley has urged lawmakers to end capital punishment. He has also led successful efforts to legalize same-sex marriage, extend in-state college tuition rates to illegal immigrants and raise income taxes on wealthy residents.

In an interview, O’Malley credited the grass-roots lobbying efforts of the NAACP and faith leaders, turnover in the state Senate and some last-minute conversions with helping achieve an objective that had previously eluded him.

“I’ve felt compelled to do everything I could to change our law, repeal the death penalty, so that we could focus on doing the things that actually work to reduce violent crime,” said O’Malley, who rose to political prominence as a tough-on-crime mayor of Baltimore.

Repeal advocates said the win in Maryland — which has five prisoners on death row but hasn’t executed anyone since 2005 — would continue momentum nationally.

Benjamin T. Jealous, president of the NAACP, which has made repeal of the death penalty a national priority, noted that Maryland would become the first state south of the Mason-Dixon line to do away with capital punishment.

“This is a big day for Maryland. It’s a bigger day for the country,” said Jealous, who watched Friday’s vote in Annapolis from the House gallery and appeared at a news conference with O’Malley afterward. “It shows that the anti-death penalty movement is accelerating.”

He said that repeal advocates are within striking distance in Delaware, Colorado, New Hampshire and Kansas.

Although the death penalty remains on the books in 33 states, many are using it more sparingly than in the past. Last year, 77 people were sentenced to death nationally, the second-lowest number since capital punishment was reinstated in 1976, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.

“State after state is deciding that the death penalty is simply not worth the risks and costs to retain,” Richard Dieter, the executive director of the center, said Friday, predicting that Maryland “won’t be the last” to end capital punishment.

During Friday’s debate in the House, opponents of the repeal bill argued that capital punishment can be an important law-enforcement tool and should be kept on the books for heinous cases, several of which were recounted in graphic detail.

“I wish that we did not need the death penalty . . . but I’ve seen the worst of the worst, and I know it’s necessary,” Del. C.T. Wilson (D-Charles), a former prosecutor, told colleagues.

But his side was outnumbered by delegates who said they’ve come to view life without the possibility of parole as an acceptable alternative.

More than a dozen members made references to Kirk Bloodsworth, a former death-row inmate who was exonerated by DNA evidence and released from prison in 1993. Bloodsworth, a former Marine convicted of raping and murdering a 9-year-old girl in Baltimore County in 1984, watched the proceedings Friday from the House gallery.

“Human beings cannot devise a system of justice that is perfect,” said Del. Anne Healey (D-Prince George’s). “What I can’t live with is, if we make a mistake, it costs somebody else his life.”

A couple of members said they had reached their decision only in recent days.

“I’m a reluctant convert to supporting repeal, but a convert nonetheless,” said William J. Frank (R-Baltimore County), citing a “respect for human life.”

Maryland voters could still get the final say on the measure. A provision in the state constitution allows citizens to petition recently passed laws to the ballot, as happened with same-sex marriage legislation last year.

Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller Jr. (D-Calvert) has said the death penalty is likely to be placed on the 2014 ballot, although no group has announced plans to spearhead an organized effort to collect signatures.

The outcome of a ballot measure would be far from certain. A Washington Post poll released last month showed that a majority of Marylanders want to keep the death penalty despite widespread skepticism as to whether it is a deterrent to murder or is applied fairly.

Repealing the death penalty was not an issue that O’Malley campaigned on in 2006 when he first defeated then-Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. (R). But in December 2006, a month before he took office, the Court of Appeals ruled that the state’s procedures had not been properly adopted and halted executions until new regulations could be issued by the administration.

It was then that O’Malley, a practicing Catholic, said he sensed an opening to pursue a long-held belief of his.

Rather than put forward new regulations that would allow the death penalty to resume, O’Malley focused on lobbying the legislature for repeal.

In high-profile testimony shortly after he took office in 2007, the governor argued that capital punishment is “inherently unjust,” does not serve as a deterrent to murder and consumes resources that could be better used to prevent crime.

In 2009, after two repeal bills sponsored by lawmakers had failed, O’Malley decided to put the full weight of his office behind the measure and sponsor it himself, even though it was unclear if there were enough votes in the Senate.

That measure was rejected by the chamber, with members choosing instead to tighten evidentiary standards in capital cases.

Since then, several lawmakers have suggested that their attempt to “fix” the death penalty in 2009 was insufficient.

Those include Sen. Robert A. Zirkin (D-Baltimore County), the primary author of the 2009 amendment, which limited capital cases to those with DNA evidence, videotaped confessions or videotape of the crime itself.

Zirkin said he wrestled with his position for months and still was conflicted as he cast his vote for the repeal, expressing no moral qualms about putting to death people who are guilty beyond a shadow of a doubt.

“From an emotional standpoint, I want to kill these people myself,” he said. “But that’s a different question than whether, legally, the state should be involved in their death.”

In the weeks before the vote, three other members announced that they would vote for the bill, citing a variety of reasons, including visits from families of murder victims who opposed capital punishment.

“The idea of strapping someone down and deliberately taking their life — it was a little difficult for me,” said Sen. John C. Astle (D-Anne Arundel). “I didn’t come to my decision easily.”

The outcome in the House on Friday was expected, but that didn’t lessen the drama. House Speaker Michael E. Busch (D-Anne Arundel) characterized his chamber’s death-penalty vote and its legalization of same-sex marriage last year as two of the most emotional and important undertaken by state lawmakers.

Washington (CNN) – The third episode of the History Channel's miniseries “The Bible” was supposed to be remembered for the brutality of Babylonian ruler Nebuchadnezzar, the strength of Daniel in the lion’s den, and the birth of Jesus Christ.

But after viewers claimed there was a striking resemblance between Satan’s human form and President Barack Obama, that probably won't be the case.

Buzz on Twitter quickly grew. According to Topsy.com on Monday, there were an estimated 20,000 tweets containing the words “Obama” and “Satan” since the 9:00 p.m. ET hour on Sunday, the hour in which Satan appears in the two-hour show.

In a statement, miniseries producer Mark Burnett called claims there was a resemblance ""utter nonsense.""

Burnett said the actor who played Satan, Mohamen Mehdi Ouazanni, ""is a highly acclaimed Moroccan actor. He has previously played parts in several Biblical epics - including Satanic characters long before Barack Obama was elected as our President.""

Ouazanni has had roles in two biblical TV movies - ""Jeremiah"" and ""The Ten Commandments.""

Executive producer of the miniseries Roma Downey, Burnett's wife, added, ""Both Mark and I have nothing but respect and love our President, who is a fellow Christian. False statements such as these are just designed as a foolish distraction to try and discredit the beauty of the story of The Bible.""

Satan appears during the miniseries’ retelling of the Temptation of Christ, when Jesus fasted for 40 days in the Judean Desert. Satan tests Jesus’ faith, asking him to make bread out of stone and jump from a cliff, but he refuses each temptation and returns to the Sea of Galilee to begin his ministry.

In the desert, Satan is draped in a long, black, hooded robe and with a slight silver tint to his face.

Both Downey and Burnett supported Obama's first campaign for president in 2008, according to Federal Election Commission reports. Downey gave $5,000 to the Obama Victory Fund and $2,700 to the Democratic National Committee in 2008. Burnett also donated to Obama's first campaign - $2,300 in 2007.

Neither gave money to Obama's 2012 campaign.

While the show was airing, tweets poured in noting the resemblance.

After three episodes, the show has scored strong ratings. Its first episode drew 13.1 million viewers, ratings that trumped CBS’s “60 Minutes” and AMC’s “The Walking Dead.” The second episode drew 10.8 million viewers.

Ratings for the third installment in the five-week miniseries have not been released.

CNN’s Belief Blog: The faith angles behind the biggest stories

The project has been a three-and-a-half year process for The History Channel and for Burnett and Downey. Burnett - who is better known as a king of reality television, with “Survivor,” “The Voice” and “The Apprentice” all under his name - told CNN earlier this month that this project was “personal.”

“It was time for an updating, adding fresh visual life to a sacred text,” Burnett said.

Both Downey and Burnett were raised Catholic, Burnett in England and Downey in Ireland. They still regularly attend Mass in Los Angeles. Growing up, both watched the classic biblical films that the Hollywood of yesteryear churned out, like “The Ten Commandments” and “The Greatest Story Ever Told.”

To film their Bible series, the duo set off for the southern tip of Morocco with a crew of around 400 people.

Burnett and Downey consulted a wide range of pastors and academics, including a major evangelical leader and a Catholic cardinal.

Their advisory panel consisted of many people from varied backgrounds familiar with sharing the stories of the Bible, rather than a who’s who of biblical academics.

Joel Osteen, a popular television preacher and pastor of the 30,000-member Lakewood church in Houston, was among those consulted. Osteen and Burnett are friends and were developing a television series together that went on the back burner during the production of this series. Osteen even took his family to Morocco during some of the filming.

While the History Channel owns the exclusive North American rights to the project, Burnett and Downey own the rights to global distribution and theatrical airings, which are in the works. The project also has a book tie-in, games and apps.

What was Kerry like as a kid, growing up in the Bronx? ""She was never difficult. Challenging, yes. She had a mind and mouth of her own. Always eager to let you know what she thought,"" says Valerie, 70. ""When she was 7, she decided she wanted to fly by herself, to be on a plane by herself. She had a cousin in Boston, so we arranged for her to fly to Boston for the weekend."" Adds Kerry: ""It's when I started talking that I became difficult."" When Kerry first thought about becoming an actress while studying theater at George Washington University in D.C., her mom told her instead to be a lawyer for actors, urging her to find a career more stable than drama. Today, she's proud of her daughter and is ""awestruck"" when she's at one of her premieres. She is on edge when she sees her daughter on screen in perilous situations. ""I was sitting next to my mother at the premiere of The Last King of Scotland, and she was hyperventilating. I'm like, 'I'm right here! No one has chopped me up. I'm right here,' "" Kerry says. Mom says she's ""getting better"" about being at ease on Kerry's turf. ""It's just wonderful to see how she has evolved in this world and how she can handle this world,"" she says. ""And yet she can be the kid who comes home for Thanksgiving dinner and fools around with her cousins."" Retorts Kerry: ""I'm faking it."" Today, with Washington working in the same city as her parents, she spends more time with Mom. They vacation together in upstate New York, where they each own a house on a lake. ""That time at the lake, that is our sanctuary. All of the cousins, all of the cousins' kids — everyone goes up. We hike and swim and watch movies. There's no TV. There's a DVD player. Everyone cooks together,"" Kerry says. Reveals Valerie, prompting laughter from her daughter: ""When they hang out, they tread water. If you want a private chat with no one else around, go out and tread water."" Adds Kerry: ""Everyone in my family swims really well. The joke is that we'll all swim way out into the lake and just sit there. We stay out there and tread water and chat."" So does Valerie give her single daughter romantic advice? Kerry sits up: ""I'd love to hear this answer."" Valerie remains relaxed: ""I don't think so."" Kerry: ""You don't really tend to do that."" Valerie: ""Her dad's favorite saying is, 'As long as you like him, I'll like him.' "" Guidelines: You share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

On Tuesday, Tavon White, nicknamed ""Bulldog,"" admitted in federal court to having smuggled cell phones, drugs and other prohibited goods into the jail as leader of the Black Guerilla Family, a complex and wide-reaching organization operating inside (and outside) the Baltimore City Detention Center.

And this operation was apparently a moneymaker; White boasted of making more than $15,000 in a slow month, reports the Washington Post.

White is the first of those indicted to plead guilty. He faces a maximum sentence of 20 years at a sentencing hearing scheduled for Feb. 2014.

Duncan also notes this is the crime that landed White in Baltimore jail to begin with."

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/07/12/Daily-Beast-Rips-Dangerous-Jenny-McCarthey,2013-07-12 00:00:00,"[""Larry O'Connor""]",Daily Beast: Jenny McCarthy Co-Hosting 'The View' Would Be 'Dangerous',"“(Jenny) McCarthy’s views on vaccinations and autism aren’t just stupid, they are actually dangerous.” So says The Daily Beast in a hard-hitting analysis of the speculation that McCarthy, a former Playboy model, is set to replace Elisabeth Hasselbeck on ABC’s “The View.”

After wading through some gratuitous attacks on Hasselbeck for her conservative views, Tricia Romano then focuses squarely on McCarthy and her activism with regard to the scientifically dubious connections between autism and diet and vaccinations.

Since 2007, McCarthy has been a vocal opponent of the chemicals in vaccinations, credulously citing research (she’s neither a doctor nor a medical professional) and experiences with her autistic son as evidence. (It has also been reported that he may not even have autism, but Landau-Kleffner syndrome.) She has promoted the idea that people are getting an outrageous number of vaccinations today compared with the 1970s or ’80s. According to the book, Autism’s False Prophets: Bad Science, Risky Medicine, and the Search for a Cure, the amount has only doubled, from seven to 14, to include vaccinations for the flu, hepatitis, and chickenpox among others, in addition to the measles, mumps, polio, tetanus, and others that are standard. McCarthy doesn’t let science and facts get in her way. She has written three books about the subject–Louder Than Words: A Mother’s Journey in Healing Autism, Mother Warriors: A Nation of Parents Healing Autism Against All Odds, and Healing and Preventing Autism, which have all been New York Times bestsellers. She is the president of an autism organization, which is also averse to vaccination, called Generation Rescue. When promoting one of her books, she told Oprah how she learned about autism: “The University of Google is where I got my degree from.”

McCarthy’s opinions on autism and suspected “causes” and “cures” have raised eyebrows in the past, including a legendary appearance on The Larry King Show in 2008. “Give my son the measles! I’ll take that over autism any day,” she yelled at a pediatrician after calling America’s vaccination program “bulls**t.”

Many believe her stances on autism lead parents to have false hope for a “cure” rather than focusing parents on the path of accepting their child’s autism as a part of their unique personality, worthy of respect. They also say McCarthy’s pseudo-science distracts parents from seeking actual help in how to better communicate and interact with their autistic children. As Big Hollywood’s Dana Commandatore points out:

Once again, we’ve learned that celebrities do not have the answers. Sure, they look good on camera and can deliver a line better than average folks, but they are missing out on something important in the case of autism. Parents don’t need pseudo science and anecdotes. They need real life experiences and tried and tested information.

Others criticize the anti-vaccine rhetoric as being responsible for thousands of preventable illnesses and deaths. But, as the Daily Beast points out, McCarthy seems unfazed by the increase in diseases as a result of her efforts:"

Lay and Jeffrey K. Skilling in the Enron scandal; she worked with her friend Lisa Monaco, now Mr. Obama’s chief counterterrorism adviser, on a related Enron case. Near the desk in Ms. Ruemmler’s dark-paneled office is a plaque of a Houston Chronicle front page with the headline “Guilty! Guilty!” above the men’s photos — a gift from an F.B.I. agent on the case.

After that, Ms. Ruemmler returned to private practice in Washington, but in 2009 she took one of the most powerful jobs at the Justice Department — the “Padag,” for principal associate deputy attorney general, who essentially runs the place. She impressed the White House counsel, Robert F. Bauer. In 2010 he made her his deputy, and the next year, seeking to leave over Mr. Obama’s objections, Mr. Bauer pressed for Ms. Ruemmler to get the job.

The president did not know her well and, associates say, Ms. Ruemmler had strained relations with two Obama confidants — the attorney general, Eric H. Holder Jr., and the president’s senior adviser, Valerie Jarrett. Even so, Alyssa Mastromonaco, a deputy chief of staff, said Mr. Obama considered “only Kathy.” He promoted her in June 2011, saying, “Kathy is an outstanding lawyer with impeccable judgment.”

Ms. Ruemmler, who declined to speak for the record for this article, gets credit from colleagues for legal strategies that are crucial to sustaining Obama policies besides the health care law. They include a compromise with religious groups on the law’s mandate for insurance coverage of contraceptives and an agreement deferring deportations of illegal immigrants who were brought to the country as children.

She is responsible for judicial nominations — including selecting, vetting and selling them to Senate Republicans — and has helped Mr. Obama diversify the federal bench, naming higher percentages of women and minorities than his Republican and Democratic predecessors. With a 25-member staff, she also monitors Congressional investigations, negotiates with Republicans who demand administration documents, advises the White House on ethics and serves as Mr. Obama’s liaison to the Justice Department and the F.B.I.

It was that last role that kept her preoccupied the week of April 15 as she coordinated Mr. Obama’s response to the Boston Marathon bombings and accompanied him to the city. “She came with us because there was information coming in, and he wanted one filter,” Ms. Mastromonaco said. “He wanted Kathy.”"
http://news.yahoo.com/immigration-debate-clears-procedural-senate-hurdle-201715813.html,,[],Immigration debate clears procedural Senate hurdle,"WASHINGTON (AP) — In Spanish and English, the Senate pushed contentious immigration legislation over early procedural hurdles with deceptive ease on Tuesday as President Barack Obama insisted the ""moment is now"" to give 11 million immigrants in the United States illegally a chance at citizenship.

Despite the lopsided votes, Republicans served notice they will seek to toughen the bill's border security provisions and impose tougher terms on those seeking to gain legal status. ""This bill has serious flaws,"" said their party leader, Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, one of several who noted pointedly that the 60-vote majority they will demand for passage is hardly assured.

Even before the first proposed changes were considered, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a potential 2016 Republican presidential contender, outlined the complicated state of play for a measure that he helped draft as a member of the bipartisan ""Gang of Eight"" and now seeks to alter. With changes to tighten control of the U.S.-Mexican border, he said, about half of the Senate's 46 Republicans are prepared to vote to create the pathway to citizenship that is backed by most or all of the 54 lawmakers aligned with the Democratic majority.

At the White House, Obama said repeatedly the current immigration system is broken, for the foreign-born who live in the United State legally and illegally alike.

Referring to the 11 million currently in the country unlawfully, he said, ""Yes, they broke the rules; they didn't wait their turn. They shouldn't be let off easy. They shouldn't be allowed to game the system. But at the same time, the vast majority of these individuals aren't looking for any trouble. They're just looking to provide for their families, contribute to their communities. ""

At its core, the bill sets out a 13-year journey to citizenship for the millions of immigrants who arrived in the United States illegally through the end of 2011 or who overstayed their visas. That journey would include paying fines and back taxes and other measures. The bill also requires a tighter border to prevent future illegal immigration.

Story continues

Other key provisions would create a new program for low-skilled workers to enter the country and expand the number of visas for high-skilled who are particularly in demand in technology firms. The bill also jettisons a decades-old system that favors family ties over education, job skills and other factors in prioritizing prospective legal immigrants.

Obama didn't say so, but the legislation is likely his best hope of achieving a second-term landmark domestic accomplishment.

Numerous Republicans hope to use the issue to repair their party's image among Hispanic voters, a growing portion of the electorate in key states, and a group that polls show gave Obama 71 percent of its votes last year. But the GOP is divided, with tea party-backed lawmakers and other conservatives resisting anything that smacks of amnesty or otherwise seems to permit legalization without assuring the long border with Mexico in particular is virtually closed to future unlawful immigration.

""Of all of the issue swirling around this bill the path to citizenship for those who are here illegally is the single most divisive issue,"" said Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican elected to his first term last fall. ""And that is the issue on which the Obama White House and Senate Democrats insist, and by insisting on that division I believe they by design destine this bill to be voted down.""

In the Capitol, Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., chose to deliver a speech on the immigration measure in Spanish. He said it was appropriate to do so since the language ""has been spoken in this country since Spanish missionaries founded St. Augustine, Florida in 1565. Spanish is also spoken by almost 40 million Americans who have a lot at stake in the outcome of this debate,"" he said in an English translation provided by his office.

Taken together, the two procedural votes had the effect of placing the bill formally before the Senate and open for amendments. Both drew more than 80 votes, reflecting a bipartisan desire to have the debate that now is expected to consume three weeks.

Substantively, an early skirmish took shape over a proposal by Cruz' fellow Texan, Sen. John Cornyn. It would permit the legalization process to begin, but require several changes before anyone currently in the country illegally could receive a green card that confers permanent legal residence.

Those changes include apprehension of at least 90 percent of those seeking to cross into the United States at every segment of the Southern border, implementation of a biometric exit system at all air and sea ports of entry and a nationwide E-Verify system to check the legal status of prospective employees.

Democratic supporters of the legislation have deemed Cornyn's plan a ""poison pill,"" designed to wreck the bill's chances for passage instead of enhance them. But the Texan told reporters he had some leverage to force changes, if nothing else.

""I think if they had 60 votes to pass a bill out of the Senate they probably wouldn't be talking to me. And they are,"" Cornyn said of majority Democrats.

As the Senate embarked on a debate expected to last for weeks, Speaker John Boehner said he hoped companion legislation could clear committee in the House by the end of the month.

In an ABC interview, the Ohio Republican sidestepped when asked if he is prepared to support a pathway to citizenship for those living in the country illegally. ""A lot of these big questions will be decided on the House floor,"" he said.

In the Senate, McConnell sounded a similar note.

""The Gang of Eight has done its work,"" he said, referring to the four senators from each party that crafted the basic bill. ""Now it's time for the Gang of 100 to do its work.""

Mike Lee (R-Utah) declared on Monday that he and other congressional Republicans would be willing to shut down the federal government in order to block further implementation of President Barack Obama's health care reform law.

Speaking on Fox News, Lee said Republicans determined that refusing to fund Obamacare was the ""last stop"" before the individual mandate and the law's health insurance exchanges are set to go into effect at the beginning of next year.

“Congress of course has to pass a law to continue funding government -- lately we’ve been doing that through a funding mechanism called a continuing resolution,"" Lee said. ""If Republicans in both houses simply refuse to vote for any continuing resolution that contains further funding for further enforcement of Obamacare, we can stop it. We can stop the individual mandate from going into effect.”

Lee added that his effort, which he said was backed by ""13 or 14"" Senate Republicans and a host of House Republicans, wouldn't target popular Obamacare provisions that already had gone into effect, like a measure that allows children to remain on their parents' health insurance until the age of 26.

Congress passed a continuing resolution in March, temporarily funding the government for the rest of the fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. Lee is suggesting that Republicans refuse to vote on a future measure to fund the government, setting up another standoff that would put critical government functions at risk.

The threat comes just days after House Republicans took their 38th vote to repeal part or all of Obamacare. Their latest move followed the Obama administration's announcement that it was delaying the law's employer mandate for a year, a decision that Republicans used to support their claims that Obamacare is unworkable.

Lee similarly suggested in a Friday interview on WBAL 1090 AM that he and other Republicans would be willing to shut down the government.

“I’ll utilize every procedural mechanism at my disposal to do it,” he said. “I generally don’t signal in advance what procedural maneuvers exactly I’ll use because it’s usually not good strategy. But what I am saying is I will not vote for a continuing resolution that contains funding for further Obamacare implantation and enforcement. So far I have got, I don’t know, 13 or 14 Senate Republicans who have joined me. I think a corresponding effort is starting to be kicked off in the House. And I expect these numbers to grow steadily as Americans realize the president has said he’s not going to implement the law as written. If he’s not going to implement the law, we shouldn’t be forced to fund it.”"

Having failed to persuade their traditional Republican allies in Congress to avert a government shutdown, business leaders fear bigger problems ahead, and they're taking sides with a Democratic president whose health care and regulatory agenda they have vigorously opposed. President Barack Obama is embracing the business outreach, eager to employ groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Wall Street CEOs to portray House Republicans as out of touch even with their long-established corporate and financial patrons. snip On Wednesday, Obama is hosting chief executives from the nation's 19 biggest financial firms. Moreover, the Chamber of Commerce has sent a letter to Congress signed by about 250 business groups urging no shutdown and warning against a debt ceiling crisis that they say could lead to an economically disastrous default. snip The letter circulated by the Chamber of Commerce urges lawmakers to raise the debt ceiling ""in a timely manner and remove any threat to the full faith and credit of the United States government."" snip Concerned, the Chamber of Commerce is preparing to participate in political primaries, protecting friendly lawmakers from conservative challengers. ""Clearly we're getting to a point where we need a Congress that's going to be productive, proactive and create a stable environment for economic growth and job creation,"" said Scott Reed, a Republican political consultant who is advising the chamber on its strategy.

The Koch Brothers do not really represent the one thousanth of one percent who have real economic power. Many of them are at risk from the destruction of the world economy and a debt default will hurt them. Thing are going well for the ultra-rich, and they are tied to the health of the system.

It will be interesting to see a civil war among the Titans of Big Capital.

Granted, they created the Frankenstein monster, but all the more reason for them to deal with it. Money still talks in Republican circles and it will be interesting to watch this war. Tea Party and Kochs vrs. Big Capital.

An interesting anti-Fascist coalition including Labor and Big Capital. It won't last, and should not since class struggle still continues, but it could put down the Tea Party.

Meanwhile, the Republican War on the United States of America continues."

Dee Dee Myers, who was Bill Clinton’s campaign spokeswoman and his first White House press secretary, said she could not imagine where “such thoughts even come from” and tweeted “#Gottago” while linking to an article in which MSNBC was mum about whether Bashir’s apology was enough.

Honestly…where do such thoughts even come from? #Gottago. MSNBC not saying whether Martin Bashir apology is enough http://t.co/5ElIrTM1bn — Dee Dee Myers (@deemyers) November 20, 2013

Myers, who has written a book about why women leaders should rule the world, spoke out after Breitbart News reported that feminist and women’s groups had been silent on Bashir’s remarks. Talk radio host Mark Levin suggested women’s groups were silent because Palin is not a left-wing politician.

After Bashir apologized on his show on Monday for words that he admitted were “wholly inappropriate” and “offensive,” Breitbart News exclusively obtained a letter from Palin’s PAC, SarahPAC, that asked MSNBC President Phil Griffin and NBC News President Deborah Turness what action the network would take against Bashir for his “appalling” words. It also mentions that MSNBC has set a precedent of firing and disciplining other anchors for “offensive language.”

“You fired Don Imus for offensive language in describing the Rutgers University Women’s Basketball team, you suspended Alec Baldwin, and yet nothing has happened to Mr. Bashir,” the letter reads. “Are we to assume then, that disciplinary procedures at your network take place based on the target of the remarks rather than the remarks themselves?”

The letter also mentions that MSNBC suspended Baldwin’s show for two weeks after he made anti-gay remarks on the streets of New York off the air, while “Mr. Bashir’s violent rhetoric” was displayed on the air.

The letter concludes by saying, “Americans deserve to know that your network doesn’t condone violent and hateful rhetoric directed at anyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, or political persuasion.”"

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

The pint-sized Democratic activist, Madison Kimrey, has become somewhat of a national sensation in recent weeks after videos circulated of her railing against election laws in her home state.

Though she's not yet old enough to vote, the self-proclaimed ""suffragette"" has been campaigning against those laws while putting the governor in an awkward position -- by calling for a sit-down with him and drawing him into a war of words.

Kimrey’s activism quickly has made her a target of criticism from Republicans. Gov. Pat McCrory, suggesting that Kimrey’s being put up to this, has called her a prop for the left.

But Kimrey, who spoke with FoxNews.com, defended herself – and said she simply “didn’t like what was happening in the state and wanted to take action.""

Specifically, she had a problem with a new state policy that took away the ability of 16- and 17-year-olds to pre-register to vote.

Supporters say the law is needed to cut down on voter fraud. The pre-registration program had been called “confusing to teenagers” and “a bureaucratic burden” by some in McCrory’s office.

But Kimrey and others see it as a tactic to suppress voter turnout.

“A lot of my friends are 16 and 17 and I thought it was important and I said, ‘Hey -- that sucks,'” Kimrey told FoxNews.com.

So Kimrey, a homeschooled Davidson Young Scholar, got involved. She started with a speech at a “Moral Mondays” protest at the state capitol and routinely posted videos on YouTube.

“Moral Mondays” are protests held in North Carolina by people opposed to new laws and policies that came out of the 2013 General Assembly session.

Kimrey also started an online petition at MoveOn.org and has gotten close to 14,000 signature.

“I have always had an interest (in politics),” Kimrey said, adding, ""Moral Mondays got me more active.""

Kimrey has already had a confrontation with the governor, who turned down her request for a 15-minute meeting. Then he called her a liberal prop.

“This is all … very liberal groups using children as, I think, props to push a very far-left agenda,” McCrory said during an interview on WWNC Radio in August. He added, “And I don’t agree with conservatives doing that. Nor do I agree with liberals doing that.”

Kimrey responded during an Oct. 29 speech, “I am not a prop! I am part of the new generation of suffragettes, and I will not stand silent while laws are passed to reduce the amount of voter turnout by young people in my home state.”

When contacted by FoxNews.com, McCrory’s office suggested they would respond to Kimrey's charges but later said their only statement would be a “no comment.”

Critics have questioned Kimrey’s political ambitions and say she’s too scripted, and claim her speeches are written and rehearsed ahead of time.

“I feel like the people who say that don’t really know me,” Kimrey countered.

Kimrey told FoxNews.com that as a child she used to run up to the television whenever President George W. Bush was on and scream, “Bush!”

While her political leanings might have changed, her love of politics has not.

Kimrey’s rise as a junior political activist mirrors that of Jonathan Krohn.

Krohn rose to GOP fame after he wrote the book “Define Conservatism” in his early teens.

He gave a speech at the 2009 Conservative Political Action Conference and quickly became the darling of conservative media outlets, which nicknamed him Lil’ Limbaugh and Alex P. Keaton, the fictional character on the 80s sitcom “Family Ties.”

Today, Krohn is an 18-year-old young adult living in Manhattan. He has renounced most of his conservative ways.

“I started reflecting on a lot of what I wrote, just thinking about what I had said and what I had done,” he told Politico during a 2012 interview, adding that he was a 13-year-old kid repeating things he had heard from his parents.

Kimrey’s father, Doug Kimrey, says he doesn’t coach his daughter on what to say or what to write.

“This is Madison,” he told FoxNews.com. “She has her own opinions and I respect that.”

When asked about the future, Kimrey, who enjoys acting, dancing and singing, says she’s not sure if politics is on the menu.

“I don’t know what I want to do,” she said. “I don’t think it’s been invented yet."""

With Defense of Social Safety Net,"Now, as the governor’s image has softened, his poll numbers have improved heading into a re-election race next year against the likely Democratic nominee, Ed FitzGerald, the executive of Cuyahoga County.

He still angers many on the left; he signed a budget in June that cut revenues to local governments and mandates that women seeking an abortion listen to the fetal heartbeat. Democrats see his centrist swing as mere calculation, a prelude to a tough re-election fight.

“This is someone who realized he had to get to the center and chose Medicaid as the issue,” said Danny Kanner, communications director of the Democratic Governors Association. “That doesn’t erase the first three years of his governorship when he pursued polices that rewarded the wealthy at the expense of the middle class.”

Ohioans earning in the top 1 percent will see a $6,000 tax cut under the latest budget passed by the Republican-led legislature, while those in the bottom fifth will see a $12 increase, according to Policy Matters Ohio, an independent research group.

The governor dismissed the notion that his Medicaid decision was political. “I have an opportunity to do good, to lift people, and that’s what I’m going to do,” he said. “You know what?” he added, using a phrase he utters before aiming a jab. “Let the chips fall where they may.”

The son of a mailman who grew up outside Pittsburgh, Mr. Kasich (pronounced KAY-sik) has said he didn’t meet a Republican until he arrived as a freshman at Ohio State. He has often showed an independent streak. He supported President Bill Clinton’s assault weapons ban while in Congress in 1994, and he teamed with Ralph Nader to close corporate tax loopholes.

In the interview in his office, he criticized a widespread conservative antipathy toward government social programs, which regards the safety net as enabling a “culture of dependency.”"

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Today’s example: the long, tortuous road to bringing more retirement security to working-class Californians.

Advertisement

In September, the state launched a plan to enable these workers to put aside about 3% of their wages a year for retirement. As enacted by the Legislature and signed by Gov. Jerry Brown, the program’s goals would be modest indeed.

The best thing about the plan is that it would allow workers to build up retirement stakes at low cost and low risk; their contributions would be pooled with other enrollees’ for the purpose of making investments, which would cut down on fees. Workers would be signed up automatically, though they could opt out at any time. They’d be protected against the loss of their contributions and guaranteed a modest investment gain — say about 3% over inflation. When they retire, their nest eggs would be turned into annuities designed to last to the end of their lives, presumably at a conversion cost lower than they might incur in the commercial annuity market.

There would be no cost to state taxpayers. Employers with five or more workers would be required to offer the plan to their workforce and to allow contributions to be withheld through their payroll systems, as they do for taxes. They’d be free of any other legal or administrative burdens.

It’s a great deal. It’s also necessary, given the decades-long assault on employer-sponsored defined-benefit pensions, which were once an important pillar of retirement security for average Americans. “This could be a real model for the nation,” Karen Friedman, policy director at the Pension Rights Center in Washington, told me.

But it’s going to take at least two more years to get off the ground, which is ridiculous. That’s chiefly because the legislation requires that a feasibility study be done first to determine the demand for such a plan and the best way to avoid sticking taxpayers with the costs of an investment guarantee, and a few other details. The kicker is that the feasibility study has to be financed from privately raised funds, and that takes time.

“I’m going door to door in Echo Park to get people to chip in dollars,” says the plan’s creator, state Sen. Kevin de León (D-Los Angeles). He’ll soon widen his appeal to big unions in the hope of more rapidly amassing the $500,000 or more he’ll need to finance the study. As it stands now, he hopes to start the study next year and get the program launched in 2015. But he says the privately financed study was the price of securing Brown’s support.

You may ask why the state should step in and help workers obtain pensions. The answer is that fewer and fewer employers offer pension plans of any sort. The problem is acute among mid-size and small businesses, and even worse among those with relatively low-paid workforces.

A 2011 conference at Berkeley found that California does poorly by its working class according to this measure. Nearly half of all the state’s workers aren’t offered retirement plans at work, and only 44% participate even if they have the opportunity.

“If we don’t get these people into a retirement savings mode, we are going to have a retirement insecurity tsunami,” De Leon says. “Folks are going to retire when their arms, their legs, their shoulders give out, and they’ll only have Social Security because they’ll have built up no assets over time. There’s nothing for working folks.”

It’s fashionable nowadays to portray retirees as an affluent class, doing much better financially than their offspring currently in the workforce. The goal is to promote the idea that it’s OK to hack away at Social Security and Medicaid because our plutocratic seniors can suck up the cuts. This is a dangerous fantasy promulgated by congressmen and Washington pundits who will never have to fear landing on the wrong side of the miscalculation.

The truth is that today’s retirees are the last beneficiaries of a bygone world, as Jacob Hacker, a political scientist at Yale University, observed at the Berkeley meeting. A quarter-century ago, 80% of large and mid-size employers offered a defined-benefit pension, the model that imposed the least risk on the worker and supplied the longest-lasting retirement income stream. Today that figure is about 30%. Some of those plans have been replaced by 401(k)-style plans, to which workers contribute out of their wages (sometimes supplemented by the employer) and then cross their fingers that their investment choices will yield decent returns over the decades.

These are a thin reed, however. The vast majority of workers don’t contribute the maximum permitted, or even enough to build up a secure nest egg; the median 401(k) balance for households approaching retirement is only about $60,000, which will barely be enough to flavor the potatoes over an average post-career life span — and that’s among households that have any 401(k) at all (fewer than 70%, according to researchers at Boston College).

Don’t forget that many of today’s seniors cashed in historic gains in asset values before retirement, including their homes and stock portfolios. We haven’t begun to see the full effect of the housing crash and two successive stock market crashes on the wealth profile of newly retiring workers; but we can be sure that it will be ugggggly.

“Since World War II, we’ve never had a cohort that did worse in retirement than the cohort before,” says Teresa Ghilarducci, a retirement expert at the New School for Social Research who participated in the Berkeley meeting. That’s about to change.

The California program is the first gingerly attack on that dismal trend line. De Leon has worked carefully around the possible pitfalls — he’s made several visits to Washington to get the Internal Revenue Service to certify that contributions will be tax-exempt, as are 401(k) contributions. He’s also seeking an agreement from the Labor Department that the plan will be exempt from ERISA, the paperwork-heavy law safeguarding pension plans sponsored by employers. (That’s why California won’t accept employer contributions.) Most experts think the program will get the agency’s green light.

The plan is aimed at low-income workers, the group with the lowest participation rate in 401(k)s and the smallest nest eggs of any kind. The minimum investment guarantee would be set low enough that the pool’s investments could be low-risk and the chances of missing the mark over the course of a career’s contributions would be almost nil. Any residual risk of falling short would be covered by an insurance policy to be purchased by the program’s board, not by the taxpayers. The state’s role would be limited to pooling all the contributions to keep costs down, though every participant would have a claim on his or her individual account.

This won’t make anyone rich. But for many working-class retirees it would be an important supplement to Social Security, which today pays an average retirement stipend of $1,230 a month. It’s the first step toward restoring the retirement security that used to come from defined-benefit pensions, especially for the working class.

“It’s not as good as a good defined-benefit plan,” says Monique Morrissey, an economist at the progressive Economic Policy Institute, a Washington think tank, “but better than what they have now.”

Advertisement

She says government guaranteed programs like California’s are a hot topic in the pension community right now. “Everyone’s trying to figure out something workable.”

Massachusetts is developing a plan to cover employees of small nonprofits, and Oregon and Connecticut are considering their own programs.

Advertisement

De Leon says he’s amazed that his unassuming first step is being hailed in Washington as a breakthrough, even before all the Ts are crossed and the I’s dotted. That speaks volumes about how Congress has ceased even to pretend to care about the American worker.

“When people there tell me I’ve done more to advance this idea than anyone in the nation,” he says, “it’s a little surreal.”

The anti-choice bill in Texas currently being debated is a great start, but we need to go right to the source: the horrible murder of sperm that occurs during male masturbation.

Some activists would have you believe these are just clumps of cells, but anyone who looks at semen under a microscope can tell you that individual sperm demonstrate purposeful movements.

Did you know that we have no actual study that proves sperm can't feel pain when unnecessarily ejaculated? It's true! For all we know, these are living organisms that endure excruciating nerve stimulation when exposed outside of the male reproductive system.

There are those who would argue that we are regulating men's bodies and taking away their freedom to make their own healthcare choices, but as our conservative brethren have pointed out in many a debate on rape culture, men simply can't control their sexual urges on their own as per the landmark legal reasoning of ""boys will be boys."" Therefore, they need help and incentives.

To that end, I am proposing a bill in the Texas Legislature that does the following:

1. Ejaculation of semen outside of an active effort to procreate is banned. Some would make the case that we should allow exemptions for cases of rape, incest, or if the man's life is in danger, but this is all nonsense and doesn't correspond with our strong, Texas values. A life is a life. Just consider if our great governor Rick Perry had been ejaculated by his father during a self-pleasuring act.

In the event Section 1 isn't passed, we should include further restrictions that make it incredibly difficult for men to masturbate without facing criminal prosecution:

2. Men who masturbate must apply for a state permit, pay a $500 fee for that permit, undergo a transanal sonogram to view the internal route sperm must take to leave the male body, be counseled by a physician on the benefits of a celibate lifestyle, and view a two-hour video on the modern genocide that is male masturbation.

3. Men who obtain masturbation permits are only permitted to do so in designated areas for such activities, specifically masturbation centers that receive licensing by the state.

4. The state will be limited to a total of six masturbation centers in order to better monitor this activity, all of which will be placed at least 200 miles outside towns with populations greater than 20,000 residents. We must think of the children who could see a sign for one of these centers.

5. Male members of the Texas Legislature are examples to all men everywhere and thus, should submit to daily external and internal swab samples when the Legislature is in session that will be analyzed for evidence that masturbation has occurred.

6. In order to evaluate charges that unsanctioned masturbation has occurred by a male member of the Texas Legislature, a Committee to Understand Male Masturbation (CUMM) will be formed to determine if reported transgressions should result in the impeachment of investigated members.

7. To avoid bias in these investigations, CUMM will be composed entirely of women in the Texas Legislature. All testimonies given on this subject will be limited to the approval of the committee.

8. The Chairwoman of CUMM could hold a possible bias if she is heterosexual, and therefore, it is advised that she be a lesbian to avoid impropriety in oversight of this committee.

We love men and believe they are the bedrock of the Texas family. We are only choosing to do what's best for them and avoid a breakdown in the societal order of this state.

Pollak'],"In Debate with Breitbart's Shapiro, CNN's Piers Morgan Calls the Constitution 'Your Little Book'","“You come in here, brandish your little book as if I don’t know what’s in there–”

“My little book? That’s the Constitution of the United States. It’s our founding document, Piers.”

“I know what’s in your Constitution.”

“Do you really?”

That was the climax of a heated debate between Breitbart News Editor-at-Large Ben Shapiro and CNN’s Piers Morgan on live television this evening–one in which Morgan came off much the worse for wear.

Shapiro began by pointing out that for weeks, Morgan had bullied guests who defend the right to bear arms by “standing on the graves of the children of Sandy Hook.”

“How dare you,” said a rattled Morgan.

“I have seen you do it repeatedly,” Shapiro replied.

He challenged Morgan to explain whether he wanted to ban all guns, not just “assault rifles,” since the vast majority of gun deaths involve ordinary handguns. “Why don’t you care about banning the handguns in Chicago?” Shapiro asked him.

Morgan, who later stated that he supported Americans’ right “to defend themselves with a handgun or a pistol,” pointed out that the weapons used in recent sensational mass shootings had been “assault rifles,” and insisted that the debate was not one of “left and right,” because his position ought to be the consensus, as in Britain. Shapiro countered that the basis of the Second Amendment was not self-defense or hunting, but the ability to resist government tyranny–a point that Morgan attempted to mock, unsuccessfully.

Shapiro’s statement is worth quoting in full:

Shapiro: I think the reason that it’s about left and right here is because fundamentally, the right believes that the basis for the Second amendment–and they believe in the Second Amendment–the basis for the Second Amendment is not really about self defense, and it’s not about hunting. It’s about resistance to government tyranny. That’s what the Founders said, and that’s what the right believes in this country. Morgan: Which tyranny are you fearing, yourself? Shapiro: I fear the possibility of a tyranny rising in the country in the next fifty to a hundred years. Let me tell you something, Piers. The fact that my grandparents and great grandparents in Europe didn’t fear that is why they’re now ashes in Europe. So this kind of leftist revisionist history where there’s never any fear of democracy going usurpatious or tyrannical, is just that. It’s fictitious.

Subsequently, Morgan accused Shapiro of wanting to “do nothing” about mass shootings, to which Shapiro replied that his position was to improve background checks and screening for mental illness and criminal histories among potential gun owners and their households. Shapiro later pointed out the hypocrisy in attacking the National Rifle Association and the Second Amendment without subjecting violent video games, the American Civil Liberties Union and the First Amendment to the same scrutiny.

Morgan then presented Shapiro with a letter co-signed by Ronald Reagan in 1994, urging support for the assault weapons ban (an ineffective policy, which lapsed after ten years). He challenged Shapiro to justify “why an American needs an assault weapon.”

Shapiro repeated his point on tyranny, to which Morgan said: “Do you know how absurd you sound?”

In so doing, he proved Shapiro’s point:

Here’s where you go into the bullying….For weeks now, you have been saying that anybody who disagrees with your position is absurd, idiotic, and doesn’t care about the dead kids in Sandy Hook. And then when I say that’s a bullying tactic, you turn around and say that I’m bullying you.

Later on the program, once Shapiro was safely off camera, Morgan admitted: “In an ideal world, I’d have all guns gone, as we have in Britain, but this is not my country and I respect the fact most Americans wouldn’t wear that kind of argument.”

An epic win for Shapiro, and for our “little book.”

Calling the decision ""outrageous,"" Pelosi argued that not only could the House pass the immigration bill if Boehner would try, but it could also pass a bill to improve background checks for gun purchases and the Employment Non-Discrimination Act to ban employers from firing people because of their sexual identity.

""ENDA, background checks and comprehensive immigration reform -- it's right there, it's right there,"" Pelosi told reporters at her weekly briefing on Capitol Hill. ""It requires it to be bipartisan because we don't have the majority, but we say to the speaker, bring up immigration any way you want -- singly, jointly, severally -- anything -- just bring it up so we can take some votes on it.""

Pelosi made it clear, however, that she didn't really expect any action in a Congress that is about the least productive in history.

""I don't know that they ever intend to do anything -- again,"" Pelosi said. ""The legislative branch, the first article of the Constitution, the first branch of government, the legislative branch -- and we're not legislating. We are not legislating. But we could.""

Asked if the House could focus on another piece of legislation that crosses party lines -- reforming spying by the National Security Agency -- Pelosi was especially dismissive.

""You know what the agenda is around here,"" Pelosi said. ""Not only is it family friendly. It's family friendly for a family of retirees. Nothing gets done. 'Let's just go home early, if we come in at all,'"" she said, paraphrasing the attitude she attributes to Boehner.

Pat Leahy (D-VT) is using the Republican National Committee (RNC) to bolster his attack on Republicans opposed to rushing through an unexamined comprehensive immigration reform package.

Leahy made the move in his letter berating Alabama Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions for joining all his Senate Judiciary Committee GOP colleagues except for the two who are members of the so-called “Gang of Eight” in calling for an open and transparent immigration reform process.

“I am encouraged by the recent recommendations in what is being called its ‘autopsy’ of the last election, in which the Republican National Committee wrote that your party ‘must embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform,'” Leahy wrote to Sessions.

The full quote from the RNC “autopsy” report reads: “We are not a policy committee, but among the steps Republicans take in the Hispanic community and beyond, we must embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform. If we do not, our Party’s appeal will continue to shrink to its core constituencies only.”

Now that the RNC, which admits it is not a vehicle from which policy should be drafted, has taken to advocating a specific policy proposal, such advocacy is being used by Senate Democrats to drive a wedge between Republican lawmakers.

“I hope that you and other Republican Senators on the Committee will do so [support immigration reform],” Leahy chided Sessions. “I am encouraged that after two resounding presidential defeats, some Republican politicians are concerned enough about the growing Hispanic voting population that they are abandoning their former demagoguery and coming to the table.”

“I welcome Republicans to this effort,” Leahy continued. “I am glad that Senator McCain is once again interested in supporting comprehensive immigration reform. I still worry that too many congressional Republicans continue to oppose a straightforward pathway to citizenship, but that is a discussion we need to have out in the open, in front of the American people.”"

* Rival accused of copying elements of Air Force 1 sneakers

* Court: Already's claim mooted after Nike dropped own case

By Jonathan Stempel

WASHINGTON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Nike Inc won a victory at the U.S. Supreme Court barring a smaller rival from suing to void the company's trademark for its top-selling Air Force 1 sneakers.

Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for a unanimous court on Wednesday that Nike's promise not to pursue an infringement lawsuit against Already LLC, maker of Yums sneakers, meant that the Texas company could not pursue its own trademark challenge.

""Already's arguments boil down to a basic policy objection that dismissing this case allows Nike to bully small innovators lawfully operating in the public domain,"" Roberts wrote. But the argument did not justify letting its lawsuit proceed, he wrote.

Wednesday's decision upheld a November 2011 ruling by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York.

James Dabney, a lawyer for Already, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Nor did Nike.

Wednesday's decision may help companies such as Nike rival Adidas SE and luxury goods makers Coach Inc and LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA, which often sue to prevent alleged imitators from interfering with their revenue streams and customer goodwill.

The case began in 2009, when Nike claimed in a lawsuit that Already's Sugar and Soulja Boy shoes infringed Nike's trademark on the stitching, eyelet panels and other features of Air Force 1. Nike, based in Beaverton, Oregon, launched the low-cut Air Force 1 sneaker in 1982 and sells millions of them each year.

After Already countersued to void the trademark, Nike dropped its lawsuit, believing Yums was not a commercial threat, and gave a promise in the form of a covenant not to sue Already.

But Already, based in Arlington, Texas, refused to drop its own case and accused Nike of dropping the original lawsuit to deprive courts of jurisdiction.

DOROTHY'S RUBY SLIPPERS

Roberts, however, said that allowing Already's lawsuit to continue would encourage large and small companies to use litigation as a ""weapon"" rather than as a last resort to settle disputes, which could discourage innovation.

""Accepting Already's theory may benefit the small competitor in this case,"" he said. ""But lowering the gates for one party lowers the gates for all. As a result, larger companies with more resources will have standing to challenge the intellectual property portfolios of their more humble rivals - not because they are threatened by any particular patent or trademark, but simply because they are competitors in the same market.""

Roberts also agreed with Nike that Already was unlikely to produce any shoe that would not be protected.

""If such a shoe exists, the parties have not pointed to it, there is no evidence that Already has dreamt of it, and we cannot conceive of it,"" Roberts wrote. ""It sits, as far as we can tell, on a shelf between Dorothy's ruby slippers and Perseus' winged sandals.""

Justice Anthony Kennedy concurred in the decision, saying that other companies should not assume they can automatically end rivals' trademark cases with covenants similar to Nike's.

Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Sonia Sotomayor joined Kennedy's concurrence.

Two companies with well-known trademarks, clothing maker Levi Strauss & Co and automaker Volkswagen AG, filed briefs supporting Nike.

The case is Already LLC v. Nike Inc, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 11-982."

""It seems almost unreal that we can't get together on a budget or legislation,"" he said on ""Fox News Sunday."" ""We weren't perfect, by a long shot, but at least we got our work done.""

Dole, who served in the Senate from 1969 to 1996, wasn't fully critical of the president, but said part of the problem is that he ""lacks communication with Congress"" and should have gotten together with members earlier in his presidency.

Dole joked at first when asked by host Chris Wallace to quickly give his thoughts on President Barack Obama. ""He's a great golfer, very articulate,"" Dole responded.

Still, he acknowledged it's not easy to work with the Senate, where he said ""no doubt about it,"" cloture is being abused. He didn't spare the Republican Party his criticism, saying they need to be ""closed for repairs"" and come up with more plans and a vision for the future before the end of the year. Wallace asked him whether he'd even fit in with the Republican Party today.

""I doubt it,"" Dole replied. ""Reagan wouldn't have made it, certainly Nixon wouldn't have made it, because he had ideas. We might have made it, but I doubt it.""

It's tough to be a leader, he said, but his strategy was to get people together and then ask them to call him when they came to a deal. In the end, the leadership gets the blame when things go wrong, he said.

""Howard Baker said running the Senate is like herding cats, and it takes leadership,"" he said. ""Somebody has to stand up and say, 'We're not going to do this.'"""

She Received The Pulitzer Prize For Commentary In']",Kathleen Parker: Take cameras out of court,"As a courtroom junkie since my early reporting days, it is at great personal sacrifice that I suggest the following: It may be time to get television cameras out of the courtroom.

Or at least, judges might be encouraged to exclude electronic media from high-profile trials.

The excessive coverage and commentary we’ve watched in recent years may be good theater but bad for justice. Most recently, we’ve been witness to the carnival trial of George Zimmerman, charged in the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin. We’ve seen the families; we’ve met neighbors and friends; and we’ve heard the screaming on the recorded 911 call.

I have written about all of the above, true. But here’s the difference. If I were sitting in the courtroom with pad and pen, no one would notice or care. The pen may be mightier than the sword — and a picture may be worth a thousand words — but video cameras alter reality. Their very presence changes the people and events they seek to capture. And, just to keep those cliches rolling, although seeing is believing, what we project for others to see is influenced — and reality is altered — by the fact that a camera is recording that projection.

We’ve always known this on some abstract level, but our curiosity — and, ostensibly, our mighty respect for the public’s right to know — has clouded our judgment. There may be no way to quantitatively prove that cameras influence courtroom behavior and, possibly, a trial’s outcome. But anyone who has ever sat in front of a camera knows that it is so.

Meanwhile, the notion of the public’s right to know every detail of what is essentially a show trial suffers a paucity of veracity. If our concern were truly to better understand the machinations of the judicial system, as some have argued, we would record and broadcast all trial proceedings rather than only the ones that involve key elements of modern tabloid storytelling, namely sex, drugs, rock ’n’ roll — and race.

The Zimmerman trial is riveting not because two men got in a scuffle and one of them died or because one was a teenager and the other an armed adult. It is that one was black, the supposed victim of a profiling vigilante, and the other white.

Voilà: We have a potboiler.

Imagine if Martin had been white under the same circumstances. Some might argue that Zimmerman would not have found Martin suspicious had he been white, but we can’t know this. We can debate the point until we’re all blue, but meanwhile, we can be fairly certain that the trial would not have attracted a single camera if not for the race element.

The point: Media are only interested in stories involving tension, whatever its underpinnings. And, inarguably, the media are providing what people, too, most care about. One Google trends chart “of interest over time” shows that people are more focused on the Zimmerman trial than they are on Egypt or the fate of Mohamed Morsi.

It is pointless to blame the media for essentially doing their job — providing information the public wants. Our attention, thus, would be more appropriately aimed at our own prurience and, given the human appetite for same, the court’s responsibility in protecting the defendant’s right to as fair a trial as possible.

This means ensuring a “neutral and detached environment,” as Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki put it in his ruling to ban media coverage of O.J. Simpson’s civil trial. The presence of electronic media in the criminal trial — very little of which I missed, I should say — “significantly diverted and distracted the participants,” Fujisaki wrote, adding that “the conduct of witnesses and counsel were unduly influenced by the presence of the electronic media.”

Fujisaki also was concerned that the jury, which was not sequestered, would be influenced by outside commentary. Although Zimmerman’s jury is sequestered, the judicial environment is hardly neutral or detached. One way or another, the media’s incessant dissection of every little shred of evidence or testimony leaks into the courtroom and contaminates the atmosphere. When lawyers and witnesses hear their own performances critiqued — and evidence is evaluated by one of the legions of former prosecutors-turned-experts — suddenly the audience is directing the play.

Put another way: If it were your neck on the line, you’d probably rather the media were in Cairo.

According to the hometown paper for America’s political class, this makes them ‘Haters.'”

In a recent poll conducted by the Washington Post, there are three teams in America: the Democrat team, the Republican team, and the Haters Team. Rasmussen says that “This wasn’t just a casual reference by a lazy journalist. Not only did the paper of the political elite produce tables and graphics with the ‘Haters’ label; they wrote an entire article about how ‘Haters Gonna Hate.'” Rasmussen added, “It truly boggles my mind to think that this is the label it intentionally and thoughtfully chose.”

Rasmussen thinks there are much better labels for those who don’t feel an affinity for either of the first two teams, such as “the adults needed to supervise the behavior of Congress.” Rasmussen believes that many in Congress entered politics with good intentions but that they find themselves in a “corrupt and dysfunctional institution.” He maintains that, no matter what you call those that don’t approve of Republicans or Democrats, you need only to recognize the ineptitude of politicians of both parties to distance oneself from supporting them.

In Rasmussen’s view, Congress can’t produce a budget, can’t produce a workable health care law, both parties prop up crony capitalism, and Republicans and Democrats alike supported the NSA’s domestic spying. But what disturbs Rasmussen more than Congress’ poor performance is that the Washington Post stigmatizes those who disagree with their elitist political class world view as “haters.” The Post is wrong, according to Rasmussen. “We don’t need to hate anybody to recognize that Congress is doing a lousy job,” he remarks. “Those of us who disapprove of both parties in Congress are simply waiting for Congress to do something worthy of our approval.”"

By Fareed Zakaria

July 4 in America is a good time to reflect on the glories of U.S. democracy – especially given the turbulence in so many democracies these days, from Egypt to Brazil to Turkey.

More: Egypt's Morsy out, uncertainty in

As we watch these protests around the globe, we should keep in mind that the distinctive feature of the American system is actually not how democratic it is, but rather how undemocratic it is.

What do I mean? Well, we have three co-equal branches of government and the one with the final say on many issues, the Supreme Court, is composed of 9 unelected men and women. The American senate is the most unrepresentative upper house in the democratic universe, with the exception of Britain's House of Lords, which is utterly powerless. California's 38 million people have the same representation in the Senate as do Wyoming's 576,000. State and local governments battle federal power constantly. Private businesses and other non-governmental groups are also part of the mix.

Now there are aspects of this system that many Americans don't like – especially the abuse of the system by largely invented practices like the filibuster – but the basic system of checks and balances, as the famous phrase goes, has worked well.

The form of government that came out of the French revolution, by contrast, is one of absolute sovereignty, centralizing all power at the top. Since that revolution, France has had many upheavals and changes in its regime. It went through two monarchies, two empires, one proto-fascist dictatorship, and five republics before it got to the present regime. The United States, by contrast, has had a continuous constitutional existence since 1789.

Why is this important as we look at the world today? In so many of these cases, what we are watching are democratic governments, elected freely and fairly, that are abusing individual rights, ignoring minority groups, and eroding checks and balances. Observing the early flowering of this phenomenon in the mid-1990s, I described it as ""illiberal democracy,"" and that is the problem we confront in Egypt and so many developing countries.

The good news is that the other elements within these societies are fighting back against illiberal democracy – political groups, student movements, opposition parties. The clash between the Egyptian military and the Muslim Brotherhood reminds one of the many clashes between kings and lords, the church and the state, that produced the development of Western liberal democracy. It can look very messy while it's happening, neither side has a monopoly of virtue, but the contest between various centers of power over time helped create a system of checks and balances in the West.

So what we're watching around the world might look like crisis and breakdown, but it might turn out to be the road to better government.

(Photo by Rob Kim/FilmMagic)

Bill de Blasio, the soon-to-be mayor of New York, surged to prominence over the summer while promising to reform the city’s police department.

He said he would scale back the rampant use of stop and frisk, the controversial practice of stopping suspects and frisking them for guns and drugs, which led to hundreds of thousands of arrests of mostly black and Latino New Yorkers on minor marijuana charges. And he vowed to dismiss the current police commissioner, Raymond Kelly, who made stop and frisk a keystone of his tenure and vigorously defended it in the press and in court to those who say that the way he has used it infringes on the rights of minorities.

But now de Blasio is considering a replacement for Kelly who has arguably done more than anyone else in the United States -- including Kelly himself -- to popularize the use of stop and frisk and other aggressive tactics associated with racial profiling.

William Bratton, who led the Boston Police Department in 1993 and oversaw dramatic crime reductions while leading the New York City Police Department from 1994 to 1996 and the Los Angeles Police Department from 2002 to 2009, is a superstar cop and a hero to many. But some critics of the aggressive policing methods championed by Kelly say he’s a poor choice to lead the department in a new direction.

“He would be terrible,” said Harry Levine, a sociology professor at Queens College and the CUNY Graduate Center, who studies marijuana arrests. “Bratton is Kelly policing with charm, charisma, savoir-faire, and unbelievably brilliant PR skills.”

Others are less critical. Adhyl Polanco, an NYPD officer who has testified against Kelly’s policies in hearings and trials, said he would welcome Bratton back to the force. Stop and frisk isn’t the problem with the NYPD today, Polanco said. “It’s the abuse that’s the problem.”

Whether a potential Bratton appointment is a good or bad thing largely depends on the lens through which you view New York City. Is New York’s transformation into one of the safest cities in the U.S. over the last 20 years an unalloyed success story? Or is it a “tale of two cities” in which the haves keep improving their lot, while the have-nots get stopped and frisked and often thrown in jail by those who see them as criminals in the making?



Bratton with former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani.

De Blasio ran a very successful campaign arguing the latter, making it all the more surprising he could choose a police commissioner championed by people who see New York through the first lens.

As the head of the NYPD, Bratton was perhaps the first police commissioner in the country to embrace the “broken windows” theory of policing -- the idea that the police can discourage criminals from acting with impunity by using the full force of the law to crack down on vandalism and other petty displays of contempt for the authorities.

Bratton unleashed patrol officers to stop people for all sorts of minor and suspected violations, and to frisk them for drugs and guns. During his 27 months as New York’s top cop, the city’s arrest rate soared and reports of serious crimes decreased by 33 percent, an extraordinary decline. Supporters praised Bratton both for his hard-nosed style and his introduction of CompStat, a police-intelligence computer system that allows commanders to track crime and arrest data in real time and essentially encourages officers to make more arrests.

But as the arrest rate climbed, so did charges of police misconduct, especially in precincts heavily populated by blacks and Latinos.

Kelly, who took over from Bratton’s successor, Bernard Kerik, in 2002, embraced and expanded on Bratton’s tactics in a way that many consider excessive and discriminatory against minorities. An analysis of the NYPD’s stop-and-frisk practice by the New York Civil Liberties Union found that innocent black and Latino New Yorkers were stopped 400,000 times in 2012, far more often than whites. The report also found that police made more arrests for marijuana possession last year than for any other crime, despite support from both Kelly and Mayor Michael Bloomberg for a proposal to decriminalize open possession of small amounts of the drug.

In recent years, Bratton has at times seemed eager to distance himself from Kelly’s approach to policing. At a 2012 business group meeting in New York, he compared stop and frisk to chemotherapy, calling it an “intrusive power,” before adding, “applied in the right way, it can have the effect of reducing crime.”

Some black and Latino leaders support Bratton's ""right way” of using stop and frisk, largely because of his accomplishments as the police chief in Los Angeles between 2002 and 2009.

John Mack, a black civil rights veteran and the former director of the Los Angeles Urban League, offered a full-throated endorsement of Bratton. “He’s sensitive to the importance of a police department not operating like an occupation force in communities of color,” he said. “The broken windows theory, that’s part of his philosophy, but that was not an issue here in Los Angeles.”

Mack worked closely with Bratton in LA and says he has personally recommended him to de Blasio. Under Bratton’s leadership, he said, “the police were not just going after every young black African American on the streets of South Los Angeles.”



Bratton greets immigrant reform supporters as they march on Hollywood Boulevard on June 24, 2007 in Los Angeles, California.

When Bratton arrived in LA, violent crimes were on the rise. The city’s police department faced corruption allegations and operated under federal oversight, and the historically strained relationship between the city’s cops and black residents was as fraught as ever.

Soon after taking over the department, Bratton sat down with some of the LAPD’s fiercest critics, including Mack and civil rights attorney Connie Rice, who had filed a number of lawsuits against the department, and asked for their support. He later tapped Rice to investigate allegations that gang officers from a troubled division had stolen drugs and framed suspects. Meanwhile, the officers who served under him were encouraged to build relationships with black and Latino community leaders, including former gang members, in a cooperative effort to reduce gang violence in the city.

By the end of his tenure, crime was down 54 percent from 2001, and race relations seemed to be improving. That year, 51 percent of residents said that the police in their communities treated members of all racial and ethnic groups fairly “almost all the time” or “most of the time,” up from 44 percent in 2005, according to a Harvard University study.

In November, de Blasio met with Bratton and two other candidates for New York’s top cop job: Philip Banks III and Rafael Pineiro, both of whom currently serve in high-ranking jobs under Kelly. Banks is black, and Pineiro is Latino, but as veterans of Kelly’s department, neither candidate fully represents a break from the NYPD’s recent past.

As the city’s public advocate, de Blasio released a report showing that stopping whites was actually more likely to lead to the recovery of guns and drugs than stops of blacks and Latinos, despite the much higher frequency of the latter. He recommended appointing an inspector general to oversee the department’s use of the strategy and passing a bill to protect against racial profiling.

Yet de Blasio has stopped short of calling for an end to stop and frisk altogether. His campaign website criticized the “overuse and abuse” of the tactic under Kelly, not the tactic itself.

Donna Lieberman, director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said she’s heard good things about Bratton from her ACLU colleagues in Southern California. “We have learned from them that his tenure in LA was characterized by a very different relationship with advocates like the Civil Liberties Union than what we have seen with Commissioner Kelly in New York,” she said. “There were lines of communication which don’t exist for us in New York now.”

Still, she tempered her praise with words of caution. If Bratton is named commissioner, “we would be very eager to hear about the plans to rein in the excesses with regard to stop and frisk, ‘broken windows,’ and CompStat,” she said. “It starts from the top.”"

During an interview with Nevada Public Radio, Reid warned that he was willing to make drastic changes to Senate rules if action is not taken on the ballooning number of stalled judicial nominees.

“All within the sound of my voice, including my Democratic senators and the Republican senators who I serve with, should understand that we as a body have the power on any given day to change the rules with a simple majority, and I will do that if necessary,"" Reid said.

""If the Republicans in the Senate don’t start approving some judges and don’t start helping get some of these nominations done, then we’re going to have to take more action.""

The ""nuclear option"" was floated by Reid during filibuster reform talks earlier this year. If taken, the simple majority vote would override the precedent of requiring a two-thirds supermajority to change filibuster rules. However, Reid and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) instead agreed to a scaled-back reform deal in January after Republicans pushed back on Reid's threats.

""No party has ever broken the rules of the Senate to change those rules. I'm glad such an irreparably damaging precedent will not be set today,"" McConnell said in a statement in January.

However, Reid's latest comments signal that the precedent may be broken if action is not taken soon on the stalled judicial nominations. As The Washington Post reported earlier this week, 15 nominations are currently awaiting a vote on the Senate floor, including 13 nominees who already cleared unanimous committee votes.

In the Nevada Public Radio interview, Reid also pointed to Republican obstruction of Richard Cordray's nomination to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

“We have not been able to confirm a person for that job. They refuse to allow us to bring that up, and -- and he was recess-appointed. Now, we have the Republican-dominated D.C. Court of Appeals who have said, 'look, the president can’t even do recess appointments now,'” Reid told NPR in January of Cordray's nomination. “So, we’re left with few alternatives, and we’re going to have to move forward and do something to change that.”"

Washington (CNN) - Amid new Republican offers to reopen the government and raise the debt limit in exchange for discussing cutting entitlements like Medicare and Social Security, President Barack Obama thanked the House Democratic caucus in a meeting at the White House, praising his legislative backers for holding firm against GOP demands to piecemeal funding for the government.

Obama signals more ‘give’ on idea of short-term debt deal

In a statement characterizing the meeting, the White House said Obama and House Democrats ""reaffirmed their shared belief that we cannot let one faction of the Republicans in the House demand a ransom for doing its job and paying the bills we have already incurred.""

The White House read out of the meeting portrayed a president solely focused on ""fighting for working families"" and gave no indication that Obama intends to cave to Republican demands, which have now evolved from ""defunding"" the president's signature health care law to slashing, in their minds, the true drivers of America's swelling debt.

Up to speed

Obamacare out, entitlements in: Republicans seem to be shifting the shutdown/debt ceiling battle line from an argument over Obamacare to one over entitlements.

After spending the first week of the shutdown trying to tie anything that would fund the government and end the impasse to President Barack Obama's signature health care law, the word ""Obamacare"" hasn't come up as much in recent days.



GOP dropping Obamacare in shutdown debate?

Republicans are saying they would be willing to talk about raising the nation’s borrowing authority so long as it includes a discussion on cutting entitlements, which they say are at the core of the country's debt problem.

At a news conference on Monday, Obama indicated Republicans could essentially set the agenda for budget negotiations, but only if Congress agrees first to a short-term spending plan to fund the government and raise the debt ceiling.

Four ways for Obama to lead U.S. out of crisis

Meanwhile, both the Senate and the House are moving forward without regard to the other. The House will vote to create a negotiating committee and on a bill to ensure “essential” federal workers don’t miss a paycheck. The Senate is expected to reject that and will instead debate a proposal to raise the debt ceiling, which is expected to go nowhere in the House.

Meet the new face of the House gym

In an interview on the Bill Press Show (and gleefully pointed out by a conservative group), Rep. Bruce Braley, D-Iowa, defends keeping the House gym open because it is where members can actually speak to each other. The House gym, he argues, could solve this crisis.

(He might have a point here. Remember what Eric Massa said Rahm Emanuel did in the House gym showers?) (refresher)

But things are getting pretty rough. Braley, who's running for the Senate in 2014, complains there’s no towel service (which we pointed out on Tuesday), but then he says, “We’re doin’ our own laundry down there.”

Finally, he says members pay $260 per year to belong to the gym. Quick back of-the-envelope math suggests members of Congress pay something less than $22 per month to belong to the gym that usually includes towel service and has a heated pool and whatnot.

Find a YMCA or church gym that’s that cheap.

Paul Ryan emerges

Remember Rep. Paul Ryan? The Republican budget guru who was on the losing ticket in the 2012 election? Right, him. Well, he’s still a member of Congress and still sits at the top of the Budget Committee. The budget wonk at the center of budget and spending battles in previous years broke his months-long silence Wednesday morning. In an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, he took a measured tone, saying “both sides should agree to common-sense reforms of the country’s entitlement programs.”

Missing from his piece? The word ""Obamacare.""

Any Cruz is good news for Democrats

That’s a different tact than what many of his tea party-aligned colleagues want, which is the dismantling of the health care law. And Sen. Ted Cruz’s speechwriter noticed the omission.

There is one big word missing from this op-ed. It's start with an O and ends with BAMACARE http://t.co/r1cYgjWEL5 — Amanda Carpenter (@amandacarpenter) October 9, 2013

Biden sidelined

Remember Vice President Joe Biden? The 2012 Democratic vice presidential candidate who sat on the winning ticket? The guy who negotiated the last fiscal stalemates? Well, he’s still the vice president. But his silence is deafening.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is making sure Biden remains silent, CNN’s Gloria Borger reported. He’s made that point very clear, both inside and outside of the White House. As one administration official put it, “Reid is convinced he needs to stand his ground.”

The Numbers

159: The Dow’s dip on Tuesday; it rose 24 points Wednesday with the expected nomination of Janet Yellen to be chair of the Federal Reserve

.355: The interest rate of Treasury bill sold at auction Tuesday

300: The percentage increase of the rate of Treasury bills a week prior

2,000: Number of workers stranded at the Grand Canyon

27,000: Number of furloughed workers collecting unemployment insurance in the D.C. area

D.C. crisis could jump-start the case for reform

Time of Need

On Tuesday, we reported that the $100,000 government benefit to assist each family with burial and reclaiming the body is going unpaid because of the shutdown. Obama promised prompt action to pay benefits to survivors of military men and women killed in action.

On Wednesday, White House spokesman Jay Carney said the president was ""disturbed"" to find out that it was not being paid and has directed the Pentagon and other officials to figure out a way to address the problem. Obama expects it ""to be fixed today,"" Carney said.

Recipients in North Carolina who have not yet picked up their food stamps for October are out of luck. The state announced that it doesn’t have the money to provide the 20% of benefactors of the Women, Infants and Children food program who have yet to collect this month’s supplement, according to the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services.

Time of do-with-what-you-have

CIA agents responsible for undercover work, counterintelligence and intelligence gathering are being called back to work because of the “threat to the safety of human life.” Director John Brennan wrote in a memo to CIA employees: “This does not mean that we can recall all of our employees. We only have the ability to recall workers involved directly in our core missions.”

A small business that fights wildfires in the western United States has laid off a dozen workers since the shutdown. With 80% of its business coming from government contracts, Mark Masters, owner of Chloeta Fire, said he lost tens of thousands of dollars in the last week.

USA TODAY

The library will preserve the president%27s books%2C manuscripts%2C historical documents

The founders raised %24106.4M for construction and programming

The library opens Sept. 27

An earlier version of this story misidentified Fred W. Smith as the founder of FedEx.

It took awhile, but the nation's first president finally has a presidential library.

""No president in American history deserves the honor of a presidential library more than our first chief executive -- nor is there a better story to tell,"" says Ann Bookout of the Mount Vernon Ladies' Association, which owns and operates the Washington estate outside Washington, D.C., in Virginia.

The association worked to build the library, called the Fred W. Smith National Library for the Study of George Washington.

The $106.4 million cost was raised in private funds from 7,000 donors, including $38 million from the Donald W. Reynolds Foundation. Under its chairman, former Las Vegas Review-Journal executive Fred W. Smith, the foundation has sponsored several projects related to George Washington.

The 45,000-square-foot library is scheduled to open Sept. 27 next to the Washington home on the Mount Vernon estate.

It will have dozens of rare artifacts that belonged to the first president, including his handwritten notes about books like A New System of Husbandry, and thousands of books, manuscripts and electronic materials about Washington.

The George Washington library is not part of the presidential library system, which is a network of 13 libraries run by the National Archives to house papers and other important materials of every president since Herbert Hoover.

""There is a national belief among ordinary citizens that having a library for the benefit of George Washington is an important thing,"" Curt Viebranz, president of the Mount Vernon Ladies' Association, said at a news conference Thursday.

The three-level structure includes a general library with thousands of books, journals, audio-visual materials and other files on Washington and his work. Within the building are three vaults of rare volumes, 105 of which belonged to Washington, a reading room for manuscripts, conference rooms and a broadcast studio. There is a residence for visiting scholars.

Viebranz says the library is the culmination of a more than 150-year effort to restore Washington's personal library collection and preserve his materials. It is also meant to promote discussion about Washington's leadership and character.

""While there have been tens of thousands of books published about Washington and lots of research to be done about him, there are still new things to learn,"" he says.

Among items in the library will be Washington's notes from the Compend of Husbandry, his copy of The Beauties of Swift: or, the Favorite Offspring of Wit & Genius by 18th-century satirist Jonathan Swift, and a farm report by his nephew, George A. Washington, from August 1790.

In a letter to his friend James McHenry, Washington wrote on April 3, 1797, that he needed a place to store his documents: ""I have not houses to build, except one, which I must erect for the accommodation and security of my military, civil and private papers, which are voluminous and may be interesting.""

Decades later, Washington's vision seemed like a lost cause. In 1848 the Boston Athenaeum, a research library, purchased most of what remained of Washington's books. The Mount Vernon Ladies' Association was established five years later to preserve the president's estate and re-create his personal reading collection.

Viebranz says the library is a collaboration of scholars, colleges, corporations and individual donors from all walks of life.

""I have a regular dialogue with ordinary Americans who send me letters, who basically mentioned the importance of the founding era,"" he says. ""Those folks will dig into their pockets and give us $1, $5, $25.""

Mount Vernon plans an exhibit to open with the presidential library. ""Take Note! Washington the Reader"" will display books, letters and notes.

Curator Susan Schoelwer says the documents aim to show not just the books but how Washington read and what he thought.

""The exhibit really is trying to get inside Washington's head,"" she says. ""There's a sort of mythology out there that he wasn't a reader, but when you begin looking at his books they do cover a wide range of topics.""

The exhibits, Viebranz says, will not only preserve Washington's documents and books but will also give people insight into his character. People will have an opportunity to learn ""what was his seminal role at the founding of the republic, which is a lesson that every American should know."""

In a heated 129-page decision, Judge Kurt D. Englehardt of Federal District Court here declared that federal prosecutors had created a “prejudicial, poisonous atmosphere” in making anonymous online comments before and during the trial at nola.com, the Web site of The Times-Picayune, and ordered a new trial for all five officers.

The decision represented the collapse, for now, of a case that was seen as symbolizing both the profound breakdown of law and order after the hurricane and a deep rot within the city’s police department that dated back well before the storm.

While a scandal over anonymous online commenting had already cut short the federal careers of two local prosecutors and the United States attorney himself, Tuesday’s decision identified another, previously unknown commenter: a veteran lawyer in the Department of Justice in Washington who had a role in preparing the case for trial."

(CNN) – There's a new Obama in town.

Sunny – a female Portuguese Water Dog – is joining Bo as “first pet,” the White House announced Monday.



Photos showed the all-black animal roaming the White House North Lawn with what appeared to be a pink flamingo dog toy.

Bo, a male of the same breed, came to the White House shortly after the Obamas first arrived at the White House in 2009. The coats of Portuguese Water Dogs are hypoallergenic, meaning Sunny and Bo won't affect first daughter Malia's canine allergies.

In a post on the White House's website, Sunny is described as ""full of energy and very affectionate,"" whose name was chosen to ""fit her cheerful personality.""

She was born in Michigan, and is just over a year old, the White House said.

Sunny’s coat is completely black - unlike Bo, who has black and white “tuxedo” markings on his chest and feet.

The Obamas made a donation to the Washington Humane Society in honor of their newest pet, the White House said.

Bo first arrived at the White House in April 2009, after months of speculation about which type of dog the Obamas would bring into the executive mansion. Obama made a campaign promise to his daughters that if he was elected president, they would get a new pet.

While the president originally expressed a desire to adopt a shelter dog, Bo eventually won out for his non-allergenic coat. He came from a breeder that was also favored by the late Sen. Ted Kennedy.

The White House wasn’t Bo’s first home – he didn't fit in well with his first owners and was returned to the breeder. When Kennedy learned the puppy was available, he arranged to offer him to the Obamas.

Bo spent a month with Kennedy's trainer before coming to the White House. His name - which happens to be the president's initials - was explained by the first family as homage to the first lady's father, who went by the nickname Diddley.

Since arriving more than four years ago, Bo has appeared countless times with the Obamas, including in White House videos and photos. He donned bunny ears for a spot promoting the annual White House Easter Egg Roll this spring.

In their blog post Monday, the White House predicted a similar regimen for Sunny.

“We suspect Sunny will follow in Bo's footsteps and keep the President company in the Oval Office, go for walks with the First Family after their 6:30 family dinner and even ’jump up on the First Ladys lap from time to time!” the White House wrote."
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/21/us/politics/president-obama-news-conference.html,2013-12-21 00:00:00,['Jackie Calmes'],"Weary Obama at Break, Hoping for a Breakthrough","Mr. Obama, from his opening remarks, stressed the economy’s signs of growth, and he said that building on such progress is “going to be where I focus all of my efforts in the year ahead.” But while he could cite specifics about improving economic indicators on employment, growth and deficits, he did not give details about his agenda, even as he said that “2014 needs to be a year of action.”

The impression conveyed was of a president as manager, one without much of an agenda or the political wherewithal for new initiatives that could make it through a Congress where Republicans are more determined than ever to thwart him before next year’s midterm elections. He ends the first year of his second term — typically the best chance for policy achievements before lame-duck status sets in — with his approval ratings having hit a record low and many Democrats disillusioned by the controversies over the health insurance law and disclosures about widespread intelligence surveillance of phone records.

From the news conference’s first question — “Has this been the worst year of your presidency?” — Mr. Obama offered a sobering review of a year that had begun, after his decisive re-election, with the expansive language, high hopes and summons to political unity contained in his second Inaugural Address. “For now decisions are upon us,” he said in wrapping up that speech, “and we cannot afford delay.”

Eleven months later, Mr. Obama was prepared as reporters drilled him on the disappointments he has suffered since that January celebration. He laughed at that first question, and said that reporters had chronicled “at least 15 near-death experiences” during his tenure. He maintained a game face, if a haggard one, as he acknowledged the frustrations and failures on immigration, budget policy, gun violence and health care that were part of his second-term agenda — one that, while ambitious, was not nearly as sweeping as his first."

Pentagon may fold historic newspaper,"Stars and Stripes — the venerable military publication that has chronicled the heroism of America's fighting men and women since the Civil War — could be on the budget-strapped Pentagon's chopping block.

The Department of Defense, which subsidizes the newspaper to the tune of $7.4 million per year, is considering a range of spending cuts that could also affect the Pentagon Channel and some programming at the American Forces Network. But word that it could shutter a proud paper read by generations of soldiers left at least one former military man disappointed.

[pullquote]

""I think it would be a terrible mistake, I really do,"" Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., told the newspaper. ""The men and women who are serving get a lot of their information this way. It’s a great conduit to spread information to the men and women who are serving all over the world.”

Stars and Stripes, which has been published continuously since World War II, currently produces its print edition Monday through Thursday, with a special weekend edition on Friday for Europe and the Pacific. It also publishes a separate Mideast edition Friday through Sunday. Roughly 200,000 people read the print edition daily, according to its website.

More On This...

Officials from the Pentagon's Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation Office told the newspaper that the entire Department of Defense is now being scrutinized as part of an exhaustive spending review ordered by Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel. Ironically, it was the paper itself which broke the news when officials said its presses could be stopped.

“In this budget environment, we’re looking at everything,” Navy Cmdr. Bill Urban, a spokesman for the cost assessment office, told Stars and Stripes.

Max Lederer, publisher of Stars and Stripes, said budget officials have made unprecedented requests for information, including hypothetical cuts, without being told why the review was under way.

“When you get asked questions in a vacuum, you get concerned,” Lederer told the newspaper, which mains editorial independence under federal law and has a civilian ombudsman who answers to Congress.

While the newspaper is subsidized, most of its budget comes from advertising, newspaper sales and other staff-generated revenue.

The first version of the newspaper was produced during the Civil War in 1861 by Union soldiers who used the facilities of a captured newspaper plant in Bloomfield, Mo., where they ran off a one-page paper. That publication would only appear four times, but the Stars and Stripes moniker would later be revived in World War I, appearing in Paris on Feb. 8, 1918. The weekly was produced at the time by an all-military staff to serve the American Expeditionary Force under General of the Armies John J. “Black Jack” Pershing and stopped printing after the war ended.

During World War II, Stars and Stripes published as many as 32 distinct editions, with up to 24 pages per issue. At one point, it had 25 publishing locations in Europe, North Africa, the Middle East and the Pacific. The newspaper has since been published continuously since the last world war, from 1942 in Europe and 1945 in the Pacific.

Most recently, in fiscal year 2013, the newspaper has expanded its online presence, serving 9.13 million unique visitors and garnering 35.8 million page views on stripes.com."
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/28/opinion/not-one-more.html,2013-10-28 00:00:00,['The Editorial Board'],‘Not One More’ - The New York Times,"President Obama urged Congress on Thursday to revive immigration reform, which is not dead but not moving, either. He was talking mostly to House Republicans, though he also urged business, labor and religious groups to “keep putting the pressure on all of us to get this done.”

It’s good that Mr. Obama said “us.” It acknowledges his own role in this continuing disaster.

Much of the responsibility to fix what Mr. Obama calls the “broken immigration system” lies within his own administration. He can’t rewrite immigration laws, but he can control how well — or disastrously — they are enforced. He can begin by undoing the damage done by his Homeland Security Department. Mr. Obama has just nominated Jeh Johnson, a former Defense Department general counsel, to replace homeland security secretary Janet Napolitano, who resigned in July. It’s the perfect opportunity for a fresh start. Here is what it might look like:

STOP NEEDLESS DEPORTATIONS The Obama administration has kept up a frantic pace of 400,000 deportations a year, and is closing in on two million. Those numbers are driven by politics, not public safety. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has wide discretion to determine whom it detains and deports. It can retool all its policies to make noncriminals and minor offenders — the people most likely to benefit from the reform now stalled in Congress — the lowest priority for deportation.

The deportation surge is fed by programs like Secure Communities, which does immigration checks on everyone arrested by local and state law enforcement, and Operation Streamline, in which border crossers in the Southwest are prosecuted en masse, with little access to legal representation. Mr. Obama turned the dragnet on, and can turn it off. In marches and vigils across the country, protesters have made one plea on deportations to Mr. Obama: “Not one more.” He should heed it.

ACKNOWLEDGE THE CRISIS As he makes the case for immigration reform, Mr. Obama often mentions the economic consequences of failure — jobs unfilled, crops unpicked, investments not made and taxes not collected. He would do well to highlight the human costs of enforcement without reform, in separating families, and violating the civil and labor rights of workers."
