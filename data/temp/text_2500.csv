As with any State of the Union address, President Barack Obama this year had several audiences and there were multiple aims for the White House: To show that he understands the economy is still struggling and that he will do more to help the unemployed find jobs, and to portray a different side of himself than what was seen on Inauguration Day – one willing to reach out to the other party.

While the president did offer some new proposals – including increasing the minimum wage and guaranteeing preschool – many of the ideas he pushed were repeating what he had previously offered but went nowhere in divided Washington. And we saw a president trying to expand the use of executive power to help push his agenda.

State of the Union brings out more of the ‘same old, same old’

Here are five things we learned Tuesday night:

1. It’s still the economy, stupid

It very well could have been a campaign speech given last year – the president talking about the need for a balanced approach to deficit reduction, at least four references to protecting the middle class, the need to reignite “the true engine of America’s economic growth.”

With the recovery still weak, unemployment at 7.9% and the nation’s growth rate shrinking the last three months of 2012, the president and his team know much of his legacy may be dependent on helping reignite the economy. The president pushed for 15 manufacturing hubs to help spur high tech job growth.

With $85 billion in automatic across-the-board spending cuts set to take effect on March 1, Obama pushed for a replacement of them because some economists warn they could lead to a recession. However, he did not give any ground on what he would accept as an alternative – setting up the next major fiscal fight with Republicans.

2. Mr. Bipartisan?

Facing hundreds of members of the opposing party, Obama took a decidedly different approach than he did in his aggressive inaugural address.

“They do expect us to put the nation’s interests before party. They do expect us to forge reasonable compromise where we can. For they know that America moves forward only when we do so together and that the responsibility of improving this union remains the task of us all,” the president said early on in the address.

He even praised some Republicans – he pointed to how Sen. John McCain, his 2008 opponent, worked with then-Sen. Joe Lieberman, a Democrat turned Independent, on climate change. He mentioned his 2012 opponent, Mitt Romney, and said we should try his idea of tying the minimum wage to the cost of living.

GOP’s Rubio rips Obama, says his plans will hurt middle class

While he talked about how chances are good for bipartisan approaches on tax and immigration reform, Republicans can be expected to say they haven’t seen a different approach so far from the president on many key issues: He wants more tax revenues and more government spending on his priorities, which are non-starters among Republicans.

Fifty-three percent of those surveyed in a CNN/ORC instant poll of speech-watchers said they did not believe the address would lead to bipartisan cooperation while 39% said they thought it would.

3. Show me the money

Proposals he floated would make high-quality preschool available to every child, provide tax credits for businesses to hire and invest, promote more scientific research and development, further shift cars and trucks away from gasoline, and invest in infrastructure. “Nothing I’m proposing tonight should increase our deficit by a single dime.” he said. “It’s not a bigger government we need, but a smarter government that sets priorities and invests in broad-based growth.”

But White House officials refuse to put a price tag on the programs – or to reveal how, in fact, they would be paid for. They promised more details when the White House’s budget proposal is released in a few weeks.

4. If they won’t, I will

The president demonstrated clearly how he plans to aggressively use executive actions to push policy if Congress thwarts him and he announced action on climate change and cybersecurity.

“If Congress won’t act soon to protect future generations, I will,” he said. “I will direct my Cabinet to come up with executive actions we can take, now and in the future, to reduce pollution, prepare our communities for the consequences of climate change, and speed the transition to more sustainable sources of energy.”

After efforts dealing with cybersecurity failed to pass Congress, the president signed an executive order to increase information-sharing and to help the private sector develop standards. These moves came after the president last month approved 23 executive actions dealing with gun control.

Obama also used the speech to make his base happy by emphasizing such liberal priorities as climate change and equal treatment and benefits for gay Americans as well as announcing a bipartisan commission to improve the voting system and pushing for a hike in the minimum wage.

5. Even presidents can’t control the news

While the White House tried to build up suspense around what the president would say, as soon as news broke Tuesday afternoon that accused cop-killer Christopher Dorner was believed to be holed up in a cabin in the California mountains, much of the media immediately switched gears.

What would have been hours of coverage of what was expected from the speech, what Obama’s message might be and discussion of his agenda did not happen.

Would this be another split-screen State of the Union similar to when networks flashed news of the verdict in O.J. Simpson’s civil trial during Bill Clinton’s 1997 address?

That did not happen this time but as soon as Obama wrapped up most news organizations quickly updated viewers on the Dorner story.

But the president might have gotten an unintended benefit from the other story of the day – interest in Dorner might have helped boost the audience for the address.

USA TODAY





A deadly shooting near the U.S. Capitol on Thursday jolted lawmakers in Congress and temporarily diverted their attention away from the federal government shutdown. What you need to know as the shutdown enters Day 4 on Friday, Oct. 4.

Both sides grope for solutions to budget, debt ceiling

The fight between President Obama, Democrats and Republicans is now a two-pronged fiscal confrontation to avoid a potential default after Oct. 17 on the nation's $16.7 trillion debt. What began for congressional Republicans as an effort to gut the health care law is now bigger. House Republicans are pursuing a broader strategy that would go beyond reopening the government and putting 800,000 furloughed workers back on the job. They'd also like to remove the prospect of default and achieve even bigger changes to reduce the debt.

Battered Dow Jones average tumbles below 15,000

It's a sign that investors are getting increasingly worried about the budget impasse in Washington. Stocks tumbled Thursday sending the Dow Jones Industrial average back below 15,000. Wall Street fears that lawmakers are so far apart that they won't agree to raise the nation's borrowing limit later this month, which would raise the risk of the nation defaulting on its debts for the first time in history. Stocks have now fallen eight of the last 10 days, as investors anticipated a budget deal would not be reached by Oct. 1, the start of the new fiscal year.

Sex assault investigations halted on college campuses

The shutdown's impact has reached college campuses. Investigations of universities suspected of mishandling sexual violence cases are being put on hold by the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights, according to a Huffington Post report. These include ongoing cases at the University of Virginia and the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. The office won't be conducting a follow-up visit at Yale, which agreed in 2012 to change the way it handles sexual misconduct cases.

Rebels refuse to heed federal shutdown call

The World War II veterans who are ignoring barricades around shuttered monuments aren't the only rebels in the government shutdown. District of Columbia Mayor Vincent Gray, with his City Council's blessing, declared each of the city's 32,000 employees essential so they could continue to pick up trash and perform other services. The nation's capital city is affected because Congress has the last word on how the District spends its money. In Wisconsin, where some state parks are partially funded by the National Park Service, the state's Department of Natural Resources rejected a federal demand that those parks be closed.

Shutdown provides a civics lesson for students

The government shutdown has become a teachable moment for youngsters, from moms who teach their kids that actions have consequences to civics classes that drive home a point about democracy at work. At Niles North High School in Skokie, Ill., some students there blamed Republicans who are allies of the Tea Party for the shutdown. Others placed blame on President Obama and both houses of Congress. Karen Carey in Lyndonville, Vt., wishes Congress understood the lesson that she's teaching her children. ""I want them to understand that if you take the last juice box, and there is a kid behind you allergic to milk, there is a consequence to what you did,"" she said.

Bonus: President Obama canceled the rest of his Asia trip because of the shutdown, the White House announced late Thursday. He was scheduled to go to Indonesia for the Asia-Pacific Economic Conference (APEC) and then to Brunei for the East Asia summit. Earlier in the week, Obama canceled visits to Malaysia and the Philippines that were to take place after the two meetings.

Editor’s Note: Ira Shapiro is the author of “The Last Great Senate: Courage and Statesmanship in Times of Crisis” (PublicAffairs). He was a former Senate staffer and served in the Clinton administration as a trade official.

The new year has hardly set in and a consensus has formed that the polarization and dysfunction gripping Washington will inevitably continue. A headline in Politico summed it up well: “New Congress with Same Old Problems.” Fareed Zakaria wrote about “America’s political failure” and the specter of our political system “seizing up.” Ezra Klein went one step further, commenting that “while the 112th Congress was surely one of the most broken and incompetent in our history, the worst is probably yet to come.”

Everyone can describe the factors that produced America’s vitriolic political culture. We are well aware of the various possible remedies, like passing a constitutional amendment on campaign finance, embracing open primaries, establishing commissions to prevent gerrymandered districts, or setting up a requirement of universal voting. But these ideas are many years away if attainable at all.

There is only one prospect for real change in our national politics. America urgently needs a rejuvenated Senate, which has to return to being, as Walter Mondale once described it: “the nation’s mediator.” The good news is that could actually happen.

Opinion: GOP holding U.S. economy hostage on debt

The 2012 Senate elections were a landslide for the Democrats, who won 25 out of 33 elections, gaining blue states and red states, sweeping nine of the 10 most hotly contested elections and bringing in a record 20 female senators.

The Senate results can be read as a repudiation of extremism and obstructionism, strengthening the hand of Senate Democrats while freeing the moderate and conservative Senate Republicans from the death grip of blind loyalty to Grover Norquist, the NRA or the tea party. Republican insiders have already indicated their interest in nominating candidates who might win general elections rather than extreme candidates destined to be defeated.

As America’s economic potential remains enviable, our political dysfunction threatens to undermine it. The fiscal cliff was barely averted, but the battles over our economic future will recommence almost immediately. The nation is still stunned by the horrific killings in Newtown and shaken by the implications of Hurricane Sandy.

The country yearns for responsible adult leadership. President Obama will provide it, but he needs the cooperation and engagement of Congress, which the Republican House has proven it cannot offer. The Senate is the only realistic partner to the president in seeking constructive solutions to the nation’s challenges on guns, climate change and immigration.

Most importantly, no one should underestimate the commitment of the senators to our country, and the anger and frustration they share about the Senate.

Across the political spectrum, from liberals like Barbara Mikulski, D-Maryland, to conservatives like Jeff Sessions, R-Alabama, there is a demand for “regular order” – legislation that results from committee consideration, vigorous debate and the opportunity to offer amendments and to reach principled compromises. The Senate has a handful of members deeply committed to absolute obstruction, but the overwhelming majority of its members sought the office for the opportunity to address the country’s challenges in a serious way. They know what the Senate is supposed to be, they hate what it has become and now they have the chance to rebuild it.

Many Americans doubt that the current crop of senators measures up to the stalwarts of the past. No one admires the great senators of the 1960s and 1970s more than I do. But the Senate that convened in the first week of January combines many capable veteran legislators, promising young senators and exciting new arrivals. They can change the status quo.

For example, even in the midst of gridlock in 2012, Democrat Barbara Boxer of California and Republican Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma reached agreement on a major transportation bill, and Democrat Tom Harkin of Iowa and Republican Mike Enzi of Wyoming forged compromises to produce a far-reaching food safety legislation.

Our senators would do well to take a page from history. In “The Passage of Power,” his latest volume on LBJ, Robert Caro reminds us that in 1963, exactly 50 years ago, the Senate was paralyzed. It was unable to move on even the tax cut proposed by President Kennedy. But the television coverage of fire hoses and police dogs being turned on peaceful civil rights demonstrators, which changed the nation’s consciousness, followed by the trauma of President Kennedy’s assassination, and Lyndon Johnson’s extraordinary leadership, transformed the Senate. Congress produced the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and a number of great legislative accomplishments. It doesn’t take much time, or that many people, to change the Senate.

So much depends on the quality of leadership. We remember the profound impact of Lyndon Johnson, Mike Mansfield, Everett Dirksen and Howard Baker on the Senate. The current Senate leaders, Harry Reid and Mitch McConnell, did not create the hyperpartisan Senate, but it got undeniably worse on their watch. Now, their places in history are on the line. They can be judged failures and quickly forgotten, or they can be remembered as the leaders who played a crucial role in restoring the Senate to its special place in our country. I wouldn’t bet against them making the right choice.

Reid has already committed to spearheading needed reforms to the Senate rules, and appears to have wisely decided against ramming through rules changes by a majority vote. McConnell already played an essential role in the last-minute compromise that averted the fiscal cliff, and in doing so, produced an 89-8 Senate vote for the compromise. He remains the key: Will he use his considerable savvy to obstruct, as he did for most of the last four years, or to reach the hard, principled compromises that major legislative accomplishments demand?

Pessimistic observers of our political scene believe that ultimately the Senate can only mirror our deep national divisions. I think this view oversimplifies the complex relationship between voters and their elected representatives.

The senators are supposed to rise above our divisions to find common ground, and by the act of doing so, contribute to rebuilding public confidence and healing a fractured nation. If the Senate returns to being “the nation’s mediator,” the results of its work can pass the Republican House the way the “fiscal cliff” deal did – by a decisive vote among Democrats, coupled with a minority of the Republicans.

The men and women in today’s Senate have a rare privilege and a special opportunity. They are United States senators. They walk where the greats once walked, and it’s time they make us proud again.

Bloomberg on Tuesday challenged his would-be successors to take a tough line in negotiations with the city’s unions, while worrying aloud that whoever is elected will be too beholden to labor.

“We can’t wake up tomorrow morning — the day after the election — and find that some candidate has made a back-room deal with one of the unions that sets the pattern for all the other unions that will eventually lead to stopping the growth in this city,” Mr. Bloomberg said, departing from his prepared remarks at the end of a speech in Brooklyn on the city’s economy and fiscal situation.

“We cannot afford certain things,” he continued. “It’s tough to say no. It’s particularly tough to say no when nobody wants anybody to get hurt. But the bottom line: this is the taxpayers’ money, and this is our future.”

Mr. Bloomberg’s speech, delivered at a former Pfizer manufacturing plant that is now home to some two dozen small companies, producing everything from 3D printers to kimchi, was in part an attempt to burnish his record of fiscal stewardship, which is hotly debated. He argued that he has determinedly tried to reform pensions and health care but has been stymied by unions."

Perez has led the Justice Department%27s Civil Rights Division since 2009

He previously served as Maryland%27s labor secretary

Perez played a leading role in Justice%27s decision to challenge voter ID laws

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama is poised to select Justice Department official Thomas Perez to be the next labor secretary, according to two people familiar with the deliberation process.

Perez' nomination to the Labor Department could come as early as Monday, the people familiar with the process said Saturday. They spoke on condition of anonymity because the official announcement has not yet been made. White House spokesman Matt Lehrich declined to comment.

Perez, 51, has led the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division since 2009 and previously served as Maryland's labor secretary. He is expected to have solid support from organized labor and the Hispanic community, which is eager to have Hispanic representation in Obama's cabinet.

Perez was the first Latino elected to the Montgomery County Council in Maryland, where he served from 2002 to 2006. If confirmed, he would replace Hilda Solis, who resigned in January to return to her native California.

Perez would come to the Labor Department as Obama pushes a major immigration overhaul, which could include changes in how employers hire guest workers. Labor Department officials have also taken a prominent role in supporting Obama's effort to raise the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $9 an hour.

At the Justice Department, Perez has played a leading role in the agency's decision to challenge voter ID laws in Texas and South Carolina that could restrict minority voting rights. A federal court later struck down the Texas law and delayed implementation of the law in South Carolina until after the 2012 election.

Perez was easily confirmed by the Senate for his Justice Department post, but since then, some GOP lawmakers have criticized his role in persuading the city of St. Paul, Minn., to withdraw a lending discrimination lawsuit from the Supreme Court. In exchange, the Justice Department declined to join two whistle-blower lawsuits against St. Paul that could have returned millions in damages to the federal government.

The St. Paul case had challenged the use of statistics to prove race discrimination under the 1968 Fair Housing Act, and Justice Department officials were concerned the court could strike down the practice.

A letter last year from four Republican lawmakers, including Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Rep. Darrell Issa of California, criticized Perez for a ""quid pro quo arrangement"" that potentially cost taxpayers more than $180 million."
http://news.yahoo.com/house-approves-bill-preventing-shutdown-march-27-191449292--finance.html,,[],House approves bill preventing shutdown March 27,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Republican-controlled House approved legislation Wednesday to prevent a government shutdown on March 27 and blunt the impact of newly imposed spending cuts on the Defense Department.

The 267-151 vote sent the measure to the Senate, where Democrats hope to give additional Cabinet agencies similar flexibility in implementing their shares of the $85 billion in spending cuts required to take effect by the end of the budget year.

Republicans said the measure was essential to keep the government operating smoothly after current funding expires on March 27.

Democrats who opposed the measure protested the embedded spending cuts and criticized Republicans for refusing to replace some of them with tax loophole closings.

Ironically, the measure underscored joint efforts by the Obama administration and congressional Republicans to ease the impact of short-term spending cuts that kicked in with dire White House warnings a few days ago. At the same time, both are eager to pocket the full savings for deficit reduction as they pivot to a new clash over Medicare next week, when House Republicans and Senate Democrats are expected to unveil rival budgets.

The overall size of the cuts in the no-shutdown spending bill remains in place: $85 billion in reductions through the end of the budget year on Sept. 30, half from defense and half from domestic programs as diverse as education, parks and payments to doctors and hospitals treating Medicare patients.

But legislation drafted by House Republicans to prevent a government shutdown on March 27 also gives the Pentagon and the Veterans Affairs Department flexibility to allocate cuts that no agency currently has.

Senate Democrats seem likely to agree to the flexibility if it can be expanded to include other agencies, according to several officials who described closed-door talks that also involved the White House. Among the candidates are the departments of Homeland Security, Transportation, Justice and State. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity, saying they were not authorized to disclose details.

Story continues

The move marks a reversal for President Barack Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., both of whom spoke dismissively in recent days of Republican plans for flexibility in administering the cuts.

""The problem is when you're cutting $85 billion in seven months, which represents over a 10 percent cut in the defense budget in seven months, there's no smart way to do that,"" the president said Feb. 26 in Newport News, Va.

""You don't want to have to choose between, Let's see, do I close funding for the disabled kid or the poor kid? Do I close this Navy shipyard or some other one?""

Asked last week whether he would agree to flexibility, Reid said: ""No, why would I? I don't have a reason to do so.""

Pentagon officials embraced flexibility even before the measure came to a vote in the House.

The difference for the Navy is ""almost night and day,"" the service's top uniformed officer told Congress on Tuesday. With flexibility, said Adm. Jonathan Greenert, the chief of naval operations, work could proceed on the overhaul of two aircraft carriers and construction on a third, all projects that the Pentagon had said would be curtailed without any changes.

The Pentagon did not immediately say whether it also would be able to order the USS Harry S. Truman to the Persian Gulf region, a mission it announced earlier would fall victim to the cuts.

Whatever the eventual impact of the spending cuts, the long-running struggle between the parties over deficits soon will shift to rival budgets under preparation by House Republicans and Senate Democrats.

Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., chairman of the House Budget Committee, told reporters his plan would make relatively modest changes compared with last year's blueprint, yet project an end to federal deficits in a decade's time. The plan leaves in place $600 billion in higher taxes on the wealthy that Congress approved on New Year's Day over the objection of many rank and file Republicans.

Republican officials said had disclosed on Tuesday that Ryan had decided against accelerating plans for a highly controversial overhaul of Medicare, the program that provides health care for people aged 65 and older. Several members of the rank and file have said in recent days Ryan was considering a budget that would implement far-reaching changes beginning in less than a decade.

The Republican proposal would give future retirees a choice between the existing program and one that provides beneficiaries a voucher for their care. In its previous forms, it also capped the overall cost of the program.

Republicans say their approach would help ensure the survival of Medicare for future retirees.

Democrats say it would end the guarantee of health care coverage for seniors that has existed since the 1960s by imposing steadily higher costs on beneficiaries.

Ryan's suggestion to accelerate the overhaul drew objections from some Republicans because it would have meant reversing a pledge the party has made to leave Medicare generally unchanged for anyone currently aged 55 and older.

The switch had few if any supporters at a closed-door leadership meeting earlier in the week, according to Republicans who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the session.

One lawmaker not at the session, Rep. Mike Simpson of Idaho, told reporters on Tuesday there was concern among some Republicans that incumbents and candidates in swing seats could be harmed in the 2014 elections. ""You've told people you'd be doing one thing"" and then changing the pledge, he said.

Democrats are poised to attack Republicans over their plans regardless.

Even before reports first surfaced of a possible change in the Republican timetable, Reid told reporters, ""Republicans plan to make more extreme cuts to Medicare and Medicaid, education, medical research. They are in an untenable position.""

Obama has proposed cuts totaling $400 billion or more to Medicare and other health care benefit programs but has refused to accept the type of change that Republicans seek.

In his State of the Union address last month, the president said he wants to reduce taxpayer subsidies to prescription drug companies, impose higher costs on wealthier seniors and make payments to providers based on ""the quality of care seniors receive"" rather than the number of tests.

""I am open to additional reforms from both parties, so long as they don't violate the guarantee of a secure retirement,"" he said.

(CNN) – Roger Ailes has never been known to keep his opinions to himself.

So perhaps it's no surprise the powerful boss of Fox News Channel revealed candid opinions of top political figures – including President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich – during conversations and meetings that were recorded by his biographer Zev Chafets.



In excerpts of Chafets' upcoming book ""Roger Ailes: Off Camera"" that were published in this month's Vanity Fair, the Fox News president is shown fiercely criticizing Obama, who he calls ""lazy.""

The remark came amid an analysis of CNN contributor and Democratic strategist Hilary Rosen's claims that Ann Romney had ""never worked a day in her life"" (Rosen later apologized.)

""Obama's the one who never worked a day in his life,"" Ailes said in an exchange with his spokesman, according to the excerpt in Vanity Fair. ""He never earned a penny that wasn't public money. How many fund-raisers does he attend every week? How often does he play basketball and golf? I wish I had that kind of time. He's lazy, but the media won't report that.""

When Ailes noticed Chafets' surprised reaction, the television executive added: ""I didn't come up with that. Obama said that, to Barbara Walters.""

He was referring to an interview when the ABC anchor asked Obama for ""the trait you most deplore in yourself.""

""Laziness,"" the president responded, explaining ""There is a deep down, underneath all the work that I do, I think there's a laziness in me. It's probably from, you know, growing up in Hawaii and it's sunny outside, and sitting on the beach.""

Ailes was no less forgiving in his assessment of Obama's deputy Joe Biden. During a meeting with staff discussing vice presidential politics, Ailes remarked, ""I have a soft spot for Joe Biden…I like him. But he's dumb as an ashtray.""

Also on the receiving end of Ailes' blunt appraisal? Newt Gingrich, the former house speaker, who gave up his contributor role at Fox to make a bid for the 2012 GOP presidential nomination.

In the waning days of his presidential campaign, Gingrich was quoted saying ""Fox has been for Romney all the way through,"" adding that he thought CNN's coverage of the GOP primaries was less biased.

""We are more likely to get neutral coverage out of CNN than we are of Fox, and we're more likely to get distortion out of Fox. That's just a fact,"" Gingrich said at an event in Delaware, according to a report from Real Clear Politics.

""He's a sore loser and if he had won he would have been a sore winner,"" Ailes said, according to Chafets' biography.

""Newt's a prick,"" Ailes succinctly concluded.

CNN reached out to the White House and to a representative of Gingrich for reaction to Ailes' comments."

As we predicted before last November’s elections, tax reform will be on the agenda in 2013 – but has its best chances in the states. We are seeing that demonstrated Thursday by Louisiana’s Republican governor, Bobby Jindal.

Jindal unveiled what could be, if approved by the legislature, the boldest, most pro-growth state tax reform in U.S. history. His plan, outlined in Baton Rouge this morning during a joint meeting of the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Committee, calls for the elimination of all state personal and corporate income taxes, as well as the state franchise tax on capital stock. This would be replaced by an increase in the state sales tax rate to 5.88 percent, up from 4 percent. The sales tax would also apply to a broader base of goods and a number of services previously untaxed.

Many governors around the country have proposed rate-reducing tax reform, but Jindal’s plan sets a gold standard for pro-growth reform. His proposal could mean more disposable income for families while increasing the job-creating capacity of employers across the Pelican State.

It would also make Louisiana’s tax code more conducive to economic growth. A recent Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development report ranked taxes according to their negative economic impact. The study concluded that taxes on income and capital, which Jindal’s plan would eliminate, were the most damaging.

Louisiana ranked 32nd on the nonpartisan Tax Foundation’s 2013 State Business Tax Climate Index. If Jindal’s plan is approved and signed into law, the state will jump to No. 4 on that index.

Jindal’s proposal is a model not just for other states but also for lawmakers on Capitol Hill. His plan adheres to the conservative principle that the tax code should not be used to pick winners and losers in the economy. It demonstrates that the purpose of real tax reform is to make the tax code more efficient and competitive – not to raise additional revenue. Jindal’s plan creates a predominantly consumption-based tax system and does so in a way that he estimates will raise the same amount of revenue for the state as current law.

President Barack Obama and congressional Democrats appear to view tax reform as a vehicle for higher taxes. The White House and folks at MSNBC would have one think that House Republicans have become extremists for insisting that tax reform not result in a net tax increase. Yet back in 1986, the last (and, many contend, only) time Washington passed comprehensive tax reform, there was bipartisan consensus that it should be revenue-neutral.

Then-Senator Bill Bradley (D-N.J.) and then-Ways & Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, a Democrat from Chicago, agreed with President Ronald Reagan that reform should clean up the tax code – not be a Trojan horse for higher taxes. This is what Jindal’s proposal would do.

Tax reform is one of the most politically difficult undertakings for lawmakers. It becomes almost impossible, however, when the public perceives it as a covert attempt to raise taxes.

Georgia offers a cautionary tale. Two years ago, state legislators introduced a reform package that would have significantly cut the state income tax – particularly important, since the state is flanked by two states with no income tax – while increasing reliance on sales tax. There was one major problem: The plan as a whole resulted in a multibillion-dollar tax increase. Fellow legislators, and the public, revolted against it.

Though the Georgia plan was reworked so it was no longer a net tax increase, the damage had already been done. In the end, it failed to pass. While some Republicans, including former Florida Governor Jeb Bush and Senator Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), are asking the GOP to repeat this folly at the national level, Jindal is wisely not making this mistake in Louisiana.

The national media and Acela-corridor crowd continue to focus on the bickering Washington, but they can learn what real tax reform looks like by looking to Louisiana.

Boehner said Tuesday it was about time the Senate “gets off their ass” and develop a way around the enormous automatic reductions.

The Ohio Republican reiterated Tuesday that he has no intention of putting forward his own alternative, arguing that the House twice passed proposals last year that would shift the burden of cuts away from Pentagon programs and onto other domestic accounts – including school lunches, food stamps and others.

“We should not have to move a third bill before the Senate gets off their ass and begins to do something,” Boehner said. “The American people know if the president gets more money they’re just going to spend it. The fact is, is that he’s gotten his tax hikes. It’s time to focus on the real problem here in Washington and that is spending.”

QUIZ: How much do you know about sequestration?

It is unclear if Boehner could rally the votes in his chamber to pass an alternative, as the earlier proposals were approved last year with the slimmest margins. Those bills are no longer available as they expired when the new Congress began in January.

Polls show Americans will largely blame Republicans for the cuts coming Friday that may cause disruptions in federal services, but Republicans say the White House is hyping the magnitude of the cuts in a campaign to bend public opinion to its side.

To counter the White House bully pulpit, Republicans are considering offering legislation that would provide the administration even more authority over determining which federal programs get cut – allowing the president to tailor the reductions rather than slashing indiscriminately across the board as required under the law.

The Senate may consider that option this week, and the House could take up the issue as part of another budget bill next week.

But the idea of shifting even more responsibility to the White House is dividing Republicans in Congress, who have been unable to agree on a consistent strategy to fight the cuts because many conservative lawmakers would simply prefer to allow the reductions to happen as a way to stem the flow of red ink.

Some Republicans would like to protect defense and other programs they favor from cuts; others, including more veteran members of the House and Senate, are loathe to cede their constitutionally vested budget powers to the administration.

Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) compared the flexibility proposals to “rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic,” saying last week: “They’re still dealing a body blow to the economy.”

The $85 billion in cuts were designed as a last-ditch strategy to bring both sides to the negotiating table on a broad deficit-reduction plan. But without an agreement, the cuts, also known as the sequester, are poised to take effect. Up to 13% from defense and 9% from other domestic accounts will be cut in the remaining seven months of the fiscal year, vacuuming about 750,000 jobs from the economy. Social Security and the Medicaid health program for poor and elderly Americans are spared, and cuts to Medicare are capped.

Obama traveled to Newport News, Va., on Tuesday to shift attention to the ordinary Americans in that military-heavy enclave who would be hit as the federal government withdraws funds from the economy. Most Americans say in polls they prefer the president’s approach of combining spending cuts with new tax revenue from wealthier Americans and corporations to stem deficits.

Democrats, to be sure, have their own divisions over Obama’s tax hike proposals. Oil state senators, for example, successfully blocked their party from proposing legislation to do away with tax deductions used by the oil and gas industries – long a target of the president.

The Senate is expected to propose Democratic and Republican alternatives this week, but neither are expected to overcome the 60-vote threshold to pass.

One point that both parties largely agree on is that the idea for the sequester originated in the administration, before Congress overwhelmingly approved it in 2011 as part of an earlier budget deal.

http://news.yahoo.com/spending-cuts-unpopular-yet-not-101827897.html,,[],Spending cuts unpopular yet not set to go away,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House said Monday the automatic spending cuts starting to take place across the federal government, with no end in sight, represent an ""empty victory"" for Republicans at odds with the party's priorities.

White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters it's remarkable some Republicans are calling the so-called ""sequester"" a win for the conservative tea party, or because Republicans stood up to the president, because the cuts go against usual GOP goals to increase defense spending and border security. He also said the cuts do nothing to address Republican priorities for long-term deficit reduction or tax reform.

Obama ""hopes that having achieved this empty victory, at least as they see it, the Republicans will understand that their goals are being unmet here,"" Carney told reporters at the White House. ""So not only are Americans suffering from this, regular folks, but their objectives are being unmet and there's an opportunity to change that dynamic.""

The Senate's Republican leader Mitch McConnell on Sunday called those cuts modest and House Speaker John Boehner said he isn't sure they will hurt the economy. White House economic adviser Gene Sperling says the pain isn't that bad — yet.

After months of dire warnings, the deep budget cuts have started taking hold and there's no evidence officials are moving to reverse the $85 billion in reductions.

""This modest reduction of 2.4 percent in spending over the next six months is a little more than the average American experienced just two months ago, when their own pay went down when the payroll tax holiday expired,"" McConnell said.

""I don't know whether it's going to hurt the economy or not,"" Boehner said. ""I don't think anyone quite understands how the sequester is really going to work.""

But Sperling cautioned: ""On Day One, it will not be as harmful as it will be over time.""

Both parties cast blame on the other for the automatic, across-the-board spending cuts but gave little guidance on what to expect in the coming weeks. Republicans and Democrats pledged to retroactively undo the cuts, but signaled no hints as to how that process would start to take shape. Republicans insisted there would be no new taxes and Democrats refused to talk about any bargain without them.

""That's not going to work,"" said Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H. ""If we're going to increase revenue again, it's got to go to the debt with real entitlement reform and real tax reform when you actually lower rates. ... I'm not going to agree to any more tax increases that are going to go to increase more government.""

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said any tax increases were unacceptable.

""I'm not going to do any more small deals. I'm not going to raise taxes to fix sequestration. We don't need to raise taxes to fund the government,"" Graham said.

All of this comes ahead of a new, March 27 deadline to deal with the question of funding the government and a debt-ceiling clash coming in May.

Obama has phoned lawmakers but it isn't clear to what end and the White House would not say whom Obama is calling.

Administration officials planned to criticize the cuts in appearances with those affected by them; Education Secretary Arne Duncan, for instance, planned to appear with school leaders who faced a leaner budget.

""Well, no one can think that that's been a success for the president,"" said Mitt Romney, Obama's unsuccessful rival in November's election. ""He didn't think the sequester would happen. It is happening.""

Obama and the Republicans have been fighting over federal spending since the opposition party regained control of the House of Representatives in the 2010 midterm elections. The budget cuts were designed in 2011 to be so ruthless that both sides would be forced to find a better deal, but they haven't despite two years to find a compromise.

The $85 billion in cuts apply to the remainder of the 2013 fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. But without a deal they will continue slashing government spending by about $1 trillion more over a 10-year period.

Nearly 700 people have been arrested in the “Moral Monday” demonstrations, as they are known. But the bad news keeps on coming from the Legislature, and pretty soon a single day of the week may not be enough to contain the outrage.

In January, after the election of Pat McCrory as governor, Republicans took control of both the executive and legislative branches for the first time since Reconstruction. Since then, state government has become a demolition derby, tearing down years of progress in public education, tax policy, racial equality in the courtroom and access to the ballot.

The cruelest decision by lawmakers went into effect last week: ending federal unemployment benefits for 70,000 residents. Another 100,000 will lose their checks in a few months. Those still receiving benefits will find that they have been cut by a third, to a maximum of $350 weekly from $535, and the length of time they can receive benefits has been slashed from 26 weeks to as few as 12 weeks.

The state has the fifth-highest unemployment rate in the country, and many Republicans insulted workers by blaming their joblessness on generous benefits. In fact, though, North Carolina is the only state that has lost long-term federal benefits, because it did not want to pay back $2.5 billion it owed to Washington for the program. The State Chamber of Commerce argued that cutting weekly benefits would be better than forcing businesses to pay more in taxes to pay off the debt, and lawmakers blindly went along, dropping out of the federal program."

James Hamilton's claim the United States is in a much deeper financial hole than many realize comes as Congress gets ready for another budget battle when lawmakers return in September. Both sides have been digging in on their policy positions over the debt, spending and the country's future fiscal health.

Hamilton believes the government is miscalculating what it owes by leaving out certain unfunded liabilities that include government loan guarantees, deposit insurance, and actions taken by the Federal Reserve as well as the cost of other government trust funds. Factoring in those figures brings the total amount the government owes to a staggering $70 trillion, he says.

Hamilton believes important areas of federal off-balance-sheet commitments include loans for post-high school education, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Reserve System.

“The biggest off-balance-sheet liabilities come from recognition of the fiscal stress that will come in the form of an aging population and rising medical expenditures,” Hamilton says, adding, “It is worth noting that there are many historical episodes in which off-balance sheet liabilities ended up having quite significant on-balance sheet implications.”

For example, he says, fiscal problems stemming from the saving and loans crisis from the 1980s.

“Losses at these institutions ended up dwarfing the capabilities of the now-defunct Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation to honor its promise to guarantee depositors,” he says.

The final on-balance-sheet cost to taxpayers honoring those guarantees came out to $124 billion.

Hamilton isn’t the first economist to say the government understates how much it owes. Claims that the real liability facing the government is $70 trillion date back several years.

David Walker, former U.S. Comptroller and CEO of the Comeback America Initiative, made similar claims in 2012. Walker’s calculations include unfunded Social Security, Medicare and retiree pension promises.

Boston economists Laurence Kotlikoff and Scott Burns warned in a 2008 Forbes article about what could happen if the government doesn’t curb its spending.

“The earthquake will come via a collapse in the market for U.S. government bonds as domestic and foreign investors realize that the only way Uncle Sam can meet his future spending obligations is to print massive quantities of money,” they said. “The result will be sky-high inflation and interest rates and, most surely, a prolonged reduction in output and employment. This could happen today. It could happen tomorrow. But it will happen here just as it has happened in every other country that tried to spend far beyond its ability to pay.”"

“I do believe we’re going to see a resolution this week,” said Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), one of the leaders of a bipartisan Senate group that has tried to negotiate a solution to the shutdown of government agencies and the need to lift the debt limit.

“We’re going to keep working and offer our ideas to the leadership,” she said on CNN’s “State of the Union”

A plan by Collins would have raised the federal debt limit through Jan. 31, funded federal agencies through March and made minor changes to President Obama’s healthcare law. Senate Democratic leaders have not accepted Collins’ proposal although Senate aides say some elements of it could figure in a final deal.

FULL COVERAGE: The U.S. government shutdown

Sen. Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the Senate’s No. 2 Democrat, said talks that began Saturday between Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada and the Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, constituted a “breakthrough.”

Durbin, appearing on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” said he thought the discussions have “the promise of finding a solution.”

As the senators’ comments made clear, the central issues in the talks have shifted in recent days.

Republicans have backed off their efforts to try to change the healthcare law, while Democrats, feeling they have the upper hand, have pushed a demand of their own: higher spending on domestic programs than allowed under the “sequester,” the across-the-board cuts that took effect earlier this year and are scheduled to deepen on Jan. 15.

Reid wants an agreement to fund federal agencies into January and a longer extension of the government’s ability to borrow money to pay its bills. He also is seeking to soften the next round of sequester cuts.

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), appearing on ABC’s “This Week” conceded that significant changes to the Affordable Care Act, as the healthcare law is formally known, were “off the table.”

But he warned against efforts to roll back the sequester. “If you break the spending cuts, you’re not going to get any Republicans in the Senate” to vote for the resulting deal, he said.

Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, an influential voice in the GOP’s right wing, also insisted that Republicans would not go along with any plan to end the sequester cuts.

“I can’t imagine you’re going to get Senate Republicans to vote for something that exceeds the sequester caps,” he said on CNN, saying that the size of the debt was the country’s No. 1 problem.

How to handle the sequester is “one of the sticking points” in the current negotiations, said Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.).

Schumer, who participated with Reid in Saturday’s negotiations, said on CBS’ “Face the Nation” that he was “cautiously hopeful, optimistic that we can come to an agreement.”

“Neither Democrats or Republicans like the sequester,” he said. “The dispute has been how to undo” it.

But Graham said he worried about a deal being reached in the Senate that could not pass muster with most House Republicans and that would further undermine House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio).

“Here’s what I’m worried about: a deal coming out of the Senate that a majority of Republicans can’t vote for in the House, that really does compromise Speaker Boehner’s leadership,” Graham said.

“And after all this mess is over, do we really want to compromise John Boehner as leader of the House? I don’t think so. So I’m not going to vote for any plan that I don’t think can get a majority of Republicans in the House, understanding that defunding Obamacare and delaying it for a year is not a realistic possibility now.”

Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) also speaking on “Face the Nation,” warned that Democrats should not overplay their hand.

“If they try to humiliate Republicans, things change in American politics,” he said. If Democrats do so, “it won’t be forgotten,” he said.

“Now’s the time to be magnanimous and sit down and get this thing done.”

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/13/obama-irs-scandal_n_3266577.html,2013-05-13 00:00:00,['Senior Politics Editor'],Obama On IRS Scandal: 'I Have Got No Patience' For It,"WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama strongly condemned officials at the Internal Revenue Service for singling out conservative groups during the lead-up to the 2012 elections.

In a press conference on Monday, Obama called the reports ""outrageous"" and intolerable, while saying he would reserve harsher judgment for when a fuller report on the IRS's actions is formally released.

""This is pretty straightforward,"" said Obama. ""If, in fact, IRS personnel engaged in the kind of practices that have been reported on and were intentionally targeting conservative groups, then that is outrageous, and there is no place for it, and they have to be held fully accountable, because the IRS as an independent agency requires absolute integrity and people have to have confidence that they are applying the laws in a non-partisan way. You should feel that way regardless of party.""

""But I have got no patience with it, I will not tolerate it, and we will make sure that we find out exactly what happened on this,"" he added.

The remarks were the president's first on the evolving scandal surrounding the tax collection agency. News broke last Friday that the IRS had targeted groups with the words ""Tea Party"" or ""Patriot"" in their name, forcing them to fill out additional questionnaires and provide more information in order to get approval for their tax-exempt status. Over the weekend, the Wall Street Journal reported that the IRS had also given extra scrutiny to organizations that focused on government spending, debt and taxes.

Lawmakers have responded with anger and outrage. On Monday morning, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) called on the IRS commissioner to be fired. The senator's office confirmed to The Huffington Post that he was referring to Steven Miller, the acting commissioner. The Senate has not yet confirmed a full-time commissioner since Douglas Shulman, a Bush appointee, stepped down this past fall.

Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), meanwhile, called for a ""congressional investigation to determine"" how the IRS scandal took place. Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.), who chairs the Senate Finance Committee, said that ""The IRS should be prepared for a full investigation into this matter by the Senate Finance Committee.""

The results of such an investigation will ultimately determine whether the story amounts to a case of terrible bureaucratic judgment or becomes a wider political scandal.

The IRS began taking on additional campaign finance regulatory responsibilities after the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision, which led to an uptick in filings for 501(c)(4) organizations seeking social welfare status. The agency's Cincinnati office became the central clearing point for those applications. Officials there, the agency said, were the ones who inappropriately targeted conservative groups for scrutiny.

As early as mid-2011, however, high-ranking IRS officials became aware that the Cincinnati office was engaging in this activity, a forthcoming Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration report will reportedly reveal. Why nothing was said or done prior to last Friday is unclear.

The president on Monday said that neither he nor his advisers were aware that this was taking place.

""I learned about it from the same news reports that I think most people learned about this,"" said the president. ""I think it was on Friday.""

The Wall Street Journal, meanwhile, reported that a government official who had reviewed a copy of the report said no one outside the IRS was involved in encouraging the targeting of conservative groups.

UPDATE: 2:45 p.m. -- Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) has joined the chorus of concerned lawmakers, saying that he supports bipartisan calls for an investigation into the IRS scandal. From his floor remarks:

I have spoken today to the senior Senator from Montana, Chairman of the Finance Committee, Max Baucus, and he is looking into this matter in his role as finance chairman of that committee. If the Inspector General's report indicates further investigation is needed, I have full confidence in the ability of Senator Baucus and the Finance Committee to get to the bottom of this matter and recommend appropriate action."

Americans have been living under Republican policies since Ronald Reagan. It is true that President George Herbert Walker Bush and President Clinton were far more fiscally responsible than the mathematically challenged and reality deficient Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush. George Herbert Walker Bush and Bill Clinton raised taxes in light of exploding deficits which ultimately resulted in a ""nominal"" budget surplus.

America went from voodoo economics to a form of fiscally responsible supply side economics. They cleaned up Ronald Reagan’s fiscal mess. They however did not clean up his flawed middle-class-pilfering supply-side economics. In fact it could be argued that Clinton was complicit by signing the ""repeal"" of Glass Steagall even as he allowed further erosion of the social safety net.

When George W. Bush got appointed president in 2000 by the Supreme Court, the era of fiscally irresponsible supply side economics returned on steroids. It was tax cuts justified by the discredited Laffer Curve all over again.

Enough Democrats never fought against the irresponsibility of the Republicans. Who wants to be on record opposing tax cuts? Republicans never worry about deficits if they are attributed to tax cuts or corporate welfare. Deficits only matter when related to the social safety net (Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, etc.)

Since the inception of supply side economics, the income and wealth of the middle class have been on a steady decline. This occurred even as the wealth and income of the top one percent have been increasing way above the rate of inflation. Even during the prosperous 1990s and parts of the 2000s, the working middle class was living a semblance of prosperity aided by financial bubbles and easy credit that ultimately disintegrated. This is best explained by Professor of Economics Emeritus Richard D. Wolff. His documentary Capitalism Hits The Fan is also informative.

Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. As you can read below the fold, this applies to both Democrats and Republicans."

http://news.yahoo.com/business-gop-establishment-tea-party-over-163718915--politics.html,,[],"Business, GOP establishment: Tea party is over","WASHINGTON (AP) — A slice of corporate America thinks tea partyers have overstayed their welcome in Washington and should be shown the door in next year's congressional elections.

In what could be a sign of challenges to come across the country, two U.S. House races in Michigan mark a turnabout from several years of widely heralded contests in which right-flank candidates have tried — sometimes successfully — to unseat Republican incumbents they perceive as not being conservative enough.

In the Michigan races, longtime Republican businessmen are taking on two House incumbents — hardline conservative Reps. Justin Amash and Kerry Bentivolio — in GOP primaries. The 16-day partial government shutdown and the threatened national default are bringing to a head a lot of pent-up frustration over GOP insurgents roughing up the business community's agenda.

Democrats hope to use this rift within the GOP to their advantage. Rep. Steve Israel, D-N.Y., chairman of the House committee to elect Democrats, insists there's been ""buyer's remorse with House Republicans who have been willing to put the economy at risk,"" and that it is opening the political map for Democrats in 2014.

That's what the Democrats would be expected to say. But there's also Defending Main Street, a new GOP-leaning group that's halfway to its goal of raising $8 million. It plans to spend that money on center-right Republicans who face a triumvirate of deep-pocketed conservative groups — Heritage Action, Club for Growth and Freedom Works — and their preferred, typically tea party candidates.

In one race, the group plans to help Idaho eight-term Rep. Mike Simpson, who faces a Club for Growth-backed challenger in a GOP primary.

""These conservative groups have had it all their own way,"" said former Republican Rep. Steve LaTourette of Ohio, head of the new group. ""They basically come in with millions of dollars and big-foot a Republican primary and you wind up with these Manchurian candidates who are not interested in governing.""

LaTourette said that for the past three years, some ""40, 42 House members have effectively denied the Republican Party the power of the majority"" that it won in the 2010 election by blocking the GOP agenda.

Defending Main Street is meeting Nov. 5 in New York with wealthy potential donors.

Call it the wrath of establishment Republicans and corporate America, always considered the best of friends. Since the Republican takeover of the House in 2010, they've watched the GOP insurgents slow a transportation bill and reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank, block a treaty governing the high seas and stand in the way of comprehensive immigration legislation.

The final straw was the bitter budget standoff that partly shuttered the government, precipitated by Republicans like Amash and Bentivolio who enlisted early in the campaign demanding that President Barack Obama dismantle his health care law in exchange for keeping the government operating.

Even after 16 days of a shutdown, falling poll numbers for the GOP and a threatened economy-jarring default, the two broke with their House Republican leaders and voted against the final deal to reopen the government.

Long before the shutdown, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which has spent tens of millions boosting mainly Republicans in congressional races, urged the GOP to fund the government and prevent a default, then double back and try and work out changes to the health care law later.

A significant number of House Republicans have given a cold-shoulder to the Chamber's agenda. Rob Engstrom, the group's political director, said the Chamber will see how races develop before deciding on its involvement next year.

The latest political dynamic promises to affect the midterm elections — but how? Republicans hope the widespread animosity generated by the shutdown dissipates by next November and they can hold their House majority. Currently, Republicans control 231 seats and Democrats 200. Democrats are widely expected to win the special House election in Massachusetts for the seat of Sen. Ed Markey and would need to gain 17 seats next year to seize control.

""As long as we stay focused on the priorities of the American people, I think we're going to be fine,"" House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said last week when asked about whether the GOP can hold onto the House.

What about the Michigan races?

In the state's 11th Congressional District, just northwest of Detroit, David Trott, a businessman involved in real estate finance and a member of the Michigan Chamber of Commerce Board of Trustees, is challenging Bentivolio.

In the 3rd Congressional District in the southwest part of the state, Brian Ellis is a 53-year-old Grand Rapids businessman who owns an investment advisory firm and serves on the school board. He describes himself as the true conservative Republican in the race, criticizing Amash's votes against Rep. Paul Ryan's budget that cut nearly $5 trillion and a measure reducing taxes for small businesses.

Ellis makes it clear that he would have sided with Boehner on the House GOP's last-ditch plan to avoid default. He says it never would have reached that point if Republicans hadn't embraced the tactic of linking the health care law to government funding.

""I certainly agree that Obamacare is an 'Obama-onation,'"" Ellis said in an interview. ""But I think the tactic, especially threatening to default on our debt, that is very reckless and not a good way to run our country. I'm in the financial world and I know that would have some far-reaching consequences that would not be good.""

In seizing on the rift, Israel and Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's national finance chairman, sent a letter to more than 1,000 business leaders reminding them that Democrats voted unanimously to end the shutdown and avoid default while House Republicans ""turned their backs on business in favor of the radical demands of the tea party.""

Republicans dismiss this Democratic outreach to the business community as wishful thinking.

""I don't think Democrats will be successful because the biggest headwinds we face in the economy right now are of their making, from regulation to the Affordable Care Act to this obsession with higher taxes,"" said Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas. ""Certainly the uncertainty of the last month has not been helpful, but that's on top of a heap of other uncertainty.""

Even if the business community isn't ready to embrace Democrats, Israel insists that the recent budget stalemate has helped his candidate recruitment while boosting the campaign committee's fundraising. At the end of September, the committee had $21.6 million on hand to $15.7 million for the National Republican Campaign Committee.

Potential recruits who Israel jokingly said had put his number on the ""do-not-call-list"" have suddenly been announcing their candidacies, including Democrat Pete Festersen, the president of the Omaha City Council, who is running against eight-term Rep. Lee Terry, and attorney Bill Hughes Jr., who is looking to unseat 10-term Rep. Frank LoBiondo, R-N.J.

They seem equally averse to suggesting the obvious plan, proposing Congress simply nix the ridiculously premised sequester and move on to smaller, more focused budget efforts like sensible people. In part that may be because they know the first side to suggest substantively weakening the sequester will then be the ""pro-deficit"" and ""big government"" side in the other party's pissy talking points for the next decade; in larger part, it seems to be because the administration itself is (yet again) so enamored with striking a Big Budget Deal that they are (yet again) pushing for the Big Budget Deal even when it's not necessary or wise. This was the same dynamic that led the White House into previous catastrophic ""negotiations"" with Congress as to whether or not the nation would shut down or default on its debts, negotiations which legitimized those same Republican threats in a rather stumbling attempt by the White House to reach some supposed ""larger"" agreement that would, in their minds, neutralize further budget fights for a while. The entire premise that any sufficiently ""large"" agreement would result in the other side not asking for more afterwards seems to be the height of political gullibility; nonetheless, that's what happened, and that's what kept happening in subsequent, related posturing, and all indications suggest that we're about to repeat the exact same thing.

So to the White House, accepting a bevy of damaging austerity-premised cuts is still considered a good bargain, if they can either (1) pry out tax concessions from the Republicans, which is at this point a goal unto itself, or (2) if the end result is ""big"" enough that the White House feels they won't have to do this crap again for a year or two. Not inspiring stuff, but again: There's no particular incentive on their parts to avoid the sequester outright. Sure, it'll hurt the economy, but Republicans will be blamed, a deal will be struck sooner or later or even later than that, then boom, victory.

As for House and Senate Democrats? They don't seem to even enter into things. They hold veto power over whatever the administration and Republicans decide to do, but as advocates for any other outcome, they're nonexistent. Again, because ""how about we not screw up the entire economy as political prank"" is right out, from a party messaging standpoint, leaving us only to debate how badly we'll be screwing it up and who will get what portion of the blame afterwards.

It's the precise dynamic of the debt ceiling fight, except this time, if possible, it's even worse because both sides have now fully embraced the rather strange notion that the economy isn't as important as enforcing a little austerity right now and damn the consequences. The fight is between the far right and the Simpson-Bowles right: all good, reasonable villagers agree that we need to screw retirees and others on the economic fringes, we're just haggling over who and how much. (Centrist ""victory"" in these matters will consist of getting Republicans to raise tax revenue after Republicans spent an entire eight-year administration lowering that same tax revenue to plainly unsustainable levels, which sounds like just asking those Republicans to exercise some common sense, and in fact is exactly that so good luck with it.)



So that's why we're at where we're at. The Republicans can't blink without looking like they're backing down on every one of their most cherished and loudly shouted supposed fiscal principles, principles that made their appearance in the debt ceiling fight and which caused this whole wreck of a thing in the first place. That's assuming, mind you, they have enough party unity left to even make a decision either way, which itself is far from a given. The White House thinks that no matter how bad things may be at this point or may get, they've at least finally got a good hand, and that they'll be able to bring Republicans back to the bargaining table after the very real bite of the sequester starts making for some very, very angry constituents back in Republican hometowns, thus finally leading the two sides to a lovely bipartisan agreement on some unknown (and, in all probability, disproportionately small) new amount of new tax revenues.

Sequester, here we come.

There's always the possibility that either side will blink. Even though the sequester is allegedly a Republican dream (Cutting the entire discretionary federal budget by an arbitrary percentage for no good reason? Be still my Norquistian heart!), the Republicans are unambiguously in the weaker position for the simple reasons that (1) the sequester is economically untenable for any period longer than a few days or weeks, and (2) the public is going to blame the jackasses who have been loudly cheering for government cuts when those cuts happen and start to hurt, because duh. Nonetheless, Republicans can't not shoot that hostage, because they said they would.

The White House might also cave for considerably less than their purported targets. Good money might even bet on that outcome, in fact, given the past (cough) history involved. And while I'm not a fan of the White House premise of using this same hostage to again attempt ""grand bargain"" revenue concessions, given that their role in avoiding the sequester is at this point merely advisory, there's not particularly any other path for them to take. True, they could beg House Republicans to simply call the whole thing off, but that argument is an obvious non-starter, so it won't happen. In any event, Grand Bargaining is in the air, God help us all.

So that's that. A very, very large number of Americans are about to be hurt for no particular reason other the Republican (and Officially Serious Villager, we must not forget) demand that we cut government and the deficit right the hell now, full stop, end of discussion. A very large number of Americans will be losing pay, they'll be losing needed services—they'll be losing things as basic as local airports that stay open. The desired outcome of this plan for both parties is to then establish a set of smaller or different cuts, possibly including the dramatic inclusion of slightly more tax revenue, and the prime long-term question is whether this entire process will merely stall the current, tenuous economic recovery or will, in some areas, kill it outright.

Make sense? Of course it doesn't. As an ideological belief, the current sudden-onset deficit fetishism was never meant to make sense in the first place. As with most things stubbornly ideological, however, merely knowing before the fact that it is a horrible, stupid, and clearly damaging idea is insufficient reason to not do it.

Ruben Hinojosa, D-Texas, speaks at a news conference in the Capitol Visitor Center held by the Congressional Hispanic Caucus entitled 'One Nation: Principles on Immigration Reform and Our Commitment to the American Dream.' (Photo By Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call)

WASHINGTON -- Several House Democrats walked out of a committee vote in protest on Wednesday, accusing their Republican counterparts of refusing to negotiate in a bipartisan manner over a job training bill.

While it's common for members of Congress to simply not show up for committee meetings, it's rare for them to actually boycott one.

""We didn’t come to this decision lightly,"" said Reps. John Tierney (D-Mass.), Rubén Hinojosa (D-Texas) and George Miller (D-Calif.), members of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, in a statement. ""Unfortunately, we viewed boycotting this proceeding as our only alternative after many months of repeatedly requesting bipartisan negotiations and being rebuffed by committee Republicans.""

""It would have been a dereliction of duty to continue to participate,"" they added.

Republicans were quick to criticize the walkout (seen in this video, near minute 51:00).

""Rather than present their ideas, Democrats offered a rote defense of the status quo and political theatrics,"" Committee Chairman Rep. John Kline (R-Minn.) said in a statement. ""Both are a disservice [to] workers, employers, and job seekers.""

The legislation at issue is a bill to reauthorize and reform the Workforce Investment Act, the largest source of federal funding for job training. Republicans want to consolidate more than 30 workforce development programs into a single fund, which they say would eliminate redundant programs and cut out red tape. Democrats say the plan would make it harder for vulnerable groups like the elderly and disabled to get access to the job training they need.

Committee Democrats argued that funding for job training had been a generally bipartisan issue until recently. After making little headway in negotiations, they sent committee Republicans a letter on Monday asking them to cancel the markup of the bill scheduled for Wednesday, saying that the GOP plan ""eliminates programs for the sake of eliminating programs, without any independent evaluation of whether they are in fact duplicative of one another.""

Nonetheless, Republicans went ahead with their markup and approved the legislation on Wednesday. Ahead of the vote, Kline said the reforms would save taxpayer dollars that are ""wasted on failed programs"" and leave workers ""stranded in unemployment.""

After discussion of the bill, Hinojosa said he would leave the committee meeting on principle, and he called on his Democratic colleagues to join him.

""I have concluded that I cannot be part of a political process that continues to be highly partisan and broken,"" Hinojosa said. ""At this time, I urge my colleagues to join me in exiting this committee room.""

He used to almost cast himself as the conservative alternative. But I don't think Boehner is seriously threatened. He won't be threatened so long as he goes along with conservatives in the House. He listens to them. He follows their advice. He’s often led by them. And as long as that’s true, how will there ever be a coup attempt? Boehner got so burned by the fiscal cliff that he’s been defanged. There’s no talk now about mounting a coup against him because he never goes against the right. The other candidates you hear about, like Tom Cole or Paul Ryan or Eric Cantor or Kevin McCarthy, you don't hear them clamoring for the job, because they'd have to handle the same situation."

Politico reported that, “President Barack Obama and his Democratic allies are eager to tag the GOP as the root cause of Washington dysfunction.” Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Executive Director Kelly Ward told the publication that Democrats are planning to highlight “the inability of Republicans to actually govern” and make that into a central “narrative” going into the 2014 midterm elections.

Even though the sequester idea originated in the White House, as Bob Woodward documented, Obama and Democrats tried to blame Republicans for the calamity that it would cause. Those tactics largely backfired, as a majority of Americans favored the across-the-board budget cuts.

Yet House Republicans and their advisers still remain fearful of Democrats and their tactics that have just recently failed, believing that a government shutdown over de-funding Obamacare or budget cuts would lose Republicans the House.

Rep. Tom Cole (R-OK), a former National Republican Congressional Committee chairman, said, “If you ask me what is the one thing that could reshuffle the deck on an otherwise stable mid-term environment in 2014, the answer is a government shutdown.” Brock McCleary, a GOP pollster and former NRCC deputy executive director, agreed, saying the “only way Republicans will lose the House is to shut down the government or default on the debt.”

The current continuing resolution to fund the government expires on Sept. 30, and the nation is set to hit its borrowing limit shortly after. Republicans have a 17-seat majority in the House and only four Republicans represent Districts that lean Democratic, which means Republicans will be more vulnerable from the right. Republican voters in most Republican House Districts want them to be more fiscally conservative and de-fund Obamacare.

Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-SC) said his voters would “rather see Republicans veer more to the right” on fiscal matters, and Chris Chocola, the president of the Club for Growth, said, “the greatest risk for Republicans is for them to continue to disappoint their supporters. I don’t think they’ve inspired them or given them a reason to support them in quite a while.”

“At some point, they have to communicate to people there is a difference between Republicans and Democrats,” he told the publication."

USA TODAY

U.S. House approved a stopgap spending bill aimed at dismantling the president%27s health care law

It faces opposition in the U.S. Senate and a veto threat from President Obama

Without a resolution by Sept. 30%2C the government will shut down on Oct. 1

WASHINGTON — The House voted 230-189 along party lines Friday to approve a stopgap spending bill to fund the federal government through mid-December, but it is facing certain defeat in the Senate because it includes language aiming to dismantle President Obama's health care law.

Just one Republican, Rep. Scott Rigell, R-Va., voted against it and two conservative Democrats, Reps. Jim Matheson of Utah and Mike McIntyre of North Carolina voted in favor.

Without a stopgap spending bill, the federal government will feel the effects of a shutdown when the fiscal year ends on Sept. 30. The bill extends the current rate of government spending at $986 billion a year.

House Republicans attached a provision to defund the Affordable Care Act, a consistent target of congressional Republicans. However, the provision has no chance of approval in the Democratic-controlled Senate and it faces a veto threat from Obama.

Next week, the Senate is expected to begin debate on the spending bill, where Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., will strip out the health care language and send a bill back to the House that simply extends current spending.

If the Senate runs out the clock on the time for debate, the vote could come as late as next weekend, giving House GOP leaders less than 48 hours to respond.

House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, has not committed to allowing a vote on a spending bill that does not address the health care law. House Republicans will then have three options: reject it, pass it or amend it and send it back to the Senate again.

The effects of a shutdown would not be immediately felt by most Americans. Essential government programs such as air traffic control, Social Security, Medicare and mail delivery would all continue, but national parks and museums would be closed, and agency operations would slow down or stop. The White House and the U.S. Congress would continue to operate as well.

But the political risks are great. The last time the government shut down was during the Clinton administration in a budget battle against Republicans led by then-speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., which resulted in a public backlash against the GOP.

Boehner has said Republicans are not seeking a government shutdown, but eye it as an opportunity to start a broader offensive against the health care law. Republicans are also seeking to delay the implementation of the law for one year in exchange for raising the debt ceiling, the nation's borrowing limit."

http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2013/05/30/who-is-not-to-trust-why-ted-cruz-is-right,2013-05-30 00:00:00,['Alfred S. Regnery'],Who Is Not to Trust? Why Ted Cruz Is Right,"So Ted Cruz doesn’t trust the Republicans. Imagine that.

“Let me be clear” he said on the Senate floor the other day. “I don’t trust the Republicans, and I don’t trust the Democrats.” And why not? The last four years have given us all ample reason not to trust the Democrats, as $1 trillion deficits have become the new normal and the national debt has zoomed toward $17 trillion, all under the Obama-Pelosi-Reid team’s watch.

But what about the Republicans, who so often claim to be the party of limited government? The truth is, the GOP’s record is seldom as grand as its rhetoric. Aside from a few Tea Party stalwarts, plenty of Republican senators are ready to throw in the towel on the debt ceiling, let it go up, and get a few scraps from the Democrats in return.

“Here is the dirty little secret about some of those on the right side of the aisle,” Cruz was quoted in the New York Times. “There are some who would very much like to cast a symbolic vote against raising the debt ceiling and nonetheless allow our friends on the left side of the aisle to raise the debt ceiling. That, to some Republicans, is the ideal outcome.”

He is right about that. Senior Republican staffers in Congress tell me that members of the Republican Leadership in both houses of Congress are terrified of not raising the debt ceiling, having been convinced that calamity will ensue if we don’t. But the alternative? Senate Majority Leader McConnell would, I am told, be happy to see the debt ceiling raised with no Republican votes. Then Republicans can beat up Democrats for raising it, while knowing that the economy won’t explode as Paul Krugman has warned it would.

And if House Speaker John Boehner had to choose between a clean debt ceiling increase (one with no limits, allowing Obama to keep raising it ad nauseum) and no debt ceiling increase at all, I am told he would take the former by conservatives in the House of Representatives.

So the establishment Republican mind-set says, “More debt is better than a melt-down, but at least get something in return, even if it doesn’t mean much, we have something to run against the Democrats with.” What do they want in return? They know they don’t have the votes to get much in the way of budget cuts, so they can at least keep the base happy with talk about “economic growth.”

When Cruz, who is anything but your traditional freshman back-bench Senator, said he didn’t trust Republicans, the party establishment, led by John McCain, howled in response. But where is the Republican leadership’s credibility? When they last held real power, these Republicans goosed up domestic discretionary spending faster than it rose under Bill Clinton and piled on the debt.

It was under a Republican president and Congress that we got Medicare Part D, the biggest new entitlement since LBJ’s Great Society. The prescription drug benefit added trillions to Medicare’s unfunded liabilities, passed only when party bosses needed to violate normal procedures to get the votes to pass it. Former U.S. Comptroller David Walker called it “the most fiscally irresponsible piece of legislation since the 1960s.”

Medicare’s chief actuary, Richard Foster, later said he was threatened not to reveal that the drug benefit’s price tag would exceed $400 billion in the first ten years. This figure was necessary under congressional rules to keep the bill from being blocked on a point of order. Foster estimated the real price tag was in excess of $500 billion. Several GOP congressmen would also recount arm-twisting tactics from the party leadership that went beyond the norm.

Instead of reducing the federal role in education, the Bush Administration and Republicans in Congress gave us No Child Left Behind, which helped double the size of the Department of Education, a Cabinet-level agency Republicans had pledged to abolish as recently as 1996. John Boehner, now the speaker of the House, was an NCLB sponsor and described its enactment as “one of the proudest accomplishments of my tenure in Congress.”

Under a Republican president and Congress, a $128 billion surplus was replaced by a $455 billion deficit. By the time George W. Bush left office, the shortfall was $1.2 trillion. Discretionary spending went up faster in Bush’s first term than it did in eight years under Bill Clinton. Under Bush’s watch, the federal budget exceeded $2 trillion, and then $3 trillion, for the first time. Most of these milestones were reached before the Democrats retook Congress. Federal spending rose from 18.4 percent of GDP to an average of 20.51 percent under Bush.

Bush and the Republican establishment bailed out the Wall Street banks with the $700 billion Troubled Assets Relief Program (with Democratic support, naturally). They bailed out the auto industry. They even pioneered a pre-Obama stimulus program, with similar results. The deficits and government growth would later endanger the Bush tax cuts, one of the signature conservative policy achievements of the period.

The Republicans who would negotiate the debt ceiling with the Democrats in a conference will be the same people who voted for all this big government and their successors. This unfortunately includes even Paul Ryan. What faith can we have that the results will be different this time?

So is there any doubt at all why Ted Cruz doesn’t trust Republicans? He explained that he thinks “a whole lot of Americans likewise don’t trust the Republicans and the Democrats because it is leadership in both parties that has gotten us in this mess.”

Maybe we need new leadership."

If the Republican Party had a brain it would give up on its debt-ceiling gambit and announce instead that it wants to open negotiations immediately with President Obama on the basis of his own deficit commission, the Simpson-Bowles plan. That would at least make the G.O.P. a serious opposition party again — with a platform that might actually appeal outside its base and challenge the president in a healthy way. But the G.O.P. would have to embrace the tax reforms and spending cuts in Simpson-Bowles first. Fat chance. And that’s a pity.

As for Obama, if he really wants to lead, he will have to finally trust the American people with the truth. I’d love to see him use his Jan. 21 Inaugural Address and his Feb. 12 State of the Union Message as a one-two punch to do just that — offer a detailed, honest diagnosis and then a detailed, honest prescription.

On the diagnosis side, Obama needs to explain to Americans the world in which they’re now living. It’s a world in which the increasing velocity of globalization and the Information Technology revolution are reshaping every job, workplace and industry. As a result, the mantra that if you “just work hard and play by the rules” you should expect a middle-class lifestyle is no longer operable. Today you need to work harder and smarter, learn and re-learn faster and longer to be in the middle class. The high-wage, middle-skilled job is a thing of the past. Today’s high-wage or decent-wage jobs all require higher skills, passion or curiosity. Government’s job is to help provide citizens with as many lifelong learning opportunities as possible to hone such skills.

In the State of the Union, I’d love to see Obama lay out a detailed plan for tax reform, spending cuts and investments — to meet the real scale of our problem and spur economic growth. We’ll get much more bang for our buck by deciding now what we’re going to do in all three areas, and signaling markets that we are putting in place a truly balanced approach, but gradually phasing it in. If you tell investors and savers that we’re going to put our fiscal house in order with a credible plan, but one that is gradually phased in, all the money now sitting on the sidelines paralyzed by uncertainty will get off the sidelines and we’ll have a real stimulus.

As for investment, I’d love to see the president launch us on an aspirational journey. My choice would be to connect every home and business in America to the Internet at one gigabit per second, or about 200 times faster than our current national household average, in five years. In an age when mining big data will be a huge industry, when online lifelong learning will be a vital necessity, and when we can’t stimulate our way to prosperity but have to invent our way there, no project would be more relevant."

That regional split became evident when members of the House of Representatives cast votes last week on a budget deal designed to avoid massive tax hikes and spending cuts: Almost 90% of Southern Republicans voted against the “fiscal-cliff” compromise. At the same time, a majority of Republican representatives from outside the South supported the deal, which was approved in large part because of overwhelming Democratic support.

The GOP’s geographic schisms burst anew after House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) canceled an expected vote on a $60-billion disaster relief package for victims of Superstorm Sandy.

Rep. Peter T. King (R- N.Y.) accused his party of “cavalier disregard” toward New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a potential 2016 GOP presidential contender, lashed out at what he called the “toxic internal politics” of his party’s House majority, noting that Republicans had speedily approved support for storm relief in “Louisiana, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Missouri, Alabama …""

Boehner moved quickly to smooth things over, but the upheaval was a reminder that divisions within the party could play an influential role as the new Congress begins to tackle Washington’s top agenda items, including an attempt in coming weeks to avoid a national debt default and President Obama’s promised effort to overhaul the nation’s immigration system.

The image projected by the battles in the House — the only part of the federal government controlled by Republicans — could influence public attitudes toward the GOP and its candidates heading into the 2014 midterm elections and the 2016 presidential contest.

In particular, the South’s preeminence could pose challenges to national GOP efforts to broaden the party’s appeal on social and cultural issues such as abortion and same-sex marriage.

“An increasing challenge for Northeastern Republicans, and West Coast Republicans, for that matter, is the growing perception among their constituents that the Republican Party is predominantly a Southern and rural party,” said Dan Schnur, a former GOP campaign strategist who directs the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at USC. “There’s always been a political and cultural disconnect between the South and the rest of the country. But as the parties have sorted themselves out geographically over the last few decades, the size of that gap has increased.”

To an unprecedented degree, today’s Republican majority in the House is centered in the states of the old Confederacy. The GOP enjoys a 57-seat advantage across the 11-state region that stretches from Texas to Virginia.

Outside the South, however, it’s a different story.

As a result of reapportionment and the 2012 election, the GOP no longer controls a majority of non-Southern congressional districts. In the last Congress, Republicans held a slim, two-district majority in non-Southern states; now Democrats have a 24-seat edge. Still, the Republicans have a comfortable 33-seat overall majority in the House — two seats are vacant — and only the most optimistic Democrats believe that Republicans will lose control of the chamber in 2014.

Merle Black, an Emory University political science professor who is an authority on the rise of the Republican Party in the South, said opposition to the fiscal cliff compromise appeared to be concentrated in congressional districts with the highest percentages of conservative voters.

“The Deep South is the most conservative area of the nation,” Black noted.

Few would dispute that the battle over the fiscal cliff and internecine sniping over Superstorm Sandy aid left Republicans in Washington deeply divided at a time when the party is still trying to recover from a presidential election defeat that many did not see coming.

“Any time a party loses an election, it goes through a process of internal debate. What the fiscal cliff did was to force that into becoming a little more public than usually happens,” said Republican strategist Ed Brookover.

Not everyone in the party agrees that its increasing concentration in the South poses a threat at the ballot box.

“No one in New Hampshire isn’t going to vote Republican because our base is in the South,” said Dave Carney, a campaign consultant based in New Hampshire whose clients have included Texas Gov. Rick Perry. “I don’t think there’s a disqualification because a majority of the party members come from below the Mason-Dixon line. What would be an issue is who the candidates will be at the national level and what their message will be.”

Yet the South’s dominance and internal politics have reinforced the tilt toward sharply conservative views.

In the House, most members of both parties represent districts that have lopsided partisan majorities. The threat of a primary challenge, often from a more extreme member of their own party, is a greater threat to many incumbents than opposition in the general election from the other party’s candidate.

That tends to foster attitudes that can run counter to a party’s national goals. The recent presidential campaign, in which Republican Mitt Romney was targeted by Democrats for adopting more conservative positions as he sought the nomination, demonstrated the limits of hewing to the Southern approach. The positions Romney and others have taken secured the support of white voters, but that is a declining share of a national electorate that is becoming increasingly diverse, with the emergence of a fast-growing Latino vote that has strongly favored Democratic candidates.

“Republicans across the country need to take a long, hard look at where this party is headed. Demographically, it cannot survive on the trajectory it’s taken,” said Dick Wadhams, a former chairman of the Colorado Republican Party. “The question for House Republicans is whether they are going to be an aid or an obstacle. I am hopeful the longer view is taken and that Republicans will understand the political predicament we would be in if responsible, substantive changes aren’t made in the tone and substance of the party’s relationship to Hispanics.”

Brookover, a former political director of the House Republican campaign committee, contrasted opposition to the fiscal cliff compromise in the House with the high level of GOP support in the Senate, where officeholders often have to build a broader base of support to win statewide. Only five Republican senators voted no.

Pat Quinn, in full re-election mode, took the unusual step of showing up in court today for the first hearing in lawmakers' effort to get their paychecks restored after the governor suspended their pay citing a lack of action on pension reform.



The hearing before Cook County Judge Neil H. Cohen was brief and laid out the schedule of paperwork to be filed before oral arguments take place on Sep. 18. That means lawmakers stand to miss at least one more paycheck (on Sept. 1) before a ruling comes down on their request to turn the paycheck spigot back on.



Last month, Quinn used his veto power to eliminate salaries for all 177 lawmakers, arguing they weren't doing their job by refusing to act on pension reform and therefore shouldn't get paid. Senate President John Cullerton and House Speaker Michael Madigan, both Chicago Democrats, sued last week, arguing the move violates the separation of powers between the legislative and executive branch.



Lawyers for the Democratic legislative leaders have asked the judge for a preliminary injunction that would allow Comptroller Judy Baar Topinka to cut checks. They are also seeking interest on the lost pay. The first monthly check they missed was supposed to be issued on Aug. 1.



Following the hearing, Quinn argued that instead of focusing on a lawsuit, lawmakers should cut a compromise on pensions and then vote to override his veto of their pay. Legislators argue that would only validate a move they say is unconstitutional, contending future governors could decide to withhold lawmaker pay any time they don't get what they want.



""We had to take dramatic and drastic action because the legislature has had months and months of opportunity to act and they've failed to act,"" Quinn said. ""I think the taxpayers of Illinois know full well what the principle is, you don't get paid if you don't do your job.""



Quinn faces a Democratic primary next year against Bill Daley, a former chief of staff to President Barack Obama. The governor's lawmaker paycheck move represents a return to his populist roots --- one lawmakers have ripped as political grandstanding."

It's not every day that GOP defends itself by claiming to be two-faced

Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, part of the Republican whip team responsible for marshaling support for legislation, said the current makeup of House Republicans could be divided roughly into a third who voted in favor of the bill because they wanted it to pass, a third who voted against the bill because they wanted it to fail, and a third who voted against the bill but had their fingers crossed that it would pass and avert a fiscal and political calamity. One lawmaker, Mr. Cole said, told him that while he did not want to vote in favor of the bill, he also did not want to amend it and send it back to the Senate where it might die and leave House Republicans blamed for tax increases. “So I said, ‘What you’re really telling me is that you want it to pass, but you don’t want to vote for it,'” recalled Mr. Cole, who voted yes.

Ron Bonjean, a Republican strategist and once the top spokesman for the former House speaker J. Dennis Hastert, a Republican, described the phenomenon thusly: “These are people who are political realists, they’re political pragmatists who want to see progress made in Washington, but are politically constrained from making compromises because they will be challenged in the primary.”

Congressman Cole is adamant that he will not accede to President Obama's unequivocal demand to raise it without any spending cuts tied to it. “I couldn’t do that. I wouldn’t do that,"" Cole told me in a phone interview. ""We didn’t downgrade our credit [in 2011] because of the debt ceiling fight. We downgraded in my view because when we had the fight we didn’t cut enough,"" Cole said. ""Just raising the debt ceiling with no compromise sends the wrong message—that we think we can willy-nilly go on forever."" ""If there are not serious cuts, the Republican votes are not going to be there,"" Cole continued.

Even as Republican officials maintain the GOP majority is safe, several lawmakers and longtime activists warn of far-reaching political ramifications if voters perceive Republicans as botching consequential talks on the debt ceiling, sequestration and a possible government shutdown. “Majorities are elected to do things, and if they become dysfunctional, the American people will change what the majority is,” Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), a House deputy majority whip and a former National Republican Congressional Committee chairman, told The Hill.

So far in 2013, House Speaker John Boehner has relied on Democratic votes to overcome overwhelming Republican opposition on back-to-back pieces of legislation: the Hurricane Sandy relief aid package on Tuesday night and the tax cliff deal from two weeks earlier. But if you think this proves that most Republicans have marginalized themselves and that Democrats are now an essential part of making the House function, House Majority Deputy Whip Tom Cole of Oklahoma says you're wrong. Why? Because, he says , secretly about half of Republicans who voted no actually wanted the legislation to pass:And why would a Republican vote no while secretly hoping for yes?In other words, about half of Republicans who vote with the hardline reactionary fringe aren't actually devoted wingnut true believers—they are actually just cowards, afraid of standing up to their political base. Whatever you think of the ethics of that, it's an invaluable insight for Democrats to remember as we move forward on issues like the debt limit. Take, for example, what the aforementioned Tom Cole said yesterday about the debt limit:Tough talk, except this is the guy who just said half of Republicans who voted no on the tax cliff deal actually supported it. And given that Cole voted for the tax cliff deal and the Hurricane Sandy package, it's not a shock that he might vote no on a clean debt deal, passing the responsibility to another one of his colleagues. But when you listen to a third interview with Cole , also from yesterday, it seems clear that he knows Republicans need to let the debt limit go up, no matter how he votes.So basically we're looking at a House Republican Conference in which members want to (a) develop a voting record that protects them from primary challenges while (b) not actually having that voting record influence the final outcome, because if it does, then they worry they will lose the majority in the general election. And if that's not a golden opportunity for Democrats to put House Republicans on defense throughout the 113th Congress, then nothing is."

The government shutdown and the game of chicken over the debt ceiling demonstrated just how dysfunctional the American political system has become. Congress cannot even pass a budget, let alone deal with climate change, Medicare reform, a jobless economy or the looming national debt.

And the situation will not improve because there are so many safe, one-party-dominant congressional districts where deluded voters keep electing the sort of Republicans who think political compromise is a far greater sin than hiring prostitutes or keeping an Argentine mistress. (Remember David Vitter and Mark Sanford?)

These safe-for-screwballs districts must be eliminated and, if accomplishing that through redistricting is impossible, then more creative means must be employed.

Since so many of the districts are in Southern states, we could tell, say, South Carolina, Mississippi and Alabama we changed our minds about the old secession thing and they are now free to leave. That could do the trick, but it would also undo all of Abraham Lincoln’s hard work. Who knows? They might bring back slavery.

A better idea is to take advantage of a historical anomaly. I’m talking about Texas, the state whose senator, Ted Cruz, ran the charge to close down the government and whose entire Republican congressional delegation voted against the bill to restart government functions and forestall a calamitous credit default.

Texas was once an independent country. It wouldn’t set such a bad precedent to let it be independent again (even if native Hawaiians start shouting, “Us too!”).

Cruz could get his wish to be president of a whole country (something that will never happen if Texas remains a state), the balance of power in Congress would shift and we might see a bill or two get passed for the first time in years.

Of course, it would be a shame to lose a star from the flag. The easiest remedy for that would be to finally make Puerto Rico a state. Economically speaking, though, Puerto Rico for Texas is not such a great swap. It would be far better to reach back pre-1776 and renew a historic connection: We once belonged to England; now they can belong to us.

I do mean England, not the entire United Kingdom. Scotland is already taking a highland fling toward independence. Northern Ireland can finally become part of the Irish Republic (what could possibly go wrong with that?). Wales ... well, maybe Wales can be a territory, like Puerto Rico.

England is the perfect replacement state. London is a financial powerhouse far beyond even the loudest boasts of Houston and Dallas. English and American cultures are more intertwined than ever. We listen to the same music, watch the same TV shows, and 80% of English actors already live in Los Angeles.

The best part is English conservatives. They are nothing like tea party Republicans. They’re all educated at Oxford and Cambridge, not Oral Roberts University. They all think universal healthcare is a sensible idea, not a pact with Lenin and Marx. And they hate being part of the European Union -- so much so that they’d be eager to tell the French and Germans to bugger off and then join the U.S. Besides, the English conservatives’ greatest hero, Winston Churchill, was half American.

Imagine trading Ted Cruz for David Cameron. There is no part of this deal that does not sound like a plus for our political system.

Texas liberals might not be quite so thrilled. Still, if they are patient, Latino voters will become the majority in Texas in just a few years. When that happens, they can throw out the crazy conservatives and, if they so choose, rejoin the union. Heck, just for fun, we’ll put stars on the flag for Wales and Puerto Rico too."

Story highlights Congress spent more time in office this year but got less done Some Republicans argue that it's number of bad bills stopped that shows effectiveness ""It's been getting worse and worse every year,"" veteran Democrat says Long-time Republican says, ""I think we've been working less""

(CNN) —

Congress set off for a two-week recess Friday, flying out of Washington under a dark cloud: the “Do-nothing” label. But that term is too easy. If you take a closer look, it turns out the better fit may be the “wasted-time” Congress.

The terms “do-nothing” and “Congress” may be so cemented together that the phrase no longer tells us much. At the moment, it may sound redundant.

In 2013, Congress spent more time at the office but got less done with it than at any time in recent history.

How much got done?

Let’s start there. There are many measures of congressional activity, but one has sparked the “do-nothing” label: Bills passed.

• Bills passed 2013: 64

• Where does that place?: That is the lowest amount in modern history.

• What about recent years?: 148 (’12), 90 (’11), 258 ('10) and 125 ('09). The lowest figure during President George W. Bush’s term was 136, double the amount passed this year.

Lawmakers pass more blame than bills

Wait, bills passed does not mean “good” bills passed. This is true. And it is a key argument for Republicans especially.

“It’s not how many bills you pass,” Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Alabama, told CNN, “It’s how many you stop. A lot of them are bad.”

This is what we’re getting at here by bucking the “do-nothing” label. It does not capture the extent of the problem in Congress.

6 reasons why 2013 was a bad year for Obama

How else can you measure the mess on Capitol Hill?

By the hundreds of hours it took Congress to get so little done.

Days in session? We could look at the days in session, which were officially more than 150 for both the House and Senate. That is average for the Senate and way above average for the House.

But those figures can be misleading: They include “pro-forma” sessions when the House and Senate are not really in Washington.

Instead, consider time in session

• Senate time in session: More than 1,098 hours.

• House time in session: More than 786 hours. .

• Relatively: That’s higher than average for the Senate over the past 30 years. And lower than average for the House.

Senate clears key nominations, leaves town for Christmas

And there were issues that both parties pledged to address, but left unresolved in that work time. To name a few:

• Jobs, long-term unemployment

• Immigration

• Energy policy

In other words, Congress spent hundreds of hours in Washington – far more than average for the Senate – and still was not able to address most of the biggest issues of the day.

“It’s a lot of wasted time,” Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-California, told CNN, her frustrated tone at odds with her bright holiday red sweater. ” Ridiculous… It’s exhausting… It’s been getting worse and worse every year. Exponentially. There are so many issues we could be dealing with, and we’re so discouraged.”

This is perhaps the greatest area of bipartisan agreement: Congress is in Washington, but doing less.

“I think we’ve been working less, to be honest with you,” Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, said as he left the last Senate vote of the year.

When asked about the increased hours in the Senate, he was quick to respond, “The number of hours doing nothing? Yes, absolutely.”

There is a pervasive sense of frustration mixed with no clear path toward a better, more able Congress.

“I think a majority of the members are trying… and hope that getting back to where the Congress does its job is just right around the next corner,” said Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Missouri, who previously served as the Republican whip in the House. He lowered is voice. “And we keep turning that corner and finding out we’re not there yet. And that’s frustrating.”

It is a combination of doing relatively little, but taking an enormous amount of time doing it.

“A lot of wasted time to me,” Boxer repeated.

Obama says 2013 wasn’t his worst year"
http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2013/03/01/happy-sequestration-day/,2013-03-01 00:00:00,['Erick Erickson'],Happy sequestration day,"Today is Sequestration Day. Americans should be happy.

Last year during the debt ceiling fight, Democrats and Republicans in Congress came up with a novel idea. To satisfy the demands of conservatives who insisted on the whacky idea of paying down the national debt, Congress would create a bipartisan “super committee” consisting of members of both the House and Senate who would come up with a plan to make cuts or increase revenue to pay down the national debt.

President Obama joined in the negotiations and came up with the idea of sequestration. If the super committee failed, and most everyone privately thought it would, there would be automatic spending cuts in 2013 that would target sacred cows including defense and education — painful for both sides.

[pullquote]

In fact, it is reasonable to believe, the sequestration cuts would be so painful to the sacred cows of both sides that once the super committee — stacked with congressmen and Senators who could never get the job done — failed, Congress could punt on sequestration and come up with new ideas to pay down the debt or find new shiny initiatives to distract Americans from a lack of debt reduction.

More On This... Obama signs order to begin $85B in spending cuts

Barack Obama came up with sequestration. He negotiated it. Conservatives opposed it knowing that Republicans would ultimately cave and there would actually be no spending cuts. Then a funny thing happened. Republicans and their conservative base fell into a lovers quarrel over the direction of the party. The party establishment in Washington wanted to collaborate with the President, ignored the base’s demands to keep up the fight against ObamaCare, and started acting arrogantly against conservatives.

The base fought back. Republican leaders knew they had to do something to keep up appearances with the base. They decided they could not backtrack on sequestration. The cuts had to happen.

President Obama has long shown a propensity to be good at only one thing: the self-promotion of Barack Obama. He has not been good at governance. He has not been good at getting other Democrats elected. He has been a terrible negotiator. He failed to see what was happening in the party opposite. He structured a deal that made sequestration the law of the land without a literal act of congress to stop it.

Now we have arrived at the day most thought would never come.

In the run up to today, President Obama resorted to a campaign of fear mongering. He decided to make sequestration a blunt instrument. Instead of using his executive discretion to make careful cuts, he found ways to make the cuts appear disastrous, spooky, and painful for the American people. In the last week it would have come as no surprise to hear the president, given his increasing hyperbole about sequestration, to claim it would cause both erectile dysfunction and hospitals to finish off the infirm and elderly without so much as a visit to a death panel.

But the hyperbole did not work. Sequestration has arrived.

In all the talk, chatter, punditry, and hyperbole, one thing has been forgotten. This fight has never been about where to make cuts, but whether to make cuts at all. House Republicans offered several plans to alter the cuts. The Democrats would never consider them. The Democrats, instead, preferred raising taxes and, in sequestration, got one of their long held wishes of defense cuts.

The Democrats were never serious about real spending cuts, which is why the president could be so unserious at his campaign style rallies claiming sequestration would cause furloughs for teachers, policemen, and fire fighters, none of whom are even employed by the federal government.

The game now is predictable. Democrats will try to make the sequestration cuts as painful as possible on the American people. They will stop spending in areas that will do maximum harm and inconvenience to the lifestyle of the American citizen. They want Americans to think any cuts in spending at all are too disruptive.

The president and Democrats do not have to do this. They could make reasonable cuts. But if they do they will show spending cuts are possible without major disruption, pain, and inconvenience. That would give away the game.

The truth is, though, inescapable. Today the sun came up. Americans went about their daily lives. The federal government was open for business. The mail ran. The Mayans were not right.

Americans are reminded that Washington can, in fact, cut its budget and the world will not end. The only better reminder of this would be a government shutdown. We can only hope."

She Started With The Times In Washington', 'D.C.', 'In', 'Covering Money', 'Politics', 'She Also Covered State Politics', 'Government In Sacramento.']",Brown emerges from bill signings with a strong political hand,"SACRAMENTO — Gov. Jerry Brown emerged this week from a month of bill decisions with accolades for temperate lawmaking and fiscal prudence that could serve him well if, as expected, he runs for reelection next year.

There was something for everyone in his signings and vetoes. He liberalized some social policies, blocked some ideas that conservatives disliked and took the middle ground on many other matters.

And nearly a year after persuading voters to pass a $6-billion tax hike, he had the victory that may matter the most: an end to the state’s budget crisis.

As a result, the 75-year-old Brown appears virtually immune to an election challenge next year. And his political strength could help fellow Democrats in the Legislature — nearly all of whose seats will be on the ballot in 2014 — keep their slim two-thirds majority in each house.

Although the state’s fiscal tranquillity gives the governor new room for policy initiatives, Brown’s 2014 agenda is expected to be muted, without flashy proposals to dangle before voters.

“Politically, this is as good as it gets for Democrats,” said Jack Pitney, a former national GOP official and a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College. “Why risk it by pushing too hard too fast?”

Democrats learned that lesson the hard way more than a decade ago, the last time they both held the governor’s chair and dominated the Legislature, albeit without a supermajority. As the economy roared during the dot-com boom, lawmakers and then-Gov. Gray Davis expanded social services and public employees’ retirement benefits.

Four years later, an energy crisis had gripped the state, deficits were rising and Davis was thrown out of office.

In a recent interview, Brown said he plans to stay his course. He’ll focus on the nitty-gritty work of implementing policies he has already signed into law — on education and prisons, for example — and will keep pushing for a state bullet train, he said.

He will also devote time, and political clout, to unclogging California water policy. The governor wants lawmakers to finish renegotiating a water bond measure, currently scheduled for the November 2014 ballot, to boost the reliability and safety of the state’s water supply.

He is simultaneously promoting a separate plan to build two massive tunnels to divert water around the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta to the southern half of the state.

“I think the emphasis has to be on digesting and managing a lot of what we have — high-speed rail, the Delta project’s going to take several years even to get it ready to go, and this whole prison realignment — there’s a lot of work to do there,” Brown said. “This is a big ship to turn. It takes a lot of knowledge and a lot of time. So I’m doing that.”

The slow-and-steady approach could clash with the priorities of Democratic lawmakers, who for years slashed school funds and welfare programs to help rescue the state’s finances. They will almost certainly want to restore those cuts.

Lawmakers and Brown have “worked together to try to get the state’s fiscal house in order,” said David McCuan, professor of political science at Sonoma State. Expensive infrastructure projects “are going to be very difficult for many legislators to swallow” without more money for social programs.

Assembly budget Chairwoman Nancy Skinner (D-Berkeley) said the minor boosts to social services this year, such as restoration of adult dental benefits in Medi-Cal, were “not as much as the need out there.”

Next year, Skinner said, there will be more focus on “those core safety-net things that really make a difference in someone’s ability to survive.” One priority, she said, will be a rollback of cuts to Medi-Cal providers, reductions that Brown demanded while the state was still mired in financial crisis.

Still, legislators know there are limits, especially in an election year. And the new class of lawmakers, who can serve all their time in one house under California’s new term limits, does not feel compelled “to solve all the state’s problems” at once, said Assemblyman Anthony Rendon (D-Lakewood), who won his first legislative seat in 2012.

“We [have] a long-range view toward public policy,” he said.

If California’s economy continues to improve, Brown could restore enough social-service funding to keep Democrats happy, and do so without appearing incautious.

As long as he doesn’t find himself forced by the courts to release thousands of prison inmates to the streets, Republicans have little chance of prevailing against Brown at the polls next year, experts say. And no viable candidate has announced a run.

“There really isn’t much barring him from reelection,” said Bill Whalen of Stanford University’s Hoover Institution, who was an aide to former Republican Gov. Pete Wilson. “He is just in this incredibly enviable position.”

(CNN) —

For most Americans, the budget debate in Washington is reaching dog-whistle pitch, a tone that only partisans can hear. Which, as far as I am concerned, is a mercy.

Paul Ryan offered his budget on Tuesday. Let’s do give him props for making the effort and all. The vast majority of his colleagues are potted plants on this front, reading talking points, sometimes banging the table and doing precious little else. But what Ryan calls a budget is what any CEO would call a firing offense. It uses some numbers and some words that appear in real budgets. But it neglects some other key elements … like arithmetic or the truth or a greater economic purpose.

The Ryan budget depends entirely on unspecified tax reforms and the replacement of revenues he doesn’t care for (such as those associated with Obamacare) with others he doesn’t care to actually define or describe. The rigorous, widely respected Center on Budget and Policy Priorities slammed the exercise, taking Ryan to task for failing to live up to his billing as the guy courageous enough to put his ideas out there.

David Rothkopf

It wrote, “Is it courageous to propose tax cuts but not identify a single tax expenditure to rein in? Is it courageous to target your deepest cuts on the poorest Americans, who vote in lower numbers and provide little in campaign contributions? Is it courageous to camouflage hundreds of billions in cuts for the poor and disadvantaged in broad budget categories without identifying the programmatic cuts, so that analysts, journalists, and other policymakers can’t identify the specific cuts and assess their impacts?”

Meanwhile, on the other side of the aisle, we have a real sign of the End Times: Senate Democrats have actually come out with a budget for the first time since the iPad was invented. There are children in school, reading, who were born since their last budget.

Senate Budget Committee Chairwoman Patty Murray unveiled it Wednesday. Her budget is as partisan as Ryan’s and offers little common ground with his on controversial issues. It calls for $1.85 trillion in deficit reduction through the end of the decade, almost $1 trillion of it from new revenues.

Ryan calls the divergent plans the beginning of a process. The question is where that process will lead.

Early next month, the president will submit the budget he was supposed to have sent to the Hill in February. There it will sit, because it too is just a negotiating ploy, an opening bid.

These compilations of charts and data are not budgets at all. They are just props in the Budget Follies of 2013. Not one of the long-term visions sketched out in these plans will actually be realized. There will be no serious discussion or honest debate about enacting meaningful tax reform, rethinking defense spending or remaking our entitlement system for a world in which people generally live longer and in which government resources are stretched.

But, frankly, these aren’t even the most critical issues we should be addressing.

The budget is important. Cutting our deficits matters. But in a country in which corporate profits and the stock market are at record highs but in which jobs are being created far too slowly and median incomes are sagging, we have far more basic issues to grapple with.

The United States is like a business whose model for making revenue is failing, trying to save itself by cutting down on travel expenditures and the cost of making photocopies. Sure, we shouldn’t overspend. But if we don’t figure out what business we’re in – what new industries will create tomorrow’s jobs, what kind of new workers we’ll need, what kind of infrastructure we must have to be competitive and attract investment – our deficit problems will seem minor compared with our social and political concerns.

Our most important national discussion should not be about spending but about investment. We need to recognize that some federal programs help grow the economy and weigh the return on investment we will get from these and which are essential to growing the new industries that will be the employers of tomorrow … and will provide the growth that is the only real solution to our debt issues.

The Ryan budget cuts transportation spending in a country that has neglected its highways and bridges for over half a century. It doesn’t plan for the infrastructure spending we will need to respond to the consequences of climate change (like hurricane relief) or anticipate the investment we could make to avoid such problems in the first place. It doesn’t discuss how to expand information technology and next-generation energy infrastructure as we must.

Perhaps the Senate budget or the president’s will be wiser about investing – although neither is likely to think big enough about transport spending or an infrastructure bank or, better, a network of regional infrastructure finance institutions. What seems more likely, sadly, is more hollow gestures, scurrying to avoid artificial deadlines and visionless crisis management. Not one leader has emerged in Washington who is providing anything truly different that cuts to the core questions we face or rises to the true challenge of our times.

Which leaves us but one consolation. Washington has grown so shrill that most of this empty debate will be heard only by our dogs. Pity the dogs.

“What is the true state of our union? Though this may sound harsh, I’ll speak the truth here,” Palin wrote. “We are a country going bankrupt to fund a bloated, distant, and often corrupt federal government led by venal politicians more concerned with paying off their campaign cronies and consolidating their own power than in preserving the constitutional republic that so many have fought and died for (including our brave men and women in uniform who were barely mentioned last night).”

Palin has assailed the “permanent political class” since her landmark speech in Indianola, Iowa in 2011 that introduced that language into the political bloodstream. Director Stephen K. Bannon and Peter Schweizer’s Government Accountability Institute have assailed D.C. as a “boomtown” that produces nothing but continues to get wealthier by expanding the size and scope of government.

During the State of the Union address on Tuesday, Palin live-tweeted with the “#SOTUGottaBKiddingMe” hashtag, assailing Obama and Washington, D.C.’s permanent political class for their cronyism. After the speech, Palin called out Obama for not honoring slain ex-Navy Seal Chris Kyle or U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens during the address. After attending Kyle’s funeral on Monday, Palin said Obama needed to “pay his respects” to the fallen American hero.

“If you missed President Obama’s State of the Union address last night, you didn’t miss much – especially if you watched any of his past four State of the Union addresses,” Palin wrote. “We heard the same recycled rhetoric, and we heard his Orwellian declaration that the cornucopia of new federal programs he proposed, as well as his intention to eradicate world poverty, wouldn’t ‘increase our deficit by a single dime.'”

Palin also referenced Paul Krugman, “one of President Obama’s economic cheerleaders at the New York Times,” who last week was “remarkably candid” when he said “death panels and taxes is how we do this.”

“But wait, I thought there’d be no such thing as ‘death panels,’ liberal liars?” Palin asked sardonically.

“This is the long-term forecast for the state of America under Obama’s failed policies: middle class taxes and death panels,” Palin wrote.



Left-wing politicians and journalists ridiculed Palin when she predicted the Affordable Care Act would lead to bureaucratic death panels rationing treatment. Politifact named “death panels” its Lie of the Year in 2009.

“Our country didn’t weather a Revolution, two World Wars, a Civil War, a Great Depression, and countless other political and economic storms, just to be sunk by the dangerous policies of this current administration,” Palin wrote. “We’re stronger than this. As President Reagan said, ‘I do not believe in a fate that will fall on us no matter what we do. I do believe in a fate that will fall on us if we do nothing.'”

Palin concluded by urging Republicans to get ready for the 2014 midterm elections: “So, do something. 2014 is just around the corner. Get motivated! Get organized. America, don’t retreat. In the words of yet another White House program, ‘Let’s move.'”"

Americans are in a panic. Crowds throng gun shows and shops. Blue-chip companies fast-forward 2013’s dividends to 2012. Investors cash out profits, estate planners report a rush of people trying to beat higher inheritance taxes and lobbyists line up for favors.

What these people share is the goal of avoiding or benefitting from government actions. More than ever, the “invisible hand” of free markets is being replaced by the visible hand of bureaucrats. The political class is the new master of the universe.

If this were being staged in a theater, the national epidemic of expectation would be called “Waiting for Government.” It would be as absurd as “Waiting for Godot,” but not at all meaningless.

[pullquote]

That’s because the tax-and-spending drama in Washington, as pathetic and infuriating as it is, threatens real-world consequences for every American. How could it be otherwise when Big Government is getting bigger?

Much, much bigger.

The frantic run-up to the fiscal cliff, including wild swings in the stock market, provided an ominous snapshot of the new reality. Barack Obama’s reelection was the big story of 2012, but the real impact of his statist policies will be felt in the new year and for many years to come.

Obama’s victory secures first-term government expansions, such as ObamaCare, which carries expensive mandates and who knows how many unintended consequences. No matter how the fiscal talks are resolved, the IRS will be taking a fatter share of the fruits of national labor. At stake is how much fatter, whose ox gets gored and whose gets spared.

Some statistics, such as housing prices, say the economy is growing, but it’s all relative. The unemployment rate is falling largely because millions have stopped looking for work. Ordinary wages are stagnant or falling.

But it is boom time for the government. Spending continues to rise, hiring is up and the Federal Reserve’s printing presses are running overtime.

The Obama administration is happy to keep borrowing 40 cents of every dollar it spends, or nearly $4 billion a day, seven days a week. Each day brings plans for added regulations and new ways to rob Peter to pay Paul.

The combination creates a huge cloud hanging over every family and business. Debts and inflation exact penalties, perhaps for generations, and already are stifling innovation and job creation. Ours has become the world’s largest debtor nation and still needs more lenders.

The certain result will be an economic pie that doesn’t grow fast enough, which will lead to new demands for more redistribution under the guise of “fairness.” Always, the government redistributes by taking the first bite for itself.

The most disheartening aspect of this gloomy vision is that Americans voted for it. Obama was upfront about wanting to raise taxes and expand government and the debt. The reach and cost of Washington grew dramatically in the last four years, and he was rewarded with four more.

It is naive to think he will change course. His rejection of any serious reforms of entitlements shows that he is emboldened. Woe to the man who dares declare that the government already is too big and powerful. He will be denounced as cruel and caricatured as wanting no government at all.

This being the season for predictions, mine is that millions upon millions of Americans who voted for Obama will be disappointed in 2013. But most will not blame him. They will agree with him that the solution is to double the dose of Washington power.

Never mind that the patient is dying. The Obama operation is a great success. Just ask him.

Bush’s legacy keeps getting worse

By Eugene Robinson,

In retrospect, George W. Bush’s legacy doesn’t look as bad as it did when he left office. It looks worse.

I join the nation in congratulating Bush on the opening of his presidential library in Dallas. Like many people, I find it much easier to honor, respect and even like the man — now that he’s no longer in the White House.

But anyone tempted to get sentimental should remember the actual record of the man who called himself The Decider. Begin with the indelible stain that one of his worst decisions left on our country’s honor: torture.

Hiding behind the euphemism “enhanced interrogation techniques,” Bush made torture official U.S. policy. Just about every objective observer has agreed with this stark conclusion. The most recent assessment came this month in a 576-page report from a task force of the bipartisan Constitution Project, which stated that “it is indisputable that the United States engaged in the practice of torture.”

We knew about the torture before Bush left office — at least, we knew about the waterboarding of three “high-value” detainees involved in planning the 9/11 attacks. But the Constitution Project task force — which included such figures as Asa Hutchinson, who served in high-ranking posts in the Bush administration, and William Sessions, who was FBI director under three presidents — concluded that other forms of torture were used “in many instances” in a manner that was “directly counter to values of the Constitution and our nation.”

Bush administration apologists argue that even waterboarding does not necessarily constitute torture and that other coercive — and excruciatingly painful — interrogation methods, such as putting subjects in “stress positions” or exposing them to extreme temperatures, certainly do not. The task force strongly disagreed, citing U.S. laws and court rulings, international treaties and common decency.

The Senate intelligence committee has produced, but refuses to make public, a 6,000-page report on the CIA’s use of torture and the network of clandestine “black site” prisons the agency established under Bush. One of President Obama’s worst decisions upon taking office in 2009, in my view, was to decline to convene some kind of blue-ribbon “truth commission” to bring all the abuses to light.

It may be years before all the facts are known. But the decision to commit torture looks ever more shameful with the passage of time.

Bush’s decision to invade and conquer Iraq also looks, in hindsight, like an even bigger strategic error. Saddam Hussein’s purported weapons of mass destruction still have yet to be found; nearly 5,000 Americans and untold Iraqis sacrificed their lives to eliminate a threat that did not exist.

We knew this, of course, when Obama became president. It’s one of the main reasons he was elected. We knew, too, that Bush’s decision to turn to Iraq diverted focus and resources from Afghanistan. But I don’t think anyone fully grasped that giving the Taliban a long, healing respite would eventually make Afghanistan this country’s longest or second-longest war, depending on what date you choose as the beginning of hostilities in Vietnam.

And it’s clear that the Bush administration did not foresee how the Iraq experience would constrain future presidents in their use of military force. Syria is a good example. Like Saddam, Bashar al-Assad is a ruthless dictator who does not hesitate to massacre his own people. But unlike Saddam, Assad does have weapons of mass destruction. And unlike Saddam, Assad has alliances with the terrorist group Hezbollah and the nuclear-mad mullahs in Iran.

I do not advocate U.S. intervention in Syria, because I fear we might make things worse rather than better. But I wonder how I might feel — and what options Obama might have — if we had not squandered so much blood and treasure in Iraq.

Bush didn’t pay for his wars. The bills he racked up for military adventures, prescription-drug benefits, the bank bailout and other impulse purchases helped create the fiscal and financial crises he bequeathed to Obama. His profligacy also robbed the Republican Party establishment of small-government credibility, thus helping give birth to the tea party movement. Thanks a lot for that.

As I’ve written before, Bush did an enormous amount of good by making it possible for AIDS sufferers in Africa to receive antiretroviral drug therapy. This literally saved millions of lives and should weigh heavily on one side of the scale when we assess The Decider’s presidency. But the pile on the other side just keeps getting bigger.

(CNN) —

Chiara de Blasio, daughter of New York City Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio, has struggled with clinical depression and drug abuse, the 19-year-old revealed in a YouTube video posted Christmas Eve.

“I’ve had depression, like clinical depression, for my entire adolescence,” de Blasio says in the video. “It made it easier, the more I drank and did drugs, to share some common ground with people that I wouldn’t have. It didn’t start out as a huge thing for me but then it became a really huge thing for me.”

In the video, de Blasio speaks about drinking and smoking marijuana when she was in college, as well as the outpatient treatment that started her on the road to recovery.

De Blasio’s father sailed to a landslide victory last month over Republican candidate Joe Lhota to become New York’s first Democratic mayor in more than 20 years. One key to his victory was a connection with voters, formed in part via his mixed-race family, particularly his son, Dante, and wife, Chirlane McCray, who played a prominent role on the campaign trail.

Chiara’s story has until now stayed out of the public eye.

“As parents, our instinct has been to protect our daughter and privately help her through a deeply personal struggle,” her parents said in an e-mail to supporters that linked to the video. “But not only has Chiara committed to her own health, she is also committed to helping young people everywhere who face similar challenges.”

Professionally shot and edited, the YouTube video was released under an account bearing Chiara de Blasio’s name. It directs viewers to visit ok2talk.org, an organization that encourages youth who struggle with mental illness to talk about their experiences.

According to the video, Chiara de Blasio has completed treatment and is now trying to reach out to others.

“It’s just important for people to realize, anybody who is watching this, that if you’re suffering and if you’re depressed, you’re dealing with mental illness, and you think that it might have something to do with your drug abuse or drinking, or if you’re just suffering from both of those at the same time and you think that they’re completely unrelated to one another,” she says, “getting sober is always a positive thing.”

De Blasio makes minimal reference to her parents, not naming either and mentioning only that both were “very emotionally committed to try to figure out some way to get me better.”

Participating in her father’s campaign after completing treatment “was like the greatest thing ever,” de Blasio says, although she doesn’t specify that it was the mayoral race.

White House Drug Policy Director Gil Kerlikowske issued a statement Tuesday afternoon praising the young de Blasio for speaking out.

“Chiara is giving a voice to the millions who suffer from substance use and mental health disorders, and we encourage others to join her,” he said.

“By talking about addiction in the light of day – and by celebrating recovery out loud – we can help correct the misinformation and stigma that too often become obstacles for the millions of Americans who deserve to live healthy, productive lives,” Kerlikowske said.

De Blasio decided to speak out “because people are suffering from this disease and dying from this disease every day. And we really can’t do anything as a society to help those people until we start talking about it,” she says. “And nobody can do sobriety on their own.”"

Michelle Obama was first-term success but what about the next%3F

Some say she is overexposed%2C appearing everywhere from TV talk shows to the Oscars

It%27s clear she%27ll continue to support military families and the fight against childhood obesity

She's already danced on TV with Jimmy Fallon. She's dropped in at the Oscars, worked out on the White House lawn, sparkled at state dinners, become a fashion trendsetter. She's even gotten Americans to think more about what they eat. What's next for first lady Michelle Obama?

From her new bangs-and-bob hairstyle to her dance moves to her couture gowns, people can't stop talking about her — and she kind of can't be avoided. She's a master of Twitter, a star of TV talk shows, a crowd-pleaser wherever she goes.

But is she overexposed? Are we going to see even more of her on our screens in the next four years?

Granted, she did not attend Saturday night's Gridiron Dinner with the president and the Washington press corps. But no less than Saturday Night Live is joking about her ubiquity, teasing in a recent skit that the sequester budget cuts would force her to make ""four television appearances a week, down from her usual 75.""

Obama, who just turned 49, is fully aware of the intensity of attention to everything she does. ""My bangs set off a national conversation,"" Obama told reporters on a recent trip, after she had joked that the bangs were her ""midlife crisis."" ""We've got a lot of talking going on. Everybody's kitchen-table conversation is now accessible to everybody else. It's absolutely not surprising.""

According to the White House, she and her staff are in the midst of strategizing how the next four years might differ, or might not, from her first term as FLOTUS, generally hailed as a rousing success with her clever blending of conventional and unconventional.

""I can't think of too much to criticize,"" says Anita McBride, former chief of staff to Laura Bush and now director of first-lady studies at American University in Washington. ""Is she pushing the envelope? Not for her. I think she's clearly found her footing.""

It's not as if Obama had a lot of training. A lawyer and non-profit executive, she was not a longtime political wife, never lived in Washington, didn't do politics, didn't even much want her husband to run for president.Syndicated columnist Kathleen Parker writes that Obama is having fun as the star of her own movie. ""She isn't just breaking the mold; she's shattering the good china. The Madonna of first ladies, she is emerging as an iconoclastic, self-reinventing woman who clearly doesn't mind shaking the firmament.""

Since 2009, her East Wing has undergone typical staff upheavals: She is on her third chief of staff, her second press secretary, her second communications director and her third social secretary (who is, for the first time, a man).

But she adapted to the undefined job of first lady like a pro, say those who have watched her. Polls show she's become one of the most popular, admired women in the world, able to persuade kids to eat their vegetables or make an unknown fashion designer like Jason Wu a global star.

""She's been a tremendous success. I don't know of any who had more success with a White House initiative,"" says Myra Gutin, a dean of first-lady historians and professor of communication at Rider University in New Jersey.

Obama has done all the traditional, popular first-lady things — adopted causes, hosted the grand, good and glittery at the White House, raised millions for her husband. But she has gone, repeatedly, where no first lady has gone before, especially on social media, which largely didn't exist for her predecessors, and on TV, which did.

She has embraced media in ways her predecessors did not. At the same time, she maintains a loyal, non-leaking, highly controlled operation that is at least as non-transparent as the White House press corps says the West Wing is. (Except no one is complaining about it.)

Meanwhile, she's tweeting, and even does Twitter Q&As. She hangs out on Google Hangout, has about 9.5 million ""likes"" on her Facebook page, and live-streams with first pooch Bo, greeting surprised tourists or reading stories to kids at the White House. The video of her wacky ""Evolution of Mom-Dancing"" with Fallon has more than 14.5 million views on YouTube. She tells funny stories when she goes on Jay Leno's or David Letterman's late-night chat show.

Once, Obama went to Target, to the shock of fellow shoppers.

She says she misses that freedom. ​""Going to Target for me is like a dream, you know?"" she told Robin Roberts in a recent Good Morning America interview. ""That one time I went, you noticed it created a stir. I'm gonna do it again, doggone it. Next four years, I'm going out. I'm breaking out. I'm gonna disguise Bo. I'm gonna put on a coat. I'm gonna take a walk, and my agents won't know a thing. Don't tell 'em!""​

This sort of thing is irresistible, say Obama trackers. ""In real-life America, this woman is genuinely admired and, in an odd way, genuinely liked, even if people don't know her — she's not just a remote figure from afar,"" says Elizabeth Mehren, a former journalist who is now a journalism professor at Boston University. ""There is a likability factor — the sense that if you sat down and had coffee with her, you'd like her.""

Gutin says she first understood how much different Obama would be from her predecessors when Gutin was invited to the White House to watch her plant her now-world-famous kitchen garden with a group of Washington schoolchildren.

""There she was in her knee-level sweats, in the ground, talking to them about eating fruits and vegetables, getting dirty with everybody else,"" Gutin says. ""I thought, well this is really pretty interesting.""

Obama has been cautious, so she's made few mistakes. She's done and said nothing that could be seized as an effective cudgel against the Obama administration, along the lines of former first lady Hillary Clinton's highly contentious attempt to preside over health care policy in her husband's administration.

And yet, some people, mostly opponents of her husband, are asking, in the language of TV, has Michelle Obama jumped the shark?

""No, that's ridiculous. She's not playing a character in a '50s sitcom,"" scoffs Barbara Lippert, a MediaPost.com columnist who covers the intersection of the media and pop culture. Millions of viewers on YouTube can't be all wrong, Lippert adds.

""Only the worst curmudgeon would make fun of that — it was a wonderful way to show people to get moving. Plus, I bet JCrew sold a lot of that sweater set she was wearing,"" she says.

Obama herself says she's not bothered by criticism of her ubiquity. ""I don't think about that stuff,"" she told reporters last week. ""It doesn't have anything to do with me. Anyone in this position has a huge spotlight, and in modern-day media, the spotlight just gets more intense. I don't attribute this to me or Barack. The culture has just shifted.""

It's not unusual for a first lady's comments and actions to be used against her husband, but Obama has not given opponents much to work with. Her remark during the 2008 campaign that for the first time she was ""proud"" of her country has faded into irrelevance, and her first-year expensive vacation in Spain with her daughters has not been repeated.

Then her drop-in at the Oscars ceremony on Feb. 24, when she announced the best-picture winner live from the White House, seemed at first to be promising for some critics: It made her vulnerable to claims that she is overexposed, Lippert says.

""It makes both the president and the first lady seem small and grasping,"" huffed The Washington Post's conservative columnist Jennifer Rubin. ""In this case, it was just downright weird.""

But not entirely unprecedented. President Reagan, a former movie star, once taped an appearance for the Oscars; former first lady Laura Bush once appeared on tape discussing movies at the Oscars; and President Franklin Roosevelt once spoke by radio at the Oscars. But never mind, even a few liberal pundits were miffed.

""Unbecoming frivolities,"" thundered the Post's popular metro columnist Courtland Milloy.

Elitist, declared MSNBC's Donny Deutsch, a Democrat, on CNN. ""I just thought it was very, very tone-deaf, and I'm just surprised they did it.""

Still, is this the best they've got?

""The people who are mean, the professional nasties — they don't have a case, so they're grasping for one,"" Mehren says.

But is there just ... well, too much of her? ""Two billion people watched her at the Oscars, so her exposure is tremendous, and it's following on the heels of a very popular appearance on the Jimmy Fallon show, where she was clearly having fun,"" McBride says.

More to the point, she says, ""a second term is very liberating because the campaigning is behind you,"" McBride says. ""There is a recognition that this time period passes so quickly and there's lots to do. I think (the FLOTUS staffers) are going to evaluate the success of the programs they already have.""​​

First-lady projects are designed to be non-controversial. Who could be against highway beautification or literacy? Obama chose to focus on military families and healthy eating and exercise to fight childhood obesity.

She's been tireless in promoting these projects in ways that rivet public attention: She invited military families to dinners at the White House and a special inaugural ball just for them. She did push-ups with Ellen DeGeneres, cooked with Rachael Ray, goofed off at the White House with Big Bird, and donned workout togs to do jumping jacks with crowds of

kiddies on the White House lawn.

Right-wing pundits such as Rush Limbaugh have periodically assailed her anti-obesity campaign as government meddling and called her a hypocrite every time she's seen eating something tasty — pizza, short ribs, etc. — in public, but Limbaugh himself has battled to lose weight. In any case, few others have objected to her causes, even if they don't like her bangs or her fashion choices.

Obama can also point to being effective. Obesity rates among children are starting to decline, corporate titans such as Walmart have joined her crusade, healthier food options are turning up in neighborhoods where few have been spotted before. Now she's pushing to bring back more PE classes to public schools, and she enlisted Nike to provide $50 million in seed money. She's managed to sign up the likes of Beyoncé and Sesame Street to help her get kids moving.

She might adopt a new cause in the new term, but it's already clear she will continue to promote her current projects. And she'll have two teenage daughters to raise.

""But she doesn't need to come up with second act. She's doing a fine job,"" Mehren says.

""She's cracked the code on first ladies,"" says Lippert.

In her position, Obama was always going to be scrutinized. McBride says she figured out how to project a classy image at home and abroad, while ""writing her own job description and being her own CEO.

""She can measure up to those who came before her."""

But many conservatives consider that insufficient to meet the Williamsburg agreement, which they hold requires a path to balancing the budget within a decade."

“It is paramount, essential, urgent that the Egyptian economy get stronger, that it gets back on its feet,” Mr. Kerry told a group of Egyptian and American business executives in Cairo. “It’s clear to us that the I.M.F. arrangement needs to be reached, that we need to give the market that confidence.”

Mr. Kerry’s visit — his first trip to an Arab capital as secretary of state — comes at a time of economic peril in Egypt. The country’s economy has teetered near collapse for months, with soaring unemployment, a gaping budget deficit, dwindling hard-currency reserves and steep declines in the currency’s value.

The fund’s loan is critical, economists say, because it would provide a seal of approval that Egypt’s economy is on a path toward self-sufficiency, allowing it to obtain enough other international loans to fill in its deficit. Both the United States and the European Union are prepared to provide substantial additional assistance if Egypt and the I.M.F. can come to terms."
http://news.yahoo.com/debt-ceiling-senate-vote-172019220.html,,[],Senate could vote this week to raise the debt ceiling,"Senate Democrats are considering holding a vote on a bill to increase the federal debt limit as early as this week, senior Senate Democratic leadership aides told Yahoo News.

Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid’s plan, as first reported by Greg Sargent of the Washington Post, would give Senate lawmakers an opportunity to vote on a “clean” increase of the debt limit — one with no extra amendments attached.



President Barack Obama and Democratic leaders have called for a “clean” debt ceiling increase, but congressional Republicans say they will insist upon broad budget reforms as part of an agreement to raise the limit.

The Treasury Department estimates that the federal government will run out of money by Oct. 17, barring congressional action to increase the nation’s borrowing limit. Not doing so could cause the government to default on the interest of its $16.7 trillion debt, which economists predict would be disastrous for the economy.

Senate Democratic leaders are confident they have the votes to pass a debt limit increase, so long as Republicans allow it to pass by a majority vote. Senate Republicans could filibuster, which would require a 60-vote threshold to overcome. An aide to Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the top Democratic vote counter in the Senate, told Yahoo News that a clean bill would receive support from all 54 Senate Democrats, meaning six Republicans would need to join them to overcome a GOP filibuster.

Because of the dire economic consequences of not raising the debt limit, holding a vote now could put Republicans in a tough position and give Democrats fodder to blame the GOP if there is a default.



Even if it passes the Senate, the debt limit bill could result in the same kind of standoff between the Democrat-controlled upper chamber and the Republican-majority House currently happening over funding the government. In an interview with ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday, Republican House Speaker John Boehner said there aren’t enough votes in the House to approve a clean bill.

The debate over the debt limit comes while tensions are already high in the nation's capital one week into a federal government shutdown that has left more than 800,000 federal workers furloughed and many government services out of commission."

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)

With 2013 just over two hours old, the Senate voted 89-8 on Tuesday to approve a last-minute deal to avert income tax hikes on all but the richest Americans and stall painful spending cuts as part of a hard-fought compromise to avoid the economically toxic “fiscal cliff.”

The country had already technically tumbled over the cliff by the time the gavel came down on the vote at 2:07 a.m.. The House of Representatives was not due to return to work to take up the measure until midday on Tuesday. But with financial markets closed for New Year's Day, quick action by lawmakers would likely limit the economic damage.

The lopsided margin belied anxiety on both sides about the deal, which emerged from barely two days of talks between Vice President Joe Biden and Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. Among the “no” votes: Republican Senator Marco Rubio, widely thought to have his eye on the 2016 presidential race.

In remarks just before the vote, McConnell repeatedly called the agreement “imperfect” but said it beat allowing income tax rates rise across the board.

“I know I can speak for my entire conference when I say we don’t think taxes should be going up on anyone, but we all knew that if we did nothing they’d be going up on everyone today,” he said. “We weren’t going to let that happen.”

“Our most important priority was to protect middle-class families. This legislation does that,” Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said. But Reid cautioned that “passing this agreement does not mean negotiations halt. Far from it.”

Compromises on tax rates

Under the compromise arrangement, taxes would rise on income above $400,000 for individuals and $450,000 for households, while exemptions and deductions the wealthiest Americans use to reduce their tax bill would face new limits. The accord would also raise the taxes paid on large inheritances from 35% to 40% for estates over $5 million. And it would extend by one year unemployment benefits for some two million Americans. It would also prevent cuts in payments to doctors who treat Medicare patients and spare tens of millions of Americans who otherwise would have been hit with the Alternative Minimum Tax.



Story continues

The middle class will still see its taxes go up: The final deal did not include an extension of the payroll tax holiday. And the overall package will deepen the deficit by hundreds of billions of dollars by extending the overwhelming majority of the Bush tax cuts. Many Democrats had opposed those measures in 2001 and 2003. Obama agreed to extend them in 2010.

Efforts to modify the first installment of $1.2 trillion in cuts to domestic and defense programs over 10 years -- the other portion of the “fiscal cliff,” known as sequestration -- had proved a sticking point late in the game. Democrats had sought a year-long freeze but ultimately caved to Republican pressure and signed on to just a two-month delay while broader deficit-reduction talks continue.

Debt-limit battle looms

That would put the next major battle over spending cuts right around the time that the White House and its Republican foes are battling it out over whether to raise the country's debt limit. Republicans have vowed to push for more spending cuts, equivalent to the amount of new borrowing. Obama has vowed not to negotiate as he did in 2011, when a bruising fight threatened the first-ever default on America's obligations and resulted in the first-ever downgrade of the country's credit rating. Biden sent that message to Democrats in Congress, two senators said.

Experts had warned that the fiscal cliff's tax increases and spending cuts, taken together, could plunge the still-fragile economy into a new recession.

Biden, evidently in good spirits after playing a central role in crafting the deal, said little on his way into or out of a roughly one hour and 45 minute meeting behind closed doors with Senate Democrats. ""Happy New Year,"" he said on the way in. Asked on the way out what his chief selling point had been, the vice president reportedly replied: ""Me.""

Biden's intervention; hurdles in the House

Hours earlier, a Democratic Senate aide told Yahoo News that ""the White House and Republicans have a deal,"" while a source familiar with the negotiations said President Barack Obama had discussed the compromise with Reid and Democratic House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and ""they both signed off.""

But the House’s Republican leaders, including Speaker John Boehner, hinted in an unusual joint statement that they might amend anything that clears the Senate – a step that could kill the deal.

“Decisions about whether the House will seek to accept or promptly amend the measure will not be made until House members -- and the American people -- have been able to review the legislation,” they said.



Biden, a 36-year Senate veteran, worked out the agreement with McConnell after talks between Obama and Boehner collapsed and a similar effort between McConnell and Reid followed suit shortly thereafter. With the deal mostly done, Obama made a final push at the White House.

“Today, it appears that an agreement to prevent this New Year's tax hike is within sight, but it's not done,” Obama said in hastily announced midday remarks at the White House. “There are still issues left to resolve, but we're hopeful that Congress can get it done – but it’s not done.”

""One thing we can count on with respect to this Congress is that if there is even one second left before you have to do what you’re supposed to do, they will use that last second,"" he said.

Obama’s remarks – by turns scolding, triumphant, and mocking of Congress – came after talks between McConnell and Biden appeared to seal the breakthrough deal.

“I can report that we’ve reached an agreement on all of the tax issues,” McConnell said on the Senate floor moments later. “We are very, very close to an agreement.”

The Kentucky Republican later briefed Republicans on the details of the deal. Lawmakers emerged from that closed-door session offered hopeful appraisals that, after clearing a few last-minute hurdles, they could vote on New Year’s Eve or with 2013 just hours old.

“Tonight, I hope,” Republican Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee told reporters. “It may be at 1, 2, 3, 4 in the morning. Oh, I guess that’s technically tomorrow.”

Reckoning with the 'sequester'

Republican Senators said negotiators were still working on a way to forestall two months of the “sequester” spending cuts, about $20 billion worth. And some expressed disquiet that the tentative compromise ran high on tax increases and low on spending cuts -- while warning that failure to act, triggering some $600 billion in income tax increases on all Americans who pay it and draconian spending cuts, was the worse option.

McConnell earlier had called for a vote on the tax component of the deal.

“Let me be clear: We’ll continue to work on finding smarter ways to cut spending, but let’s not let that hold up protecting Americans from the tax hike,” McConnell urged. “Let’s pass the tax relief portion now. Let’s take what’s been agreed to and get moving.”



House passage was not a sure thing: Both the AFL-CIO labor union and the conservative Heritage Action organization argued against the package.

The breakthrough came after McConnell announced Sunday that he had started to negotiate with Biden in a bid to ""jump-start"" stalled talks to avoid the fiscal cliff.

Under their tentative deal, the top tax rate on household income above $450,000 would rise from 35 percent to 39.6 percent -- where it was under Bill Clinton, before the reductions enacted under George W. Bush in 2001 and 2003.

Some congressional liberals had expressed objections to extending tax cuts above the $250,000 income threshold Obama cited throughout the 2012 campaign. Democrats were huddling in private as well to work out whether they could support the arrangement.

Obama responds to critics

Possibly with balking progressives in mind, Obama trumpeted victories dear to the left of his party. ""The potential agreement that’s being talked about would not only make sure the taxes don’t go up on middle-class families, it also would extend tax credits for families with children. It would extend our tuition tax credit that’s helped millions of families pay for college. It would extend tax credits for clean energy companies that are creating jobs and reducing our dependence on foreign oil. It would extend unemployment insurance to 2 million Americans who are out there still actively looking for a job.""

Obama said he had hoped for ""a larger agreement, a bigger deal, a grand bargain,"" to stem the tide of red ink swamping the country’s finances – but shelved that goal.

""With this Congress, that was obviously a little too much to hope for at this time,"" he said. ""It may be we can do it in stages. We’re going to solve this problem instead in several steps.""

The president also looked ahead to his next budgetary battle with Republicans, warning that “any future deficit agreement” will have to couple spending cuts with tax increases. He expressed a willingness to reduce spending on popular programs like Medicare, but said entitlement reform would have to go hand in hand with new tax revenues.

“If Republicans think that I will finish the job of deficit reduction through spending cuts alone … then they’ve another thing coming,” Obama said defiantly. “That’s not how it’s going to work.”

“If we’re serious about deficit reduction and debt reduction, then it’s going to have to be a matter of shared sacrifice. At least as long as I’m president. And I’m going to be president for the next four years, I hope,” he said.

The other “no” votes were: Michael Bennet (D-Col.), Tom Carper (D-Del.), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Rand Paul (R-Ken.), and Richard Shelby (R-Ala.). Republicans Jim DeMint of South Carolina and Mark Kirk of Illinois as well as Democrat Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey did not vote.

Des Moines Register

Last month%2C Cruz kicked off a controversial campaign to stymie Obamacare

Cruz spoke Friday at the Republican Party of Iowa%27s annual Ronald Reagan fundraising dinner

The audience greeted him with a 36-second standing ovation

Conservative purist Ted Cruz addressed the concerns of any Iowa Republicans who reject him as too rigid, arguing he knows exactly how to unify the GOP and how to turn the country around.

The answer: ""Restore historic economic growth,"" he said.

Cruz, a U.S. senator from Texas, who has been drawn to the presidential testing grounds of Iowa three times now in less than three months, told an audience of about 600 at the Republican Party of Iowa's annual Ronald Reagan fundraising dinner: ""We need to come together.""

""And let me tell you, growth and principles are ideas that unify Republicans,"" he said. ""They are principles and ideals that unify the evangelical community, the liberty movement and the business community. Growth and freedom are principles that bring together Main Street and the tea party.""

Last month, Cruz kicked off a controversial campaign to stymie Obamacare, the federal law requiring almost all Americans to carry health insurance, with a 21-hour pseudo-filibuster. The battle between conservative and Democratic members of Congress led to a 16-day federal government shutdown and took the country to what some Americans considered an alarming near-default on its debts.

The Des Moines Register reported Friday morning that some Iowa Republicans believe Cruz is the embodiment of the war inside the GOP. They see him as the tip of the spear of anti-establishment rage that is tearing apart the coalition of Republicans that has existed since the Reagan era: fiscal conservatives, social conservatives and national security conservatives.

If Cruz were to run for president, his campaign might leave him with only the fiercest tea party defenders, those center-right voters and political strategists say.

In a 45-minute speech, Cruz said over and over that working ""collectively"" is the only way to protect the nation from those who want to impose health insurance mandates, pile on more national debt, assault gun rights and hurt other constitutional rights.

It was the GOP's failure to stand together, he said, that killed the effort to defund Obamacare.

""We didn't accomplish our ultimate policy goal in this battle, and we didn't because unfortunately a significant number of Senate Republicans chose not to unite and stand side by side with House Republicans,"" he said. ""Had we stood together I'm convinced the outcome of this fight would be very, very different. But listen, none of us ever thought that taking on the Washington establishment was going to be easy.""

He added: ""Right now I'm more encouraged than ever.""

As Cruz took the stage, the audience greeted him with a 36-second standing ovation.

""I promise that I'll do everything humanly possible to try to speak for less than 21 hours,"" Cruz told them. ""You know I'm nearing to end when I bring out and begin to read 'The Cat in the Hat.'''

Twenty-one hours, he said, referring to his Sept. 24 speech on the Senate floor, is a long time.

""That's almost as long as it takes to sign up on the Obamacare website,"" he joked, referring to the troubled rollout of healthcare.gov, a site meant to help millions of uninsured Americans sign up for health insurance.

When Cruz came to Iowa in July, he had his father, a Cuban immigrant, in tow. This time his wife, Heidi, was by his side, and he made repeated references to their two young daughters, Catherine and Caroline.

Some center-right Republicans skipped the traditional fundraising dinner to express distaste for both Cruz and the current liberty movement-oriented leadership at party headquarters.

Republican Party of Iowa Co-Chairman David Fischer referenced that rift in his opening remarks.

""There are some of the old guard in the Grand Old Party that frankly don't approve of the kind of principled leadership being shown by the new conservative leaders like Sens. Cruz, (Rand) Paul and (Mike) Lee,"" he said, referring to the conservative senators from Texas, Kentucky and Utah.

""Some Republicans have even gone so far as to call them names. Well, I have a name for these new leaders, too,"" Fischer said. ""I call them the future.""

Republicans describe the fissure in different ways.

A center-right national strategist, Mike Murphy, has been talking this week about what he sees as two schools of thought in GOP.

The ""mathematicians"" look at the GOP's losing streak and say the party needs to make real changes to attract voters beyond the old Republican base of white guys, Murphy told the Washington Post.

The ""priests"" are focused on sins that the GOP is against, and they argue a lack of ideological purity is what loses elections, Murphy said.

When the Register asked Cruz where he falls, he scoffed.

""I do always finds it amusing that political strategists who manage to lose national elections immediately share their wisdom to others about how to continue losing national elections,"" he said in an interview earlier in the week.

Politicians can be hybrids of the two categories – politics is about the spectrum, not the absolutes, center-right strategists say. But not Cruz, Murphy told the Register in an email Friday night.

He's a purist and a priest, Murphy said.

""It's not a question of purity,"" Cruz told the Register. ""It's a question of standing for common-sense conservative principles that are shared throughout this country that have been part of the American fabric of every small town and every small business and in families all across this country.""

Cruz said every Republican presidential candidate who ran as a strong conservative won — Nixon in 1968 and 1972, Reagan in 1980 and 1984, George H.W. Bush in 1988, George W. Bush in 2000 and 2004. And those that ran as an establishment moderate lost — Ford in 1976, George H.W. Bush in 1992, Dole in 1996, McCain in 2008 and Romney in 2012, Cruz said.

""After looking at that 40-year pattern,"" he said, ""the D.C. strategists all say we need more establishment moderates because they haven't won in four decades, but next time, trust us, they're going to win. That's not a pattern to electoral success.""

The Register interviewed 10 Republicans at the dinner, and each firmly agreed that division in the GOP means trouble.

""Political parties are designed to win elections. It's the only reason they exist,"" said Keith Christiansen, 18, a student at Grandview University in Des Moines. ""You cannot control the government if your party is fighting amongst itself. The in-fighting is horrible.""

But the chairman of the Iowa GOP, A.J. Spiker, told the audience that conservatives at the right-most side of the spectrum aren't budging.

""The Republican party is at a crossroads to determine the type of party it wishes to be,"" he said.

Those in ""the permanent political establishment"" who say it's necessary to water down the GOP message to try to win elections, Spiker said, won't succeed."

His Latest Book Is', 'Code Red', 'How Progressives', 'Moderates Can Unite To Save Our Country.']",E.J. Dionne: Political dysfunctions spells trouble for democracies,"We know American politics are dysfunctional. But after a week of scandal obsession during which the nation’s capital and the media virtually ignored the problems most voters care about — jobs, incomes, growth, opportunity, education — it’s worth asking if there is something especially flawed about our democracy.

Our circumstances certainly have their own particular disabilities: a radicalization of conservative politics, over-the-top mistrust of President Obama on the right, high-tech gerrymandering in the House and a Senate snarled by non-constitutional super-majority requirements.

Still, while it may not be much of a comfort, the democratic distemper is not a peculiarly American phenomenon. Across most of the democratic world, there is an impatience bordering on exhaustion with electoral systems and political classes.

Citizen dissatisfaction is hardly surprising in the wake of a deeply damaging economic downturn. That doesn’t make the challenge any less daunting. We should consider whether democracy itself is in danger of being discredited. Politicians might usefully disentangle themselves from their day-to-day power struggles long enough to take seriously their responsibility to a noble idea and the systems that undergird it.

It’s not hard to discover that this conundrum is global and not just our own. “Has democracy had its day?” is the headline on Columbia University historian Mark Mazower’s cover story in the May issue of Prospect, a British magazine. The subhead: “Electoral politics has had a bad decade.”

Earlier this month, the Transatlantic Academy, a global partnership of think tanks led by the German Marshall Fund of the United States, issued “The Democratic Disconnect,” a sober report by a group of distinguished academics.

“Democracy is in trouble,” the report begins. “The collective engagement of a concerned citizenry for the public good — the bedrock of a healthy democracy — is eroding. Democratic governments often seem crippled in their capacity to deliver what their people want and need. They are neither as responsive nor as accountable as they need to be in an era of hard choices and rising nondemocratic powers. There is widespread concern about apparent declining rates of voter participation and about the alienation or disaffection of citizens from the political process.”

In Europe, the authors noted, “there is fear that the distance between ordinary citizens and the politicians and bureaucrats in Brussels compromises democratic legitimacy.” In the United States, “lamentations about gridlock and polarization are the order of the day.” Even our peaceable neighbor Canada is not immune. “Canadians,” they write, “worry about the tendency of their political system to place largely unaccountable power in the hands of the prime minister.”

The report does include some useful suggestions for reviving the democratic spirit and improving democratic practice. But it is not alarmist to be uneasy about democracy’s prospects. Ernst Hillebrand, the head of international policy analysis for the Friedrich Ebert Foundation, the German Social Democratic Party’s think tank, describes a chilling finding in a 2009 survey by the German polling firm Forsa: “that zero percent — yes, zero percent — of workers in Germany believe they can have a significant impact on how policy in Germany is shaped via the ballot box.”

And bear in mind that a poll released last week by the Pew Global Attitudes Project found that Germans are far more satisfied with their country’s situation than are their European neighbors.

In a conversation last week during a visit to Washington, Hillebrand pointed to two streams of discontent the world’s democracies face. One is material. The other might be called spiritual.

On the one side, large numbers of lower-middle-class and working-class voters have seen their economic standing deteriorate over two or three decades. There has been a substantial transfer of wealth and income from labor — which is how most people pay their way — to capital. Productivity gains no longer lead to wage gains. This builds justified frustration.

At the same time, he said, many citizens, especially the young, have enhanced expectations for “participation, self-realization and control over their lives.” They do not see current electoral arrangements in democracies giving them much chance to achieve any of these goals.

Since World War II, bouts of economic growth have allowed democracies to buy their way out of trouble. One can hope this will happen again — and soon. In the meantime, politicians might contemplate their obligations to stewardship of the democratic ideal. They could begin by pondering what an unemployed 28-year-old makes of a ruling elite that expends so much energy feuding over how bureaucrats rewrote a set of talking points.

http://news.yahoo.com/army-says-no-more-tanks-congress-insists-115422396.html,,[],"Army says no to more tanks, but Congress insists","WASHINGTON (AP) — Built to dominate the enemy in combat, the Army's hulking Abrams tank is proving equally hard to beat in a budget battle.

Lawmakers from both parties have devoted nearly half a billion dollars in taxpayer money over the past two years to build improved versions of the 70-ton Abrams.

But senior Army officials have said repeatedly, ""No thanks.""

It's the inverse of the federal budget world these days, in which automatic spending cuts are leaving sought-after pet programs struggling or unpaid altogether. Republicans and Democrats for years have fought so bitterly that lawmaking in Washington ground to a near-halt.

Yet in the case of the Abrams tank, there's a bipartisan push to spend an extra $436 million on a weapon the experts explicitly say is not needed.

""If we had our choice, we would use that money in a different way,"" Gen. Ray Odierno, the Army's chief of staff, told The Associated Press this past week.

Why are the tank dollars still flowing? Politics.

Keeping the Abrams production line rolling protects businesses and good paying jobs in congressional districts where the tank's many suppliers are located.

If there's a home of the Abrams, it's politically important Ohio. The nation's only tank plant is in Lima. So it's no coincidence that the champions for more tanks are Rep. Jim Jordan and Sen. Rob Portman, two of Capitol's Hill most prominent deficit hawks, as well as Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown. They said their support is rooted in protecting national security, not in pork-barrel politics.

""The one area where we are supposed to spend taxpayer money is in defense of the country,"" said Jordan, whose district in the northwest part of the state includes the tank plant.

The Abrams dilemma underscores the challenge that Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel faces as he seeks to purge programs that the military considers unnecessary or too expensive in order to ensure there's enough money for essential operations, training and equipment.

Story continues

Hagel, a former Republican senator from Nebraska, faces a daunting task in persuading members of Congress to eliminate or scale back projects favored by constituents.

Federal budgets are always peppered with money for pet projects. What sets the Abrams example apart is the certainty of the Army's position.

Sean Kennedy, director of research for the nonpartisan Citizens Against Government Waste, said Congress should listen when one of the military services says no to more equipment.

""When an institution as risk averse as the Defense Department says they have enough tanks, we can probably believe them,"" Kennedy said.

Congressional backers of the Abrams upgrades view the vast network of companies, many of them small businesses, that manufacture the tanks' materials and parts as a critical asset that has to be preserved. The money, they say, is a modest investment that will keep important tooling and manufacturing skills from being lost if the Abrams line were to be shut down.

The Lima plant is a study in how federal dollars affect local communities, which in turn hold tight to the federal dollars. The facility is owned by the federal government but operated by the land systems division of General Dynamics, a major defense contractor that spent close to $11 million last year on lobbying, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.

The plant is Lima's fifth-largest employer with close to 700 employees, down from about 1,100 just a few years ago, according to Mayor David Berger. But the facility is still crucial to the local economy. ""All of those jobs and their spending activity in the community and the company's spending probably have about a $100 million impact annually,"" Berger said.

Jordan, a House conservative leader who has pushed for deep reductions in federal spending, supported the automatic cuts known as the sequester that require $42 billion to be shaved from the Pentagon's budget by the end of September. The military also has to absorb a $487 billion reduction in defense spending over the next 10 years, as required by the Budget Control Act passed in 2011.

Still, said Jordan, it would be a big mistake to stop producing tanks.

""Look, (the plant) is in the 4th Congressional District and my job is to represent the 4th Congressional District, so I understand that,"" he said. ""But the fact remains, if it was not in the best interests of the national defense for the United States of America, then you would not see me supporting it like we do.""

The tanks that Congress is requiring the Army to buy aren't brand new. Earlier models are being outfitted with a sophisticated suite of electronics that gives the vehicles better microprocessors, color flat panel displays, a more capable communications system, and other improvements. The upgraded tanks cost about $7.5 million each, according to the Army.

Out of a fleet of nearly 2,400 tanks, roughly two-thirds are the improved versions, which the Army refers to with a moniker that befits their heft: the M1A2SEPv2, and service officials said they have plenty of them. ""The Army is on record saying we do not require any additional M1A2s,"" Davis Welch, deputy director of the Army budget office, said this month.

The tank fleet, on average, is less than 3 years old. The Abrams is named after Gen. Creighton Abrams, one of the top tank commanders during World War II and a former Army chief of staff.

The Army's plan was to stop buying tanks until 2017, when production of a newly designed Abrams would begin. Orders for Abrams tanks from U.S. allies help fill the gap created by the loss of tanks for the Army, according to service officials, but congressional proponents of the program feared there would not be enough international business to keep the Abrams line going.

This pause in tank production for the U.S. would allow the Army to spend its money on research and development work for the new and improved model, said Ashley Givens, a spokeswoman for the Army's Ground Combat Systems office.

The first editions of the Abrams tank were fielded in the early 1980s. Over the decades, the Abrams supply chain has become embedded in communities across the country.

General Dynamics estimated in 2011 that there were more than 560 subcontractors throughout the country involved in the Abrams program and that they employed as many as 18,000 people. More than 40 of the companies are in Pennsylvania, according to Sen. Robert Casey, D-Pa., also a staunch backer of continued tank production.

A letter signed by 173 Democratic and Republican members of the House last year and sent to then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta demonstrated the depth of bipartisan support for the Abrams program on Capitol Hill. They chided the Obama administration for neglecting the industrial base and proposing to terminate tank production in the United States for the first time since World War II.

Portman, who served as President George W. Bush's budget director before being elected to the Senate, said allowing the line to wither and close would create a financial mess.

""People can't sit around for three years on unemployment insurance and wait for the government to come back,"" Portman said. ""That supply chain is going to be much more costly and much more inefficient to create if you mothball the plant.""

Pete Keating, a General Dynamics spokesman, said the money from Congress is allowing for a stable base of production for the Army, which receives about four tanks a month. With the line open, Lima also can fill international orders, bringing more work to Lima and preserving American jobs, he said.

Current foreign customers are Saudi Arabia, which is getting about five tanks a month, and Egypt, which is getting four. Each country pays all of their own costs. That's a ""success story during a period of economic pain,"" Keating said.

Still, far fewer tanks are coming out of the Lima plant than in years past. The drop-off has affected companies such as Verhoff Machine and Welding in Continental, Ohio, which makes seats and other parts for the Abrams. Ed Verhoff, the company's president, said his sales have dropped from $20 million to $7 million over the past two years. He's also had to lay off about 25 skilled employees and he expects to be issuing more pink slips in the future.

""When we start to lose this base of people, what are we going to do? Buy our tanks from China?"" Verhoff said.

Steven Grundman, a defense expert at the Atlantic Council in Washington, said the difficulty of reviving defense industrial capabilities tends to be overstated.

""From the fairly insular world in which the defense industry operates, these capabilities seem to be unique and in many cases extraordinarily high art,"" said Grundman, a former deputy undersecretary of defense for industrial affairs and installations during the Clinton administration. ""But in the greater scope of the economy, they tend not to be.""

If the debate proceeds as it has -- many times -- in the past, then most Democrats will embrace the president’s message and back the proposal, while most Republicans will oppose it, on the grounds that higher labor costs will lead to higher unemployment.

But we shouldn’t rely on political opinions in this debate. Facts clearly demonstrate that raising the minimum wage is a bad idea.

The case against raising the minimum wage is straightforward: A higher wage makes it more expensive for firms to hire workers. How big an effect does this have on the job market? Economists debate this. But no one argues that increasing the minimum wage increases the number of unemployed workers who find jobs. In the end, the trade-off is clear. People who keep their jobs get more money; those who lose their jobs, or fail to get new ones, suffer.

In announcing his proposal to increase the minimum wage, the president argued that doing so would alleviate poverty. The president is certainly correct to turn his attention to the poor, many of whom have been suffering for years in a tough economy. And it is clearly desirable for households that engage in full-time work not to live in poverty. But increasing the minimum wage would not accomplish this goal.

Research published in 2010 by economists Joseph Sabia and Richard Burkhauser concluded that if the federal minimum wage were increased from $7.25 an hour to $9.50 an hour (remember that the president’s proposal is to increase the minimum wage to $9 per hour), only 11.3% of workers who would gain from the increase belong to poor households.

Why?

First, many people who live in poverty do not work, and would thus be unaffected by an increase in the minimum wage. In addition, workers who earn the minimum wage are generally not the primary breadwinners in their households. They are secondary earners -- an elderly parent earning some retirement income or a spouse with a part-time job. Or they are young people living with their parents. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that while workers under age 25 make up only about 20% of those who earn hourly wages, they constitute about half of all workers earning the minimum wage or less. Raising the minimum wage is therefore an ineffective anti-poverty proposal.

The case for a higher minimum wage grows even weaker when you stop to consider that there are vastly superior alternatives for steering money to low-income households. For example, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has found that expanding the earned income tax credit is a much more efficient way to fight poverty than increasing the minimum wage.

Why have we so often embraced a less effective tool? A tax credit is less politically palatable because it takes money directly out of federal coffers, while the minimum wage can be raised without it showing up directly on the government’s books. The cost of a higher wage is borne by employers and consumers -- and by the unfortunate people who end up not working because of it.

It is also important to consider the president’s proposal to increase the minimum wage in the context of today’s labor market. The unemployment rate for African American teenagers stands at a staggeringly high 43.1%. For white teenagers, the unemployment rate is 22.1%; a little more than 11% of workers older than 25 and without a high school diploma are unemployed.

To put these numbers in perspective, overall unemployment at the height of the Depression was about 25%. Especially for low-skill workers and for young workers, the two groups of workers who will be disproportionately hit by a minimum-wage increase, ours is a labor market in crisis. Increasing the cost of job creation now is unwise.

One reason public officials continue to embrace such a bad idea is that it’s popular, and thus can provide an opportunity to score political points. The last time we had this debate, it was President George W. Bush who signed a minimum-wage increase into law. The fact that even a Republican president did so shows just how tempting this policy is to politicians.

The head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Rep. Steve Israel, knows this. He told the Washington Post last month that the minimum wage was “a reminder to suburban independent voters that House Republicans are extreme, and out of touch.” Rep. Nancy Pelosi seconded that notion, explaining to the Post that Democrats intend to embrace a simple message: “We want to raise the minimum wage, and you don’t. Why not?”

Why not support increasing the minimum wage? Because it will make it more expensive for businesses to hire young and low-skill workers at a time of crisis-level unemployment. Because it will not alleviate poverty. Because there are much better alternatives to help poor families, and because the minimum wage is a dishonest approach that hides the true cost of the policy."
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/18/immigration-bill-opposition_n_3109770.html,2013-04-18 00:00:00,"['Senior Political Correspondent', 'Yahoo']",Immigration Bill Opposition Building Among Conservatives,"WASHINGTON -- The limits of Marco Rubio's persuasive powers and charm, and the depth of conservative reservations about immigration reform, are beginning to show themselves.

Rubio, the Republican Florida senator who is spearheading outreach to the Republican base and to conservative talk radio hosts, was unable to persuade one of the top radio figures on the right to support the Senate's immigration reform effort when he appeared on The Mark Levin Show Wednesday night.

Levin, a former Reagan administration official, was pleasant and polite with Rubio during his 17-minute interview with the senator. But his skepticism was clear, and he referred to undocumented immigrants as ""illegal aliens."" On Thursday morning, he made his opposition to the Senate effort official. Levin posted a note on his Facebook page that said, ""Count me out: the border is NOT secured and Obama cannot be trusted, period.""

Levin linked to a site that referred to Rubio as a ""slick used car salesman."" Levin said later Thursday morning that he wished he had not linked to the site criticizing Rubio.

""While I oppose the immigration bill, given the border-security issue and Obama's record of non-enforcement, among other things, I regret linking to a post that refers to Senator Rubio as a slick used car salesman,"" Levin wrote. ""He is earnest and thoughtful and deserves much better. He loves his country and means well, unlike too many politicians. There are slick used car salesmen on Capitol Hill, many come to mind, but Rubio is certainly not one of them.""

But he's not the only one. Heritage Foundation President Jim DeMint, a former South Carolina senator who is a friend of Rubio's and was instrumental in helping Rubio get elected in 2010, posted an op-ed Thursday explaining why he thinks the Senate bill that Rubio is pushing is ""flawed.""

DeMint foisted the term ""amnesty"" -- the one-word wrecking ball that killed the 2007 immigration reform effort -- on the immigration reform legislation introduced by the Senate's ""gang of eight"" this week.

""After decades of empty promises on immigration enforcement, Congress simply lacks credibility to keep its promises,"" DeMint said, describing the Senate bill as ""immediate amnesty in the form of provisional status within months and lofty promises of 'strategies' and 'plans' for enforcement years later.""

DeMint decried the creation of a comprehensive bill, and said Congress should ""debate and develop understandable reforms in a transparent step-by-step process that addresses all of the immigration issues."" With that language, DeMint appears to have given himself some wiggle room to support a bill in Congress this year, but not a lot.

Many Republicans see passing an immigration reform bill as crucial to the party's electoral future, given the horrid state of their relationship with Latino voters. But conservatives like DeMint and Levin are not persuaded by that argument.

""We know that is the entitlement programs and the unfunded liability that they are leaving on this generation and the next."" [...] ""This fall is going to give us a great opportunity, I think, to all come together and try and tackle the real problem, which is the entitlements,” Cantor said.

Ah, ""compromise."" In other words, yeah, we're taking hostages. We'll shut down the government over Obamacare AND Social Security and Medicare. As if President Obama hasn't had Social Security and Medicare benefits cuts sitting out there on the negotiating table for every manufactured debt crisis the Republicans come up with. Cantor even says ""the House really is the only one who has consistently engaged in trying to address the spending problem."" As if Democrats haven't agreed to $1.5 trillion in cuts, as if the deficit wasn't actually shrinking.

This time, Obama should take them up on it, at least to the extent of telling them to make him an offer. Take his own offers for cutting the programs off the table and tell them to put theirs out there, since obviously they're not going to bite on his. This time, let Republicans own the cuts to these programs. Make them put their names on them, make them insist that unless they get those cuts, they'll shut down government. There's a template out there already for that. Just ask Bill Clinton and Newt Gingrich. We all remember how well that worked for Republicans.

Tell President Obama it's the Republicans' turn to own Medicare cuts, and to take the cuts he's offered off the table."

The Nevada Democrat won't be directly involved in the formal House-Senate budget negotiations set to begin Wednesday. But he has been among the most overt in blaming the opposite party -- even before the talks begin. And he has given perhaps the bleakest assessment for a potential compromise on tax increases and cuts to entitlement spending.

""You keep talking about Medicare and Social Security,"" Reid said on Thursday, cutting off a Nevada Public Radio host. ""Get something else in your brain. Stop talking about that. ... There is not going to be a grand bargain.""

He also said Republicans would have to agree on tax-revenue increases for Congress to achieve a large-scale agreement, but they instead have their mind set on ""nothing more on revenue.""

""And until they get off that kick, there's not going to be a grand bargain,"" Reid said. ""There's not going to be a small bargain. The only people who feel there shouldn't be more [tax money] coming in to the federal government from the rich people are the Republicans in the Congress. Everybody else, including the rich people, is willing to pay more. They want to pay more.""

To be sure, lawmakers, their aides and observers who will be monitoring the talks say entrenched differences over taxes is perhaps the biggest roadblock toward a substantive deal.

Republicans won't agree to more taxes atop the 10-year, $600 billion-plus increase on upper-income earners that President Obama and Democrats muscled through in January. And Democrats won't yield to cuts in benefit programs like Medicare, without higher taxes.

""If we focus on some big, grand bargain then we're going to focus on our differences, and both sides are going to require that the other side compromises some core principle and then we'll get nothing done,"" said House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wis.

Ryan, his party's vice presidential nominee a year ago, and Senate Budget Committee Chairman Patty Murray, D-Wash., are two of the key congressional figures in the talks.

They have already talked informally and say they're seeking ""common ground"" between the sharply different Republican and Democratic budgets.

That would likely involve finding ideas upon which they can agree instead of compromising principles -- including Republicans' opposition to tax increases or many Democrats' unwillingness to consider cutting future Social Security benefits by decreasing the annual cost-of-living adjustments.

Ryan says he's seeking a ""smaller, more achievable objective"" instead of a broader agreement encompassing tax hikes and structural curbs on the relentless growth of benefit programs like Medicare and Medicaid.

Though the pre-meeting talk appears to be limiting Americans' expectations, none so far has included the hard-line positions that led to a partial government shutdown earlier this month and almost resulted in the country exceeding its project debt limit ceiling.

The new deal would be to fund government operations through September 2014. The temporary funding measure that allowed the government to fully reopen last week is set to expire in early January.

If Reid, Ryan and others see one potential agreement in the talks, it would be on the across-the-board federal spending cuts known as sequester.

Sequester mostly hits so-called discretionary spending, the money approved by Congress each year to run agency operations.

Ryan wants to cut autopilot-like spending on so-called entitlement programs like Medicare to ease sequestration's effects on both the Pentagon and domestic programs.

""I think we all agree that there's a smarter way to cut spending"" than sequestration, Ryan said. ""If I can reform entitlement programs where the savings compound annually ... that is more valuable for reducing the debt that a one-time spending cut in discretionary spending.""

The automatic spending cuts are mandated by the failure of the 2011 deficit super committee to reach an agreement. They would carve $91 billion from the day-to-day budgets of the Pentagon and domestic agencies in 2014 compared with the limits set by the 2011 budget deal. The Pentagon would absorb almost 60 percent of the cuts.

Republicans are looking at several cuts to Medicare health care providers found in Obama's budget. They also have voiced support for curbing Social Security cost-of-living adjustments, or COLAs, an idea Obama has backed, but only in the context of a broader deal in which Republicans would allow tax increases. That proposal won't fly in the current talks.

So where might common ground be found? One option embraced by Murray and utilized earlier this year to ease $12 billion worth of sequestration cuts would be to lower spending ""caps"" in future years to offset some of the automatic cuts now. That would save $142 billion over the coming decade.

There are also several super committee ideas like curbing Postal Service cost overruns, making federal workers contribute more to their pensions and raising premiums on higher-income Medicare beneficiaries.

There are also lots of fee proposals contained in Obama's budget, but most of them promise lots of irritation while raising relatively little money. Lawmakers have annually repelled attempts by Obama to increase airline security fees by $18 billion over a decade to help pay for Transportation Security Administration operations.

Democrats, meanwhile, are wary of using cuts to Medicare and other entitlement programs to ease cuts in the defense budget. Negotiators still might explore curbing generous military retirement, health care and prescription drug benefits as a way to restore cuts to readiness and procurement of weapons systems.

http://news.yahoo.com/texas-senator-ted-cruz-blazing-trail-washington-060210411.html,,[],New Texas Senator Ted Cruz blazing a trail in Washington,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - For new U.S. senators, the drill typically goes something like this: Keep quiet once you arrive in Washington, learn how things work and then begin asserting yourself. That is not exactly the path Ted Cruz is taking. He has been in office for barely six weeks, but already the senator from Texas, a favorite of the conservative Tea Party movement, has shown a provocative, in-your-face style that has won him criticism and praise. Cruz, 42, has been chided by Democrats and even fellow Republicans who say he trampled Senate etiquette during contentious hearings in which he went after former Republican Senator Chuck Hagel, Democratic President Barack Obama's nominee for defense secretary. While some Republican leaders have sought to broaden the party's appeal with a more moderate tone on a range of issues, Cruz has unabashedly - and often dramatically - cast himself as a hard-line conservative with a distaste for compromise. He was one of only three senators to vote against Secretary of State John Kerry's confirmation, and sponsored a doomed-to-fail bill to repeal Obama's healthcare overhaul, which some conservatives view as socialized medicine. Cruz voted against both a Hurricane Sandy relief package and raising the government's debt ceiling. Cruz, the son of a Cuban immigrant, has also expressed ""deep concerns"" about a bipartisan Senate plan to give many of the nation's 11 million illegal immigrants a possible path to U.S. citizenship. All of which have made Cruz an intriguing player in Washington at a time when some Republicans are emphasizing social programs and compassionate immigration policies to try to win over Hispanics, who voted overwhelmingly for Obama in the November election. Cruz's early influence in Washington was evident on Tuesday, when a Senate committee hearing on Hagel's nomination as defense secretary essentially became a discussion of Cruz's tactics. In recent weeks, Cruz has suggested that Hagel's nomination was endorsed by Iran, and that Hagel was not being forthcoming enough about his finances. Before the Democratic-led Senate Armed Services Committee voted to back Hagel's confirmation on Tuesday on a party-line, 14-11 vote, Cruz angered lawmakers in both parties by suggesting, without giving evidence, that Hagel might have taken money from countries such as North Korea. That drew a rebuke from Democratic Senator Bill Nelson of Florida, who said Cruz had ""gone over the line."" It also prompted a warning to Cruz from a fellow Republican, John McCain of Arizona, who had sharply questioned Hagel during the hearings and was about to vote against Hagel's nomination. ""No one on this committee at any time should impugn his character or his integrity,"" McCain said of Hagel, a fellow veteran of the Vietnam War. 'A POLITICAL PHENOMENON' Cruz's aggressive approach has made him a favorite conversation piece in Washington, where headlines in recent days have referred to him as an ""attack dog"" and a ""chicken hawk"" - a term used by critics for those who take a strong pro-defense stance but have served little or no time in the armed forces. CNN broadcaster Wolf Blitzer chided Cruz during an interview about the need to compromise. MSNBC host Joe Scarborough, a former Republican congressman from Florida, refused to utter Cruz's name while denouncing the senator's questioning of Hagel at his confirmation hearing as a ""clown show."" Cruz, who declined through an aide to be interviewed for this story, has been unapologetic. ""I view all of that as a sign that maybe we're doing something right,"" he said recently on conservative Glenn Beck's radio show. Cruz's ambition and no-holds-barred style have made him a hero among conservative activists and raised talk that Cruz - like Florida Senator Marco Rubio, another Hispanic rising star among Republicans - might run for president as soon as 2016. ""He's a political phenomenon, and he has managed to become a national figure in a very short period of time,"" said Steve Munisteri, chairman of the Texas Republican Party. ""I have no doubt that a year from now, virtually every Republican activist in the country will know who Ted Cruz is."" But some analysts said Cruz's confrontational approach also put him at risk of being marginalized and portrayed as a political bomb thrower in a gridlocked Congress. ""He talks about issues from an ideological perspective. But has shown no sign of being someone who could sit down and work out a solution to a complicated problem,"" said political scientist Cal Jillson of Southern Methodist University in Dallas. Norm Ornstein, a congressional analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, said Cruz had been pushing the limits on standards of behavior in the tradition-bound Senate. GRASS-ROOTS SUPPORT ""In the modern, cable television-talk radio media age, the more outrageous you are, the more attention you get,"" Ornstein said. ""And Cruz is no dummy. He's a smart, articulate guy. You'll be seeing and hearing him a lot."" Cruz captured his Senate seat after upsetting Texas Lieutenant Governor David Dewhurst, the choice of the state party establishment, in the Republican primary. That followed months of political spade work at small county meetings around the state that won Cruz a dedicated grass-roots following. ""I see Ted as someone who gives a voice and representation to people like me, who feel like they have had no voice and no power,"" said Katrina Pierson, founder of the Grassroots Texans Network and a board member of the Dallas Tea Party, who was an early Cruz supporter. But Cruz, a Harvard Law School graduate who was a clerk for former Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist and served as Texas solicitor general, has also built bridges with more established Republicans eager to court the party's conservative wing and promote a rising Hispanic star. Party leaders gave him a plum speaking slot at last year's national convention, and sought-after appointments to the Senate Judiciary and Armed Services committees once he was elected. They also made him vice chairman of the Senate Republican campaign arm, which will recruit and back candidates in the 2014 elections. The top two Senate Republicans, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and John Cornyn of Texas, both hope to avoid primary challenges from conservatives next year and have sought to strengthen their relationships with Cruz. Cruz accompanied McConnell on a congressional visit to Israel and Afghanistan last month and won an admirer in the process. McConnell told the National Review Online afterward that Cruz was ""ready for prime time on day one, which is pretty unusual for somebody who just got sworn in."" Republican leaders also have been eager for Cruz, whose father was born in Cuba and came to Texas in 1957, to help them gain support among Hispanics. But Cruz refused to back a bipartisan Senate immigration plan, putting him at odds with Rubio and with the views of most Hispanics, who polls show support a broad path to citizenship. ""To allow those who came here illegally to be placed on such a path is both inconsistent with the rule of law and profoundly unfair to the millions of legal immigrants who waited years, if not decades, to come to America legally,"" Cruz said in a statement after the Senate immigration plan was made public. Trey Martinez Fischer, a Democratic state representative in Texas and head of the state's Mexican-American Legislative Caucus said Cruz represented the ""extreme conservative, highly partisan"" wing of the Republican Party. ""I would caution anybody who looks to Senator Cruz as a role model for Hispanics,"" Martinez Fischer said. ""There is a difference between being the Hispanic candidate and being the candidate who happens to be Hispanic. He's the latter."" (Editing by David Lindsey and Peter Cooney)"

Citizens who serve on the Texas review panels are charged with making suggestions about proposed classroom texts that are being considered for the state's list of “approved” schoolbooks. While most reviewers on this year’s biology panel made routine, noncontroversial suggestions, some took issue with the fact that the proposed books did not include information about creationism while focusing on evolution.

Washington (CNN) - Rick Perry is inviting close friends and supporters to an event next Monday in San Antonio where he is expected to announce if he plans to seek an unprecedented fourth full term as Texas governor, CNN has learned.

Perry ""will be making an announcement around mid-day in San Antonio concerning his exciting future plans,"" according to a ""Save the Date"" email obtained Tuesday by CNN. The announcement comes as Perry finds himself at the center of a high-profile legislative fight over abortion rights in his state.



""Please join his family and closest friends on July 8th,"" reads the email, which is being circulated to his political allies. ""Details to follow.""

Perry has long said he will make a decision about his political future after the conclusion of this year's legislative session, but because Democrats blocked the abortion measure with an attention-grabbing filibuster by state Sen. Wendy Davis last week, the governor was forced to call another session to tackle that issue and others.

Originally, Perry was supposed to announce his 2014 plans this week.

Most Texas political insiders don't expect Perry, who has held the state's top office since 2000, to run again, though many say he is considering another presidential run after his ill-fated 2012 effort.

As of the last financial reporting period, Perry, one of the Republican Party's top fundraisers, had just $6 million in his campaign war chest. The next Republican in line for the governorship, state Attorney General Greg Abbott, had $18 million.

But people close to Perry have also been reminding reporters in recent weeks that he has a knack for changing his mind.

""I don't think anyone knows what he is going to do until he gets up there and says it,"" Ray Sullivan, Perry's former chief-of-staff, when asked about next week's event.

Before seeking a third term in 2010, Perry said he was not going to run again before changing his mind and trouncing Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison in a titanic Republican primary fight. Perry said no to a presidential run for many months, before ultimately jumping into the race in August 2011.

Then, after saying he would suspend his campaign following a disappointing finish in the 2012 Iowa caucuses, Perry suddenly tweeted that he would continue on in South Carolina, which surprised many of his staffers.

Perry-watchers got a clue that he might be nearing an announcement about his latest plans earlier Tuesday, when a Texas radio host interviewing Perry about the special session said ""we get a few more weeks before we start badgering you about your future plans.""

Perry responded, ""Yeah, or less even, we may let you know a little bit before that."""

The tea party firebrand from Texas has been in the Senate all of seven months, but he’s already looking like a strong contender for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016.

Before that, he wowed social conservatives in a campaign-style visit to Iowa, whose caucuses are the first stop on the long trail that leads to the nomination.

“I saw a lot in Ted Cruz, and I liked what I saw,” said Bob Vander Plaats, an Iowa evangelical leader whose endorsement has carried weight in earlier caucuses. “If he proves to be the real deal, he will be a phenomenon.”

Naturally, Cruz responds to talk of a presidential candidacy with the obligatory aw-shucks: “My focus is entirely on the Senate.” But he doesn’t say no. So watch what he does, not what he says. He’s on his way back to Iowa next week and New Hampshire after that, unusual destinations for a freshman senator whose day job is looking out for Texas.

Isn’t a presidential campaign a stretch for a 42-year-old first-time officeholder whose initial media coverage painted him as a nutty combination of Joseph McCarthy and Sarah Palin?

After all, Cruz’s first moments in the national spotlight came during Chuck Hagel’s nomination hearing to become Defense secretary, when Cruz asked whether the nominee might be hiding secret income from North Korea. Later, he attacked his Republican colleagues as unprincipled “squishes” on gun control. Fellow Senate Republican John McCain dismissed him as a “wacko bird.”

But Cruz is wacko like a fox. He is driven by his belief that government spending is the problem, and he says he has a strategy for changing the country’s direction. He believes that the tea party movement, if sustained and better organized, could force the Republican establishment to the right — where, in his view, it belongs.

Will he succeed? If not, it won’t be for lack of brains. At Harvard Law School, he was an editor of the Harvard Law Review (like Barack Obama), and constitutional lawyer Alan Dershowitz, who taught Cruz, told me this week that the senator was “among the smartest students I’ve ever had.”

So far, Cruz’s career in Washington has focused on a series of high-profile “no” votes. He voted against raising the federal government’s debt ceiling, against aid to states ravaged by Superstorm Sandy and against the nomination of John F. Kerry as secretary of State. Along with most other Republicans, he voted against the immigration reform bill that would grant a path to citizenship to immigrants who entered the country illegally. And now Cruz is leading a campaign to press Republican senators to threaten a government shutdown in October unless President Obama’s healthcare program is entirely defunded — a proposal several conservatives have denounced as suicidal.

But Cruz cheerfully shrugs off the criticism of his GOP colleagues as the complaints of an entrenched establishment made up of, in his words, “a lot of people that don’t like to be held accountable.”

Cruz says his main goal is recasting the Republican Party’s economic message to embrace both low-income voters and the Mitt Romney set.

“Republicans should be the party of the 47%, of those climbing the economic ladder,” he said at a recent conference sponsored by the Hoover Institution, adding that policies should be evaluated in terms of how they affect “those who are least well off among us.”

Cruz calls his approach to these issues “opportunity conservatism,” although most of his specific policies still sound like traditional GOP doctrine. He opposes hiking the minimum wage, for example, but on grounds that it would be harmful to “young people, African Americans, Hispanics, single women.”

So far, the message seems to be resonating, and Cruz has pulled off a feat that has eluded most other tea party candidates: He is drawing fervent support from social conservatives, economic conservatives and libertarians at the same time.

“He is already trusted on the values issues that mean a lot to social conservatives,” Vander Plaats told me. “So we don’t mind when he says he wants to focus on economic issues; for most people, we would agree that the focus has to be on growth and opportunity.”

Cruz’s rawboned attacks on his fellow Republicans haven’t won him many friends in the Senate or put his name atop any successful legislation, but they aren’t designed to. His goal, he says, is to mobilize the GOP’s most conservative voters and push the party in their direction.

It may not be a recipe for winning the next presidential election — not according to conventional wisdom, at least. But it’s made this once unknown Senate freshman a man to watch in the race for the GOP nomination.

http://news.yahoo.com/democrats-vote-curb-filibusters-appointees-174525409--politics.html,,[],Democrats vote to curb filibusters on appointees,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Sweeping aside a century of precedent, Democrats took a chunk out of the Senate's hallowed filibuster tradition on Thursday and cleared the way for speedy confirmation of controversial appointments made by President Barack Obama and chief executives in the future.

Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., who orchestrated the change, called the 52-48 vote a blow against gridlock. Republicans warned Democrats will eventually regret their actions once political fortunes are reversed and they can no longer block appointments made by a GOP president.

At the White House, Obama welcomed the shift. ""The gears of government have got to work,"" he said, and he declared that Republicans had increasingly used existing rules ""as a reckless and relentless tool to grind all business to a halt.""

But Republicans warned of a power grab by Democrats, some predicting that worse was yet to come. ""This drastic move sets a dangerous precedent that could later be expanded to speed passage of expansive and controversial legislation,"" said Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama.

The day's change involved presidential appointees, not legislation — and not Supreme Court nominees.

The immediate impact was to ensure post-Thanksgiving confirmation for Patricia Millett, one of Obama's three stalled nominees for the District of Columbia Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals, and for others whom Republicans have blocked. Rep. Mel Watt, D-N.C., tapped to head the Federal Housing Finance Agency, is among them.

The longer-term result of the unilateral move by Democrats was harder to gauge in a Senate that has grown deeply constrained by the major political differences emblematic of an era of divided government.

At issue was a rule that has required a 60-vote majority to end debate in the 100-member Senate and assure a yes-or-no vote on presidential nominees to federal courts or to Cabinet departments or other agencies.

Under a parliamentary maneuver scripted in advance, Democrats changed the proceedings so that only a simple majority was required to clear the way for a final vote. In Senate-speak, this was accomplished by establishing a new precedent under the rules, rather than a formal rules change.

Story continues

Supreme Court nominations still will be subject to a traditional filibuster, the term used to describe the 60-vote requirement to limit debate.

The day's events capped more than a decade of struggle over judicial nominations, in which first President George W. Bush found his appointees stalled by Senate Democrats, and more recently Obama has complained that Republicans have been delaying or preventing confirmation for his picks.

The vote adds to the list of issues likely to figure in next year's congressional elections. In a fundraising appeal emailed a few hours after the vote, the Senate Republicans' campaign organization asked for donations. It warned that ""Democrats are going to pack Obama's liberal judges on the federal courts,"" and sought donations to ""throw these hacks out of office.""

On Thursday, in a certain sign that a showdown was imminent, senators filed into the Senate chamber at midmorning in unusual numbers. They listened from their desks as Reid and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky swapped accusations that preceded a series of votes on arcane parliamentary points. Yet there was no suspense about the final outcome.

McConnell said Republicans had grown tired of threats of action. ""We're not interested in having a gun put to our head any longer,"" he said, noting that Democrats have periodically talked of changing the rules in recent months.

Still, the events marked a reversal for Reid, who had threatened earlier in the year to change the application of filibuster rules for nominees to Cabinet departments and other agencies, but not for appointments to the courts.

Back then, he and McConnell clashed in highly personal, accusatory terms. This time, they recited their grievances in an exchange that was courteous if sharply worded.

""In the history of the Republic, there have been 168 filibusters of executive and judicial nominees. Half of them have occurred during the Obama administration — during the last four and a half years,"" Reid said.

The Nevada Democrat accused the GOP of ""unbreakable, unprecedented obstruction."" He said Republicans had blocked qualified appointees ""to force wholesale changes to laws ... to restructure entire executive branch departments"" and because they don't want Obama ""to appoint any judges to certain courts.""

McConnell retorted that Democrats had ""pioneered the practice of filibustering circuit court nominees,"" beginning with Miguel Estrada, a 2001 Bush appointee to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals blocked by Democrats under pressure from outside liberal groups. A Hispanic immigrant viewed at the time as a potential future Supreme Court pick, he withdrew his nomination after more than two years in limbo.

McConnell said Republicans had allowed confirmation of 99 percent of Obama's appointments to the courts. And he likened Reid's dropping of his pledge to leave rules for judicial appointees unaffected to the promise the president made that Americans who liked their health coverage could keep it under ""Obamacare.""

McConnell, the GOP leader said, ""may as well just have said, 'If you like the rules of the Senate, you can keep them.'""

The change is the most far-reaching since 1975, when a two-thirds requirement for cutting off filibusters against legislation and all nominations was lowered to 60 votes.

The original impetus for the change came from relatively junior Democrats, including Sens. Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Tom Udall of New Mexico, who are among the 31 members of their party who have never served in the Senate minority.

More senior Democrats came around gradually, some noting the Senate's traditions while others fretted about the possibility that they were giving up the right to block nominees of the future whom they might oppose strenuously.

Asked about that concern after the vote, Reid said, ""This is the way it has to be. The Senate has changed.""

Modern-day rules covering filibusters have evolved slowly in the Senate, where change rarely comes easily. Since 1917, the minority has enjoyed the right to unlimited debate on legislation and nominations until the majority can amass a super-majority. In recent years, that has meant 60 votes.

In the end, Democratic Sens. Carl Levin of Michigan, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Mark Pryor of Arkansas parted company with Reid on the switch.

Pryor, who faces a difficult re-election fight next year, said in a statement the Senate was ""designed to protect — not stamp out — the voices of the minority.""

Pryor also noted he had been among a bipartisan group of senators, the so-called Gang of 14, that produced a last-minute compromise nearly a decade ago when Republicans threatened a change in procedures to assure confirmation of several of Bush's stalled judicial nominees.

Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., another veteran of the Gang of 14, said he had met with Reid on Wednesday urging him to reconsider. ""I reached out until my arms ached,"" he said.

Peters'],Senate Democrats Poised to Block Filibusters of Presidential Picks,"WASHINGTON — Senate Democrats are on the verge of moving to eliminate the use of the filibuster against most presidential nominees, aides and senior party leaders said Wednesday, a move that would deprive Republicans of their ability to block President Obama’s picks for cabinet posts and the federal judiciary and further erode what little bipartisanship still exists in the Senate.

Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, is poised to move forward on Thursday with a vote on what is known on Capitol Hill as the “nuclear option,” several Democrats said. Mr. Reid and the senators who have been the most vocal on stopping the Republican blockade of White House nominees are now confident they have the votes to make the change.

“We’re not bluffing,” said one senior aide who has spoken with Mr. Reid directly and expects a vote on Thursday, barring any unforeseen breakthrough on blocked judges.

The threat that Democrats could significantly limit how the filibuster can be used against nominees has rattled Republicans. Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican who has brokered last-minute deals that have averted a change to filibuster rules in the past, visited Mr. Reid in his office on Thursday but failed to strike a compromise."

Brad Dayspring, communications director for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, called Grimes “an empty dress” in an interview with The Hill published Wednesday.

The insults continued from there.

“Alison Lundergan Grimes seems incapable of articulating her own thoughts, and faced with questions, either directly parrots the talking points handed to her by [Sen.] Chuck Schumer or she babbles incoherently and stares blankly into the camera as though she’s a freshman in high school struggling to remember the CliffsNotes after forgetting to read her homework assignment,” Dayspring told The Hill.

""This degrading and offensive comment from McConnell's campaign team is appalling and he should condemn it immediately,"" Grimes spokeswoman Charly Norton told The Huffington Post. ""It shows his team's true feelings towards women and continues his disgraceful pattern of not standing up for the women of Kentucky. From misleading Kentuckians on his votes against the Violence Against Women Act, to voting against equal pay for equal work, Senator McConnell has failed to lead on issues important to women and their families.""

""Republicans think a substance-free insult is the right way to deal with a qualified, popular woman challenger – at least their rhetoric is consistent with their anti-woman policies,"" said Jess McIntosh, communications director at EMILY's List, which endorsed Grimes.

""The only surprising part of all this is the GOP’s continued unwillingness to understand that other women –- including Kentucky women -– can hear them when they say this stuff. It’s why women turned out in historic numbers for Democratic candidates last election, and it’s why we’ll see a repeat next November.""

Grimes, Kentucky's secretary of state, has been hesitant to talk about policy specifics since she officially jumped into the 2014 Senate race. But she has pushed to raise the minimum wage, been vocal about her support for reproductive rights, and announced her intention to delay the Affordable Care Act’s requirement that small businesses provide medical coverage to their employees.

“The president and I disagree on a lot of things,” she said in an August interview with HuffPost's Howard Fineman. “Sen. McConnell will use the same tactics that the GOP has used in other red states, and try to claim that I was a cheerleader for President Obama.

“Well, I am as much a cheerleader for President Obama as Sen. McConnell is a Chippendale dancer.”

http://news.yahoo.com/moon-bill-create-national-park-protect-apollo-landing-110016060.html,,[],Moon Bill Would Create National Park to Protect Apollo Landing Sites,"A new bill introduced into the U.S. Congress would establish the Apollo Lunar Landing Sites National Historical Park on the moon.

Called the Apollo Lunar Landing Legacy Act, the bill was introduced Monday (July 8) by Rep. Donna Edwards of (D-Md.) and was co-sponsored by Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-Texas).

The bill (House Resolution 2617) was referred to the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, and in addition to the House Committee on Natural Resources. [See photos of the Apollo moon landing sites today]

Protect sites for posterity

Noting that the Apollo lunar program was one of the greatest achievements in American history, the bill notes that, as commercial enterprises and foreign nations acquire the ability to land on the moon, ""it is necessary to protect the Apollo lunar landing sites for posterity.""

In part, the bill calls for no later than one year after the date of enactment of the act, ""there shall be established as a unit of the National Park System the Apollo Lunar Landing Sites National Historical Park.""

Creating such a park will expand and enhance the protection and preservation of the Apollo lunar landing sites, the bill states, ""and provide for greater recognition and public understanding of this singular achievement in American history.""

Astronauts and instruments

In the bill, ""Apollo lunar landing sites"" refer to all areas of the moon where astronauts and instruments connected to the Apollo program between 1969 and 1972 touched the lunar surface.

The bill also spotlights the artifacts on the surface of the moon associated with the ill-fated Apollo 13 mission, ""which had an instrumentality crash land on the lunar surface April 14, 1970,"" the bill states.

Exactly what this passage suggests isn't spelled out, although on April 14, 1970, the Apollo 13 mission's Saturn IVB upper stage impacted the moon north of Mare Cognitum. That human-caused impact crater, which is roughly 100 feet (30 meters) in diameter, has been imaged by the super-sharp camera system onboard NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter.

Lunar National Park duties

The Secretary of the Interior is identified in the bill as the administrator of the historical park. That agency would work with NASA under an agreement that hammers out respective duties and responsibilities to manage the park.

Those duties include ensuring the proper monitoring of the Apollo lunar landing sites; managing access to the sites, including through coordination with other spacefaring nations and entities; and ensuring an accurate cataloguing of items in the park (in conjunction with the director of the Smithsonian Institution).

The bill also calls for the heads of the Department of the Interior and NASA to ""submit the Apollo 11 lunar landing site to the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) for designation as a World Heritage Site"" no later than one year after the park's establishment.

But by seeking to establish clearer limits for campaign-related spending by groups claiming tax exemption, the I.R.S. proposal could have an enormous impact on some of the biggest groups, forcing them to either limit their election spending or register as openly political organizations, such as super PACs.

A spokesman for Crossroads declined to comment, as did officials at other political nonprofits.

Nick Ryan, the founder of the American Future Fund, which spent at least $25 million on political advertising last year, said, “Unfortunately, it appears that the same bureaucrats that attempted to suppress the speech of conservative groups in recent years has now put together new rules that apply to (c)4 groups but do not apply to liberal groups like labor unions.”

“I wish I could say I am surprised,” Mr. Ryan added, “but I am not.” The final rules are unlikely to be issued until after the 2014 election, after a public comment period.

The administration’s proposal would apply to nonprofits organized under Section 501(c)4 of the tax code, which are granted tax exemption in exchange for devoting themselves to the promotion of “social welfare.”

Under current rules, promoting social welfare can include some political activity, along with unlimited amounts of lobbying. Some of the largest political nonprofits — like Americans for Prosperity, backed by the conservative philanthropists Charles and David Koch — have used that provision to justify significant expenditures on political ads.

But under the new proposal, a broad swath of political work would be classified as “candidate-related political activity” and explicitly excluded from the agency’s definition of social welfare. Those activities include advertisements that mention a candidate within 60 days of an election as well as grants to other organizations making candidate-related expenditures.

“Depending on the details, this could be dramatic,” said Marcus S. Owens, a former chief of the I.R.S.’s exempt organizations division."

In rural Ohio, co-workers at a factory have become encamped into groups over divided views toward Obama and the country.

In rural Ohio, co-workers at a factory have become encamped into groups over divided views toward Obama and the country.

In rural Ohio, co-workers at a factory have become encamped into groups over divided views toward Obama and the country.

On the same day, in the same county of northern Ohio, two new grandparents prepared to drive to the same factory for work. They had started their careers at Arm & Hammer the same year, and for more than two decades, they had stood together on a concrete floor and watched baking soda roll down an 80-foot production line. But, on this morning, what they saw looked nothing alike.

Bill Herr, 61, left a house that had declined in value by 20 percent, in a neighborhood blemished by foreclosures, in a town where he believed the economy for the middle class was “falling apart.” He said goodbye to a wife who was recovering from open-heart surgery, which she blamed in small part on the stress and disappointment of the presidential election. He grabbed a coat purchased for $6 at Goodwill and walked out a front door where he had recently hung a sign created by a local Christian motorcycle group: “AMERICA NEEDS GOD’S HELP! PRAYER OUR ONLY HOPE.”

Cathy Morris, 53, left a home she had bought with the help of a middle-class tax break and then drove by the mailbox where she sent regular $25 checks to President Obama. She passed through a town that she believed was “almost back” and pulled into an Arm & Hammer factory where orders had increased by 5 percent and management was once again hiring. “Obama,” she said. “Thank goodness.”

This is the America that Obama will govern in his second term: A place divided not only by ideology, race and class but also by the very perception of reality. Four years since Obama first took office, is the country better or worse off? Safer or more at risk? Principled or desperately lost?

Here in Fremont, as in much of America, it all depends on whom you ask. In this rural, Rust Belt county where Obama won exactly 50 percent of the vote, located in a state where he won 50 percent, residents expect Obama to either ruin the country or rescue it. The president who spoke ambitiously at his first inauguration about uniting America instead arrives at his second with the country further divided. Fourteen percent of Republicans think he’s doing a good job, compared with 88 percent of Democrats. The goal is no longer to effect sweeping conciliation so much as to find fractional compromise in a diminishing common ground.

Inside an Arm & Hammer factory that billows smoke across the farmlands of Ohio, 180 employees now self-segregate into what Morris calls “ideological islands.” Co-workers who were once moderate Democrats or Republicans shifted fully to their sides over the past four years, intensifying the disconnect.

There are free copies of a National Rifle Association monthly magazine in one break room and, as of late last year, a life-size cardboard cutout of Obama in the other. There are workers who share copies of Obama’s biography, “Dreams From My Father,” and others who distribute the movie-version parody, “Dreams From My Real Father: A Story of Reds and Deception.”

And then there are Morris and Herr, two longtime employees working side by side, each anticipating Obama’s second inauguration as a seminal moment.

For one, it is confirmation that life has gotten better.

For the other, it is proof that life has gotten worse.

‘Obama’s America’

Bill and Sally Herr built their farmhouse on the outskirts of Fremont in the months after Sept. 11, 2001, and they agreed to decorate it in homage to the country they served and loved. They placed two American flags on the lawn, five flag magnets on the fridge, a flag-themed coloring book in the grandkids’ room and a flag throw blanket on the living room couch. They framed another flag just inside the entryway, displaying it under three words that summarized their philosophy: “God Bless America.”

But lately, when they talked about the state of the country, the phrase Bill preferred was something different, something much less reassuring.

“Obama’s America,” he said.

Obama’s America: It was the wood pellets burning downstairs in their latest attempt to lower the energy bill; the constant threats of downsizing at the print shop where Sally has worked for 30 years; the 25 percent drop in tithing at their church; the date nights paid for with gift certificates to Arby’s or Casa Fiesta; the 37-year-old son with a doctorate who had been forced to move back in with them for six months after losing his job as a counselor in Toledo.

What bothered Bill most of all was the way he thought Obama had slighted the military, removing troops from combat zones too quickly and once disregarding Iraq as a “stupid war.” Stupid or not, Bill had been there to fight it when the Army sent orders to a 52-year-old whose military experience consisted mostly of humanitarian missions in South America with the Army Reserve. This time, the orders were to deploy on five days notice for a 12-month tour with a unit out of Chicago. So off he had gone into the desert with men less than half his age, once unloading 190 rounds in a single firefight, ducking behind a tank as his chin strap filled with sweat. “So that was stupid?” he wondered.

Bill and Sally were lifelong Republicans who had been wary of Obama from the start, but it was the frustrations of the past four years that had welcomed Fox News as a constant presence into their living room and tea party members to their annual backyard Fourth of July bash. They wanted friends with whom to share their frustrations. Now they forwarded along e-mails from those new friends suggesting murky details in Obama’s family history and traveled to Glenn Beck rallies across the state.

They had sought out a community of others who thought like them, and immersing in that community had changed what they thought.

“The first time he won, I really just considered him inexperienced and misguided,” Sally said. “This time, I think he is purposely taking us to a place we don’t recognize.”

Obama had said he wanted to raise the federal debt limit; Sally and Bill, meanwhile, were teaching Financial Peace University at their church, where they talked about borrowing $21,000 to buy their first house and then staying there 30 years until the mortgage was paid off.

“The most important lesson is you pay off what you owe before you borrow more,” Bill had told the congregants.

Obama wanted to cover rising costs for food stamps and unemployment insurance; Bill had found a factory job that paid $21 an hour and stuck with it through aching feet, back pain and boredom. He had selected a new Arm & Hammer trinket out of the company catalogue to mark every five years of employment and displayed those gifts proudly around his house. He had continued to fill the vats of glue and load cartons of baking soda boxes onto the line, watching 270 of them get filled every minute, eight hours a day, for 23 years.

On the other side

Cathy Morris, an Arm & Hammer quality supervisor, had worked alongside Bill for every one of those years without ever speaking to him about politics. She had overheard enough of his conversations to know: “He’s way over on the other side,” she said — and she preferred to associate only with her own side whenever possible.

She picked out an elliptical machine at the gym farthest from the TVs, because they were always tuned to Fox News. She deleted conservative friends from her Facebook page. She went on Snopes.com to investigate rumors about Obama and then shared her findings mostly with other liberals — the mechanic at work whom she spotted at a rally for Vice President Biden, her union Democrat father or her two daughters who had graduated from liberal arts colleges. In what increasingly felt like a fight over basic American principles, she decided her role was to reinforce the stakes with liberals already on her side.

“Why waste my breath talking about the president to somebody who is always going to hate him?” Morris said. “If they can’t understand what he’s accomplished, it is already a lost cause.”

How, she wondered, could anyone not see the proof? The local unemployment rate had dropped from 13 percent to just more than 6 percent. The nearby National Machinery Plant, which had nearly closed its doors a few years earlier, now had trucks lining up at the loading docks like floats awaiting the start of a victory parade. The two colleges in town had become more diverse, and Arm & Hammer had begun offering benefits to same-sex domestic partners. Because of health-care reform, Morris’s youngest daughter, 22, has been able to stay on her mother’s health insurance plan. Morris decided to repay the president by doing something she had never done: making regular donations to Obama’s reelection campaign.

In this county of 50-50, she had decided there was no more room for ambivalence. “You are all in for him or against him, and you have to commit,” Morris said.

Local membership had risen for both the tea party and the Democratic Women’s Club, and one disagreement on election night had resulted in an assault charge. Even the area’s once-tranquil town hall meetings had devolved into a shouting match, with one woman suggesting that liberals in Washington should be “shot in the head,” prompting local Democrats to demand a police investigation. Ever since, local politics had all but come to a standstill.

But the line at Arm & Hammer had to keep moving, 270 cartons a minute, so employees had decided to guard the peace by talking sparingly about Obama or his second inauguration.

“I only confide in people who think like I think,” Herr said.

“Smile and stick to your side,” Morris said.

So they stood together in polite silence and watched baking soda roll down the manufacturing line and onto the trucks, where it would be delivered into an economy that was improving or combusting, in a country where life was getting better or worse."

Sen. John McCain said in an interview published Wednesday in the New Republic that if the 2016 White House race boils down to Hillary Clinton vs. Rand Paul, he would face a “tough choice.”

In the wide-ranging question-and-answer session, McCain, the 2008 Republican presidential nominee, fiercely defended his choice of Sarah Palin to be his running mate, affirmed that President Barack Obama has grown in office, and criticized the Pentagon’s obvious reluctance to get more involved in Syria’s civil war.

So who would he vote for in 2016 if it came down to Kentucky’s junior Republican senator and the Democratic former secretary of state?

“It’s gonna be a tough choice,” McCain told the magazine with a laugh.

“Let me just clarify that,” McCain added quickly. “I think that Rand Paul represents a segment of the GOP, just like his father. And I think he is trying to expand that, intelligently, to make it larger.”

McCain — a foreign policy hawk who favors an assertive American role in world affairs — has clashed openly with the younger Paul, who warns against military intervention and has sharply criticized the national security state.

The Arizona Republican, who sits on the Senate’s Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committees, has frequently been sharply at odds with Obama on international affairs. So he does he think Clinton did as secretary of state?

“I think she did a fine job. She’s a rock star. She has, maybe not glamour, but certainly the aura of someone widely regarded throughout the world,” McCain said.

“I do think it is interesting that the issues where (Secretary of State) John Kerry is engaging is where Hillary Clinton did not engage in, that those decisions were left to the White House and the National Security Council,” he added, implicitly laying first-term foreign policy setbacks at the feet of the White House.

What about Palin? Does it bother him that the decision to pick her as his running mate in 2008 will weigh on his legacy?

""No, because I think historians will decide that facts are stubborn things,"" McCain replied, saying that his campaign got a boost in the polls and that the former Alaska governor ""held her own"" against then-Sen. Joe Biden.

""She did everything I ever wanted. She excited our base in a way I was unable to achieve,"" McCain said. ""Not only do I not regret it, but I have probably not seen anyone in American life savaged like she was, particularly by the liberal left.""

When asked for which one he would vote, McCain laughed and said: “It’s gonna be a tough choice.”

It is quite telling that McCain would say such a thing to the left-wing New Republic, especially after he seemed so outraged after the bungling and subsequent cover up surrounding the September 11 anniversary attacks on our consulate in Libya.

Whatever differences McCain and Paul might have over policy, four people were murdered on Hillary Clinton’s watch at the State Department, and her reaction to those trying to get to the bottom of it were famously met with Clinton screeching, “What difference does it make?”

Moreover, you would think Clinton’s indifference to repeated requests for increased security for our diplomatic team in Libya would border on something close to unforgivable for a former POW. Not to mention the fact no one in the administration even tried to rescue or reinforce a group of Americans under attack.

But we are undoubtedly in the middle of a changing of the guard in the GOP. The McCains, Roves, and Grahams see their time coming to an end, and in response they have, at times, launched nihilistic campaigns against the Tea Party, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, etc.

Rove runs to the New York Times to attack his own, McCain runs to the New Republic to slash away at one of our rising stars by giving The Grand Dame of Libya a credibility boost…

Seems that the mayors of the village are willing to burn it down rather than see themselves replaced.

According to the Louisiana Secretary of State's website, McAllister led establishment candidate Neil Riser 59.7 percent to 40.3 percent -- a difference of over 17,500 votes -- with 976 of a possible 981 precincts reporting.

McAllister advanced to this weekend’s election to face off against Riser after an October contest with more than a dozen other candidates from both political parties -- in what is known as a “jungle primary.”

The seat in Louisiana's 5th Congressional District was left open when GOP Rep. Rodney Alexander resigned this summer to take a Cabinet post in GOP Gov. Bobby Jindal's administration.

The largely rural district along the Mississippi River delta is dotted with farmland and plagued by poverty. The 5th District covers all or part of 24 parishes, from northeast and central Louisiana into southeastern parishes bordering Mississippi.

In last month's election, Riser finished ahead of McAllister, taking 33 percent of the vote compared to 18 percent. But neither got the 50 percent needed to be declared the outright winner.

Many GOP races since 2010 have in some form been a Tea Party-vs.-establishment candidate showdown.

However, Riser doubled as both the establishment candidate and Tea Party favorite, promoting his experience but promising strident opposition to President Obama.

McAllister, meanwhile, embraced his outsider status, complete with an endorsement from his close friend Phil Robertson, the patriarch of television's hit series ""Duck Dynasty."" McAllister ran as the more measured pragmatist, criticizing Washington gridlock and hyper-partisanship, particularly on Obama's health care law.

""Plain and simple, this was Riser's election to lose. Riser was the favorite going into the evening. He had the dollars. He had the endorsement of the Republican establishment. He had a strong showing in the primary. Yet, he lost it,"" Joshua Stockley, a political science professor at the University of Louisiana at Monroe, told the Associated Press.

An ally of Jindal, Riser had his campaign up and running almost immediately after Alexander announced his resignation in September. The timing prompted cries of favoritism, though Jindal, Alexander and Riser deny any collusion.

Riser touted his decades-long experience as a businessman in the funeral industry while arguing his insider experience has led to significant legislative accomplishments such as helping get a state constitutional amendment passed that strengthened gun rights.

""I see a very clear distinction in the fact that I've made the votes,"" Riser said. ""These aren't just talking points for me.""

He was endorsed by the Tea Party of Louisiana and FreedomWorks, a Tea Party-aligned national political action group.

Conservative activists said it's McAllister, who's never held public office and noted during the campaign that he'd never even visited Washington, that they worry would be the go-along-to-get-along congressman who isn't conservative enough.

McAllister, who spent at least $800,000 of his own money on his campaign, according to the Federal Election Comission, countered eagerly with his newcomer status.

""I am not part of the establishment; I'm just part of the district,"" he said.

When Robertson endorsed his friend, he explained that McAllister has ""the least political experience.""

Despite that profile, McAllister didn't push the ""blow the whole place up"" mantra that some GOP primary candidates have offered in similar conservative enclaves around the country.

While he is critical of the atmosphere in Washington, he doesn't blame it exclusively on Obama. He also points a finger at House Republicans' 40-plus votes to repeal Obama's health insurance overhaul.

""I will vote to repeal it if there's a vote right now today,"" he said in a recent debate.

""But the truth of the matter is you stand on a platform and pander for votes on something that can't be repealed,"" he told Riser.

McAllister says Republicans should show the president respect and that the best course on health care is to work on improving Obama's signature law since he was re-elected and Democrats still control the Senate.

Both candidates described themselves as conservatives – opposing abortion, favoring strong gun rights and criticizing Obama's policies generally. Both criticize the levels of federal spending and debt.

""I don't think there's a lot of difference in the policy, per se, because we're both true conservatives both fiscally and socially,"" McAllister said.

McAllister will take office in time to vote on the next round of budget resolutions in January and, almost certainly, a vote soon after on whether to raise the nation's borrowing limit. Those votes were set up by an October deal to end a partial government shutdown driven by GOP opposition to the health care law.

Riser said he opposes efforts to raise the debt ceiling, saying spending should be cut instead. McAllister wasn't so absolute. He conceded he'd be willing to raise the debt ceiling if the increase was coupled with federal spending cuts and a long-term deficit reduction plan.

Obama’s trust-in-government deficit

By Dan Balz,

Whatever else happens as a result of the multiple controversies that have engulfed the administration, one thing is clear: President Obama has failed to meet one of the most important goals he set out when he was first elected, which was to demonstrate that activist government could also be smart government.

Six weeks after winning the presidency in 2008, Obama reflected on the meaning of the election. He was reluctant to claim, as some others were, that his victory marked the beginning of an era in which Americans would embrace bigger government. Suspicion of command-and-control, top-down government, he said, was “a lasting legacy” of Ronald Reagan’s presidency.

So rather than portraying his first election as the end of a long period of conservative ascendancy, Obama called it “a correction to the correction.” As he put it then: “I think what you saw in this election was people saying: ‘Yes, we don’t want some big, bureaucratic, ever-expanding state. On the other hand, we don’t want a state that’s dysfunctional, that doesn’t believe in its mission, that can’t carry out some of the basic functions of government and provide service to people and be there when they’re hurting.’ ”

He then described what that meant for the government he was beginning to assemble. “What we don’t know yet is whether my administration and this next generation of leadership is going to be able to hew to a new, more pragmatic approach that is less interested in whether we have big government or small government [but is] more interested in whether we have a smart, effective government.”

What has happened since Obama laid down that challenge for his administration? More Americans favor smaller government over bigger government than when he was first elected, according to exit polls from last November. Public confidence in the federal government is as low as it has ever been, according to a Pew Research Center survey released this spring.

This weekend, four of the government’s most important agencies are beset by political controversy, management breakdowns or both: State (what happened in Benghazi, Libya), Treasury (targeting of conservative groups by the Internal Revenue Service), Justice (leak-related investigation of the Association Press) and Defense (rising numbers of sexual assaults).

Add to that the questions about Health and Human Services and its implementation of the Affordable Care Act, and it is little wonder confidence has eroded.

Enough blame to share

There are many reasons for the public’s diminished confidence in the federal government, reflecting general disapproval with the way Washington has worked during the Obama years. The president’s advisers blame Republicans for much of the gridlock and partisan infighting, and they are quick to note that Obama’s approval ratings are far higher than those of the Republicans.

Republicans do bear a considerable share of the responsibility for overall attitudes about Washington and government. Their dismal ratings are a measure of public dissatisfaction with the party generally and with House Republican efforts to thwart the president.

But Obama bears a particular responsibility for failing to do what he said he had to do, which was to convince the public that he could make the part of government that he directly controls — the executive branch — smarter, more effective and more deserving of trust.

Early in his presidency, Obama convened a meeting with a group of historians. The topic he put on the table was: What does it take to be a transformational president? Obama’s ambition to be such a figure could be seen in his first-term agenda, which included a major economic stimulus package, a bailout of the auto industry, a major financial regulatory reform package and, biggest of all, the law that is transforming the nation’s health-care industry.

But public skepticism about government put an extra burden on Obama, as it has on all activist Democratic politicians over the past three decades. To do what he wanted to do through government required building greater confidence in government. Long before the current controversies materialized, he had not been able to do that.

Defenders of his stimulus package say it prevented another depression and helped initiate a turnaround in the economy. But as the recovery sputtered and calls grew for additional stimulus, Obama did not have the political support to launch another round of government intervention because of criticisms that he had already added enormously to the deficit.

Most controversial has been his health-care initiative. Throughout the long battle to enact and then begin to implement the law, Obama’s White House has been unable to win broad public support for it, even though individual pieces are popular. Obama is still fighting to overcome distrust of government as he proceeds with the most complex change in social welfare policy since the 1960s.

Now the president is dealing with unexpected problems, each of which threatens to make the trust-in-government deficit even bigger.

Damaged, but how much?

The most corrosive of the controversies is what happened at the IRS, which singled out tea party and other conservative groups for special scrutiny in their applications for tax-exempt status. That Obama knew nothing about it does little to quell concerns that one of the most-feared units in government was operating out of control.

The multiple failures at the IRS speak of an agency that, at worst, was politically motivated in going after opponents of the president’s agenda and that, at best, showed terrible judgment, lacked vigorous oversight by its managers and misled members of Congress about what was happening.

There is much about the Justice Department’s leak investigation that isn’t known and may not be known, given that it involves national security issues and classified information. But on its face, the collection of telephone records from the Associated Press appears to be so broad that it cannot easily be explained. Because the president, rightly, cannot interfere, he is left mostly helpless in the face of this controversy.

The argument over what happened in Benghazi last Sept. 11 is mired in politics and probably will continue to be. Obama sees the investigation led by Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, as a politically inspired sideshow. Republicans see the administration’s response as a political coverup designed to protect the president and former secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton.

Putting aside the controversy over what happened to the administration’s original talking points as they evolved amid bureaucratic wrangling, what actually happened in Benghazi was a breakdown in security that reflected badly on the administration. Wherever the congressional investigation leads, the findings of the State Department’s internal investigation, which cited “systemic failures and leadership and management deficiencies,” stand as harsh criticism of what happened on Obama’s and Clinton’s watch.

The full political impact of what is unfolding now may not be clear until closer to the 2014 elections. Obama has been damaged, but how much? Republicans are on the offensive but risk overplaying their hand out of deep dislike for this president. But no matter how the electoral politics turn out, Obama’s goal of creating confidence in bigger government has taken a big hit.

http://news.yahoo.com/obama-climate-change-must-vote-100111195.html,,[],Obama: Make climate change a must for your vote,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama is urging Americans to make climate change a political litmus test, asking them to declare they won't vote for any politicians who don't protect future generations from environmental devastation.

Obama says Americans are already paying the price for climate change, including in lost lives and hundreds of billions of dollars. He says America will be judged as a people and a nation by how it responds.

""If you agree with me, I'll need you to act,"" Obama says, appealing to Americans to spread the word to their family, friends and classmates. ""Remind everyone who represents you, at every level of government, that there is no contradiction between a sound environment and a strong economy — and that sheltering future generations against the ravages of climate change is a prerequisite for your vote.""

Obama's remarks in his weekly radio and Internet address, released Saturday but recorded at the White House prior to the start of Obama's weeklong trip to Africa, marks the start of a new phase for Obama's efforts on climate change: convincing the public to sell it for him.

Obama last week unveiled a national plan to combat climate change and prepare for its effects, bypassing Congress after years of frustrated efforts to get lawmakers to pass legislation to deal with the issue. At the core of Obama's plan are new controls on new and existing power plants that emit carbon dioxide — heat-trapping gases blamed for global warming. The program also will boost renewable energy production on federal lands, increase efficiency standards and prepare communities to deal with higher temperatures.

None of the measures in Obama's plan require Congress to act — a consideration that liberates the president but also poses risks if it's perceived as executive overreach. Republicans and some Democrats have already denounced the plan as a job-killing ""war on coal,"" and opponents could try to undercut Obama's plan or hinder it through legal action if Americans don't seem to be on board.

""The question is not whether we need to act. The question is whether we will have the courage to act before it's too late,"" Obama says.

In the Republican address, Sen. Pat Roberts of Kansas says there are troubling, unanswered questions about the implementation of Obama's health care law.

""We must put an end to the fear and uncertainty,"" Roberts says. ""Those 'bumps' and 'glitches' the president talks about? It's a train wreck, folks, and we have to get America out of the way."""

The advantages and responsibilities of world leadership was in our hands. We built on the New Deal to strengthen the middle class with Social Security and Medicare and then focused on human rights with the Civil Rights Act. Then in 1981 came the Reagan revolution. And in a symbolic act President Reagan took down the solar panels which had been installed on the Carter White House. This act symbolized that new guys were in town and it also meant that government was being pushed out of the way for business to take its place as the rightful representative of the American people.

That was about the same time that understanding about our species' contribution to climate warming was being discussed in the global scientific community. It was already recognized that our industrial consumption based on fossil fuels was the leading cause of our atmospheric pollution. It was also recognized that global warming would require a global response, with nations working together to advance and implement solutions. Our global economic and political leadership placed us in a position of responsibility to the global challenge of climate change; but here is where we abdicated our global leadership responsibility and the Republican ideology of laissez faire collided with the needed response to our changing climate.



In the over 30 years of Republican political dominance, the evidence of anthropogenic climate change has only strengthened to the point that 97 percent of credible climate scientists support the overwhelming evidence of human caused climate change. Yet over that time the Republican/conservative response has been to use its power to misinform and to obstruct any progress to mitigate. The Republican political leaders have taken the side of their business buddies —the fossil fuel industry, who have rewarded them with obnoxious sums of money for their support which has assured them of unrivaled control of the energy market. In the 112th GOP-controlled congress alone there have been 317 votes taken against the environment.

The cost of this obstruction and misinformation? It increasingly looks like the cost the world will be paying for this idiotic political malfeasance is a safe future for our children and grandchildren. We have lost too much time in implementing solutions and already many in the world especially the most vulnerable are on the road to mass suffering and hunger.

The Virginia League of Conservation Voters has spent nearly a million dollars on the race between McAuliffe and Ken Cuccinelli, the Republican attorney general, according to campaign records from the Virginia Public Access Project. Jeff Gohringer, press secretary for the national League of Conservation Voters, said that the group has contributed $1.9 million to the state league in both cash and in-kind contributions this election cycle across all races. The Sierra Club launched its own anti-Cuccinelli efforts as well.

Polling heading into Tuesday's election shows McAuliffe with a 6-point lead over Cuccinelli.

Cuccinelli has been a particularly popular target for environmental groups, given his outspoken denial of climate change. In his role as attorney general, Cuccinelli attempted to subpoena the records and emailed correspondence of a former University of Virginia climate scientist, accusing him of fraud in his climate research. That climate scientist, Michael Mann, has been campaigning against Cuccinelli in the state.

""We got involved in this race because of climate change,"" said LCV's Gohringer.

""[Cuccinelli] is one of the most vocal climate deniers in the country. To defeat him would send a signal to other climate change deniers, and also highlight the growing environmental movement.""

The McAuliffe campaign has also criticized Cuccinelli's climate change denial in television ads that accuse the Republican of being too extreme for Virginia.

The Virginia League of Conservation Voters' political action committee is also running a field program that it characterized as the largest effort by an outside group this year -- with volunteers making an estimated 300,000 canvassing visits over the course of the campaign -- one-third of them in the final five days of the race, according to Gohringer.

McAuliffe has been accused of waffling on coal and greenhouse gas emissions over the years. He did not come out in support of the EPA's new rules for coal-fired power plants until early last month. His opponent quickly seized on the statement as part of a ""war on coal.""

""I think we've seen Terry McAuliffe unafraid to really lean into these issues throughout the campaign, talking about climate change, supporting the EPA,"" said Gohringer. ""He's been a champion throughout the campaign. It's been a dividing line between the candidates.""

The League of Conservation Voters was a significant spender in the Virginia Senate race last year, as well, contributing $2 million to help Democrat Tim Kaine defeat Republican George Allen. The group and its affiliates spent a record $14 million on the 2012 election."

With Tropical Storm Chantal headed for South Florida with landfall likely Saturday, Florida Gov. Rick Scott is sounding alarm bells about the impact of National Guard furloughs on state storm preparations. “The problem is you’re losing training time, you’re losing preparation time,” Scott said during a radio interview in Jacksonville. “When will the National Guard make the decision that we stop the furloughs? Right after the hurricane hits?”

Scott joined with two other Southern Republican governors whose states are in the path of tropical storms to write a letter to President Obama urging him to call off the furloughs. In Florida, nearly 1,000 employees of the National Guard are furloughed once a week, saving the federal government money under the congressionally mandated sequester but costing the state in readiness.

Florida Gov. Rick Scott, you are a dumbass. Sorry, but there's really no other professional political way to put it. It looks once again like a group of austerity-obsessed Republicans have suddenly discovered a pressing new need for some of those parts of government they decided they didn't want to pay for. Specifically, the part they suddenly discover personally affects them Mr. Scott, I have it on very good authority that the National Guard has been implementing furloughs because Republicans insisted they not be paid enough to avoid furloughs. It was called sequestration and it was in all the papers. You may have heard of it.One of those two other Southern Republican governors is of course Bobby Jindal, most famous for being pissed off at something called ""volcano monitoring"" because his state doesn't have volcanos, but a firm believer in ""hurricane monitoring"" because Bobby Jindal only believes in things he can see out his window. It isn't so much an ideological conviction for him as it is pure self-centeredness, self-centeredness above and beyond that of the usual Republican wag.

So that's great, you're sending a letter off to President Obama saying you're very very peeved about the congressionally mandated requirement that members of the National Guard be furloughed because Republicans have insisted not just on implementing what all parties agreed at the beginning was the Stupidest Possible Way to cut spending, but are now insisting that we not actually fix because Congress is literally simply too incompetent to pass any better idea. You know who would be a better person to complain to than President Obama? The damn Republicans who insist on the furloughs. The people who put the ""mandate"" in the ""congressional mandate"" part. You even have their numbers, it wouldn't be a hard call.

Unless, of course, this isn't actually about avoiding potentially dangerous cuts to government safety programs, but about moving money around (the executive branch can't do a whole lot of that either, by the way) so as to screw somebody else in order to reverse only the cuts to government safety that affect you, and your state, and the people who will have your head on a plastic cafeteria tray if you screw things up. Because that wouldn't just be stupid, that'd make you kind of a bastard.

My lingering suspicion has long been that the House, crippled by their own ideological schisms, incompetence and eff-it-all approach to government, will never be able to actually pass any legislation that removes the need for government-wide furloughs, program cancellations, and other drastic measures. They'll just go through the entire roster of government duties one-by-one, refunding each and every thing a week after the cut to that thing resulted in either a minor fiasco or an outright disaster, and only when the fiascos or outright disasters are things they can personally see out their office windows. That seems to be the case—though if we count recent House Republican reactions to natural disasters not in their own states but merely in other Republican-led states, even that might might be expecting too much of them.

WASHINGTON — They were the towheaded sisters who tagged along on campaigns, polite and smiling, as their father rose through Wyoming and then Washington politics to become one of the most powerful men in the country.

“We were as close as sisters can be,” recalled Mary Cheney of her relationship with her older sister, Liz.

But now, a feud between the two has spilled into public view, involving social media, an angry same-sex spouse, a high-profile election and a father who feels uncomfortably caught between his two children.

The situation has deteriorated so much that the two sisters have not spoken since the summer, and the quarrel threatens to get in the way of something former Vice President Dick Cheney desperately wants — a United States Senate seat for Liz.

Things erupted on Sunday when Mary Cheney, a lesbian, and her wife were at home watching “Fox News Sunday” — their usual weekend ritual. Liz Cheney appeared on the show and said that she opposed same-sex marriage, describing it as “just an area where we disagree,” referring to her sister. Taken aback and hurt, Mary Cheney took to her Facebook page to blast back: “Liz — this isn’t just an issue on which we disagree you’re just wrong — and on the wrong side of history.”

Watch the latest video at video.foxnews.com

But then Mary Cheney’s wife, Heather Poe, went further, touching on Liz Cheney’s relocation from Northern Virginia to Wyoming to seek office. (Liz Cheney is already battling accusations of carpetbagging in the race.)

“I can’t help but wonder how Liz would feel if as she moved from state to state, she discovered that her family was protected in one but not the other,” Ms. Poe wrote on her Facebook page. “Yes, Liz,” she added, “in fifteen states and the District of Columbia you are my sister-in-law.”

The feud reveals tensions not just within the family but in the Republican Party more broadly as it seeks to respond to both a changing America and an energized, fervently conservative base.

Indeed, while Liz Cheney seeks to make clear her opposition to same-sex marriage, her father more than a decade ago was able to embrace fairly moderate views on the subject, breaking publicly with President George W. Bush over Mr. Bush’s support for a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage. He has gone further still since then, telling Barbara Walters in 2011, “I certainly don’t have any problem with” same-sex marriage.

But Ms. Cheney, in her bid to defeat Republican Senator Michael B. Enzi of Wyoming, is running to his right and seeking to capture conservatives and Tea Party enthusiasts.

Liz Cheney on Sunday declined to directly address the remarks from her sister and sister-in-law, but said in an email: “I love my sister and her family and have always tried to be compassionate towards them. I believe that is the Christian way to behave.”

People who have spoken to Liz Cheney say she is irritated that her sister is making their dispute public and believes it is hypocritical for Mary Cheney to take such a hard line now, given that she worked for the re-election of President Bush, an opponent of same-sex marriage.

The relationship between the two sisters used to be quite different. The daughters drew especially close when their father ran as Mr. Bush’s running mate in 2000 and eventually became a figure of great controversy and enormous power as vice president. After Mr. Cheney left office in 2009, politically bruised and physically ailing, the sisters, who lived 15 minutes apart in Washington’s tony Northern Virginia suburbs, would join their parents for a standing Sunday dinner at Liz’s house in McLean each week, along with their families, including Ms. Poe.

Mary Cheney, 44, said in a phone interview Sunday that she presumed her sister shared her father’s views on marriage, and that view was reinforced because Liz Cheney “was always very supportive” of her relationship with Ms. Poe and the couple’s two children. She learned otherwise in August when Liz Cheney declared, shortly after announcing her Senate candidacy, that she was opposed to same-sex marriage rights. Mary Cheney said it is now “impossible” for the sisters to reconcile as long as Liz Cheney maintains that position.

“What amazes me is that she says she’s running to be a new generation of leader,” Mary Cheney said, citing her 47-year-old sister’s slogan in her campaign against Mr. Enzi, 69. “I’m not sure how sticking to the positions of the last 20 or 30 years is the best way to do that.”

Mary Cheney said it was her wife’s idea for the couple to take to Facebook to respond to Liz’s televised remarks. Ms. Poe seemed especially hurt that her sister-in-law had acted so embracing toward them in private, and then took this public position.

“Liz has been a guest in our home, has spent time and shared holidays with our children, and when Mary and I got married in 2012 — she didn’t hesitate to tell us how happy she was for us,” Ms. Poe wrote. “To have her say she doesn’t support our right to marry is offensive to say the least.”

In the interview, Mary Cheney, who is a longtime political consultant, said she would continue to raise the matter. Reminded by a reporter that such criticism could complicate her sister’s Senate campaign, Mary Cheney offered a clipped answer reminiscent of her father’s terse style. “O.K.,” she said, before letting silence fill the air.

It is not the substance of the issue that could hurt Liz Cheney in Wyoming — her opponent also opposes same-sex marriage. But the ugly family drama and questions about what Liz Cheney truly believes could reinforce questions about her authenticity in a place where many voters have met their politicians in person and are already skeptical of an outsider like Ms. Cheney, who has lived elsewhere for much of her life. Ms. Cheney’s first ad, which she released last week, was devoted entirely to emphasizing her family’s Wyoming roots.

Wyoming, a sprawling but sparsely populated state, has rarely seen such high-profile primaries, and this one has already featured an ugly Cheney family episode: After former Wyoming Senator Alan Simpson, a longtime friend of the family who served with Mr. Cheney in the state’s congressional delegation, fretted to The New York Times this summer about how Liz Cheney’s challenge of Mr. Enzi would be divisive among the state’s Republicans, Lynne Cheney, the sisters’ mother and Mr. Cheney’s wife, confronted him at a charity event and told him to “just shut up” — three times, Mr. Simpson claimed. When Lynne Cheney later said that the exchange never happened, Mr. Simpson called her denial “a damn baldfaced lie.”

The former vice president is active and visible in his daughter’s Senate bid and this Wednesday, he will join her in Denver for a fund-raiser to benefit her campaign. Early polls show Liz Cheney trailing Mr. Enzi, but her fund-raising since declaring her candidacy has been robust.

As for Mary Cheney, she said that when she gets together with her parents these days, they know which subjects not to bring up. “They come over for dinner and we don’t talk about Liz or the race,” she said. “There is so much more to talk about.”

The Cheneys have tried to be “as neutral as they can,” added Mary Cheney, who just returned from a pheasant hunting trip with her father in South Dakota. “My parents are stuck in an awful position.”

As for the coming holidays, Mary Cheney said that her parents will come to her and Ms. Poe’s Northern Virginia home for Thanksgiving and that she assumed her older sister would be in Wyoming.

At Christmas, the whole Cheney clan will head to the Jackson Hole area in Wyoming, where Liz Cheney now lives. But Mary Cheney said of her sister, “I will not be seeing her.”"

After it was announced this morning that anti-gay Pastor Louie Giglio had withdrawn from delivering the benediction at President Obama's inauguration, the usual suspects on the right stepped forward backward to, as Think Progress describes it, rant about ""a left-wing conspiracy to force him off of the program."" From the same Think Progress story, here are some of the right's comments:



• “[T]he administration’s inclusivity only goes so far. It’s not inclusive of those who disagree with them.” [Richard Land, Southern Baptist Convention’s Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission] • “This president appears determined to stir division and create two Americas: One America that holds to a biblical view of sexuality and another that offers tolerance so long as you embrace its redefined view of sexuality.” [Tony Perkins, Family Research Council] • “It is the ultimate hypocrisy for the Obama administration to pretend it supports diversity and yet denounces anyone who dares to disagree with its radical homosexual agenda. Rev. Giglio’s comments about homosexuality from more than a decade ago were not hateful but represent the historical teachings of the world’s three major religions. Apparently the Obama administration’s definition of tolerance is only broad enough to include its own views.” [Robert Jeffress, First Baptist Church, Dallas, Texas] • “The intolerant Left claims another scalp.” [Kirsten Powers, Fox News political analyst] • “Louis Giglio, a popular orthodox evangelical pastor whose views are mainstream Christian cannot pray the Inaugural benediction.” [Erick Erickson, RedState] • “The bully bigots at Big Gay win huge victory for fascistic intolerance.” [Bryan Fischer, American Family Association radio host]

Erickson and others argue that Giglio represents ""mainstream"" Christianity since, after all, when he was slamming homosexuality, he quoted the Bible. These are, as Robert Jeffress says, ""historical teachings."" Sure, the Bible also suggests adulteresses should be stoned. I guess that's mainstream and historical too. And don't you even dare piss against a wall!

Their main gripe is that President Obama says he supports diversity, yet he will not showcase points of view with which he disagrees at his inauguration. Hey, it's his party! He didn't ask Nazis to speak at the inauguration either. And what about the millions of Americans who are atheists? Their voices are almost never represented at these big shindigs. The right's argument is just hogwash. Remember Rick Warren? It's time for another perspective. Diversity.

Look, Giglio wasn't asked to just sit on the stage or meet with the President during the ceremonies. He was asked to give the friggin' benediction! This is America's every-four-year Big Speech to God and the Nation. A man who thinks homosexuality is a sin, who warned America not to allow the gay lifestyle to become ""acceptable,"" and who promoted therapy to cure the gay, is not mainstream, except when he's standing next to Tony Perkins and Bryan Fischer.

Louie Giglio is free to preach his divisive and hateful religion whenever and wherever he wants, and Americans are free to listen to him. Or not. President Obama also has the right not to give his homophobia a platform and big microphone. If that's being intolerant of intolerance, so be it."
http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/ticket/supreme-court-holds-big-four-cases-final-frantic-170036331.html,,[],"Supreme Court holds big four cases for final, frantic week of term","To the dismay of court watchers everywhere, the Supreme Court did not hand down decisions in the four biggest pending cases on Thursday, leaving their simultaneous release for the final, frantic week of the court's term.

Opinions that could drastically expand the rights of gays and lesbians in society, sharply curtail the use of race in college admissions and strike down civil rights legislation protecting minorities at the ballot box could all be released at the same time on Monday, unless the court adds more decision days to its schedule for later that week.

Though undoubtedly every case the nine justices decide has important effects on the legal system, each term a handful of controversial cases particularly captures the public's attention. This year, the court decided to wade into the gay marriage debate for the first time in its history, and it also took up two landmark cases involving race. One of the cases, a challenge to the University of Texas' affirmative-action program, was argued in front of the court all the way back in October, and many legal experts are stumped as to why the justices have taken such an unusually long time to release an opinion.

It's common for the court to delay releasing its biggest decisions until the very last day. Last year, the court did just that, releasing its bombshell decision upholding the health care law on June 28. This is often because the controversial cases are the most difficult and require more back-and-forth between the justices' dissents and the main opinion and concurrences.

Two highly anticipated gay marriage cases—Perry v. Hollingsworth and Windsor v. United States—are sure to have attracted just this sort of judicial shuffling.

In the Perry case, the court is expected decide whether California voters discriminated against gay people when they voted ""yes"" to Proposition 8, which bans same-sex marriage, in 2008. In Windsor, the court is weighing whether the federal Defense of Marriage Act—which limits all federal marriage benefits to opposite sex couples—violates the constitutional rights of same-sex couples.

Story continues

Justice Anthony Kennedy, a conservative-leaning swing vote on the court with a history of backing gay rights, is expected to decide the fate of both cases.

But it's possible that the justices could dodge the legal heart of those two cases—whether gays and lesbians have a fundamental right to marriage—and instead rule narrowly on procedural or standing grounds.

David Boies, an attorney representing same-sex couples in California in the Perry case, has said he believes the justices will rule that the proponents of Proposition 8 do not have the legal standing to challenge the lower court's ruling striking down the ban. (In the Proposition 8 case, California's elected officials opted not to appeal the lower court's ruling, and it's unclear if an unelected coalition of Proposition 8 supporters have the legal right to appeal on behalf of California voters.) If the court rules on these narrow grounds, it would make same-sex marriage legal again in California without having any implications for the dozens of states that currently ban same-sex marriage. This would punt the fundamental gay marriage question down the road for the court to decide later.

In the DOMA case, the justices may decide to strike it down based on the federalist argument that states should be allowed to define marriage for themselves. It's also possible that the justices will decide that Congress doesn't have the standing to defend the law, after the Obama administration's Justice Department declined to defend it in court. Either possibility would result in a narrow decision without much legal implications for the gay rights movement's larger argument that same-sex couples should be allowed to wed.

The two cases involving race, Shelby County v. Holder and Fisher v. University of Texas, will also most likely be released on Monday or another decision day next week.

In Shelby, the justices could significantly scale back the federal government's right to supervise states with a history of voting discrimination against minorities. If the justices decide to strike down this key part of the Voting Rights Act—a cornerstone of the civil rights movement that helped dismantle decades of discriminatory voting restrictions—states would have more leeway to pass laws the Obama administration considers to be discriminatory. These include laws that tighten identification requirements and limit early voting hours at the ballot box, which have passed in dozens of states in the past few years.

In Fisher, the court will decide whether universities can use race as a factor in undergraduate admissions. The Supreme Court established in 2003 in Grutter v. Bollinger that universities could use race as a factor in admissions as long as they did not use quotas (for example, that 10 percent of the class must be black). The justices said affirmative action was still necessary to counteract the effects of institutionalized racism that had prevented minorities from attending college in the past. The majority wrote that they believed that in 25 years, affirmative action would no longer be necessary and should be stopped.

It's possible that the justices will use Abigail Fisher's complaint that she was rejected from UT because she is white to step up the timeline set out in the 2003 decision, and reject the college's use of affirmative action as unconstitutional. The college argues that Fisher's grade point average and standardized test scores made her inadmissible regardless of her race, and that using race as one factor in admission helps it maintain a diverse student body.

The justices also have the option of not deciding some of the cases at all, which would mean they would have to be reargued in October. But that's rare. A hectic Monday full of four legal landscape-changing decisions is much more likely."

True, but for some of the Ohioans who acknowledged Mr. Portman, doubts flickered below the surface. “Senator!” said one spectator, Pete Kidnocker, reaching out to shake Mr. Portman’s hand. But after Mr. Portman passed, Mr. Kidnocker said he would vote for an alternative in a Republican primary and accused the senator of “betraying his principles.”

There's been a lot of focus on the Democratic senators who have switched their positions and say they are now supporting same-sex marriage. What about the ones who haven't — particularly Sens. Mark Pryor and Mary Landrieu?

Pryor of Arkansas and Landrieu of Louisiana are two of the most vulnerable Democrats up for re-election in 2014. They hail from red states that didn't vote for President Obama last year, and both have been quick to assert their independence from the White House.

Landrieu said in TV interviews last week that her personal views — like those of Democratic Sens. Kay Hagan of North Carolina and Mark Warner of Virginia — have ""evolved"" on the subject. ""But my state has a very strong constitutional amendment against gay marriage and I think I have to honor that,"" Landrieu told CNN.

Pryor didn't sound like he was about to change his stance in an interview with KFSM, the CBS affiliate for Fort Smith, Bentonville and Bentonville. ""I am opposed to gay marriage,"" he told the TV station via e-mail. The senator said he has talked to gay and lesbian friends, who have stressed that their sexual orientation is not a choice.

Pryor also told KFSM that he is undecided on the topic of benefits to same-sex couples and said he would revisit the issue after the Supreme Court rules in the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) case.

The Supreme Court heard arguments in late March challenging DOMA, and justices were skeptical that the law was constitutional because it denies benefits to same-sex couples. So timing is crucial here: It's one thing to come out and say you're for gay marriage before the court rules, which is expected sometime this summer.

There's also the question of electoral politics. Sen. Tim Johnson, D-S.D., who announced his support for marriage equality on Monday, has decided to retire and won't be facing voters again. Hagan, one of the Democrats to support gay marriage, is up for re-election in 2014 in a swing state that Obama lost in 2012 but won in 2008. What's more, North Carolina voters overwhelmingly approved a ban on gay marriage last year.

The third holdout on gay marriage is Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va. In a statement to Talking Points Memo last week, Manchin indicated he is unlikely to change his views. He said he believes marriage is ""a union between one man and one woman"" and that he also supports the Defense of Marriage Act."

When Barack Obama was running for President in 2008, I thought he was serious about protecting the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community from workplace discrimination. He made two key promises — that he would sign an executive order providing workplace protections by federal contractors, and that he would help pass the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA), ending workplace discrimination by all employers. I contributed to the campaign, expecting that if elected, he would keep his word to fight for our community.

Five years later, I’m still waiting. Despite having this executive order sitting on his desk, the president has yet to pick up his pen. While many employers have added nondiscrimination policies on their own, prominent holdouts such as Exxon Mobil set a damaging, dangerous precedent. Millions of LGBT Americans continue to experience the enormous pain of living and working in the closet, not allowed to acknowledge who we are and who we love.

As a gray-haired, 56-year-old lesbian, I don’t have time to wait another generation for equality — it’s been almost 40 years since similar legislation to ENDA was first introduced in Congress. And being polite hasn’t gotten us any closer to it becoming a reality.

When I attended a Democratic National Committee (DNC) fundraiser a few days ago, I brought this sense of urgency. When I blurted out my comments during the first lady’s speech, it was a spontaneous reaction to her saying, “Right now, today, we have an obligation to stand up for those kids.” I needed to speak up for LGBT youth, who make up 40 percent of homeless youth — kicked out onto the street because parents and workplaces won’t accept them for who they are — and for LGBT parents, whose lack of workplace protections imperils their children’s futures.

Michelle Obama is only the latest political figure to face an impassioned heckler. From Reagan to Romney, and Clinton to Christie we look at how politicians have handled the uninvited interlocutors. (The Fold/The Washington Post)

Some have said that the first lady wasn’t a proper target because she is not an elected official. However, time and again, the first lady has come to our community and asked us to “max out” on our contributions to the DNC. In fact, she had just made the same request of several hundred LGBT attendees, days after Senate Democrats had refused to include same-sex binational couples in their immigration reform bill. Despite the Democratic Party happily cashing LGBT checks, I have not seen the Obama administration “max out” on the myriad ways that the government could protect the LGBT community.

For most of my life, I have been in one closet or another, as my “coming out” process took decades. I remained in the work closet the longest, as a public servant doing environmental and consumer protection work. In the mid-90s, in the final round of interviews for a position I was offered and accepted, I was asked why I was moving to the area. I lied and responded that I was moving to help take care of a “family member.” The interviewer seemed satisfied with the response, not wanting to pry further and assuming it was an elderly parent. In truth, it was my partner of seven years — who I felt I had to hide and whose humanity I felt ashamed to acknowledge.

After years of these lonely, isolating and dehumanizing experiences, I’ve only recently been able to find the strength to advocate for myself and millions of others.

It is in small moments each day that LGBT Americans have to make choices about whether to acknowledge the truth of our own lives or hide ourselves away. We make choices about displaying family photos on a desk, or eating lunch alone to avoid questions about weekend plans, or ducking away from co-workers while out at dinner with friends. And it is in these moments that low-income LGBT Americans must choose between their humanity and a paycheck — knowing that making ends meet often means slowly chipping away at one’s identity.

Mrs. Obama has accomplished extraordinary things and is inarguably the conscience of the White House. She understands injustice at a deep level, and it was that political conscience I was hoping to stir at this week’s fundraiser. Some have said it was disrespectful for a white woman to interrupt an African American woman, or for an activist to interrupt the first lady. All I can say is that in that moment, I could no longer remain silent while standing in front of one of our country’s most powerful political figures. I spoke up for the millions of LGBT Americans who have to make small and excruciating choices each day about the extent to which they are able to live safe and honest lives.

My hope is that the first lady sees me as just one of millions who are desperate to participate fully in the American dream — a dream she is helping to build for millions across this country. After being locked out of that dream for so long, I hope President Obama considers the desperation we all feel for equality and signs this executive order."

If justices on the Supreme Court sounded cautious and tentative as they addressed the issue of same-sex marriage Tuesday, it’s little wonder. Like everyone else in public life, they are operating in the middle of a political whirlwind.

The political and legal systems are caught between past and future. Public opinion has shifted rapidly, and a majority of Americans now back legalizing same-sex marriage. Among those younger than 40, support is overwhelming. The question is when and in what form the future arrives.

There is little doubt that every Democrat who seeks the White House in 2016 will support same-sex marriage — a reality that wasn’t so obvious 18 months ago. The question for Republicans is whether any of their 2016 candidates will take a similar position.

There is no better reminder of how rapidly things have changed than to recall that President Obama declared his support for same-sex marriage just in May — and only after Vice President Biden got there first. Obama seemed as hesitant to change his position — it took him several years — as some of the justices sounded Tuesday about making sweeping rulings about the constitutionality of such unions.

Obama’s hesitancy was perhaps understandable. California’s Proposition 8, the ban on same-sex marriage that was the subject of Tuesday’s oral argument at the high court, was approved four years ago — and in a staunchly Democratic state. If that vote were held today, odds are that California voters would go the other way.

Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post Wait 1 second to continue.

Politicians in both parties are scrambling to come to terms with the swift change in public opinion and how that fits with the views of their traditional constituencies. Today, it is considered perilous for any Democrat with national aspirations not to support same-sex marriage — which may explain why Hillary Rodham Clinton announced her support last week.

Clinton wasn’t alone. This week, a number of Democrats from purple or red states — Sens. Mark R. Warner of Virginia, Claire McCaskill of Missouri and Jon Tester of Montana, among others — announced their support. Many others are sure to follow, no matter what the Supreme Court does on Proposition 8.

Among Republicans, Sen. Rob Portman (Ohio) announced a change in position this month and now supports same-sex marriage. He was motivated because his son is gay. But Portman is in the minority among current or former elected officials in his party, in company with former vice president Dick Cheney and former Utah governor Jon Huntsman Jr.

Rank-and-file Republicans remain opposed to same-sex marriage. Overall, 59 percent of Republicans say they are against it, and nearly all feel strongly about that opposition, according to the latest Washington Post-ABC News poll. Yet Republicans are divided generationally. For the first time in a Post-ABC News poll, a majority of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents younger than 50 support legalizing same-sex marriage.

Republican leaders see the overall shifts in public opinion as clearly as do the Democrats and have responded accordingly. In 2004, Republicans used ballot initiatives barring same-sex marriage to spur turnout among their conservative voters. That strategy helped then-President George W. Bush win reelection. Many Republicans then favored a federal constitutional amendment barring same-sex marriage.

In 2012, Republican nominee Mitt Romney was mostly silent on the issue, other than to state his opposition. Democrats made it a consistent theme of their national convention, and Obama included it in his inaugural address in January.

GOP leaders know their position is no longer a winning one. They are now looking for a strategy to avoid making it a losing issue. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus told USA Today’s Susan Page this week that although the party does not need to change its official opposition to same-sex marriage, there is no reason “to act like Old Testament heretics” on the issue.

Priebus said Republicans should be welcoming to people with different views. “We’re not going to agree on every issue,” he said. “It doesn’t mean that we need to divide and subtract people from our party.” GOP strategist Karl Rove said he thinks it’s possible that one of the Republican candidates for president in 2016 will support same-sex marriage — although most of those talked about as potential candidates are opposed today.

The Supreme Court justices can see the contours of this debate — rapidly moving public opinion along with generational and geographic differences — and may choose not to deal directly with the California proposition. Absent a Supreme Court decision, the battle to legalize these unions will be waged state by state, with a patchwork that probably will divide red states from blue states.

Symbolically, however, the debate is in a different place. The rising segments of the population favor same-sex marriage — a reality that adds to pressures on the Republican Party as its leaders seek to put the GOP in a position to compete more effectively for the White House without offending the party’s conservative base.

Justice Anthony Kennedy observed Tuesday that the court was in “uncharted waters” as it weighed the constitutionality of same-sex marriage. But many politicians aren’t waiting for the court to act."

And it’s not because there’s an anti-homosexual mood, and nobody’s homophobic that I know of, but many of us, and I consider myself included, base our standards not on the latest Washington Post poll, but on an objective standard, not a subjective standard.

I have great sympathy and extraordinary admiration for Sen. Portman. I consider him a friend and I value his work in the Senate and think he’s a great person. The mistake is that we sometimes base our public policy decisions on how we feel, how we think, maybe even some personal experiences, and we don’t regard a lot of these issues from the standpoint of an objective standard.

Last week, Reince Priebus said that he believed Mike Huckabee was a model for how Republicans should talk about social issues like marriage equality. Yesterday, Huckabee demonstrated what Priebus was talking about, answering a question about the possibility of the Republican Party endorsing marriage equality by saying But don't worry, it's not because evangelicals are bigots or anything like that:And he has the utmost respect for Sen. Rob Portman (R-OH) who recently became the only Republican senator to support marriage equality, joining 45 of his Democratic colleagues:So there you have it. Reince Priebus's model for talking about social issues doesn't hate Rob Portman—he just thinks he's a poll-driven weakling making decisions based on emotion instead of the objective truth that gay and lesbian couples should not be allowed to marry. It's not that Huckabee wants to be anti-homosexual or anything, it's just that objectively speaking, heterosexual couples should have more freedom than everyone else. And if Republicans make the mistake of giving into the temptation of not being homophobic bigots, a big chunk of their political base will quit the party, and maybe vote for Ray Moore or something like that. But they'll do it with a big old affable smile, just like Mike Huckabee."

Under the latest measure, the definition of marriage would be changed in state law from an act between a man and a woman to one between two people. Civil unions could be converted to marriages within a year of the law going onto the books.



The legislation would not require religious organizations to perform a marriage of gay couples, and church officials would not be forced to allow their facilities to be used by gay couples seeking to marry.



While advocates have brought forth a lengthy line-up of religious leaders who have endorsed gay marriage, Catholics and conservative African American church groups have provided fierce opposition. They argue same-sex marriage violates the basic tenets of the Bible, which call for marriage to be only between a man and a woman.



Advocates argue a prohibition on gay marriage goes against American values of equality and fairness.



They gathered ahead of the debate Thursday afternoon to demand a vote, detailing hurdles same-sex couples face without full legal recognition of their relationship.



Mercedes Santos and Theresa Volpe of West Rogers Park detailed how hospital officials would not let them both in the room when their now 5-year-old son was hospitalized for kidney failure because ""there couldn't be two moms.""



""My son was dying and the last thing I needed to do was sit and try to explain to them who I was,"" Volpe said. ""We feel very strongly about the message that's being sent today to our family. ... It's about equality and our family is just as equal as any other family that is allowed to have marriage."""

Chris Kyle, 38, a decorated Iraq war veteran, a former SEAL and author of “American Sniper,” was shot and killed Saturday. Police arrested Eddie Ray Routh, 25, a veteran authorities say may have a mental illness related to his military service.

In response to the news, Paul tweeted: “Chris Kyle’s death seems to confirm that ‘he who lives by the sword dies by the sword.’ Treating PTSD at a firing range doesn’t make sense.”

The tweet set off a chain reaction of criticism online.

Aaron Worthing (@AaronWorthing) responded: “What the Hell, @RonPaul? Are you actually blaming Chris Kyle for his own death?”

Michelle Lancaster (@SkiGarmisch) added, “Very disrespectful commentary to this man, his memory and his family. Shame on you.”

Razor (@hale.razor) wrote, “So all veterans, once done serving our nation with honor, deserve to be murdered as civilians? Wow.”

[pullquote]

Calls and emails to Paul for comment were not immediately returned. He averages about two tweets a day, typically about policy issues ranging from immigration to the Federal Reserve. Paul, who is known for his anti-war views, retired as a long-time Texas congressman earlier this year.

Kyle, the most lethal sniper in the U.S., had 160 confirmed kills. He enlisted in the Navy in February 1999 and was discharged in November 2009. He had four tours in Iraq under his belt and received 14 different awards and decorations, including two Silver Stars, five Bronze Stars with Valor and two Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medals. After leaving the Navy, he wrote his biography, “American Sniper.”

Last year, Kyle told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram that he didn’t go into the service for the money or awards.

“I did it because I felt like it was something that needed to be done and it was honorable,” Kyle said. “I loved the guys.”

Routh, a former corporal in the Marines, is being held on $3 million bond. He is also accused of killing Chad Littlefield, 35, who was at the gun range with Kyle. Routh has been charged with one count of capital murder and two charges of murder. Routh served on active duty from 2006 to 2010. He fought in Iraq in 2007 and was sent to Haiti in 2010.

In 2010, there were over 15,000 felons and fugitives who tried to illegally purchase firearms. Of those 15,000, the Obama Justice Department prosecuted just 44. Let me repeat those numbers because those numbers are staggering, 15,000, they only prosecuted 44.”

— Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), on the Sean Hannity Show, April 10, 2013

We’ve written before about the disconnect between the number of people denied guns via a background check and the number of people prosecuted. Essentially, bringing a criminal case for lying on a government form is a relatively low priority for prosecutors. But we have also shown that the federal numbers do not tell the complete picture, because there is strong evidence that state officials use background checks to pick up and charge fugitives and other at-large criminals.

Cruz, in a talking point he also repeated on the Lou Dobbs show, placed the blame for this problem on the Obama administration. He got one set of numbers wrong — in 2010 the number of felons and fugitive denied a firearm was actually 48,000, not 15,000 — but the number of prosecutions he cited (44) was on the nose. That’s out of nearly 73,000 total denials, for a variety of reasons, by the FBI.

Still, we were intrigued by his partisan framing of the problem. So we dug into the numbers again to see if there was much difference between Obama and the administration of George W. Bush in prosecuting such cases.

The Facts

Ever since the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) was established, government reports — such as by the General Accounting Office in 2003 and the Justice Department Inspector General in 2004 — have documented how few people are prosecuted. In 2002 and 2003, for instance, the IG found that only 154 people (much less than one percent) out of 120,000 denials were prosecuted — about an average of 78 prosecutions a year.

Starting in 2005, annual studies of the NICS system began listing the number of prosecutions per year that resulted from federal background checks. Generally, about the same number of people is denied through state agencies, but the records are spotty on how many state prosecutions resulted.

Below is the key data, with links to the reports in the date. The 2005 report did not break out the actual number of fugitives or felons, but just gave a percentage. We calculated the percentage of denials out of all denials because the data does not how many prosecutions involved felons or fugitives.

2010: 72,659 denials

34,459 felony convictions/indictments

13,862 fugitives

44 prosecutions (0.06 percent of denials)

2009: 67,324 denials

32,652 felony convictions/indictments

11,341 fugitives

77 prosecutions (0.11 percent)

2008: 70,725 denials

39,526 felony convictions/indictments

9,464 fugitives

105 prosecutions (0.15 percent)

2007: 73,992 denials

23,703 felony convictions/indictments

4,803 fugitives

122 prosecutions (0.16 percent)

2006: 69,930 denials

25,259 felony convictions/indictments

4,235 fugitives

112 prosecutions (0.16 percent)

2005: 66,705 denials

36.8 percent felony convictions/indictments

5.3 percent fugitives

135 prosecutions (0.20 percent)

Clearly there is a bit a downward trend here, with the low point reached in 2010, both in terms of raw numbers and as a percentage of denials. (We suspect there might have been a brief burst of enthusiasm for more prosecutions after the critical 2004 IG report.)

But the differences are really on the margins. Neither the Bush administration nor Obama administration ever prosecuted even ¼ of one percent of the people who failed to pass a criminal background check.

“The senator did not mention President Bush, did not say Bush was better,” said Cruz communications director Sean Rushton. “We’re talking about the current administration, which we are debating on its current hard push for new gun regulation. Obama’s prosecution stats stand on their own, regardless of the Bush record. And the underlying point is the same — why increase restrictions on law-abiding people when we’re not prosecuting under current law?”

The Pinocchio Test

If Cruz wants to attack the fact that relatively few people are prosecuted by federal prosecutors for lying on a background check, he should drop the partisan frame.

This clearly has never been a priority in either Republican or Democratic administrations. So Cruz’s claim that Obama has not made this a priority lacks the proper context and, under our Pinocchio scale, represents “selective telling of the truth.”

USA TODAY

Amar Kaleka says he wants Congress to %22stop playing politics%22

Six people were killed at Sikh Temple of Wisconsin in summer 2012 by a white supremacist

Rep. Ryan%2C the 2012 GOP vice presidential nominee%2C is in his eighth term in U.S. House

The son of a Wisconsin Sikh temple leader who was among those slain last year by a white supremacist says he intends to run for Congress and challenge House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan.

Amardeep Kaleka told the Associated Press that he wants to bring accountability and transparency back to Washington, and blames Ryan and his fellow Republicans for the partial government shutdown. Kaleka has been a staunch advocate for gun control, and called on Congress to impose stricter background checks on gun owners.

""There's a fever in the nation, and specifically in this district, for our leaders to stop playing politics and do their jobs,"" Kaleka said in his AP interview. ""All I want to do is bring democracy — a government of, for and by the people — back to America.""

Kaleka's father, Satwant Singh Kaleka, was the founder and president of the Milwaukee-area Sikh temple where six people were killed. Wade Michael Page walked into the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin in August 2012 and opened fire on several priests and worshipers. Page, who played in neo-Nazi bands, fatally shot himself after he was wounded in the parking lot by responding police.

Kaleka, 35, intends to run as a Democrat and file his paperwork Wednesday to form an exploratory committee. He helped organize a candlelight vigil this summer to mark the one-year anniversary of the mass shooting.

Ryan, the 2012 GOP vice presidential nominee, has been targeted by Democrats before in Wisconsin's 1st Congressional District. He easily won an eighth term in the House last year, even as he and Mitt Romney lost the presidential election.

Ryan marked the one-year anniversary of the shooting in Oak Creek, Wis., with a statement condemning the ""senseless act of violence"" and praising retired Lt. Brian Murphy, the first police officer to respond to the scene.

""Since that fateful day, the people of Oak Creek have come together,"" Ryan said in his statement. ""They refuse to let violence shake their community.""

A Senate bill to expand background checks on gun owners was rejected this spring, and is unlikely to come up in the Republican-controlled House.

The national battle over guns is headed to the states in a major way.

Already groups supporting more gun restrictions have been active on the local level. And now for the first time in almost two decades, the National Rifle Association is attempting to coordinate the recall of a top state legislator for having successfully passed further gun restrictions in his state, CNN has learned.

The focus of the NRA campaign is Colorado State Senate President John Morse. He is facing a petition drive to initiate an election to recall him because of legislation passed earlier this year requiring “universal” background checks on sales of all firearms in the state, as well as a ban on the sale of ammunition magazines greater than 15 rounds.

Morse told CNN he knew he was being targeted by local gun groups, but at the beginning did not know the NRA was after him.

""It was a grassroots effort for a little while, but when that didn't take at all, it was clear they were getting money from outside, and I wasn't the least bit surprised the NRA was behind it,"" said Morse.

The NRA declined an invitation to appear on ""The Lead.""



In a mailer obtained by CNN, the NRA Political Victory fund wrote to a “Second Amendment Supporter” in Colorado that “your NRA is coordinating a recall effort with the Basic Freedom Defense Fund to put Senator Morse on the ballot for a special election and vote him out of office.” (Emphasis theirs.)

You can see both sides of the mailer here and here.

Writes the NRA: “State Senator Morse led the charge to pass extreme and onerous anti-gun state legislation in Denver earlier this year. Responsible gun owners and sportsmen will be forever burdened by his misguided leadership in the Colorado Senate.”

""You have to remember that Colorado is ground zero for some of the worst gun tragedies that have occurred in our nation's history, with Columbine, and again Aurora,"" said Morse.

""We addressed [tighter gun regulations] this session, but this is what we get for that response,"" said Morse.

The NRA mailing sends recipients to the website of the Basic Freedom Defense Fund and urges them to find a local petition signing location where, it’s suggested, they go to sign the petition to hold a recall election. The petition drive has a June 3 deadline; 7,178 signatures are needed to mandate a recall election.

With efforts to enact further gun restrictions failing in the U.S. Senate, this latest move suggests that these fights are turning to the states.

Some political observers suggest that these local battles over gun laws could end up gaining the type of attention, fundraising and ferocity that marked the failed 2012 recall election of GOP Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, with national groups such as the NRA squaring off against groups in favor of more gun regulations led by New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg and former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Arizona, just as corporate interests, such as the Koch brothers, squared off in Wisconsin against national labor unions.

Christy Le Lait, the campaign manager for Morse, tells CNN that the “NRA is investing in these recall races to send a message to every other local official to not pass any other gun safety measures or else the NRA will come after you as well.”

The NRA begged off public comment, deferring all interviews to local Colorado gun activists involved in the petition drive.

The NRA was involved in fending off the recall of Walker, though that was not a fight about gun laws. It also was involved in the successful recall of California Gov. Gray Davis, though that too was not a fight about guns.

In 1994, the NRA led an effort to recall Democratic California state senator David Roberti, who had pushed a law to ban some types of semiautomatic assault rifles in that state, though that effort was unsuccessful."

Jay Nixon’s veto of a bill that would expand gun rights and make federal gun regulations unenforceable -- even as similar laws adopted in other states to buck federal gun rules face legal challenges.

Several of Nixon’s fellow Democrats told The Associated Press that they would vote to override his veto when lawmakers convene in September, even while agreeing with the governor that the bill couldn’t survive a court challenge. Many of them noted that in some parts of Missouri, a “no” vote on gun legislation could be career ending.

The legislation would make it a misdemeanor for federal agents to attempt to enforce any federal gun regulations that “infringe on the people’s right to keep and bear arms.” The same criminal charges would apply to journalists who publish any identifying information about gun owners. The charge would be punishable by up to a year in jail and a $1,000 fine.

Nixon said the bill infringes on the U.S. Constitution by giving precedence to state law over federal laws and by limiting the First Amendment rights of media.

The legislation is one of the boldest measures yet in a recent national trend in which states are attempting to nullify federal laws. A recent Associated Press analysis found that about four-fifths of the states have enacted local laws that directly reject or ignore federal laws on gun control, marijuana use, health insurance requirements and identification standards for driver’s licenses. Relatively few of those go so far as to threaten criminal charges against federal authorities.

The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last week ruled against a series of laws enacted in Montana that attempt to declare that federal firearms regulations don't apply to guns made and kept in that state. Similar laws have been adopted in other states.

In the Montana case, the Justice Department successfully argued that the courts have already decided Congress can use its power to regulate interstate commerce to set standards on such items as guns.

The ruling has the potential to affect similar laws in several other states and leaves open the possibility of an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.

The state of Montana has intervened in support of its law. The case also attracted the support of Utah, Alaska, Idaho, Michigan, Nebraska, South Carolina, South Dakota, West Virginia, and Wyoming.

In Missouri, gun rights legislation typically has received bipartisan support. In 2003, the Republican-led Legislature overrode Democratic Gov. Bob Holden’s veto of legislation legalizing concealed guns with the help of more than two dozen Democrats. That same year, Democrats helped Republicans to override another Holden veto of a bill limiting lawsuits against gun manufacturers.

“We love our guns and we love hunting. It’s not worth the fight for me to vote against it,” said Rep. T.J. McKenna, D-Festus. But, he added, “the bill is completely unconstitutional, so the courts are going to have to throw it out.”

McKenna was among 11 House Democrats who joined Republicans to pass the Missouri gun legislation in May, by a 116-38 vote. The bill cleared the Senate 26-6, with two Democrats supporting it. A veto override needs a two-thirds majority in both chambers, or 109 votes in the House and 23 in the Senate.

Republicans hold 24 Senate seats. Although Republicans currently hold 109 House seats, they’re down at least one of their own. Rep. Jay Barnes was the only Republican to vote against the original bill and said he opposes a veto override.

“Our Constitution is not a Chinese buffet, which we like and do not like,” the Jefferson City attorney told the AP. “The First Amendment is part of the Constitution that we must uphold. … (And) the supremacy clause means that states cannot criminalize the activities of agents of the federal government.”

If the rest of the Republicans stick together, and none are absent, that means they will need at least one Democratic vote to override the veto.

But so far, at least three House Democrats McKenna, Keith English of Florissant and Ben Harris of Hillsboro said they would support a veto override, and Democratic Rep. Jeff Roorda of Barnhart said he was leaning toward it.

“Being a rural-area Democrat, if you don’t vote for any gun bill, it will kill you,” Harris said. “That’s what the Republicans want you to do is vote against it, because if you vote against it, they’ll send one mailer every week just blasting you about guns, and you’ll lose” re-election.

Four other Democrats who voted for the bill told the AP they were now undecided. At least one of the original Democratic “yes” votes Rep. Steve Hodges, of East Prairie said he would switch to a “no.”

This year’s vetoed gun bill is entitled the “Second Amendment Preservation Act” a label that some Democrats said makes it politically risky to oppose.

Democratic Rep. Ed Schieffer, who proclaims himself “100 percent pro-gun,” said he voted for the bill in May with an eye toward a potential 2014 state Senate campaign against Republican Rep. Jeanie Riddle, of Mokane, who also supported the bill. Schieffer, of Troy, said he is undecided whether to support a veto override.

“I personally believe that any higher court will probably rule this particular gun law unconstitutional on that, I probably agree that the governor’s right,” Schieffer said. “But I may end up still voting for the gun bill, because I don’t want to be on record for not supporting guns.”

But Bloomberg has already expanded his reach beyond New York City, with his coalition Mayors Against Illegal Guns and his political advocacy group Independence USA PAC.

Bloomberg dared to poke the bee hive, wading into the National Rifle Association's home state to back Democratic candidate Terry McAuliffe in the Virginia governor's race. McAuliffe eked out a win over Republican state Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli Tuesday night.

""If I 20 years ago said to you a Democrat, who was F-rated by the NRA, and unabashedly in favor of commonsense gun checks, background checks – if I told you he could win governor, you would have laughed me out of the room,"" Bloomberg said in an interview with CNN's ""The Lead with Jake Tapper.""

""The voters of the home state of the NRA stood up yesterday and said, 'Enough,'"" said Bloomberg,



Bloomberg's Independence USA PAC gave $1.7 million to Terry McAuliffe, and more than $3 million in Virginia races overall, according to the Virginia Public Access Project.

""The people of Virginia have spoken, and the people of Virginia will be safer because of this,"" said Bloomberg.

But the people of Virginia had mixed reactions to ads run by Bloomberg's political group. Democrats tell CNN the ad supporting greater restrictions on guns played well in the Northern Virginia suburbs, but not so well in the outer suburbs, where feelings about the NRA are more positive. And in Southwestern Virginia, where McAuliffe did poorly, Bloomberg's involvement was used as a message point against him.

The NRA said some of Bloomberg’s endorsements were a bust, like the $100,000 the mayor’s political group invested in an NRA-endorsed Virginia State House candidate. “She won, he lost,” an NRA official said in an e-mail to CNN. The association also highlighted that of the 67 Virginia House Delegates the NRA endorsed, 65 won.

“It's a democracy, so not everybody is going to be on the same side. But McAuliffe won, which says a majority of the voters in Virginia want commonsense background checks,” said Bloomberg.

The mayor had a personal interest in getting involved in Virginia.

“I represent New York City. When we stop people with guns, illegal guns, more of them come from Virginia, sadly, than from any other state. So that was one of the factors that also convinced me that I should put some money into this race,” said Bloomberg.

Newly re-elected New Jersey Governor Chris Christie said Tuesday that gun control measures need to address “root problems,” and “deal with folks who have mental health issues before they act out.”

“What Governor Christie is talking about is the person that takes an automatic weapon and kills many people. And, yes, I'm very much in favor of trying to find those people and provide help and get them off the streets,” said Bloomberg.

But, he added, “That's not where most people are killed. Most people are killed one or two at a time on the streets of our cities all over this country.”

Lessons for the country

Christie was re-elected in a blue state, with about 60% of the vote.

“The lesson for this whole country, whether it was Christie or McAuliffe - both of them were centralists. They could work across the aisle,” said Bloomberg. “Being an obstructionist, or being a radical, the voters rejected that in both cases.”

Handing over the reins to Bill de Blasio

Bloomberg met with Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio for about an hour Wednesday morning. De Blasio won by a landslide last night, beating out Republican nominee Joe Lhota by about 40 percentage points. Bloomberg chose not to endorse anyone in the race.

“Bill de Blasio and I aren't going to agree on everything, but we certainly agree on a lot of things,” said Bloomberg, who added he has “a big vested interest” in ensuring his successor is a successful mayor.

“The bottom line is, I'm going to live in New York City, and I want Bill de Blasio's administration to be successful, and our administration to do everything to transfer everything we've been doing over,” said Bloomberg.

The “slippery slope” of marijuana

Several ballot initiatives on marijuana passed Tuesday night – Colorado will now tax the drug, and Portland voters approved legalizing recreational marijuana for residents 21 and older.

“This is just a bad idea,” said Bloomberg, “and a slippery slope for us to go down.”

The mayor said he worries that drug dealers who can no longer make money selling marijuana will move on to more potent drugs, and marijuana users who grow accustomed to the drug will move on to prescription drugs, or crack and cocaine.

“There's no science that says smoking a lot of strong marijuana, which is what's on the market, I'm told, today, is good for your health,” said Bloomberg.

Bloomberg 2016?

Given Bloomberg’s national recognition, and his expanding footprint in political races across the country, it is likely he will play some role in the 2016 elections.

“Let me guarantee you two things. Number one: I will vote. And number two: I won't be running … in terms of something in the middle,” said Bloomberg.

“It depends who's running, and whether I want to support them, whether I want to get involved,” said Bloomberg.

“I've got more things to do, going forward, than I can handle. In fact, I've got to start learning how to say no to new things,” said Bloomberg."

It is the latest in a series of proposals to tighten gun laws in the state, the fates of which are now being decided in the House and Senate.

The last several days have been marked by many hours of emotional debate over the proposed laws.

Earlier this week, state lawmakers passed a bill that bans the purchase of ammunition magazines of more than 15 rounds. It now awaits the governor’s signature. The legislation requiring universal background checks, House Bill 1229, had also passed but was returned to the legislature so it could be amended to define how organizations such as gun trusts would act during gun transfers. The amended bill passed the Senate on a 19-14 vote. It passed the House 36 to 27 a few hours later.

Gov. John Hickenlooper, a Democrat, who called for universal background checks in his State of the State address in January, is expected to sign the bill.

The state has been thrust into the national spotlight as a debate over gun control rages in the aftermath of the shooting deaths in December of 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.

Colorado, a battleground state where many revere gun ownership, has also been roiled by two of the largest mass shootings in U.S. history, at Columbine High School in 1999 and at an Aurora movie theater in 2012. That shooting left 12 people dead and 70 injured.

Republicans in both chambers have voiced strong opposition to House Bill 1229. On Friday, several said they feared that young people in 4-H clubs and Boy Scout programs could be targeted. Others said a state tradition of outdoor sportsmanship was threatened.

Republican state Sen. Kevin Lundberg said that exemptions in the legislation meant to cover certain gun transfers were insufficient and could put a burden on common transfers between friends and neighbors.

“We’ve made a dysfunctional mess of these exemptions,” he said. “No one, practically speaking, will be able to get their arms around it.”

On Friday the Denver Post reported that universal checks could be hampered because some of the federally licensed dealers who would be required to conduct them have said the $10 fee for the service is not enough to cover its costs.

Also on Friday, National Rifle Assn. Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre used his speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference near Washington, D.C., to argue against expanding the background-check system, which, he said, “only includes good, law abiding people.” He repeated his allegation that new checks would lead to a national registry of firearms that the government would use to tax or take guns.

Supporters of the tightened gun laws say opponents have unfairly painted their efforts.

“These bills do not take firearms away from anyone who can legally have one,” Colorado Senate President John Morse said in a statement. “Those political scare tactics have zero truth behind them. These bills are reasonable policies that respect 2nd Amendment rights, while helping to keep Colorado safe.”

Four weeks later, Mr. Begich, who faces re-election next year, ignored Mr. Obama’s pleas on a landmark bill intended to reduce gun violence and instead voted against a measure to expand background checks. Mr. Obama denounced the defeat of gun control steps on Wednesday as “a shameful day.”

But Mr. Begich’s defiance and that of other Democrats who voted against Mr. Obama appear to have come with little cost. Sally Jewell, the interior secretary, is still planning a trip to Alaska — to let Mr. Begich show his constituents that he is pushing the government to approve the road.

The trip will also reinforce for Mr. Begich and his colleagues a truth about Mr. Obama: After more than four years in the Oval Office, the president has rarely demonstrated an appetite for ruthless politics that instills fear in lawmakers. That raises a broader question: If he cannot translate the support of 90 percent of the public for background checks into a victory on Capitol Hill, what can he expect to accomplish legislatively for his remaining three and a half years in office?"

Among other things, the new laws require background checks for private gun sales and limit ammunition magazines to 15 rounds.

Mr. Morse’s hand was on the tiller during much of that debate. A former police chief, he said he found himself in a position of not just rounding up votes, but actually explaining the mechanics of guns to fellow Democrats. He brought a magazine to show his colleagues how it worked. In an emotional speech in March, as the debate reached its peak, Mr. Morse stood on the Senate floor and spoke of gun violence and “cleansing a sickness from our souls.”

His opponents pounced on the remark, framing it as a sign of Mr. Morse’s disregard for his gun-owning constituents, as well as a symptom of the widening gap between Colorado’s urban Democrats and its rural Republicans.

Mr. Morse represented a slice of Colorado Springs that straddles those fault lines. His district is closely split among Democrats, Republicans and unaffiliated voters. And on Tuesday, despite huge voter-turnout drives and Obama-style neighborhood canvassing, more of Mr. Morse’s opponents showed up to cast him out.

The passions ignited by the vote were on full display on Tuesday, as opposing sides lined up side by side outside polling places here in Colorado’s second-largest city. They spoke of knowing survivors of the mass shooting inside the Century 16 theater in Aurora, Colo.

Arkansas Democrat voted against Senate bill to expand background checks on gun buyers

Pryor has been target of ads by gun-control group founded by NYC Mayor Michael Bloomberg

Senator is considered one of most vulnerable Democrats up for re-election in 2014

WASHINGTON -- Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor is firing back at gun-control advocates, using the first TV ad of his 2014 campaign to defend his vote against gun legislation and push back against New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

The ad, coming 17 months before Pryor faces voters in Arkansas, began running statewide Friday.

Pryor was one of four Democrats who voted in April against a bill that would expand background checks on gun buyers. The Arkansas senator has been targeted in ad campaigns by Mayors Against Illegal Guns, the group co-founded by Bloomberg, both before and since the Senate vote.

""The mayor of New York City is running ads against me because I opposed President Obama's gun-control legislation. Nothing in the Obama plan would have prevented tragedies like Newtown, Aurora, Tucson or even Jonesboro,"" Pryor said in the ad, as he speaks directly to the camera. ""I'm committed to finding real solutions to gun violence while protecting our Second Amendment rights.""

Pryor ends the ad by saying, ""No one from New York or Washington tells me what to do. I listen to Arkansas.""

Obama blasted the politics of the gun debate after the Senate defeated the bipartisan background check proposal, calling it a ""shameful"" day. Only four Republicans supported the measure, which was considered a compromise. The bill would have expanded background checks to include purchases made at gun shows and on the Internet.

Earlier this month, Pryor told an Arkansas audience that he'd be willing to look at a revised gun proposal if it combined parts of the background checks proposal by Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa., and another drafted by Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa.

Pryor voted for the Grassley plan, which included strict penalties on ""straw purchases"" -- those made by someone who can legally own a gun on behalf of someone who is barred from owning a firearm.

Pryor is widely considered to be among the most vulnerable Senate Democrats seeking re-election, although a Republican opponent has not yet entered the race. Obama lost Arkansas to Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential election by nearly 24 percentage points.

Pryor raised nearly $2 million from January through March in his bid for a third term, including at a fundraising event featuring former president Bill Clinton, a longtime friend of the Pryor family. Pryor's father, David, is a popular former Arkansas governor and senator."

Political conventional wisdom has it that in a purple state, such as Virginia, support for gun-safety legislation is best played down. As manager of Mark Herring’s campaign for attorney general, I got a lot of advice. One of the things I heard most frequently was that we should soft-pedal his strong record and advocacy for sensible gun legislation. It would hurt us outside of Northern Virginia and wasn’t a voting issue within the Beltway, I was told.

Like much conventional wisdom, this was wrong — and we not only ignored this advice but did the opposite. There were stark differences between Herring and his Republican opponent, Sen. Mark D. Obenshain (R-Harrisonburg), on gun safety. Obenshain opposed comprehensive background checks and opposed closing the gun-show loophole. He opposed former governor Douglas Wilder’s landmark “one-gun-a-month” legislation. Obenshain also made a habit of voting for such irresponsible proposals as allowing guns in bars and restaurants where alcohol is served.

In short, Obenshain has opposed every constructive proposal to help reduce gun violence.

We knew this would open an opportunity for us to draw an effective contrast; public polling showed widespread support for sensible gun-safety laws, as did our own polling. Hence, more than a year out from Election Day, dealing with gun violence was a fundamental messaging point for Herring. And when the primary was over, and Herring and Obenshain met in their first debate, he drew a sharp contrast with his opponent on guns. We would prosecute that case throughout the fall campaign.

1 of 11 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × 11 facts about the NRA View Photos The National Rifle Association becomes a focus of coverage whenever gun-related massacres take place in the United States. But how well do you know the NRA's history and background? Caption The National Rifle Association becomes a focus of coverage whenever gun-related massacres take place in the United States. But how well do you know the NRA's history and background? 1. Its first president might be better known for sideburns. Gen. Ambrose E. Burnside, formerly a gunsmith, bemoaned the Union's shooting inaccuracy and tactics in the Civil War. He became the NRA's first leader when it was founded in 1871 in New York with the goal to ""promote and encourage rifle shooting on a scientific basis.'' The word sideburns is a play on Burnside's last name, used to describe the hair on the side of his face that curled around to join his mustache. Library of Congress/AP Wait 1 second to continue.

Obenshain’s position against gun-safety legislation was standard GOP fare — but it reflected a state and a voter mind-set that no longer exist. Almost all Virginians support sensible gun-safety legislation. Over the years, the commonwealth has become more urban and suburban, not only in Northern Virginia but also in Norfolk and Richmond. We found broad support in the Washington suburbs, Richmond and Norfolk for comprehensive background checks and ending the gun-show loophole.

Campaigns must make difficult financial choices, and in the general election, we knew we were going to be outspent by as much as three to one. We also knew that two issues would be powerful to voters: gun violence and Obenshain’s extremist views on women’s health issues. We couldn’t afford to focus on both simultaneously, so we started our television campaign on Obenshain’s record on women. Our intent was to start with these issues, broaden the offensive and eventually close by focusing on Obenshain’s record of inaction, or worse, on gun violence.

Ultimately, we never stopped talking about Obenshain’s abysmal record on women’s health. Independence USA, the super political action committee started by New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, and Americans for Responsible Solutions, the organization founded by former representative Gabrielle “Gabby” Giffords and her husband, Mark Kelly, joined the race in the closing weeks, running commercials that discussed gun violence issues.

The National Rifle Association ran commercials against Herring, but its messages were directed at voters who our own polling showed were never accessible to Herring. The NRA avoided the largest concentrations of swing voters in the Northern Virginia, Norfolk and Richmond markets. That is not a recipe for growth or success.

The swing vote began to shift dramatically in our favor at the end. When the ballots were counted in Northern Virginia, Herring not only beat Obenshain there by more than 100,000 votes, but he also increased the total Democratic vote in Northern Virginia for attorney general by more than 124,000 since the last election. A post-election survey of voters in Northern Virginia by the Global Strategy Group indicated that 57 percent of those who voted for Herring in Northern Virginia believe gun issues had a major impact on the way they voted.

This massive increase wasn’t just about the mechanics of campaigning. The painful and numbing record of senseless gun violence — from Columbine High School in Colorado to Virginia Tech to Newtown, Conn., and, during the heart of the fall campaign, the Navy Yard shooting — was the real determinant of voters’ sentiments. Our campaign pointed out the contrast, and voters lined up on our side. Even the NRA’s active opposition in its home state could not change the fact that voters rejected our opponent’s radical position on gun safety. Those perpetuating the conventional wisdom should take notice: In the end, voters were calling out for action on gun violence, and they flocked to the candidate who offered progress and a sensible, mainstream approach to protecting Virginians."

Pollak'],Obama's gun stance creates trouble for Dems in 2014,"Politico notes that the biggest obstacle to Democrats’ hopes of re-taking the House of Representatives in 2014 may be President Barack Obama. And the reason? His crusade for gun control:

Adding to the complications of running as a conservative Democrat is the lingering presence of billionaire New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who has essentially declared war on pro-gun Democrats. Last month, Bloomberg funneled $2 million into his super PAC to sink the fortunes of a pro-NRA Democrat in a special primary election for an Illinois congressional seat. (A Democrat closer to Bloomberg’s gun stance is expected to win the general election.) Polls consistently show Obama’s positions on issues ranging from immigration to the minimum wage to gun control picking up wide support across the country. But the 2014 battle for the House won’t be fought nationally — it will most likely be decided in several dozen districts, all but a handful of which favor Republicans.

Politico understates the importance of that Illinois race. The Democrat whom Bloomberg–and Obama–backed, Robin Kelly, has said she is in favor of “banning guns” outright and boasted of her “F” rating from the NRA. David Axelrod mocked her opponent, former Rep. Debbie Halvorson, suggesting that she was ironically insensitive to the “carnage” in the district she was running to represent. The real irony was that the Obama machine had recruited the pro-Second Amendment Halvorson to run in 2008.

“@politico: NRA ally Debbie Halvorson could win Jesse Jackson Jr.’s Chicago seat: politi.co/Whw4xE“Ironic, given carnage in 2d CD. — David Axelrod (@davidaxelrod) January 27, 2013

Kelly was backed by Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-IL), who is featured in today’s Breitbart News story talking about how the assault weapons ban is merely the first step in a long-term agenda to ban handguns.

That might work in urban districts where Democrats rarely lose. It won’t work in swing districts that Obama lost in 2012, which are the districts that Democrats need to pick up in 2014. And it can’t help that they have anti-gun zealots like Schakowsky and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi leading the charge."

Bloomberg, in a sharp escalation in the battle over gun control, is seeking to punish Democratic senators by taking away the one thing they most need from New Yorkers: money.

On Wednesday, Mr. Bloomberg will send a personal letter to hundreds of the biggest Democratic donors in New York urging them to cut off contributions to the four Democratic senators who helped block a bill in April that would have strengthened background checks on gun purchasers.

The move could inflame tensions that have simmered for weeks between Mr. Bloomberg, who blames the four Democrats for the defeat of the bill, and Democratic Senate leaders, who have privately told City Hall that the attacks can serve only to empower a Republican majority openly hostile to Mr. Bloomberg’s priorities.

By appealing to the Democrats’ financial base, Mr. Bloomberg is exploiting his relationships and prestige among wealthy New Yorkers to disrupt the flow of campaign money to key Democrats whose re-election next year will help determine whether the party retains control of the Senate. No state is more essential to the party’s fund-raising: Sitting Democratic senators and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee raised $30.4 million from New York donors in 2012, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, more than in any other state."

One, he says, he had before July 1, when the law banning the possession, sale or transfer of the large-capacity magazines went into effect. The other, he “maybe” obtained afterward.

He shuffles the magazines, which look identical, and then challenges the audience to tell the difference.

“How is a deputy or an officer supposed to know which is which?” he asks.

Colorado’s package of gun laws, enacted this year after mass shootings in Aurora, Colo., and Newtown, Conn., has been hailed as a victory by advocates of gun control. But if Sheriff Cooke and a majority of the other county sheriffs in Colorado offer any indication, the new laws — which mandate background checks for private gun transfers and outlaw magazines over 15 rounds — may prove nearly irrelevant across much of the state’s rural regions.

Some sheriffs, like Sheriff Cooke, are refusing to enforce the laws, saying that they are too vague and violate Second Amendment rights. Many more say that enforcement will be “a very low priority,” as several sheriffs put it. All but seven of the 62 elected sheriffs in Colorado signed on in May to a federal lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the statutes."

NEWARK, N.J., Aug 8 (Reuters) - New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a likely Republican contender for the White House in 2016, on Thursday signed into law 10 bills tightening restrictions on guns in the state.

The measures including banning the purchase of handguns by people on a federal watch list of potential terrorism suspects, stepping up penalties on some firearms violations and exempting gun records from the state's open public records law.

The moves made New Jersey the latest northeastern state to tighten gun laws in the wake of a December school massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, that left 26 young students and educators dead and sparked a renewed debate on gun control.

""These common-sense measures will both strengthen New Jersey's already tough gun laws and upgrade penalties for those who commit gun crimes and violate gun trafficking laws,"" said Christie, who is expected to easily win reelection this year.

In a nod to public pressure from gun-rights activists, he held off on signing other proposed measures that would have banned .50-caliber rifles, required dealers to log ammunition sales and allowed for instant background checks.

Gun rights, which are protected by the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, are a contentions issue on the national stage. A gun-rights group in New Hampshire - the site of a key presidential nominating primary where Christie would want to do well should he run for president - warned that it would organize voters against him if he were to crack down on gun owners in New Jersey.

""There are still three major anti-gun bills on Governor Christie's desk, and we are watching,"" said Sam Cohen, executive vice president of Pro Gun New Hampshire.

Gun control supporters in New Jersey said the signings represented a step forward.

""Seeing these bills signed into law is a victory for New Jersey's communities,"" said Louis Greenwald, majority leader of the state assembly. ""Yet they do not go far enough in doing all we can to prevent gun-related tragedies from afflicting our families.""

Neighboring New York state and nearby Connecticut have recently tightened their already restrictive laws on gun ownership in the wake of the Newtown shooting.

Not all legislation aimed at guns this year will tighten restrictions. Illinois in July adopted a law allowing its residents to carry concealed guns, making it the last state in the nation to permit some form of possession of guns in public. (Editing by Scott Malone and Phil Berlowitz)"
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/01/18/senate-dems-noncommittal-on-obama-gun-control-plan/,2013-01-18 00:00:00,[],Senate Dems hesitant on Obama gun control plan,"President Obama's gun-control package was always going to be a tough sell in the Republican-led House -- but the plan is already running into resistance, or at least hesitation, from moderate Democrats in the Senate.

The lukewarm response in the Senate to Obama's highly anticipated anti-gun violence plan portends an uphill climb for the legislation. And it underscores how, as the president's backers prepare to launch a veritable campaign to promote the plan, they will be pressuring members of their own party as much as reluctant Republicans.

No Democrat in the Senate came out against Obama's gun plan. But several appeared to be on the fence or noncommittal, even as the president's allies in the House cheered the package as a long-sought solution to America's gun violence problem.

""We must find a way to balance our Second Amendment rights with the challenges of mental illness, criminal behavior and the safety of our schools and communities,"" Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., said in a statement, noting Louisiana's tradition of hunting, target shooting and gun collecting. She said she would give the proposals ""serious consideration.""

The president on Wednesday called for a new and stronger assault-weapons ban as well as a 10-round cap on magazines and universal background checks. The last assault-weapons ban expired in 2004 amid questions about its effectiveness and political considerations. The shocking mass shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., has renewed interest in seeking a stricter crackdown on weapons that do the most damage -- yet more than a decade later, lawmakers remain leery about the perception of infringing on Second Amendment rights.

Many of the Democrats voicing concern are up for re-election in 2014. A total of 20 Democratic seats are up in the next cycle -- 22 when special elections are included.

Among those senators is Sen. Mark Begich, D-Alaska, who has parted with the president before on energy and other issues.

He said he was ""pleased"" with Obama's call for an increase in mental health services, but said ""there is no quick fix when it comes to keeping our families and communities safe.""

""We must make smart investments to increase our safety while ensuring American's Second Amendment rights are protected,"" he said.

Sen. Joe Manchin in West Virginia and Sen. Max Baucus in Montana have also declined to take a position on the president's proposals.

Even Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, who is considered to have a pro-gun rights record, said only that the chamber would ""consider"" the legislation.

""The tragedy at Sandy Hook was just the latest sad reminder that we are not doing enough to protect our citizens -- especially our children -- from gun violence and a culture of violence, and all options should be on the table moving forward,"" he said.

House Speaker John Boehner similarly did not take a position on the plan after Obama announced it Wednesday.

One lawmaker to watch is Sen. Al Franken in Minnesota. Considered among the most liberal members of the Senate, Franken nevertheless represents a state with a strong gun-rights culture and one where both parties are well-represented - he is up for re-election in 2014.

His office scrambled on Thursday to clarify an article which suggested he was holding back on endorsing an assault-weapons ban.

In a carefully worded statement, Franken said he's ""always supported the Second Amendment rights of Minnesotans to own firearms for collection, protection, and sport. But I also think we need to find a balance between those rights and the safety of our children and our communities.""

He noted he co-sponsored legislation to ban large magazines and supports ""the principle that we should reinstate a ban on assault weapons.""

Gov. Jerry Brown and the Legislature also restricted the controversial oil-drilling technique known as fracking and allowed transgender students to choose which school restrooms to use and sports teams to join, based on their gender identity.

California’s willingness to address contentious policy issues, many of which have remained suspended in Washington’s partisan divide, comes in the state’s new era of one-party rule. Democrats hold the governor’s office, every other statewide post and supermajorities in both houses of the Legislature – political dominance not seen here in more than a century.

While Congress was gridlocked on immigration issues last year, for example, Brown and state lawmakers approved more than a dozen bills on the subject.

One bars local law enforcement officials from detaining immigrants in the country illegally longer than necessary so that federal immigration authorities can take them into custody, if they are accused of only minor crimes. Immigrants would have to be charged with or convicted of a serious offense to merit a 48-hour hold and transfer to U.S. immigration officials under the controversial new measure known as the Trust Act.

The stricter gun controls were enacted in the wake of the 2012 shooting deaths of 20 students and six adults at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut.

One of those restrictions is a five-year ban on firearm possession by anyone who makes serious threats of violence to psychotherapists. The law requires those mental health professionals to notify law enforcement of such threats within 24 hours.

The governor signed 800 bills last year, and most of them kick in Wednesday. Others became law immediately upon his signature or will take effect later.

California’s minimum wage will rise to $9 an hour from $8, for example, but not until July 1. It will climb to $10 by January 2016.

And a new law permitting driver’s licenses for immigrants who are in the country illegally will start Jan. 1, 2015, after new DMV guidelines are developed. The agency has said it may be able to issue the first licenses late this year, if public hearings and the drafting of rules go smoothly.

The new state laws include:

Cars

Pat Toomey, R-Pa., wasn’t planning to co-sponsor legislation seeking to expand background checks for gun purchases if reintroduced. While Toomey noted that it was “unlikely” another attempt to pass the measure would succeed in Congress, he said he would be a co-sponsor of such a bill if it were to be reintroduced.

As a lifetime member of the National Rifle Association with an “A+” rating for her voting record in the Tennessee House of Representatives, Debra Maggart never imagined that her political career would end this way.

Maggart, who chaired the Republican caucus, killed an NRA-backed bill that would have permitted Tennesseans to keep firearms in their parked vehicles wherever they went — work, school or the neighborhood bar.

Months later, Maggart was stunned to see NRA-sponsored ads on billboards in her district. Her face was next to a picture of President Obama. The ads proclaimed: “Sure, Rep. Debra Maggart Says She Supports Your Gun Rights. Of Course, He Says the Same Thing.”

The NRA threw its support behind a newcomer in the Republican primary. By summer’s end, the woman who had been one of Tennessee’s most powerful Republicans and ardent supporters of gun rights was done in by hardball tactics.

“As a pro-Second Amendment person and a life member of the NRA, I was just shocked they did this to me,” Maggart said in an interview. “They did this to send a message: ‘If you don’t do what we want, we will annihilate you.’ ”

The message has not been lost on lawmakers across the nation, including those in the U.S. Senate, where a proposal to expand background checks for gun purchases died April 17 in the face of the NRA’s staunch opposition.

For longtime NRA members, the Senate vote was not surprising. The group has turned the debate over gun control into a clarion call for constitutional rights. Any perceived assault on the Second Amendment is met with a withering counterattack. Even conservative lawmakers who cross the NRA are labeled as traitors. The NRA has been so effective over the years that gun-control groups are now trying to adopt some of the same tactics.

Well-organized NRA members and affiliated groups of gun owners hold rallies and pour resources into political campaigns. They flood local and national legislative offices with e-mails and phone calls. They make unannounced visits to the offices of lawmakers. The NRA’s lobbying arm posts myriad “Alerts,” calling on millions of members across the country to rise up at a moment’s notice.

It’s more about organizing muscle and less about political money.

A spokesman for the NRA did not return calls requesting comment.

“The NRA knows how to play very effective hardball,” said Richard Feldman, a former NRA lobbyist who wrote the book “Ricochet,” an inside account of gun politics and tactics. “They have turned this into a symbolic issue. It’s no longer about guns. It’s about freedom and responsibility and liberty.”

After the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings in Newtown, Conn., in December, Sen. Mark Begich (D-Alaska) said he could sense a “sea change” in gun politics. He issued a public pledge: He would not “shy away” from challenging the NRA, which has great influence in his state.

That was before Begich was overwhelmed by phone calls and e-mails from NRA members and other gun rights activists. They warned him against voting for expanded background checks, to stop violating “our gun rights,” and to break with the Democratic Party or face the consequences in the next election.

Begich was one of four Democrats from states with strong NRA membership to turn his back on his party and the legislation.

‘One strike and you’re out’

The NRA’s tough tactics have a long history. In 1994, after President Bill Clinton pushed criminal background checks and a 10-year ban on assault-style weapons through Congress, the NRA organized a grass-roots uprising.

The midterm elections that year were a bloodbath for Democrats who opposed the NRA, and Republicans took control of the House of Representatives for the first time in 40 years.

Some of the most influential members of the Democratic Party lost their seats that night, including House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (Wash.) and House Judiciary Chairman Jack Brooks (Tex.).

“The NRA had a great night,” Clinton would write in his autobiography. “They beat both Speaker Tom Foley and Jack Brooks, two of the ablest members of Congress, who had warned me this would happen. . . . The NRA was an unforgiving master: one strike and you’re out.”

George “Buddy” Darden was one of the 54 House Democrats to lose his job that night. For nearly 10 years, he had represented a district that included suburban Atlanta and swaths of rural Georgia, an increasingly conservative district with an well-organized contingent of NRA members.

Darden opposed the ban on assault-style weapons, but he wound up voting for the bill that contained the 10-year prohibition. The NRA leadership was infuriated. It recruited conservative religious groups, along with like-minded city council members and county commissioners, to attack Darden and support Republican challenger Robert L. Barr Jr., who used a local gun shop as a campaign base.

Barr won with more than 52 percent of the vote.

Looking back, Darden said numerous factors played into his loss. Although he refused to give the NRA full credit, he acknowledged that the group influenced the outcome of that race.

“The NRA is a take-no-prisoners organization. There is no margin of error with them,” Darden said in an interview. “I knew their position, and I can’t complain. I just felt that the Second Amendment, just like any other amendment, is not absolute.”

Feldman, the former NRA lobbyist, remembers the Darden-Barr race well. At the time, he was chief executive of the American Shooting Sports Council, a trade association for the firearms industry.

“He voted for the final package that included the assault weapons ban, and the day after he did that, there were lines around the corner of the gun store of people supporting Bob Barr,” Feldman recalled. “The NRA supported Barr. We supported Barr. You do what you do in a democracy.

“You support your friends, and you oppose your enemies.”

‘I couldn’t believe it’

Debra Maggart has been around firearms all her life. Her family owned Carter Hardware in Nashville, which sold rifles, shotguns and handguns. She got her hunter’s license, joined a local gun club and went to the Tennessee House in 2004 as a pro-gun lawmaker.

“You can’t get more pro-Second Amendment than me,” she said.

Last year, Maggart said, the NRA drafted a bill to permit concealed weapons to be kept in locked vehicles no matter where they were parked. She said business and property owners objected, arguing that they could be liable for gunfire on their properties. Maggart tabled the bill in April 2012.

In early July, she started to receive frantic phone calls from her friends.

“Have you seen the billboards?” they asked.

“I went out and looked, and I couldn’t believe it,” she said. “The billboards said I was just like Obama, and where I’m from, that’s deadly.”

The billboard ads were followed by radio spots, newspaper ads and fliers mailed to homes in her district: “Maggart and Obama: We Can’t Trust Either With Our Rights.”

On YouTube, Chris Cox, chief of lobbying for the NRA, went after Maggart.

“We’ve put up ads and billboards comparing Debra Maggart to Barack Obama,” Cox said. “That’s because, while both say they support our Second Amendment rights, they both worked against our freedoms behind closed doors.”

Maggart estimated that the NRA and other gun groups spent $155,000 on the race. She said all she could do was watch her polling numbers fall. She ended up losing the Republican primary by 16 percentage points to a candidate handpicked by the NRA, Courtney Rogers, a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel who had no political experience.

“They will lie about you. They will use intimidation tactics. They will use bullying tactics, and because of that, people are afraid,” Maggart said.

“Why wouldn’t you be afraid?’”

Ayotte in the middle

After watching the NRA’s successes on Capitol Hill and in statehouses across the nation, gun-control groups are starting to employ some of the same tactics.

Nowhere has that been more apparent than in New Hampshire, where Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte finds herself caught between two powerful forces: the NRA and Mayors Against Illegal Guns.

Ayotte was the only senator from a Northeastern state to side with the NRA.

Since the vote, the NRA and the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a firearms industry trade group, have been running radio spots in New Hampshire that praise Ayotte for her stance.

“Kelly Ayotte is not just a senator, she’s also a mom who cares about protecting our kids,” the announcer says. “Kelly had the courage to oppose misguided gun-control laws that would not have prevented Sandy Hook.”

Gun-control groups are hitting back. The mayors group, organized by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg (I), has tapped a deep reservoir of phone and ­e-mail lists to mobilize opposition to Ayotte. Protesters have trailed Ayotte to events in New Hampshire, demanding that she explain her vote.

On April 30, the daughter of the slain Sandy Hook principal confronted Ayotte at a crowded town hall meeting in Warren, N.H.

The scene was reminiscent of the way the NRA had taken over town hall meetings.

“A fair amount of what we’re doing in New Hampshire is right out of the NRA playbook,” said Arkadi Gerney, who was a special adviser to the mayors group before joining the Center for American Progress as a senior fellow. He and others are helping to coordinate the anti-Ayotte campaign in New Hampshire.

One of the lessons learned: Every vote in every city, county and state cannot be taken for granted.

“We’re on the ground, moving people on our side,” Gerney said. “You have to have people show up at the events, send letters and make the phone calls.

“It’s not enough to have 99 percent of the people agree with you.”

Toomey’s quandary

Until recently, Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.) was considered a friend of the NRA’s in the halls of Congress and in the Lehigh Valley of Pennsylvania, a state that boasts one of the highest concentrations of NRA members. The NRA had given Toomey an “A” rating for his dependable voting record and, in 2011, invited him to speak at its annual Celebration of American Values Leadership Forum.

That was before Toomey this spring joined Sens. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) and Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) to introduce legislation to expand federal background checks. Even though the measure failed, gun rights activists say Toomey crossed the “line in the sand” drawn by the NRA.

William A. Bachenberg, an NRA national board member who directs the organization’s efforts in eastern Pennsylvania, said Toomey undercut his credibility in the gun rights community. Bachenberg said many of Toomey’s supporters see the background-check proposal as a purely political move to help him win reelection in 2016 in a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans by nearly 1 million voters.

“I will not support him,” declared Bachenberg, who owns a skeet-shooting range in the Lehigh Valley and said he was not speaking on behalf of the NRA. “A lot of shooters have been coming to the range, and they feel betrayed. When you talk about constitutional rights and an issue that is this dear to us, this is very frustrating.”

John F. Brinson has been a friend of Toomey’s for more than 20 years. But as a co-chairman of the Eastern Pennsylvania Firearms Coalition, Brinson said he sees trouble on the horizon for the senator.

“I will support Pat, but a lot of people won’t. They are so angry,” Brinson said. “I have a right to keep and bear arms, period. And this is the kind of thing that sets off gun owners and makes us crazy. This is not gun control, this is people control, and they are treating us like children.”

Before the proposal was defeated, Toomey said he knew that the NRA would be angry.

“My approach is to do the right thing and let the chips fall where they may,” he said in an interview. ”I don’t know what the political implications will be. I don’t think anyone does. “

Manchin has said he plans to revive the background-check legislation. Toomey noted that it was “unlikely” another attempt to pass the measure would succeed in Congress, but he said he would be a co-sponsor of such a bill if it were to be reintroduced.

The NRA’s clout in Congress rests primarily on its exaggerated reputation for invulnerability rather than on anything more tangible. During the 2012 political campaigns, the NRA spent $25 million on TV ads and $3 million more on lobbying. While these may sound like impressive numbers, in reality they amount to little more than chump change in a $6 billion campaign year. The implicit logic on Capitol Hill is that the gun lobby can’t be beaten because it hasn’t been beaten. No major gun legislation has made its way through Congress since former President Bill Clinton’s first term. With an estimated 300 million firearms in private hands, universal background checks for new gun purchases are far from a panacea. Obama is gambling that investing time and effort in the cause is more than just a feel-good gesture. For if the NRA cannot be beaten on this limited front—even after the horrors at Sandy Hook Elementary School—then we will never limit gun violence.

Is it any wonder that Americans dislike Congress so much? It shouldn't be a surprise because our representatives in Washington ignore public opinion. Gun control is the perfect example. A clear majority of people favors a ban on assault weapons (57 percent favor and 41 percent oppose, according to an ABC News/Washington Post poll). But members of Congress can't even agree on universal background checks which just about every living and breathing American favors. (91 percent according to ABC News/Washington Post.) [...] The debate over the federal budget is just another example of congressional indifference to public opinion. For years, the debate over the federal budget has mainly been about the federal budget deficit to the exclusion of any meaningful discussion about job creation. When President Obama formally introduces his budget for the 2014 fiscal year on Wednesday, it will be business as usual. We'll have a lot of talk about deficits but little debate about jobs. Everyone in Washington talks about the deficit but Americans outside our nation's capital worry about jobs. Not that anyone in Washington cares but the public disagrees with the tone of the budget discussion in D.C. A new Marist College poll shows that Americans want Congress to focus on creating jobs (62 percent of them anyway) more than they want deficit reduction (only 35 percent want that). If that doesn't work for you, the national Election Day exit poll showed that a lot more voters were worried about jobs (59 percent) than they were the deficit (15 percent).

For liberals, generally speaking, honoring procedures—means—is the core of what being ""principled"" means. For conservatives, fighting for the right outcome—ends—even at the expense of procedural nicety, is what being ""principled"" means. Think of it it, allegorically, this way: imagine in Washington DC, near Capitol Hill, a little old lady is crossing a hazardous street. A fastidious liberal congressmen, proud of always acting in a principled way in all things, stops to help her across the street—even though that means he might be late for a key vote (the sacrifice of an end, in itself, confirms his principled nature). A fastidious conservative congressman, on the other hand, leaves the lady to her fate and makes the vote (because the upholding of the end, in itself, is where honor lies—and dishonor rests, in the ultimate term of derision righties reserve for each other, in being a ""squish""). In short, if you're a conservative, isn't the point of an election to win, so you can bend the world to your will, no matter the means it takes to get there? Even if you don't necessarily have the majority's support?

The capitalist revival she sparked did not slow the over-financialization and deindustrialization of the economy, with clear and negative consequences in the 2008 financial crash. Her weakening of the unions also led to a regressively skewed distribution of wealth and, her critics said, a widening gap between rich and poor. Arguably, Mrs. Thatcher’s popular military successes made it easier for Mr. Blair to carelessly and recklessly follow George W. Bush into Iraq. But Mrs. Thatcher knew how to stand up to Ronald Reagan when she needed to — for example, over the ill-considered United States invasion of Grenada. She was one of the first Western leaders to recognize the reformist intentions of Mikhail Gorbachev, showed remarkable foresight on the dangers of climate change, and in general managed Britain’s global role more deftly than her successors.

The hallmarks of Thatcher’s legacy—the spending cuts, erosion of social democracy, union-busting and privatization—are alive and well within the Republican Party, particularly in GOP-controlled governors’ mansions. Following the Iron Lady’s death, Fox News’ Chris Stirewalt said hopefully that “there might be a Maggie Thatcher or two out there for the GOP.” In fact, he’s in luck: There are several."

But Tuesday, voters in the bluer-than-red state-of Colorado told Scarborough and company to go get their shine box. Here is their unforgettably awkward and red-faced reaction:

—

—

What we saw from Scarborough and company, in the months following the terrible murders at Sandy Hook Elementary, wasn’t even concern-trolling; it was The Sanctimony of Our Betters coming from those who had deluded themselves into believing the GOP and NRA were on the path to irrelevance unless they reversed course and restricted Americans’ Second Amendment civil rights with laws that would have done absolutely nothing to stop another Sandy Hook.

To listen to Scarborough, it was NRA that was losing its political clout. To listen to Scarborough, it was the GOP ensuring they would lose seats. “Oh, no,” Joe screamed! “The ‘lying‘ GOP is doomed if they don’t listen to me and hand Obama a victory on guns!”

Even after Manchin-Toomey died in the Senate, Scarborough and his peanut-gallery practiced a scorched-earth policy to hammer the NRA and GOP as out-of-touch, suicidal nitwits for not caving to their relentless emotional blackmail and cherry-picked polls.

Well, a funny thing happened on the way to Reality, a funny thing called democracy — something that would not have caught The Bubbled off-guard had they been adult enough to consider this poll, or perhaps this one. Tuesday in Colorado, although outspent by the opposition, everyday citizens, with some help from the NRA, booted out two Democrat State Senators for passing the same gun control laws Scarborough demanded the GOP pass in order to survive.

In other words, Scarborough was 100% wrong — it is Democrats and Bloomberg’s anti-gun group that took a beating for taking Scarborough’s advice.

So watch the video again… This what a boorish, unrelenting, shrill, dishonest, and holier-than-thou crusade looks like after it meets American Liberty.

On Tuesday, voters in Colorado recalled two state senators–Angela Giron (D-Pueblo) and Senate President John Morse (D-Colorado Springs)–that supported Colorado Gov. John Hickenloooper’s (D) sweeping gun control legislation, which he signed into law in March. As Breitbart News reported, Morse lost his recall election 51 to 49 percent, and Giron lost hers by a “whopping 56 to 44 percent.”

Bloomberg reportedly called Hickenlooper on at least two occasions before the Colorado governor signed the gun control laws, and he gave $350,000 more to his Mayors Against Illegal Guns group to back the efforts of Morse and Giron to fight the recall efforts against them leading up to the elections. With Bloomberg’s gun control dreams fading in Colorado, he may be turning his sights on Virginia through McAuliffe.

At the end of August, as the Colorado recall efforts were heating up, Bloomberg and McAuliffe reportedly met in McAuliffe’s native state of New York. The meeting prompted Second Amendment advocates in Virginia to wonder if Bloomberg and McAuliffe may have discussed something similar to NY SAFE Act for Virginia as a condition of Bloomberg’s financial support or endorsing McAuliffe; this would presumably help McAuliffe court Virginia’s business-oriented independent voters, particularly in Northern Virginia. Virginia, like Colorado, is quickly becoming a national bellwether on a host of issues.

As Breitbart News reported, at least “one New York-based gun manufacturer” decided to move from the state because of NY SAFE Act. The Syracuse Post-Standard noted the law “expands a ban on military-style weapons, requires mental health professionals to report threats, limits magazines to seven bullets, taxes bullets, and creates a registry.”

Politico, which reported the meeting between McAuliffe and Bloomberg, said it was unclear what the meeting was for, but noted that Bloomberg has indeed spent more than $15 million on his Mayors Against Illegal Guns group and candidates who back his gun control agenda.

In the RealClearPolitics average of polls, McAuliffe has nearly an eight-point lead over Republican Ken Cuccinelli in the gubernatorial contest, though recent polls have found that roughly 10% of the electorate is undecided. Election forecasters have the race pegged as “lean McAuliffe” or “tossup”; it is often difficult to predict turnout in an off-year elections in which the most fervent supporters are the only ones guaranteed to go to the polls.

As Breitbart News noted, McAuliffe reportedly purchased a gun for the first time in January of 2013, and the National Rifle Association has given him an “F” rating."

Among other things, the new laws require background checks for private gun sales and limit ammunition magazines to 15 rounds.

Mr. Morse’s hand was on the tiller during much of that debate. A former police chief, he said he found himself in a position of not just rounding up votes, but actually explaining the mechanics of guns to fellow Democrats. He brought a magazine to show his colleagues how it worked. In an emotional speech in March, as the debate reached its peak, Mr. Morse stood on the Senate floor and spoke of gun violence and “cleansing a sickness from our souls.”

His opponents pounced on the remark, framing it as a sign of Mr. Morse’s disregard for his gun-owning constituents, as well as a symptom of the widening gap between Colorado’s urban Democrats and its rural Republicans.

Mr. Morse represented a slice of Colorado Springs that straddles those fault lines. His district is closely split among Democrats, Republicans and unaffiliated voters. And on Tuesday, despite huge voter-turnout drives and Obama-style neighborhood canvassing, more of Mr. Morse’s opponents showed up to cast him out.

The passions ignited by the vote were on full display on Tuesday, as opposing sides lined up side by side outside polling places here in Colorado’s second-largest city. They spoke of knowing survivors of the mass shooting inside the Century 16 theater in Aurora, Colo. Two of Mr. Morse’s sisters held up a banner, and complained that their brother’s opponents were twisting his record and his words in bitter attack ads.

http://news.yahoo.com/laws-effect-alaska-july-1-142036174.html,,[],New laws take effect in Alaska on July 1,"JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) -- This part of summer is a time for patriotism. It's also the time new state laws go into effect across the nation.

Fiscal years begin July 1 on most financial calendars, and a slew of state government spending regulations kick in each year on that date. Policy laws also hit the books in a wave, though states often mark their independence by enacting such legislation on their own time.

Among the laws set to take effect this year around the U.S. are new abortion limits, gun laws and technology rules. And one state, Wyoming, will start setting up a lottery Monday, leaving only a handful of states without a jackpot drawing.

Alaska's three-month legislative session was dominated this year by debate over rolling back the state's oil taxes as a way to increase production. The bill, recently signed into law, is now the subject of a repeal effort. Other bills were less controversial, including those that take effect July 1.

So as you get ready for Fourth of July gatherings and family time, consider this roundup of what's happening in Alaska:

— SEX TRAFFICKING: SB22, from Gov. Sean Parnell, is an omnibus crime bill that deals with things like trafficking, conduct of probation officers and domestic violence. It eliminates statutes of limitations to prosecute child pornography, human trafficking and sex trafficking cases. It allows judges to require that the movements of individuals charged with or convicted of domestic violence be tracked using GPS or other technology. It also bars probation and parole officers from having sex with those on probation.

— AGENCY AUDITS: HB30, from House Speaker Mike Chenault, requires performance reviews of state agencies. The intent is to get a more in-depth look at the workings of state agencies than legislators can typically do during a 90-day session. Agencies are to be audited one at a time, beginning in 2014 with the Department of Correction, and audited every 10 years.

— MOBILE INSURANCE: HB146, from Rep. Pete Higgins, allows drivers to provide their proof of motor vehicle insurance on electronic devices, like smartphones.

Provisions within several other bills, including state spending bills, also take effect July 1."

Chris Christie, whose political hug of President Obama in the wake of Hurricane Sandy raised Republican hackles, has now criticized the National Rifle Assn. for the group’s anti-gun control ad that referenced the president’s two daughters.

Considered a potential GOP national candidate in 2016, Christie on Thursday went after the NRA, which is part of the coalition that forms the GOP’s conservative wing. The ad argues that because Obama’s daughters have armed security, regular parents deserve the same treatment in the wake of last month’s deadly rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.

The NRA has said it is in favor of putting armed guards in schools and opposes putting limits on owning guns and ammunition as Obama has proposed.

“To talk about the president’s children or any public officer’s children who have -- not by their own choice, but by requirement -- to have protection and to use that somehow to try to make a political point I think is reprehensible,” Christie said at a news conference in which he discussed gun control.

“My children had no choice that I wanted to run for governor. I pretended that they did. I asked them what they thought. But in the end, they had absolutely no choice in whether I ran for governor or not. And they knew that, by the way, when I was asking them, which is why they didn’t spend a whole lot of time answering.”

“But the effects on their lives are significant,” he told reporters. “And they’re a full couple of steps down from the effect that it would have if, you know, when your father’s president of the United States, and the security concerns that go along with that.”

Attacking the NRA may not disqualify Christie as a potential GOP candidate, but it is just the latest in a series of contrarian steps the pugnacious governor has taken.

After Hurricane Sandy tore through his state and others, Christie spoke well of Obama’s efforts to bring immediate aid to New Jersey, which Obama visited. The governor -- who had criticized Obama earlier in the presidential campaign and was an announced supporter of GOP candidate Mitt Romney -- explained that his responsibilities as governor trumped his politics. Christie also had delivered the keynote address at the GOP convention last year.

Then, earlier this month, Christie criticized Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) for delaying House consideration of a Hurricane Sandy relief bill that eventually passed the GOP-controlled House. The cost of the aid package was more than $60 billion.

“All I can tell you is this was the speaker’s decision, his alone,” Christie said at the time.

Christie is seeking reelection as governor. With approval ratings higher than 70%, Christie is considered a prohibitive favorite in the usually Democratic state.

However, Republicans elsewhere have taken notice of Christie’s rebellious comments.

In an interview on Friday with a conservative radio host, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, also a potential 2016 contender and heir to his father’s libertarian constituency, cast doubt on Christie’s chances for national office under the GOP banner.

“I think criticizing the 2nd Amendment movement and the over-the-top ‘give me my money’ stuff, ‘I want all 60 billion now or I’ll throw a tantrum,’ I don’t think that’s going to play well in the Republican primary,” Paul said.

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/05/28/lawmakers-facing-recall-bids-over-strict-gun-laws-in-colorado/,2013-05-28 00:00:00,[],Lawmakers facing recall bids over strict gun laws in Colorado,"A Democratic campaign office here usually would be quiet this time of year, a few weeks after the state's legislature wrapped up work and lawmakers headed off to summer vacations.

But even though it's not an election year, the office is in full campaign mode, with volunteers working the phones and reviewing maps in anticipation of a new front of modern campaigning -- the recall phase.

A handful of Democratic state lawmakers in Colorado face recall petition efforts in what looks to be the first wave of fallout over legislative votes to limit gun rights. In an era in which recall efforts are booming, from governor's offices down to town councils and school boards, the Colorado efforts will serve as the first test of gun-rights groups' ability to punish elected officials who expanded gun control laws after last year's Aurora, Colo., and Newtown, Conn., shooting massacres.

In Colorado, gun-rights activists wasted no time seeking recalls to oust state Senate President John Morse and three other Democratic lawmakers. The targeted lawmakers weren't necessarily the main advocates for ratcheting back gun rights, but all come from districts with enough Republicans to give opponents hope they can boot out the Democrats and replace them with lawmakers friendlier to guns. Colorado is the only state outside the East Coast to have adopted significant statewide gun controls this year.

""Colorado seems to be the testing ground for some of the gun measures, so this has national implications,"" said Victor Head, a plumber from Pueblo who is organizing a recall attempt against a Democratic senator.

Two of four recall efforts in Colorado already have evaporated from lack of support. But in Colorado Springs, Morse opponents are piling up signatures in gun shops and outside libraries and grocery stores. The National Rifle Association sent a political mailer saying it was coordinating the recall effort with local groups, though the local recall petitioners have denied that. The NRA did not return calls for comment on their involvement in the Colorado Springs effort.

Morse has mounted a campaign to urge voters not to sign petitions. In an indication of the national stakes, that push is largely funded by a $20,000 contribution from a national progressive group called America Votes. The Morse campaign said the donation came through the group's local Colorado office.

The recall group's main funding comes from a $14,000 contribution from a nonprofit run by a local conservative consultant, Laura Carno. She said that contribution was made possible by some out-of-state donors.

""People in other states that are further down this road, like New York and Massachusetts, are calling up and saying `What can we do to help?""' Carno said. ""This isn't what Colorado stands for.""

In an interview, Morse seemed resigned to facing a recall vote after signatures are verified. He believes national gun-rights supporters are using his district to make a national statement about the political peril officials face if they take on gun control.

""That's what's going on here. They want to take out the Senate president,"" Morse said.

The organizer of the Morse recall effort, Anthony Garcia, didn't disagree. Garcia doesn't live in Morse's district but in the northern Colorado town of Brighton. Garcia said Morse was targeted not just because of his votes for gun control but because he's a prominent Democrat from a competitive district.

""It's as much about saying Colorado is angry as it is about getting one guy out,"" Garcia said. ""Legislators need to know when citizens are outraged that they can't ignore the people.""

Immediate accountability seems to be a common thread in recall attempts, said Joshua Spivak, who tracks recall elections nationwide at the Hugh L. Carey Institute for Government Reform at Wagner College in New York. Technology makes it easier to organize, Spivak said, and modern-day voters watching political activity in real time on Twitter and TV aren't content to wait until another election to show their displeasure when they feel ignored.

Spivak said at least 169 officials at all levels of government faced recalls last year, up from 151 the year before. The number this year could go even higher, he said.

Technology isn't the only explanation.

""The other reason,"" Spivak said, ""is that they succeed.""

Most recalls actually fail, as in the case last year of Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican who survived a recall election after attacking collective bargaining rights for state employees. But compared with re-election campaigns, when incumbents face up to 75 percent likelihood of winning, Spivak said recall elections have a much lower rate of success for incumbents.

In Colorado last year, seven recall efforts made it to ballots, all local races, Spivak said. Of those seven, two officials were ousted and two more resigned.

Nationwide, 108 recalled officials last year lost or left office after a recall. That makes the recall a powerful tool -- and one likely to be used more often, Spivak said.

Back in Colorado Springs, a couple of Morse opponents defended the recall attempt as the best way for citizens to keep their representatives accountable.

""I believe in gun rights. And he didn't listen. He's supposed to represent the people, and when he doesn't do that, what are supposed to do? Nothing?"" asked Bianca McCarl, a 40-year-old merchandiser who is supporting Morse's recall.

Assuming the Morse recall goes to ballots, with an election to be held by late summer, the incumbent holds a slight party registration advantage in the district. He believes most voters liked his gun votes.

He's counting on the support from voters like Joan Muir, a retiree who placed a pro-Morse sticker on her car bumper after seeing other cars carrying messages calling for his ouster. In an interview, Muir said she was dismayed by the recall campaign.

""I live here. I'm for gun control,"" Muri said. ""I don't care for guns, period, so they don't speak for all of us when they say Morse didn't listen to the people."""

Sen. Lisa Murkowski's (R-Alaska) net approval rating dropped 16 points, as she shed much of her previous cross-party appeal. Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) saw his numbers dive 18 points, from a positive to a negative rating.

Not all of the change can be attributed to the vote. Portman, for instance, saw his approval drop among Republicans when he announced his support for gay marriage in March. But in Alaska, Arizona, Nevada and Ohio, at least 60 percent of voters supported background checks, and many expressed disappointment with politicians who voted otherwise.

Fifty-two percent of Arizona voters said they were less likely to support Sen. Jeff Flake (R) for reelection due to his ""no"" vote, while 46 percent of Nevadans said the same of Sen. Dean Heller (R). More than a third of voters were less likely to back Portman as well as Alaska Sens. Mark Begich (D) and Murkowski. A previous PPP poll found that Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) also saw her ratings tumble 15 points, likely due in part to her vote against background checks.

Much of the lost support comes from independent or moderate voters.

PPP hasn't yet conducted polling on how senators who supported the bill have fared. But Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), who cosponsored background check legislation, saw his approval rating increase by a net 7 points, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released Friday.

Nationally, most polls taken since the shooting in Newtown, Conn., have found that upwards of 80 percent of people support gun background checks, and that there is relatively little partisan division on the issue.

Opinions were less unified on the actual legislation considered in the Senate, but most still say they wish it had gone through. A 65 percent majority of Americans said the measure should have passed, including 45 percent of Republicans and a majority of Democrats and independents, according to a Gallup poll released Monday."

Bloomberg, in a sharp escalation in the battle over gun control, is seeking to punish Democratic senators by taking away the one thing they most need from New Yorkers: money.

On Wednesday, Mr. Bloomberg will send a personal letter to hundreds of the biggest Democratic donors in New York urging them to cut off contributions to the four Democratic senators who helped block a bill in April that would have strengthened background checks on gun purchasers.

The move could inflame tensions that have simmered for weeks between Mr. Bloomberg, who blames the four Democrats for the defeat of the bill, and Democratic Senate leaders, who have privately told City Hall that the attacks can serve only to empower a Republican majority openly hostile to Mr. Bloomberg’s priorities.

By appealing to the Democrats’ financial base, Mr. Bloomberg is exploiting his relationships and prestige among wealthy New Yorkers to disrupt the flow of campaign money to key Democrats whose re-election next year will help determine whether the party retains control of the Senate. No state is more essential to the party’s fund-raising: Sitting Democratic senators and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee raised $30.4 million from New York donors in 2012, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, more than in any other state."
http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/27/politics/romney-shutdown/,2013-09-27 00:00:00,['Sherisse Pham'],Exclusive: Romney disagrees with GOP ‘tactics’ on Obamacare,"(CNN) —

Mitt Romney thinks Obamacare is a bad law that will hurt the country, but disagrees with how conservatives in Washington are trying to get rid of it.

In an exclusive interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper in Boston on Friday, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee said using the politically charged Affordable Care Act as a wedge in Washington’s fiscal wars is counterproductive.

“We’re more effective tactically not to use a shutdown of some kind to pursue the … anti-Obamacare objective. I don’t think that will be as effective,” Romney said in the interview conducted on Friday in Boston.

Romney, however, gave Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas credit for speaking for more than 21 hours against the health care law, a marathon he called a “quasi filibuster.”

But, Romney adds, “I think there’s a better way of getting rid of Obamacare - my own view - and that is, one, delaying it by at least a year. That was Senator (Joe) Manchin’s idea, the Democrats’ idea.”

“The other would be potentially working hard to get Republicans elected to the House and Senate and they’d be able to do in a traditional way,” said Romney.

When it comes to negotiations over the debt ceiling, which is a separate crisis from the looming government shutdown, Republican leaders want a number of conditions.

These include one-year delay of Obamacare, blocking certain business regulations, federal approval of the Keystone XL pipeline, and blocking the Environmental Protection Agency from regulating ash waste from coal fired power plants.

Romney called those demands “a tactical choice.”

Asked if a showdown over the debt ceiling is an effective tactic, the former Massachusetts governor and private equity executive pivoted to leadership and political entanglements in Washington.

“There’s no question that the political dysfunction is the cause of many of the problems of the country,” he said, noting that leadership is needed “breakthrough” it.

“And unfortunately, we haven’t seen the kind of leadership in the White House. The president spends his time attacking the opposition party,” he said.

Asked how he could reconcile his opinion of Obamacare with the health care law he championed while governor of Massachusetts, Romney said the two issues were very different.

“We don’t have in my state people losing jobs – 40-hour-week jobs, going down to 29.5-hour-week jobs as a result of the bill that we passed,” said Romney.

Moreover, Romney added, Massachusetts’ plan was not meant to be implemented nationally, it was meant to be a guide for individual states to craft their own health care plans.

“Let them do it in their own way. And if Vermont wants to be a single-payor, socialized medicine state, let them try it. We’ll learn from that experiment. But don’t have the federal government impose a one-size-fits-all plan on the entire nation because it will hurt people, and it is.”

The next presidential campaign is years away, but there are lessons to be learned from Romney’s failed bid for the White House.

“The largest strategic error was not investing sufficiently, particularly in Hispanic TV and Hispanic outreach to help Hispanic voters understand that ours is the party of opportunity,” said Romney.

One of the problems with the Latino vote, was that Republicans and Romney were viewed by voters as being against immigration reform, against the bipartisan comprehensive reform effort.

“I think my position and the position of our party is not well understood at the Hispanic community,” said Romney. “I want to see immigration reform. I said that during the campaign. I want to make sure we have a legal immigration system that brings, in my view, more people legally to our country. I’d like to do that.”"
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/07/02/administration-delays-key-obamacare-insurance-mandate/,2013-07-02 00:00:00,[],Administration delays key ObamaCare insurance mandate,"The Obama administration announced Tuesday that it is delaying a major provision in the health care overhaul, putting off until 2015 a requirement that many employers offer health insurance.

The announcement was made late Tuesday by the Treasury Department, at the beginning of the holiday week while Congress was on recess. It comes amid reports that the administration is running into roadblocks as it prepares to implement ObamaCare.

The change in the employer mandate is arguably the most significant concession the administration has made to date.

Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., a critic of the law, seized on the delay as a ""clear admission"" that the law is ""unaffordable, unworkable and unpopular.""

""It's also a cynical political ploy to delay the coming train wreck associated with ObamaCare until after the 2014 elections,"" he said.

The law requires companies that employ 50 or more workers to offer coverage or face fines. The Treasury Department and the White House said that, based on complaints by employers that the system for reporting the coverage was too onerous, they would simplify that system and give employers an additional year to comply.

""We have heard concerns about the complexity of the requirements and the need for more time to implement them effectively,"" Mark J. Mazur, the assistant secretary for tax policy at the Treasury Department, said in a statement posted online. ""We have listened to your feedback. And we are taking action.""

The mandate was originally set to kick in for 2014, but will now start in 2015.

The decision effectively means that penalties that would have been assessed against non-compliant businesses will be delayed until 2015. The administration encouraged employers to provide insurance anyway.

While the employer mandate is being delayed, the so-called individual mandate -- the requirement that individuals obtain health insurance -- presumably remains on schedule for 2014.

The administration also still plans to open up a new marketplace for government-regulated insurance plans on Oct. 1, to take effect on Jan. 1. And a sprawling set of subsidies would also remain in place.

The delay of the employer mandate, though, raises questions about whether more elements of the law might be delayed in the coming months.

White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett explained that, on the employer mandate issue, the administration was making two changes.

""First, we are cutting red tape and simplifying the reporting process,"" she wrote on the White House blog. She cited concerns that the law would have required companies to set up new data collection systems on employee access to health care. She said: ""Some of this detailed reporting may be unnecessary for businesses that more than meet the minimum standards in the law."" So, she said, the administration plans to figure out a ""smarter system.""

Second, she said, the administration would delay the roll-out and penalties since they were overhauling the reporting system.

""This allows employers the time to test the new reporting systems and make any necessary adaptations to their health benefits while staying the course toward making health coverage more affordable and accessible for their workers,"" she said.

Randy Johnson, senior vice president of Labor, Immigration, and Employee Benefits at the Chamber of Commerce, told Fox News that with its decision, the administration has ""finally recognized the obvious.""

""Employers need more time and clarification of the rules of the road before implementing the employer mandate,"" he said. ""We will continue to work to alleviate this and other problems with ObamaCare.""

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/12/29/white-house-says-obamacare-signups-passed-1-million-mark/,2013-12-29 00:00:00,[],White House says ObamaCare sign-ups passed 1 million mark,"The Obama administration announced early Sunday that enrollment in the federal healthcare exchange passed the 1 million mark in December as more than 975,000 people signed up between December 1 and the December 24 deadline to ensure coverage beginning on the first of 2014.

Officially, the administration put the total of people now enrolled at more than 1.1 million people now enrolled and boasted that the site was able to support 83,000 concurrent visitors on December 23, the next-to-last day before the sign-up deadline. By contrast, the administration reported only 27,000 sign-ups in October --the website's first, error-prone month -- and 137,000 in November.

The administration has yet to provide a December update on the 14 states running their own exchanges. While California, New York, Washington, Kentucky and Connecticut have performed well, others are still struggling.

The windfall comes at a critical moment for Obama's sweeping health care law, which becomes ""real"" for many Americans on Jan. 1 when coverage through the exchanges and key patient protections kick in.

""As we continue our open enrollment campaign, we experienced a welcome surge in enrollment as millions of Americans seek access to affordable health care coverage,"" Marilyn Tavenner, the head of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said in a blog post.

The fledgling exchanges are still likely to fall short of the government's own targets for 2013. The administration had projected more than 3.3 million overall would be enrolled through federal and state exchanges by the end of the year.

Tavenner said fixes to the website, which underwent a major overhaul to address widespread outages and glitches, contributed to December's figures. But the problems haven't totally disappeared. Thousands of people wound up waiting on hold for telephone help on Christmas Eve for a multitude of reasons, including technical difficulties.

The administration released the figures Sunday while President Barack Obama was vacationing in Hawaii. Although the president has spent most of his time relaxing with friends and family, he stepped into work mode late Friday for an update from aides on his signature domestic policy achievement. The White House said Obama told his team to focus on minimizing disruptions for those switching plans.

For Americans who successfully chose insurance plans by Dec. 24, coverage should start on New Year's Day for those who pay their first month's premium by the due date, which in most cases has been extended until Jan. 10.

But insurers have complained that another set of technical problems, largely hidden from consumers, has resulted in the government passing along inaccurate data on enrollees. The White House says the error rate has been significantly reduced. Yet with a flood of signups that must be processed in just days, it remains unclear whether last-minute enrollees will encounter a seamless experience if they try to use their new benefits come Jan. 1.

The political fallout from the website's calamitous rollout could pale in comparison to the heat that Obama might take if Americans who signed up and paid their premiums arrive at the pharmacy or the emergency room and find there's no record of their coverage. Republican critics, already on the lookout for health-law failures to exploit in the 2014 midterm elections, would be emboldened to argue that shortcomings with the law's implementation have jeopardized Americans' health.

As make-or-break January approaches, officials are also working to prevent gaps in coverage for millions of Americans whose individual policies were canceled this fall because they fell short of the law's requirements. In one of a series of last-minute tweaks, the administration in December said even if those individuals don't sign up for new plans, they won't face the penalty the law imposes on Americans who fail to get insurance by March 31.

A key indicator of whether state-run exchanges are keeping pace with the federal exchange will come next month, when the administration releases full December figures. Overall, the goal is to sign up 7 million Americans before the first-year open enrollment period closes at the end of March.

A few states offering their own updates have posted encouraging totals, including New York, where more than 200,000 have enrolled either through the state exchange or through Medicaid, a government program expanded under Obama's health law to cover more people. In California, a tally released Friday showed nearly 430,000 have enrolled through the exchange so far.

""The basic structure of that law is working despite all the problems --despite the website problems, despite the messaging problems,"" Obama told reporters before departing for Hawaii.

Another major unknown is whether the recent surge in enrollments skewed toward older Americans whose medical needs are expensive to cover, or whether the administration succeeded in recruiting younger and healthier people whose participation is critical to the law's success. Those details for December are expected to be released in mid-January.

Meanwhile, with the website now able to handle higher volumes without crashing or clogging up, the government plans in January to ramp up outreach to consumers to encourage more people to sign up, the administration said.

At first, it looked like conservatives would leave themselves a way to propose their own version of the same reforms in Obamacare, and rename it on their own terms. As such, there seemed to be a method to it when, at the outset, conservatives worked hard to prevent an actual discussion of the substance of the law itself. Much of the initial hatred of the ACA was focused on a series of phony talking points and outright lies (“government takeover” of health care; “death panels”; the law was “rammed through” using corrupt procedural tricks; etc.)."

According to a survey I stumbled across just weeks ago, 21 percent believe that a U.F.O. landed in Roswell, N.M., nearly seven decades ago and that the federal government hushed it up, while 14 percent believe in Bigfoot.

According to another survey, taken last year, about 65 percent of us can’t name a single Supreme Court justice. Not the chief one, John Roberts. Not the mute one, Clarence Thomas. Not even the mean one, Antonin Scalia. Though when it comes to Scalia, perhaps the body politic suffers less from ignorance than from repressed memory.

That we Americans are out to lunch isn’t news. But every once in a while a fresh factoid like the Obamacare ignorance comes along to remind us that we’re out to breakfast and dinner as well. And it adds an important, infrequently acknowledged bit of perspective to all the commentary, from us journalists and from political strategists alike, about how voters behave and whom they reward. We purport to interpret an informed, rational universe, because we’d undercut our own insights if we purported anything else.

But only limited sense can be made of what is often nonsensical, and the truth is that a great big chunk of the electorate is tuned out, zonked out or combing Roswell for alien remains. Polls over the last few years have variously shown that about 30 percent of us couldn’t name the vice president, about 35 percent couldn’t assign the proper century to the American Revolution and 6 percent couldn’t circle Independence Day on a calendar. I’m supposing that the 6 percent weren’t also given the holiday’s synonym, the Fourth of July. I’m an optimist through and through."

What calculation persuades them that repealing the health care law is worth the risk? Indeed, whose interests do they represent?

Nearly 6 in 10 Americans disapprove of trying to stop the law by cutting its financing. Even among those who don’t like the law, less than half want their representatives in Congress to try to make it fail.

It is tempting to discard the Tea Party activists driving the Republican Party as crazy — as some commentators have — motivated by fear and willing to believe that default won’t cause much harm and might even act as a purgative to free the economy of a bloated government.

“They listen to nobody but themselves,” the Harvard political scientist Theda Skocpol told me. “They are convinced of their rectitude and convinced that they alone are qualified to save America from the dire threat of Obama and his polices. They have worked themselves into a dangerous place.”

Their relationship with reality can take peculiar turns. Reflexive opponents of “government,” they can exhibit little sense of what the government actually does.

And yet the argument that half the Republican Party has simply lost its mind has to be an unsatisfactory answer, especially considering the sophistication of some of the deep-pocketed backers of the Tea Party insurgency.

There is a plausible alternative to irrationality. Flawed though it may turn out to be, Obamacare, as the Affordable Care Act is popularly known, could fundamentally change the relationship between working Americans and their government. This could pose an existential threat to the small-government credo that has defined the G.O.P. for four decades."

http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/27/politics/romney-shutdown/,2013-09-27 00:00:00,['Sherisse Pham'],Exclusive: Romney disagrees with GOP ‘tactics’ on Obamacare,"(CNN) —

Mitt Romney thinks Obamacare is a bad law that will hurt the country, but disagrees with how conservatives in Washington are trying to get rid of it.

In an exclusive interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper in Boston on Friday, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee said using the politically charged Affordable Care Act as a wedge in Washington’s fiscal wars is counterproductive.

“We’re more effective tactically not to use a shutdown of some kind to pursue the … anti-Obamacare objective. I don’t think that will be as effective,” Romney said in the interview conducted on Friday in Boston.

Romney, however, gave Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas credit for speaking for more than 21 hours against the health care law, a marathon he called a “quasi filibuster.”

But, Romney adds, “I think there’s a better way of getting rid of Obamacare - my own view - and that is, one, delaying it by at least a year. That was Senator (Joe) Manchin’s idea, the Democrats’ idea.”

“The other would be potentially working hard to get Republicans elected to the House and Senate and they’d be able to do in a traditional way,” said Romney.

When it comes to negotiations over the debt ceiling, which is a separate crisis from the looming government shutdown, Republican leaders want a number of conditions.

These include one-year delay of Obamacare, blocking certain business regulations, federal approval of the Keystone XL pipeline, and blocking the Environmental Protection Agency from regulating ash waste from coal fired power plants.

Romney called those demands “a tactical choice.”

Asked if a showdown over the debt ceiling is an effective tactic, the former Massachusetts governor and private equity executive pivoted to leadership and political entanglements in Washington.

“There’s no question that the political dysfunction is the cause of many of the problems of the country,” he said, noting that leadership is needed “breakthrough” it.

“And unfortunately, we haven’t seen the kind of leadership in the White House. The president spends his time attacking the opposition party,” he said.

Asked how he could reconcile his opinion of Obamacare with the health care law he championed while governor of Massachusetts, Romney said the two issues were very different.

“We don’t have in my state people losing jobs – 40-hour-week jobs, going down to 29.5-hour-week jobs as a result of the bill that we passed,” said Romney.

Moreover, Romney added, Massachusetts’ plan was not meant to be implemented nationally, it was meant to be a guide for individual states to craft their own health care plans.

“Let them do it in their own way. And if Vermont wants to be a single-payor, socialized medicine state, let them try it. We’ll learn from that experiment. But don’t have the federal government impose a one-size-fits-all plan on the entire nation because it will hurt people, and it is.”

The next presidential campaign is years away, but there are lessons to be learned from Romney’s failed bid for the White House.

“The largest strategic error was not investing sufficiently, particularly in Hispanic TV and Hispanic outreach to help Hispanic voters understand that ours is the party of opportunity,” said Romney.

One of the problems with the Latino vote, was that Republicans and Romney were viewed by voters as being against immigration reform, against the bipartisan comprehensive reform effort.

“I think my position and the position of our party is not well understood at the Hispanic community,” said Romney. “I want to see immigration reform. I said that during the campaign. I want to make sure we have a legal immigration system that brings, in my view, more people legally to our country. I’d like to do that.”"

Within minutes, Nancy Mace, who is opposing Sen. Lindsey Graham in the GOP primary, issued a press release attacking Graham for his past criticism of the defunding strategy. In just two hours, Graham tweeted that he supported the House’s efforts to defund the unpopular health care law. Such is the power of primaries.

I support the House-passed bill to Defund Obamacare. #SenateMustAct — Lindsey Graham (@GrahamBlog) September 20, 2013

As recently as July, Graham said that defunding ObamaCare was “a bridge too far for him.” Primary opponents do tend to focus a politician’s mind.

Graham faces at least three opponents in next year’s primary contest. Normally, multiple challengers give an edge to incumbents, as opposition is split among several challengers. South Carolina, however, uses a run-off system. If no candidate gets more than 50% of the vote, the top two voter-getters face off in a run-off. Multiple challengers increase the odds that Graham falls below 50% and has to face a run-off.

Graham is no doubt a nice man and would make a good GOP Senator from a state like Maine. His representing South Carolina, however, is a wasted opportunity for conservatives. An East Coast John McCain does a disservice to the Palmetto State.

Graham’s tweet in support of the House action indicates he is aware of the challenge before him. Few incumbents are so disliked by the grass-roots, both in South Carolina and across the country. A run-off election, with a single conservative challenger, would ignite national interest and possibly create a wave that washes over Graham.

His tweet in support of defunding ObamaCare was a good start. He now has to follow that up over the coming weeks."

Tea Party-aligned members of Boehner's caucus are flexing their muscle and pressuring him to allow a vote on an anti-ObamaCare measure as part of ongoing budget talks. They want the vote tied directly to the budget measure, and rejected a compromise plan earlier this week -- leaving unclear how Congress might pass a short-term spending bill before funding runs out on Sept. 30.

Boehner, after meeting with bipartisan congressional leaders on Thursday morning, offered no hint of what the next step might be. In the face of heated intra-party squabbling -- and even nastier accusations flying between Republican and Democrats -- he projected cool.

""There's all this speculation about these deadlines that are coming up. I'm well aware of the deadlines. So are my colleagues,"" he said. ""And so we're working with our colleagues to work our way through these issues. I think there's a way to get there. ... There are a million options that are being discussed by a lot of people.""

But Boehner realizes that the party's public image going into the 2014 elections could be at stake, with Democrats eager to pin the blame on them if Congress can't reach a budget deal and there's a partial shutdown. Lawmakers came within minutes of a shutdown during a budget fight in 2011, and have continued to pass a series of short-term measures -- leaving the prospect of a shutdown perpetually over the horizon.

This time, the biggest sticking point centers on ObamaCare. House conservatives wanted to make sure the spending measure includes a provision to de-fund the health care law. Boehner floated a compromise that would allow members to take a vote on that, but also keep the ObamaCare provision distinct and allow the Senate to carve it out and vote it down, while still sending the budget portion to the White House.

House conservatives rejected the idea, and Capitol Hill was overtaken by cross-party bickering on Thursday as Democrats tried to shame Republicans into backing down.

""The anarchists are winning,"" Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid said. ""Anything that can be done to slow down, hurt or get rid of government in any way -- that's good. Shutting down the government is obviously what the majority of the Republican caucus wants in the House.""

Reid said he likes Boehner, but feels ""sorry"" for him and his predicament.

Democrats generally argue that the anti-ObamaCare votes are pointless, since they stand little chance of passing the Senate or ever being approved by the president.

But House conservatives claim the American people want them to act on ObamaCare, and see the budget vote as leverage.

Rep. Blake Farenthold, R-Texas, said the short-term spending measure is ""one of our few leverage points.""

""This is the argument we got last time the (budget measure) was coming around -- we can't shut the government down or we'll lose the presidency, we'll lose seats in the House,"" he said. ""Guess what, we lost seats in the House and we lost the presidency. The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. The people want us to act and act decisively.""

Republican lawmakers are now trying to come up with an alternative plan to both deal with ObamaCare and the budget. Some are discussing a plan to vote on delaying the health care law for a year, as opposed to de-funding it.

House leaders told their members on Thursday to prepare to skip a planned recess the final week of September so they can work on the spending bill.

Tea party leaders predicted that the shutdown strategy would result in a mass uprising against Obamacare, forcing the political establishment to defund or delay it. In fact, Republicans were broadly blamed for overreach and the law became (in some polls) more popular.

The reagent was added to the test tube. The reaction did not occur.

Conservatives who are not sobered are not serious. And those who insist that just a little more fortitude in the Senate would have turned the tide — causing at least six Democratic senators to switch their votes and the president to meekly accept defunding — have chosen to live in a pleasing political world of their own creation.

This is a serious setback for Republicans. It is not, however, the political apocalypse. The broader debate over Obamacare is favorable to its critics. Implementation problems increasingly seem structural, not technical. Americans are being compelled to join a system that was hastily designed, poorly tested and remains persistently dysfunctional.

And President Obama’s recent political victory was largely empty of substance. The Republican Party conducted a nervous breakdown in public — and the president won the status quo, with a four-month extension of the sequester.

Yet recent Republican problems are not temporary or cosmetic.

It is now clear that there is no functional majority in the House of Representatives. In the 1996 budget confrontation, Speaker Newt Gingrich was capable of making mistakes, but he was also capable of making decisions and setting Republican strategy. Speaker John Boehner, without the reliable support of perhaps a third of his caucus, has been unable to do the same. On some issues, including rational budget measures, a majority can be constructed only with Democratic votes.

Some Republicans blame Boehner’s passive leadership style. But the problem is not a lack of firmness or charisma. Recent divisions represent an escalation of tea party rhetoric and ambitions — not just an attempt to block Obamacare but an accusation that conservatives who oppose their approach are supporting Obamacare.

This is a strategic and tactical debate rather than a policy disagreement. But the result is no less bitter. Both sides of the GOP want to get rid of an unpopular law. One side believes in building a legislative majority and electing a president to overturn it; the other believes in making preposterous demands and blaming their Republican colleagues when these demands aren’t fulfilled. Tea party ideology involves questioning the character of Republican leaders — presenting them as cowards or coopted by the establishment or deceptive about their actual views. Republican leaders, in turn, naturally view the tea party caucus as politically irrational and irresponsible. Boehner has not bridged this gap. Perhaps no one could.

Will the tea party be chastened by recent defeat? Not likely, or not for long. Because tea party leaders inhabit an alternative political reality — sheltered in safe districts or states, applauded by conservative media, incited (or threatened) by advocacy groups, carried along by a deep current of anger and frustration among activists — they have no incentive to view defeat as defeat. In fact, turning against tactical radicalism would involve serious political risk. So every setback is interpreted as a need for greater purity and commitment.

This conflict is certain to bleed over into the 2016 Republican presidential primaries. The influence of a highly committed minority is exaggerated in small electorates. All the conditions for volatility will be present: voters embittered by recent defeats, a growing infrastructure of tea party institutions, a campaign finance system easily influenced by ideologically eccentric billionaires.

The trends that helped elevate a series of politically unserious Republican candidates in 2012 — including Herman Cain and Michele Bachmann — have grown only stronger. It is instructive how easily Sen. Ted Cruz has gotten to the right of Sen. Rand Paul. Who will be able to gather momentum to Cruz’s starboard? Ben Carson? Allen West? Republican primary voters tend to make more sober political choices in the end. But the process itself creates a durable image of radicalism and instability.

This leaves Republican governors as the most functional element of the party — and many are not only functional but impressive. They have the best prospect of making a tough critique of Obamacare while proposing a credible alternative. But the longing for a great leader is also a form of confession: that a divided party is in need of saving.

Pollak'],"When It Mattered, Red-State Dems Voted Against Obamacare Delay","Dana Bash of CNN reported Wednesday evening that all of the Democratic Senators facing re-election in 2014 would back a “new” proposal to delay the Obamacare enrollment deadline–not really “new,” since Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) already said he would propose legislation to delay the individual mandate, and House Republicans passed a bill in late September to avoid a government shutdown if the mandate were delayed.

new: senior dem source tells me to expect every sen dem running in 2014 to back @JeanneShaheen proposal to delay #ACA enrollment deadline — Dana Bash (@DanaBashCNN) October 23, 2013

The House proposal failed in the Senate, 54-46, on a party-line vote. Every single Democrat voted against the proposed delay in Obamacare’s individual mandate, including those up for re-election in 2014, including red-state Democrats–all of them. If just five of them had shifted, the shutdown would have been avoided and the delay would have been passed–to face Obama’s veto, but the point would have been made.

Furthermore, there are sixteen Democrats facing re-election in the Senate, almost enough to override the president’s veto. If just a few more Democrats–perhaps the five planning to retire–had switched to back a delay that even the White House is said to be considering in one form or another, then Obama’s veto would not have been a threat. The disastrous Obamacare rollout, and the shutdown, would not have happened.

As I wrote on Sep. 23, that solution was “Win-win. Therefore unlikely.” But it should have happened, if the media had been more interested in the substance of the issue rather than whether Obama would win or lose. Instead, they helped Democrats and the media label the GOP as terrorists, hostage-takers, kidnappers, arsonists, “Gremlins” (my favorite) and suicide bombers–while some Republicans joined in the insults.

When the polls landed, Democrats became the “terrorists, hostage-takers, kidnappers, arsonists, and suicide bombers,” pressing their perceived advantage to demand the reversal of the budget sequester–at least until their allies in the media quietly warned them not to squander their victory. Now that some Democrats have embraced what Ted Cruz, Mike Lee, and–yes–John Boehner fought for, no one is calling them nasty names.

What’s done is done–and Republicans will have to find a way back from what was, in the end, a very real political loss. But let it be noted, along the way, that the very same Democrats who will now be lining up to support a delay in the enrollment deadline or individual mandate were proud that they “never folded” in the debate just a few weeks ago. They had their chance to protect Americans. They protected Obama instead."

But of those opposed, 38% say they are against the law because they think it's too liberal and 12% say it's not liberal enough. That means that 53% either support Obamacare, or say it's not liberal enough.

That CNN poll that demonstrates that yes, Republicans really did shoot themselves in the foot with their government shutdown and debt ceiling brinksmanship, also demonstrated, again, that Obamcare isn't so unpopular these days. Huh, about the same percentage (54 percent) that say ""it's a bad thing that the GOP controls the House."" Seriously, Republicans, we're done with this fight. The majority wasn't with you on repeal: In March, 2011 , in May, 2011 (and that's a Rasmussen poll!), in July, 2012 , in November, 2012 (as if the election weren't indication enough), and finally July of this year.

""A lot of people feel we are test subjects rather than people,"" said the engineering student. Residents of Magee House at the University of New Brunswick in Fredericton are in quarantine after at least 12 people tested positive for COVID-19. (Maria Jose Burgos/CBC) Mazerolle said he understands people are concerned and worried about their personal freedoms, but it's important to limit the spread of the virus. ""To minimize the potential spread, unfortunately people's movements need to be restricted for a limited period of time. … If we didn't restrict movement, we could be in a much worse situation."" Students have also expressed concerns over the residence's ventilation system. Mazerolle said the ventilation system has been checked twice and deemed safe by engineers with Public Health and the Department of Environment.

So far, all test results have been negative. George Street Middle School reopens George Street Middle School in Fredericton reopened Monday, six days after students, staff and their families were urged by Public Health to self-isolate last week following a confirmed case of COVID-19. In a letter to parents on Sunday, Public Health said students and staff can return to school, and their families can return to work, with the exception of those who have been told by Public Health to self-isolate for 14 days.

Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), who is up for re-election in 2014, wrote to Obama on Tuesday and asked him to delay the enrollment deadline for the individual mandate. “Given the existing problems with the website, I urge you to consider extending open enrollment beyond the current end date of March 31, 2014,” Shaheen wrote to the president. “Allowing extra time for consumers is critically important so they have the opportunity to become familiar with the website, survey their options and enroll.”

On Wednesday, Sen. Mark Pryor (D-AR), who is facing a tough challenge in his 2014 re-election against Rep. Tom Cotton (R-AR), came out in support of Shaheen’s call for a delay of the individual mandate’s enrollment deadline. Pryor had previously been on record as supportive of the mandate as is.

Now, according to CNN’s Bash, the Democratic Party is coordinating an effort to support a delay in the individual mandate.

“new: senior dem source tells me to expect every sen dem running in 2014 to back @JeanneShaheen proposal to delay #ACA enrollment deadline,” Bash tweeted on early Wednesday evening.

Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) is on record as supporting a one-year delay in the individual mandate as well, although Manchin is not up for re-election in 2014.

The Democrats’ push comes shortly after Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) recently launched a crusade against Obamacare. Cruz’s efforts and those of Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) showed the American people the president and Senate Democrats were unwilling to compromise on Obamacare, and the Democrats’ stubbornness resulted in a temporary partial government shutdown and a short-lived debt crisis scare.

Many Republicans, including the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), have been predicting for months that the Democrats would look for an Obamacare “escape hatch” ahead of 2014."

The president defended his health care law at the White House Thursday, the day after House Republicans voted again to repeal it. (The Washington Post)

Transforming the nation’s health-care system stands as Barack Obama’s most crucial piece of unfinished business, with much of his presidential legacy riding on whether it is deemed to have succeeded or failed.

While other presidents have managed to overcome intense opposition to major new social initiatives, Obama faces a degree of difficulty with health care that has no historic parallel.

So there was a certain urgency in the speech that Obama gave Thursday, the morning after the Republican-led House voted for the 38th and 39th times to dismantle all or part of the Affordable Care Act.

“There are still a lot of folks — in this town, at least — who are rooting for this law to fail. Some of them seem to think this law is about me. It’s not,” he said.

The process of implementing the law promises to be “many orders of magnitude more complicated” than establishing such programs as Social Security and Medicare, said David Blumenthal, president of the Commonwealth Fund, an organization that produces research on health and public policy issues.

Blumenthal, the Obama administration’s former coordinator of health information technology, also wrote a book on how 20th century presidents dealt with health-care policy.

He noted that both Social Security and Medicare are national programs that basically consist of paying bills and making payments to those who are eligible.

The new health-care law seeks to establish new health-insurance marketplaces and transform how care is delivered, while giving states more leeway in determining how that will be done.

Obama must also implement the new law against a united opposition party that is determined to throw as many obstacles as it can in his path.

“Obamacare is a disaster,” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said in a speech on the Senate floor shortly after the president’s remarks. “Mr. President, the plan is already failing.”

Some Republican lawmakers, who routinely help their constituents with concerns about Social Security and Medicare, have even served notice that they do not plan to assist those who come to them for aid in navigating the new health-care system.

“All we can do is pass them back to the Obama administration. The ball’s in their court. They’re responsible for it,” Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) told the Hill newspaper last month.

The question of who is to blame for the fact that the bill passed without a single Republican vote is likely to remain a matter of dispute between the parties for years to come.

If the president ever had any real hope that Republicans would embrace the new law after the Supreme Court upheld its constitutionality and he won reelection, he has since given that up.

But current and former administration officials say Obama and his team have been surprised at how steadfast the opposition has remained.

“It used to be that you had a fight, and it was over, and you moved on,” said Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist Jonathan Gruber, who consulted with the administration and congressional Democrats in putting together the law.

The drumbeat of House votes against the law is little more than political theater, but the decision by nearly half the nation’s states to reject federal money to expand their Medicaid programs — a crucial element of achieving near-universal health coverage — has the potential to be far more damaging.

In some states, nearly everyone will have some kind of health coverage under the new law.

In others, a perverse result is likely: Many people who earn up to the poverty level will remain uninsured, while those who make more will receive government subsidies to purchase policies in the newly established marketplaces known as exchanges.

Administration officials say that as the benefits of the new law become more apparent, opposing it will become more difficult for Republicans.

They note that the Democrats went through much the same evolution before and after the establishment of the Medicare prescription drug program in 2003 under President George W. Bush.

After initially denouncing the drug program and vowing to repeal it, Democratic lawmakers ultimately embraced it, and even devoted town hall meetings to helping constituents sign up for it.

“We know the American people think the bill should be implemented, and if there are problems along the way, we need to address them,” said White House communications director Jennifer Palmieri. “Our goal is to implement it well. We do think the further along we get, as people get more and more benefits, the less attractive it should be for people to fight it.”

But some of those who support the new system say that will not happen without a big push from the president himself. Thursday’s event at the White House, for instance, highlighted an often-overlooked aspect of the law that has already taken effect: its requirement that insurance companies spend 80 percent of the premiums they receive on providing health care, rather than taking the payments as profit or using them to pay for overhead.

”If he had one shortcoming during the passage of the law, it was failing to be out there personally as much as he should have been,” Blumenthal said. “His legacy is on the line, and there is probably no point in holding any of his political capital back. He is all-in for making this work.”"

WASHINGTON (AP) — Republican Rep. Phil Gingrey, an OB-GYN since 1975, said former Rep. Todd Akin was ""partly right"" when he said women's bodies can avoid pregnancy in cases of ""legitimate rape.""

However, the six-term Georgia lawmaker issued a statement Friday, the day after his comments, saying his position was misconstrued and that he neither defends nor stands by Akin's remark.

Gingrey spoke to constituents at a Thursday breakfast meeting and commented on both Akin and Richard Mourdock, two Republican Senate candidates tripped up by their clumsy comments last year about rape and abortion, according to the Marietta Daily Journal in Georgia. Republicans disavowed Akin after his statement, and Mourdock was widely criticized when he said pregnancy resulting from rape is ""something God intended.""

""Part of the reason the Dems still control the Senate is because of comments made in Missouri by Todd Akin and Indiana by Mourdock were considered a little bit over the top,"" Gingrey said, according to the newspaper. ""Mourdock basically said 'Look, if there is conception in the aftermath of a rape, that's still a child, and it's a child of God, essentially.' Now, in Indiana, that cost him the election.

""And in Missouri, Todd Akin was asked by a local news source about rape and he said, 'Look, in a legitimate rape situation' — and what he meant by legitimate rape was just, look, someone can say I was raped: a scared-to-death 15-year-old that becomes impregnated by her boyfriend and then has to tell her parents — that's pretty tough — and might on some occasion say, 'Hey, I was raped.' That's what he meant when he said legitimate rape versus non-legitimate rape.

""I don't find anything so horrible about that,"" Gingrey said. ""But then he went on and said that in a situation of rape, of a legitimate rape, a woman's body has a way of shutting down so the pregnancy would not occur. He's partly right on that.""

He made the comments to the Smyrna Area Council of the Cobb Chamber of Commerce, according to the newspaper.

Gingrey added that he has been an OB-GYN since 1975 and understands pregnancies.

""And I've delivered lots of babies, and I know about these things. It is true. We tell infertile couples all the time that are having trouble conceiving because of the woman not ovulating, 'Just relax. Drink a glass of wine. And don't be so tense and uptight, because all that adrenaline can cause you not to ovulate.' So he was partially right, wasn't he?"" Gingrey said. ""But the fact that a woman may have already ovulated 12 hours before she is raped, you're not going to prevent a pregnancy there by a woman's body shutting anything down, because the horse has already left the barn, so to speak. And yet the media took that and tore it apart,"" the congressman said.

Gingrey is co-chairman of the GOP Doctors Caucus, which was formed in March 2009 to challenge President Barack Obama's health care overhaul. He also is a member of the Health subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce panel.

He sought to explain his comments, saying in a statement issued by his office Friday, ""At a breakfast yesterday morning, I was asked why Democrats made abortion a central theme of the presidential campaign. I do not defend, nor do I stand by, the remarks made by Rep. Akin and Mr. Mourdock. In my attempt to provide context as to what I presumed they meant, my position was misconstrued.""

Gingrey's initial comments drew widespread criticism.

""Just when I think Republicans can't possibly be any more wrong when it comes to women, they find a new low. In one fell swoop, Republican Congressman Phil Gingrey said women regularly lie about being raped, that they're able to prevent a pregnancy simply by 'being tense and uptight,' and that Todd Akin had a point,"" said Stephanie Schriock, President of EMILY's List.

Jesse Ferguson of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee said it was ""alarming and telling"" that the head of the GOP Doctors Caucus shared Akin's views."

The two women above were interested in what we were doing and when asked said they had something to say.

This morning MSNBC Chuck Todd assessed that the Obama Presidency using the Republican moniker of Obamacare for the Affordable Care Act while cute was stupid. Todd vastly underestimates the success of the Republicans in promoting that name so much so that most Americans immediately identify with the Obamacare as opposed to the Affordable Care Act.

When asked about the Affordable Care Act the women above were completely oblivious to it. When told it was Obamacare they immediately knew what I was talking about and said they did not know it by that name. The two women interviewed are probative.

If these women understood that Obamacare forced insurance companies to use at least 80 percent of their premiums to pay for health care cost, prevent insurance companies from rescinding their policies when they most needed it most, provide breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and other health screenings as part of every policy, prevent lifetime caps that likely prevent most medical bankruptcies, and ensure that everybody have skin in the health care domain who can afford it, would they think differently? Would they think differently when they realize that pre-Obamacare the wild wild west of medical insurance was more about profits than health outcomes? When the morality of America’s health care system pre and post Obamacare is examined, many of those opposing will be ashamed of their opposing stance.

The interview went well and just talking to them gives me hope that when the truth is spoken and respect is acquired, people can agree on real truths.

Listen to the interview and tell me what you think."

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) offered some harsh words for his Republican colleagues not actively trying to gut the Affordable Care Act.

He explained that some Republicans are taking a more passive approach to opposing the health care law-- hoping it doesn't work and then using the failures for political gain.

""I consider that the Bad Samaritan theory,"" he said. ""Basically inflict a bunch of harm on the American people and hope we benefit politically from it. What a terrible, cynical approach. I'm not interested in seeing the American people suffer just because my party might benefit politically if they blame the Democrats for the foolish policies that have been imposed.""

His comments came from an interview with CNN's Dana Bush that aired on Sunday's episode of 'State Of The Union.'

Cruz said that, though his repeated attempts to defund Obamacare have been futile, he will continue to oppose the law.

On ABC's 'This Week', he told host Jon Karl that he ""would do anything, and I will continue to do anything I can to stop the train wreck that is Obamacare.""

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/11/28/democrats-worrying-about-party-re-election-prospects-distancing-themselves-from/,2013-11-28 00:00:00,[],Dems worrying about re-election prospects distancing themselves from Obama over health law rollout,"A month after emerging from a government shutdown at the top of their game, many Democrats in Congress newly worried about the party's re-election prospects are for the first time distancing themselves from President Barack Obama after the disastrous rollout of his health care overhaul.

At issue, said several Obama allies, is a loss of trust in the president after only 106,000 people — instead of an anticipated half million — were able to buy insurance coverage the first month of the new ""Obamacare"" web sites. In addition, some 4.2 million Americans received notices from insurers that policies Obama had promised they could keep were being canceled.

""Folks are now, I think in talking to members, more cautious with regard to dealing with the president,"" said Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, the senior Democrat on the House Oversight Committee and one of the first leaders in his state to endorse Obama's presidential candidacy six year ago.

Cummings, the White House's biggest defender in a Republican-controlled committee whose agenda is waging war against the administration over Benghazi, the IRS scandal, a gun-tracking operation and now health care, said he still thinks Obama is operating with integrity. But he noted that not all his Democratic colleagues agree.

""They want to make sure that everything possible is being done to, number one, be transparent, (two) fix this website situation and, three, to restore trust,"" Cummings said.

Rep. William Lacy Clay, D-Mo., like Cummings, a prominent member of the Congressional Black Caucus who personally likes Obama, struggled to describe the state of play between congressional Democrats and the president.

""I am trying to think if you can call it a relationship at this point,"" he said.

Clay said the administration is now obligated to ""fix it, fix all of it"" after Obama apologized this month for both the insurance website problems and his earlier promises that people could keep their old polices. Otherwise, he said, ""a wide brush will be used to paint us all as incompetent and ineffective.""

Obama is now allowing insurance companies to reissue their canceled policies for another year. But ""Obamacare's"" problems have left Democrats vulnerable to an orchestrated assault by Republicans who six weeks ago were on the losing end of the government shutdown.

The political body language tells the story of the strain. Thirty-nine House Democrats in Obama's party defied the president's veto threat and voted for a GOP-sponsored bill to permit the sale of individual health coverage that falls short of requirements in the law.

""I think people want to have a little more transparency going forward with whoever is implementing the website and other elements,"" said Jeff Link, senior adviser to Iowa Rep. Bruce Braley, who is running for Senate and voted for both the original health care law and the GOP-sponsored House bill this month. ""If demanding that kind of transparency means lack of trust,"" he added delicately, ""then I think people probably would like to have had more transparency.""

Across the Capitol, several swing-state Senate Democrats have signed onto legislation to further weaken the health care law. Sponsored by Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu, who's facing a tough re-election challenge, the bill would require insurance companies to permanently continue selling policies that the law deems substandard. Landrieu herself skipped an event with Obama earlier this month when he appeared at the Port of New Orleans. She said she had a long-standing engagement elsewhere in the state, which Obama lost last year by 17 points.

Repairing the relationship between Obama and his allies may be as complex as fixing the website and health care law. Much rests on rebuilding trust with the public, a solid majority of which now opposes ""Obamacare,"" according to multiple polls. Both parties will be watching on Saturday to see whether the vast majority of those who try to sign up for policies on the website will succeed, as Obama has promised. Democrats have urged the administration to quit setting ""red lines"" like the Nov. 30 deadline, that carry the risk of being broken.

Nearly a year from the midterm election, Republicans in both chambers are launching a drive to link virtually every congressional Democrat to Obamacare. In the House, the effort, based around dozens of votes to repeal the law, is about denying Democrats the 17-seat gain they would need to win back the majority. In the Senate, it's about gaining the six seats Republicans need to take control of that chamber.

""So you're running on Obamacare,"" read a faux tip sheet from House Republicans to House Democrats that went out over the holiday week. ""The best thing to do,"" it advises Democratic lawmakers in 28 districts, ""is step in front of the cameras and explain to voters why government should run their health care.""

Senate Republicans, meanwhile, showed notable discipline last week when they complained loudly about the Democrats' new limits on filibusters — then pivoted in as little as one sentence back to ""Obamacare.""

The filibuster limits, said Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, can be chalked up to ""broken promises, double standards and raw power — the same playbook that got us Obamacare.""

Democratic leaders scoff at the notion that missed deadlines and other problems could threaten the party's prospects 11 months down the road. A similar budget-and-debt fight that sparked the shutdown and smacked Republicans last month looms early next year, they point out. There is time, they insist, for the law to begin working as intended and to help elevate the Democrats' political prospects.

""Yesterday's battles and today's battles and tomorrow's battles create different environments,"" said House Democratic campaign chief Steve Israel, D-N.Y. Independent voters, the keys to elections in the most competitive districts in the country, are pragmatic, he added. ""They want the Affordable Care Act not to be repealed, but to be fixed. They don't want to go back, they want to go forward."""

James Inhofe (R-Okla.) said Sunday that he ""probably wouldn't be here"" if he had been insured under the Affordable Care Act, referring to his emergency quadruple bypass surgery earlier this month.

In a radio interview with WABC's Aaron Klein, Inhofe said his doctors discovered multiple blocked arteries during a colonoscopy and that he needed surgery immediately.

The senator said he was able to be treated right away because of his health care plan, but under a program like the Affordable Care Act, Inhofe said ""with my age, that would have been about a six-month wait"" because he did not have a heart attack.

""It's amazing. The people in any of these countries that have socialized medicine like Obama's trying to impose on America — the single pay, and we know that's what he's trying to do — should listen carefully,"" Inhofe said. ""Let's hold on to what we've got here. You're talking to someone right now who probably wouldn't be here if we had socialized medicine in America.""

Inhofe, who has served in the Senate since 1995, is an ardent opponent of President Barack Obama's signature health care reform law. Prior to the government shutdown that ended last week, he voted against a continuing resolution to fund the government because it did not defund the health care law.

“Today I kept my promise to Oklahomans that I would not vote for a continuing resolution that funds the President's disastrous health care law,"" Inhofe said in a statement on the September vote. ""I will continue to work with my colleagues in Congress and do whatever it takes to fight for ObamaCare to be defunded and repealed."""

For both sides in the protracted battle over what has come to be called Obamacare, it is a moment of political peril.

The president has staked his legacy on tens of millions of Americans who don’t get health benefits at work being able to start signing up for insurance coverage, even if they have a preexisting medical problem.

A meltdown in this new system would be politically damaging for Obama and his Democratic allies, who have said since the law passed in 2010 that Americans would embrace the Affordable Care Act once they realized its benefits.

For Republicans, the stakes also are high. Warning of an impending catastrophe, the GOP has waged an unprecedented campaign to stop the law from taking effect — including the current threat to shut down much of the federal government if Obama does not yield. A relatively drama-free rollout of the law this fall could shatter what has been a key pillar of the Republican agenda.

More worrisome still to some Republican strategists: The law’s new benefits may prove popular with millions of Americans who have been unable to get health insurance.

“We are replacing years of fighting with a reality, and that reality will shape public attitudes from here forward,” said Bill McInturff, a veteran Republican pollster. “If it works, attitudes about the law could change. But this country will have limited patience and tolerance if it doesn’t.”

Enrollment is scheduled to begin Tuesday in new state-based insurance marketplaces authorized by the law. Consumers who don’t get health benefits at work will be able to shop on the marketplaces for health plans, which must provide a new basic set of protections. The coverage will take effect Jan. 1.

Few on either side think opinions will change overnight, as a relatively small number of consumers will initially use these markets. Only about 7 million people are expected to enroll in 2014, rising to 25 million by 2018, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. An additional 12 million low-income Americans ultimately will sign up for government Medicaid programs under the law, the budget office says.

By contrast, more than 160 million people will continue to get health benefits through the decades-old system of employer-sponsored coverage, according to the projections.

Obama and his allies, however, are counting on a gradual transformation in public opinion. As millions of Americans get guaranteed health insurance and begin sharing personal stories with friends and neighbors, what has largely been a political debate will start transforming into a discussion about consumer experiences, they believe.

Supporting this effort, a vast network of grass-roots groups, some linked directly to Obama’s 2012 reelection campaign, have fanned out across the country to enroll consumers in health coverage.

The president himself appealed directly to Americans in a fiery speech last week touting the healthcare law.

“You don’t need to listen to the politicians. You don’t need to listen to me. Just go check it out for yourself,” he told an audience of supporters in suburban Washington.

“I promise you, if you go on the website and it turns out you’re going to save $100, $200, $300 a month on your insurance, or you’ll be able to buy insurance for the first time, even if you didn’t vote for me, I’ll bet you’ll sign up.”

Even some Republicans believe that once consumers get assistance from the law, those benefits will become popular, making repeal all but impossible.

“The reality is that once people actually get health insurance, we are going to see stories of how it improved people’s health, even saved lives,” said William Pierce, a former George W. Bush administration official who worked on implementation of the Medicare Part D program a decade ago.

Part D, which enables seniors to get a private prescription drug plan through Medicare, was viewed unfavorably by more than half of seniors after Republicans enacted it in 2003 over the objections of most Democrats. Initial reports of confusion and technical problems when the program rolled out in 2005 further depressed public support.

Today, the prescription drug benefit is widely seen as a runaway success, with 9 in 10 seniors reporting they are satisfied with their coverage, according to a recent poll by the Healthcare Leadership Council, a coalition of leading healthcare companies.

One provision of Obama’s health law expands the Part D program by gradually closing a gap in coverage known as the doughnut hole.

Tevi Troy, another former Bush administration official and senior healthcare advisor to former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign, said the possibility of a similar change in views of the Affordable Care Act drove Romney to develop meticulous plans for stopping the law if he was elected.

“We knew … a Rubicon would be crossed” if the law took effect, Troy said. Like many Republicans, Troy believes the law, even if it proves popular, will drive up costs, pushing the federal government deeper into debt.

The law continues to engender fierce partisan opposition, with just 1 in 10 Republicans holding a favorable view, according to a September tracking poll from the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation.

Republican leaders have already begun using Obamacare attacks to target Democratic lawmakers up for reelection in red states in 2014, including senators from Alaska, Arkansas, Louisiana and North Carolina. That playbook helped Republicans capture the House in the 2010 midterm election, when shell-shocked Democrats largely tried to avoid talking about the law.

Even a relatively successful rollout probably will include enough glitches to sustain partisan opposition, public opinion experts say.

Indeed, the portions of the law that already have taken effect don’t appear to have changed many minds.

Several million young people have been able to remain on their parents’ health plans until they turn 26. Seniors have gotten relief on their prescription bills as the Part D drug coverage gap closes.

And millions of consumers qualified for rebates from their insurance companies under a provision that limits how much insurers can spend on nonmedical expenses, such as profits or executive salaries.

Yet public views of the law have barely budged in 3 1/2 years.

Nor are Americans optimistic that they will realize any benefits. Just 12% of respondents in a recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll said the health law would have a positive effect on them or their family.

“It’s a bit of a mystery,” said Celinda Lake, a veteran Democratic pollster, who still believes that public views will change once the new insurance guarantee takes effect next year.

Looming as an even greater threat to Obama and other Democrats may be other changes that could be blamed on the law, such as rising costs or moves by more employers to stop offering health coverage to their employees.

“That could be very, very difficult for Democrats,” said McInturff, the Republican pollster. Those sorts of changes, if they occur on a widespread basis, could provide one of the most potent lines of attack for Republicans in next year’s congressional elections, he said.

http://news.yahoo.com/whats-whats-nations-health-plan-195549940.html,,[],"What's in, what's out in the nation's health plan","WASHINGTON (AP) -- Six years ago, candidate Barack Obama stood before Iowa voters and unveiled a plan designed to extend health care to all Americans.

""We can do this,"" he said with confidence. ""The time has come for universal, affordable health care in America.""

Three years ago, President Barack Obama signed into law a plan designed to extend coverage to more than 30 million uninsured people.

""This is what change looks like,"" he exulted.

Not so fast.

Obama's message now boils down to this: Be patient, not yet, adjust your expectations.

A look at how the scope of Obama's health-care plan has narrowed in recent years:

PUBLIC OPTION? Never mind.

Obama once trumpeted the idea of providing a public option in health care, in essence a government-run plan that would be one of many choices for people seeking affordable care. That idea, popular with liberals but opposed by conservatives and many moderates, never made it into the health-care law. In the quest for a workable compromise, Obama deemed it expendable.

LONG-TERM CARE INSURANCE? Buh-bye.

When the president signed his health-care plan into law, it included a proposal to provide basic long-term care insurance at an affordable cost. Before the program ever got off the ground, though, the administration ditched it last spring for fear it would turn into a financial drain. It could take be years before lawmakers to tackle the issue again.

COVERAGE FOR THE NEEDIEST? Not in every state.

The law envisioned millions of the neediest Americans gaining health insurance by enrolling in Medicaid, with coverage starting in January. But the Supreme Court threw a wrench in that plan last year when it gave states the right to opt out of the Medicaid expansion plan. Because of Republican opposition in many states, it looks like nearly 2 in 3 of those who would qualify for new Medicaid coverage may be out of luck because their state lawmakers have not agreed to expand the program.

WHAT ABOUT WORKERS? A longer wait.

Story continues

The law requires companies with 50 or more workers to offer affordable coverage to full-time employees or risk a series of escalating tax penalties. Originally, that requirement was supposed to take effect on Jan. 1, 2014. But now the administration is pushing that requirement back a year, citing the complexity of the undertaking. Most medium and large business already offer health insurance. Those most likely to be affected by the delay: low-wage workers at hotels, restaurants and stores.

WHAT'S LEFT? Plenty.

Starting next year individuals will be required to carry health insurance or face fines. People who are uninsured will be able to shop for affordable coverage through online marketplaces. Middle-class people who don't have coverage through their jobs will use the marketplace to apply for tax credits to help pay their premiums. Low-income people will be steered to the Medicaid expansion — if their state participates. Insurance companies will be required to accept people regardless of their medical problems. A number of other changes already have taken effect, including a provision that allows young adults to stay on their parents' insurance until age 26 and a ban on lifetime limits on insurance coverage.

Washington (CNN) - What a difference a month makes.

A new CNN/ORC International poll indicates a dramatic turnaround in the battle for control of Congress in next year's midterm elections.



Democrats a month ago held a 50%-42% advantage among registered voters in a generic ballot, which asked respondents to choose between a Democrat or Republican in their congressional district without identifying the candidates.

That result came after congressional Republicans appeared to overplay their hand in the bitter fight over the federal government shutdown and the debt ceiling.

But the Democratic lead has disappeared. A new CNN/ORC poll indicates the GOP now holds a 49%-47% edge.

The new survey was conducted last week and released Tuesday.

The 10-point swing follows a political uproar over Obamacare, which included the botched rollout of HealthCare.gov and controversy over insurance policy cancelations due primarily to the new health law.

The turnaround in the CNN/ORC poll follows similar shifts in recent national surveys from Quinnipiac University and Fox News.

At a news conference two weeks ago, President Barack Obama acknowledged that problems plaguing the startup of the new healthcare law could hurt Democrats.

""There is no doubt that our failure to rollout the ACA smoothly has put a burden on Democrats, whether they are running or not because they stood up and supported this effort through thick and thin,"" Obama said.

The CNN/ORC poll, released as the President makes a West Coast campaign fundraising swing on behalf of fellow Democrats, indicates both parties making gains within their base.

""It looks like the biggest shifts toward the Republicans came among white voters, higher-income Americans, and people who live in rural areas, while Democrats have gained strength in the past month among some of their natural constituencies, such as non-white voters and lower-income Americans,"" said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland.

""If those patterns persist into 2014, it may indicate that Obamacare is popular among those who it was designed to help the most, but unpopular among the larger group of voters who are personally less concerned about health insurance and health care,"" Holland said.

Republicans currently have a 17-seat advantage in the U.S. House with the Democrats holding a 55-45 majority in the Senate.

While the generic ballot question is one of the most commonly used indicators when it comes to the battle for Congress, the poll results are a long way from predicting what will happen next November.

""There is just under a year to go before any votes are actually cast and the 'generic ballot' question is not necessarily a good predictor of the actual outcome of 435 separate elections,"" Holland cautions.

""A year before the 2010 midterms, for example, the Democrats held a six-point lead on the generic ballot but the GOP wound up regaining control of the House in that election cycle, thanks to an historic 63-seat pickup,"" he said.

The poll was conducted November 18-20 for CNN by ORC International, with 843 adult Americans, including 749 registered voters, questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points."

President Obama expresses optimism about low approval ratings

Obama tells ABC%27s Barbara Walters that the health care law will be %22a legacy I am extraordinarily proud of%22

There is little more than three years left in Obama%27s final term

President Obama, battered politically over the rollout of his health care plan, says there is a bright spot in low approval ratings.

""The good thing about when you're down is that, usually, you got nowhere to go but up,"" Obama told Barbara Walters of ABC News.

Obama also said that the health care plan will work in the long run, that problems with the website will be fixed, and that people who have had their insurance policies canceled will be helped.

""I continue to believe, and (I am) absolutely convinced that at the end of the day, people are going to look back at the work we've done to make sure that in this country, you don't go bankrupt when you get sick, that families have that security,"" Obama said. ""That is going be a legacy I am extraordinarily proud of.""

ABC released clips from the Walters interview that airs Friday night on 20/20.

The website HealthCare.gov has had numerous technical glitches since its unveiling on Oct. 1. Obama administration officials have vowed a well-functioning website by the end of November, which is Saturday.

Many consumers have seen their insurance policies bought on the individual market canceled because they do not meet the standards of the new law. The health care disputes have taken a toll on Obama's political standing, with his approval ratings hitting low points in a string of recent polls.

Some surveys indicate that many voters no longer trust Obama. He took issue with that analysis during his interview with Walters, saying that every president goes through rough patches.

""I got re-elected in part because people did think I was trustworthy and they knew I was working on their behalf,"" Obama said. ""Very rarely are the good things that happen (going to) get the same attention as the things that aren't working so well.""

With a little more than three years left in his second term, Obama vowed to push on with his agenda.

""Every president in their second term is mindful that you've only got a limited amount of time,"" he said, ""and you want to make sure you are squeezing every last ounce of energy that you have to try to deliver on the commitments you made to the American people."""
http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/10/26/in-iowa-speech-ted-cruz-warns-democrats-on-shutdown/,2013-10-26 00:00:00,"[""Ed O'Keefe"", 'Reporter Focused On Congress', 'National Politics', 'The Federal Government']","In Iowa speech, Ted Cruz warns Democrats on shutdown","He warned that the decision by Senate Democrats to repeatedly vote together against GOP-backed budget proposals -- including a measure that Cruz claimed would repeal the congressional exemption from the new health-care law -- means that vulnerable House and Senate Democrats will suffer political consequences during next year’s midterm elections.

“I promise you, come October and November of 2014, we’re going to see TV commercials all over this country of Democrats who voted to give themselves a special exemption to Obamacare that their constituents don’t get and there are going to be some Democratic members of Congress and of the Senate who are suddenly going to be experiencing the joys of the private health-care system,” Cruz told the crowd.

The comments suggest that Cruz is preparing to take an even more active role in calling out his Democratic colleagues for actions taken during the shutdown -- even though Democrts have generally emerged victorious from the standoff, at least according to public opinion polls. Any new effort by Cruz to blunt Senate Democrats would be notable since he is a vice chairman of the National Senatorial Campaign Committee and has been criticized by some for doing little to help bolster the party’s chances of retaking the Senate next year.

The senator delivered a series of well-worn jokes and zingers heard before on the Senate floor or in similar speeches in other early-primary states, including South Carolina.

Promising a sellout crowd of 600 people that he wouldn’t speak for as long as he did during his recent 21-hour marathon filibuster-like speech on the Senate floor, Cruz began by joking that “Twenty-one hours is a long time. That’s almost as long as it takes to sign up on the Obamacare Web site.”

As he did during a similar state party function in South Carolina in May, Cruz avoided using a lectern and instead paced the stage with a wireless microphone pinned to his necktie. He began by chastising the Obama administration for being “bent on violating every constitutional protection."" He retold the life story of his father, Rafael Cruz, a Cuban immigrant. And he repeatedly poked fun at “conventional wisdom” emanating from Washington.

Unlike previous addresses, however, Cruz was accompanied Friday night by his wife, Heidi Nelson Cruz, a rare political trip for her outside of Texas. The joint appearance came just days after a high-profile New York Times profile that discussed the couple's relationship and finances and her work for Goldman Sachs.

Looking beyond the health-care fight, Cruz at one point discussed the need for Republicans to focus much more intently on economic growth.

“If we don’t have growth, we can’t achieve anything,” he told the crowd. Arguing that even modest economic growth could generate trillions of dollars in tax revenues and deficit reduction, he said “That’s what the Republican Party needs to be about. We need to be about economic growth all the time, every day, that’s how we turn the country around.”

In a nod to the growing power and popularity of grassroots conservatives, he listed five instances in the past year where a groundswell of conservative support helped blunt Obama administration policies: During a filibuster by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) against U.S. drone policy; during the Senate debate over gun control; during the summer's immigration debate; when Republicans joined Democrats in raising concerns about President Obama's plans in Syria; and most recently during the government shutdown.

Cruz eagerly sought to harness that grassroots support by asking people in the crowd to use their cellphones to text the word “growth” to a number tied to his political organization -- a modern-age way to collect the names and numbers of potential political supporters. He made a similar request during his South Carolina speech in May.

That request, plus Cruz's appearance in the state that hosts the first presidential caucuses, will once again fuel speculation about his political future. He demurred when asked afterward by reporters whether the trip was in preparation for a presidential bid.

The visit was Cruz's third to Iowa this year, but his longest yet. He arrived Friday afternoon in time for his speech and on Saturday plans to join Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) on the congressman’s annual pheasant hunt and “Defenders of Freedom” fundraiser in Akron and Le Mars, two towns in the conservative northwest corner of the state. He will fly home Sunday to celebrate the birthday of his 3-year old daughter.

Cruz is not the only would-be GOP presidential candidate spending time in Iowa these days. Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), who was the 2012 Republican vice presidential candidate, will be in the state next month to attend a fundraiser for Republican Gov. Terry Branstad. And Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) made a well-received trip to the state last spring shortly after he mounted a filibuster in opposition to domestic spying programs.

Tea Party-aligned members of Boehner's caucus are flexing their muscle and pressuring him to allow a vote on an anti-ObamaCare measure as part of ongoing budget talks. They want the vote tied directly to the budget measure, and rejected a compromise plan earlier this week -- leaving unclear how Congress might pass a short-term spending bill before funding runs out on Sept. 30.

Boehner, after meeting with bipartisan congressional leaders on Thursday morning, offered no hint of what the next step might be. In the face of heated intra-party squabbling -- and even nastier accusations flying between Republican and Democrats -- he projected cool.

""There's all this speculation about these deadlines that are coming up. I'm well aware of the deadlines. So are my colleagues,"" he said. ""And so we're working with our colleagues to work our way through these issues. I think there's a way to get there. ... There are a million options that are being discussed by a lot of people.""

But Boehner realizes that the party's public image going into the 2014 elections could be at stake, with Democrats eager to pin the blame on them if Congress can't reach a budget deal and there's a partial shutdown. Lawmakers came within minutes of a shutdown during a budget fight in 2011, and have continued to pass a series of short-term measures -- leaving the prospect of a shutdown perpetually over the horizon.

This time, the biggest sticking point centers on ObamaCare. House conservatives wanted to make sure the spending measure includes a provision to de-fund the health care law. Boehner floated a compromise that would allow members to take a vote on that, but also keep the ObamaCare provision distinct and allow the Senate to carve it out and vote it down, while still sending the budget portion to the White House.

House conservatives rejected the idea, and Capitol Hill was overtaken by cross-party bickering on Thursday as Democrats tried to shame Republicans into backing down.

""The anarchists are winning,"" Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid said. ""Anything that can be done to slow down, hurt or get rid of government in any way -- that's good. Shutting down the government is obviously what the majority of the Republican caucus wants in the House.""

Reid said he likes Boehner, but feels ""sorry"" for him and his predicament.

Democrats generally argue that the anti-ObamaCare votes are pointless, since they stand little chance of passing the Senate or ever being approved by the president.

But House conservatives claim the American people want them to act on ObamaCare, and see the budget vote as leverage.

Rep. Blake Farenthold, R-Texas, said the short-term spending measure is ""one of our few leverage points.""

""This is the argument we got last time the (budget measure) was coming around -- we can't shut the government down or we'll lose the presidency, we'll lose seats in the House,"" he said. ""Guess what, we lost seats in the House and we lost the presidency. The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. The people want us to act and act decisively.""

Republican lawmakers are now trying to come up with an alternative plan to both deal with ObamaCare and the budget. Some are discussing a plan to vote on delaying the health care law for a year, as opposed to de-funding it.

House leaders told their members on Thursday to prepare to skip a planned recess the final week of September so they can work on the spending bill.

Obama was able to protect them with his rhetoric, but he was never measured against his results. Now, in the second term, they’re implementing these things, they’re putting details in writing, regulations are coming out, and we’re seeing just how different these proposals are than the rhetoric that was used to sell them.” [...] “I don’t see this last election as the end of this story,” he says. “I see it as a chapter in this story. A story for the fight over the soul of America, and I believe that the chapter we’re entering is one where conservatives have a better chance of triumphing, because the president’s actual proposals don’t add up and people are going to see that.”

Move over, Karl Rove. You might not have been willing to accept the verdict of voters on election night, but Paul Ryan—who actually lost the election—is still holding out hope for victory. Actually, he's not just holding out hope: He's convinced that he will win.According to Ryan, the GOP's vision for a world without Obamacare has never been in a better position to prevail. Why? Because Obamacare is now being implemented:Yeah, that makes total sense. In fact, it's actually a good thing that Chief Justice John Roberts recognized Obamacare was constitutional, because otherwise it would have been blocked, which would have made getting rid of it much, much harder. And it's also good that President Obama himself won reelection in 2012, because otherwise Republicans could have simply repealed it, which would have made it permanent. Makes total sense, right?

And, come to think of it, it was a stroke of brilliance for Paul Ryan to include all of Obamacare's deficit-reduction measures in his budget, including hundreds of billions in Medicare savings, because what better way to undermine Obamacare than to propose keeping it in place?

In all seriousness, Ryan's argument might sound attractive to Obamacare detractors, but it is completely disingenuous. It would be one thing if Republicans were trying their hardest to make Obamacare work, but in most states and with most Republicans in Congress, the opposite is true. GOP legislators on Capitol Hill are busily trying to block essential funds for Obamacare and most Republican governors are doing everything they can to make implementing the law difficult. So despite what Ryan said, Republicans aren't sitting on the sidelines letting Obamacare succeed or fail on its own: They are actively engaged in efforts to wreck it, even after losing the 2012 election. Obamacare is still a battle—fortunately, Ryan's side is still losing."

It's back, now with even more pain.

Rep. Paul Ryan has once again resurrected his hugely unpopular Medicare voucher plan (they're calling it ""competitive bidding"" ), now with even more stuff to make it unpopular. Bowing to the reality that his numbers just don't add up to what he says will be a balanced budget in 10 years, Ryan has decided to break the promise Republicans made to protect people 55 and older from his cuts.

That's the promise he and Mitt Romney made on the 2012 campaign trail and the promise GOP Congress members ran on, and now some of them are ""furious"" with Ryan's reversal.



After agreeing to write a budget resolution that will balance the budget over the next decade, Ryan conceded that he might have to adjust the age to as high as 59. The dwindling group of middle-of-the-road House Republican lawmakers decried the potential change in age because the party for the past two years has repeatedly cited 55 years and above as the untouched generation. Some of the members are also facing challenging reelection races next year. “A lot of people had made commitments at 55. In other words, in the campaign [Republican vulnerable members] said it wouldn’t affect your Medicare for retirees or near retirees for those 55 and up ... and [if] this budget forces them to renege on that, that would be problematic for many,” said the GOP lawmaker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

The handful of ""moderate"" Republicans (the ones who have to appear not quite as crazy as they really are because they're in tougher districts) aren't likely to be a big enough force in the party to convince Ryan to change his mind. He's got to make a stab at getting his numbers to finally work, and the only way he can do that, and get in all the tax cuts he wants, is by starving a few more grannies.

All of which could make 2014 just a little more profitable for Democrats, particularly if they can stave off any grand bargain that includes Medicare."

Washington (CNN) - The top Democrat in the House is pushing back against calls to extend open enrollment in the new health care exchanges because of the massive technical problems plaguing HealthCare.gov.

""I don't support that,"" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday morning, just hours after Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire appeared to be the first Democrat in Congress to join a growing number of her Republican colleagues in suggesting the deadline be pushed back.

The current law stipulates that enrollment in the insurance exchanges set up by the Affordable Care Act ends on March 31, 2014. Those who are uninsured after that point face fines by the Internal Revenue Service.

""As website glitches persist, we are losing valuable time to educate and enroll people in insurance plans,"" Shaheen wrote in a letter to President Barack Obama. ""I also fear that people that have tried, and failed, to enroll online may become frustrated and not return to the website to try again at a later date... Allowing extra time for consumers is critically important so they have the opportunity to become familiar with the website, survey their options and enroll.""

When asked by CNN Senior Congressional Producer Deirdre Walsh, Pelosi said she disagreed with Shaheen, adding that ""I think we should fix what we have. Move forward with the deadline we have, respectful of what her (Shaheen's) experience may be, of her suggestion, but not supportive of it.""

Pelosi also told reporters on Capitol Hill that she didn't hear any members who took part in a closed door meeting of House Democrats and officials implementing the health care exchanges earlier Wednesday suggest that they wanted to push back the deadline.

But one senior House Democrat who spoke with CNN following the meeting didn't rule it out.

""I'm not prepared to say that now. We're going to have to find out,"" said longtime Rep. John Dingell of Michigan, a healthcare reform patriarch, when asked about pushing back the enrollment deadline or removing the fine.

Shaheen faces re-election next year in a purple state but early polling indicates she's far ahead of her possible GOP challengers. Regardless of her push to extend the deadline, Shaheen does not appear to be a turncoat in the war over Obamacare. The Senator's letter to the President offers high praise of - and some patient frustration with - the law.

Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor of Arkansas also supports pushing back the deadline.

""The senator has seen the letter and supports the effort to extend the enrollment deadline,"" Michael Teague, Pryor's communications director, told CNN Wednesday afternoon.

Pryor, like Shaheen, is also up for re-election next year. He faces a tough bid for another term in office in a red state and is being challenged by GOP Rep. Tom Cotton.

At the annual meeting here of the nation’s Republican governors, the ones who are eyeing presidential runs in 2016 say they oppose the health care law. But there is sharp disagreement among those who have helped carry out the law and those who remain entrenched in their opposition.

These early divisions reveal not only the difficult calculations of ambitious Republican politicians as they look to the next presidential campaign, but also the complexities of being a governor rather than a lawmaker at a time when the party’s base is hostile to those who cooperate with Democrats.

The governors who refused the Medicaid expansion money that is part of the health care law — believing they had found a wedge issue — are already boasting about it."

Pollak'],Obama Cancels 'You Can Keep Your Plan' Promise: 'Just Shop Around',"In a speech at Boston’s Faneuil Hall on Wednesday afternoon, President Barack Obama discarded his now-infamous broken promise: “If you like your health insurance, you can keep your health insurance.” Instead, he offered a new promise: “You will be getting a better deal,” the president told health insurance consumers.

He blamed insurance companies, not Obamacare, for the canceled policies:

Now, if you had one of these substandard plans before the Affordable Care Act became law, and you really like that plan, you were able to keep it. That’s what I said when I was running for office. That was part of the promise we made. But ever since the law was passed, if insurers decided to downgrade or cancel the substandard plans, what we said under the law is that you have got to replace them with quality, comprehensive coverage because that, too, was a central premise of the Affordable Care Act from the very beginning… So if you’re getting one of these letters [canceling your insurance policy], just shop around in the new marketplace. That’s what it’s for… For the fewer than 5% of Americans who buy insurance on your own, you will be getting a better deal. So anyone peddling the motion that insurers are canceling people’s plan without mentioning that almost all the insurers are encouraging people to join better plans with the same carrier and stronger benefits and stronger protections, while others will be able to get better plans with new carriers through the marketplace, and then many will get new help to pay for these better plans and make them actually cheaper–if you leave that stuff out, you’re being grossly misleading, to say the least.

Ignoring evidence that the “better deal” is often far more expensive than existing plans, the president updated his promise without apologizing for misleading voters for years about the consequences of Obamacare. He also ignored the fact that companies were compelled by the law to change their plans to comply with new rules.

Obama, repeating a common Democrat talking point, also cited Medicare Part D to claim that Democrats had helped Republicans improve that policy, even though they had opposed it. However, as Rep. Renee Ellmers (R-NC) pointed out in Congress earlier Wednesday, Medicare Part D is voluntary–unlike Obamacare."

Pollak'],The Weakest Link: Left Targets Justice Roberts–Again,"It worked last time. Last year, when oral arguments in the Obamacare case seemed to go against the administration, the left targeted Chief Justice John Roberts with a series of attacks from President Barack Obama on down. The attacks may have worked, as Roberts apparently changed his vote and upheld Obamacare by effectively rewriting the legislation itself to define the individual mandate as a tax.

The attacks on Roberts last year included President Obama’s general–and bizarre–assertion that the Supreme Court could not overturn congressional legislation, as well as a direct attack on Roberts by Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT), who admonished the Chief Justice about “the proper role of the judicial branch.” The left media joined in enthusiastically, bullying the Chief Justice into deferring to Congress and the President.

This time, the charge is being led by the left media, including Ryan Grim of the Huffington Post, who penned a front-page article attacking Roberts for his past rulings on race and discrimination. Roberts’s Obamacare decision, or his support for overturning most of Arizona’s allegedly discriminatory immigration law (another 2012 debacle) apparently earned no points from Grim, who castigates Roberts for ignoring race.

“Roberts has in the past been dismissive of the need for voting rights protections or affirmative action, viewing the world as without the sort of racism that might require such remedies,” Grim writes scornfully. He seizes on Roberts’s skepticism that the Defense of Marriage Act was motivated by anti-homosexual animus, pointing to a passage in the Congressional Record about the moral disapproval of homosexuality.

Grim makes use of a familiar left-wing tactic: casting moral disapproval of homosexuality as moral disapproval of gay people. Many supporters of traditional marriage are careful to distinguish between the two. Moreover, Roberts asked: “So eighty-four Senators–it’s the same question I asked before–eighty-four Senators based their vote on moral disapproval of gay people?” He was not denying that some might have acted out of animus, but doubting that all had done so.

The point was not lost on Justice Elena Kagan, who quoted the same passage from the Congressional Record to which Grim refers. She admitted, after Roberts’s question, that most Senators who voted for the act likely did not act out of anti-gay bigotry. Grim ignores that and twists Roberts’s words to cast him as willfully blind–not just to anti-gay bigotry, but bigotry in general.

There is, Grim implies, one way for Roberts to redeem himself–for the moment, anyway–and that is to vote to strike down the Defense of Marriage Act. Then he can prove he is not blind, or bigoted himself–until the next constitutional controversy comes up, when the left will dip its pens in poison again and attack the Chief Justice, believing him to be the Court’s weakest link. Based on his recent history, they would not be wrong."

President Obama expresses optimism about low approval ratings

Obama tells ABC%27s Barbara Walters that the health care law will be %22a legacy I am extraordinarily proud of%22

There is little more than three years left in Obama%27s final term

President Obama, battered politically over the rollout of his health care plan, says there is a bright spot in low approval ratings.

""The good thing about when you're down is that, usually, you got nowhere to go but up,"" Obama told Barbara Walters of ABC News.

Obama also said that the health care plan will work in the long run, that problems with the website will be fixed, and that people who have had their insurance policies canceled will be helped.

""I continue to believe, and (I am) absolutely convinced that at the end of the day, people are going to look back at the work we've done to make sure that in this country, you don't go bankrupt when you get sick, that families have that security,"" Obama said. ""That is going be a legacy I am extraordinarily proud of.""

ABC released clips from the Walters interview that airs Friday night on 20/20.

The website HealthCare.gov has had numerous technical glitches since its unveiling on Oct. 1. Obama administration officials have vowed a well-functioning website by the end of November, which is Saturday.

Many consumers have seen their insurance policies bought on the individual market canceled because they do not meet the standards of the new law. The health care disputes have taken a toll on Obama's political standing, with his approval ratings hitting low points in a string of recent polls.

Some surveys indicate that many voters no longer trust Obama. He took issue with that analysis during his interview with Walters, saying that every president goes through rough patches.

""I got re-elected in part because people did think I was trustworthy and they knew I was working on their behalf,"" Obama said. ""Very rarely are the good things that happen (going to) get the same attention as the things that aren't working so well.""

With a little more than three years left in his second term, Obama vowed to push on with his agenda.

""Every president in their second term is mindful that you've only got a limited amount of time,"" he said, ""and you want to make sure you are squeezing every last ounce of energy that you have to try to deliver on the commitments you made to the American people."""

First the bad news for Obama: The latest Washington Post/ABC News poll shows the public by 55%-42% disapproves of his performance in office. By 63%-33%, Americans disapprove of his handling of the health law.

Perhaps even more ominously for the president, by 52%-46%, the public now has an unfavorable view of Obama, himself. In the past, even when the public has soured on Obama’s performance in office, a majority has liked him personally. Now, however, by 51%-47% those surveyed say Obama does not “understand the problems of people like you” and by 50%-47%, they do not see him as “honest and trustworthy.”

Across the board, those ratings – and others equally troubling for the White House -- have fallen in the last few weeks as Obama and his aides have struggled with the launch of the healthcare law.

But the counterpoint comes from a newly released National Journal Congressional Connection survey which, like the Post/ABC poll, was taken Thursday through Sunday.

The National Journal poll shows that despite all the problems of the healthcare rollout, fewer than four in 10 Americans support repeal of the law. Even more strikingly, the percentage backing repeal has not grown by a statistically significant amount since the summer.

Repeal has been the steady, repeated demand of congressional Republicans, and the poll shows ample reasons why: Among self-identified Republicans, nearly three out of four respondents supported repeal. But among self-identified independents, a group that is otherwise quite skeptical of the law, only four in 10 back repeal. Democrats overwhelmingly oppose that idea.

Taken together, the two polls reaffirm a key point about the electorate that both parties tend to forget, to their detriment: A large bloc of Americans takes a relatively non-ideological, pragmatic approach to politics and government. They like to see accomplishments, they judge politicians by a relatively straightforward standard of results and they mistrust sudden shifts of course in either direction. That, of course, puts those Americans at odds with the more ideologically oriented voters who form the bedrock supporters of both parties.

For the healthcare law, the poll results suggest the issue will weigh down Obama and Democrats in general so long as the public sees the law as failing to work. But the reverse may also prove true: If the White House can get the law’s problems fixed, they have a chance to recover, so long as Republicans stick strictly to a message of repeal, which their core supporters insist on, but which the wider public rejects.

[For the Record, 1:55 p.m. PST Nov. 19: An earlier version of this post stated that, according to a Washington Post/ABC News poll, fewer than one in four Americans support repealing the Affordable Care Act. The poll’s actual statistic is fewer than four in 10 Americans.]

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/09/30/ben-sasse-nebraska-obamacare,2013-09-30 00:00:00,['Breitbart News'],Emergent Anti-Obamacare Senate Candidate Breaks Fundraising Record in Nebraska,"A novice Republican running in a rural state has shattered fundraising records campaigning as the “anti-Obamacare candidate.” In his first race for public office, Ben Sasse has raised nearly $750,000 in just eight weeks of the first quarter of his nascent candidacy, according to records being filed with the Federal Election Commission.

The massive haul highlights how lucrative campaigning against Obamacare can be for Republicans. It also underscores how deeply motivated conservative voters are to see that the sprawling healthcare law be killed.

A college president in his hometown of Fremont, Nebraska, Sasse is a newcomer to politics, but he has spent much of the past decade working on healthcare issues. As a top advisor to President Bush’s Health Secretary, Sasse worked to cut red tape and pushed market-based solutions over government mandates. Sasse also spent several years traveling the country giving speeches and advising companies about the dangers of Obamacare and how it will hike costs, constrict innovation, and ultimately provide terrible health care.

“I am the anti-Obamacare candidate,” Sasse said cheerfully. “Not only have I read the 2,300-page bill, I have actually spent years studying it and I understand just how devastating this will be to American businesses, families and taxpayers.”

It was Sasse’s health care expertise and his outspoken opposition to Obamacare that inspired former Nebraska GOP chairman Mark Fahleson to draft Sasse to run for the open seat left by Sen. Mike Johann’s retirement.

“2014 and probably 2016 will be about one thing more than anything else,” Fahleson said. “It will be about Obamacare and the false promises and reckless entitlement spending that are set to destroy this country. And I don’t know anybody who knows more about it and is more honest about the problems of Obamacare than Ben.”

Sasse’s campaign comes just as the crusade against Obamacare has hit a fevered pitch in Washington.

“Ted Cruz has finally shown the Republican establishment in Washington just how fed up voters are with the federal government and the notion that bureaucrats know what is best for patients,” said one political consultant who advised the Cruz campaign. “That’s why a guy knowledgeable about healthcare like Ben Sasse being in the Senate would be the most destructive thing to ever hit Obamacare.”

Sasse’s cash haul of nearly $750,000 from individual donors in his first quarter breaks Nebraska’s previous record of $526,000 from individual donors, set in 2007 by Johanns while he was sitting U.S. Secretary of Agriculture.

Shane Osborn, former state treasurer who has been running for the senate seat for six months, raised just $234,000 in his first quarter, according to FEC records."

He Joined The Newspaper In', 'Reported Washington To']",Healthcare an obstacle as Republicans court Latinos,"As Republican leaders try to woo Latino voters with a new openness to legal status for the nation’s illegal immigrants, the party remains at odds with America’s fastest-growing ethnic community on another key issue: healthcare.

Latinos, who have the lowest rates of health coverage in the country, are among the strongest backers of President Obama’s healthcare law. In a recent national poll, supporters outnumbered detractors by more than 2 to 1. Latinos also overwhelmingly see guaranteeing healthcare as a core government responsibility, surveys show.



Yet congressional Republicans continue to make repeal of the 2010 Affordable Care Act a top agenda item and have renewed calls for deep cuts in health programs such as Medicaid, which are very popular with Latinos.

“Obamacare is a colossal mistake for our country,” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said recently in a speech on the Senate floor. “It needs to be pulled out by its roots.”

Republican National Committee spokeswoman Alexandra Franceschi expressed confidence that Latinos would ultimately recognize that the law raises costs and burdens businesses. “We’re going to do a better job explaining why this law is negatively affecting all Americans, including the Hispanic community,” she said.

At the same time, however, attacking the law risks undermining the RNC’s planned minority outreach campaign, which party leaders said in a recent strategy blueprint must convince Latinos “we care about them.”

“This is going to hurt Republicans,” said Matt Barreto, cofounder of Latino Decisions, a nonpartisan national polling firm. “When Republicans keep saying they will repeal the health law, Latinos hear the party is going to take away their healthcare.”

Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney received just 27% of the Latino vote in November, in large measure because of his harsh rhetoric about illegal immigrants. But he also made overturning the health law a central plank of his campaign. His first Spanish-language ad after he won the 2012 nomination promised he would issue an executive order to roll back the law on his first day in office.

Obama, meanwhile, made upholding the Affordable Care Act a core part of his Latino strategy. A quarter of the president’s advertising in Spanish focused on the law, said James Aldrete, who oversaw Spanish-language media strategy for Obama in 2008 and 2012. “We knew from the start that, if Latinos knew about the benefits of the law, they were going back the president,” he said. “It was central to our messaging.”

In one widely aired television ad, Cristina Saralegui, a popular talk-show host, explained in Spanish how the law would help millions of Latinos get health insurance. In another, a campaign volunteer visiting a middle-aged man with diabetes, which is widespread among Latinos, said: “Family is important to President Obama, and he understands that families that are fighters sometimes have lost everything when someone gets sick.”

Surveys indicate that close to 30% of Latino citizens and legal permanent residents lack health insurance. By comparison, just 11% of white and 17% of black Americans are uninsured, according to the latest data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Starting next year, the health law will provide hundreds of millions of dollars in subsidies to low-income Americans and legal residents to help pay insurance premiums. Illegal immigrants cannot receive these subsidies.

The law will also provide states with additional federal aid if they open their Medicaid programs to more of their poor residents. That, too, will likely disproportionately benefit Latinos, nearly 30% of whom rely on government health insurance, at twice the rate of white Americans.

The high numbers of Latinos who are uninsured or depend on public programs reflect their lower incomes and their concentration in industries, such as the service sector, that often don’t provide health benefits.

“Latinos realize that government will not fulfill every need, but what they admire about the United States is that the government steps in when there is a need,” said Lorena Chambers, a Latina media consultant who worked on a campaign to help pass the president’s health law.

Nearly half of Latinos in a recent Pew Research Center poll said they trusted the federal government to do the right thing “always” or “most of the time.” Just 20% of white respondents felt that way. And two-thirds of Latinos believed the federal government should ensure that everyone has access to health insurance, a 2012 Latino Decisions survey found.

Brittain, 30, and her husband, an accountant, lost their jobs and their health coverage last year. Their two children, who are 2 and 4, qualify for Medicaid. Brittain responded to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll.

Republicans, she said, just don’t seem to understand that kind of struggle. “It seems like whatever the president is for, they are against. They don’t care about how that affects real people,” she said.

The Republican National Committee acknowledged the damage caused by that perception in outlining its strategy to win over Latinos. “They want to know that we are not just the party for those at the top of the economic ladder because our dream of a better life is for them, too,” party leaders wrote.

But Republicans show few signs of changing course on healthcare.

GOP lawmakers on Capitol Hill pushed more votes last month to repeal all or part of the law, after more than 30 such votes in 2011 and 2012. And the GOP budget just passed by the House would repeal the new health law and slash billions of dollars from future Medicaid spending, leaving tens of millions of mostly low-income Americans — many of them Latino — without health coverage.

Even two of the party’s most prominent Latino politicians have taken up the repeal refrain.

Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, considered a likely presidential contender, cited the law as an example of government hurting people in his GOP response to Obama’s State of the Union speech in February. And newly elected Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, a tea party favorite, used his first major speech on the Senate floor to push an amendment to defund the law.

Jack Kingston: Not 'Responsible' To Let Obamacare Fail,"A Republican congressman running for the U.S. Senate in Georgia broke with many members of his party on Monday and said it was irresponsible to just let Obamacare fail.

Speaking to a local conservative radio station called ""Z Politics,"" Rep. Jack Kingston (R-Ga.) discussed his Small Business Fairness In ObamaCare Act, which would exempt small businesses from the requirement that companies with over 50 full-time workers provide health insurance.

Kingston's legislation obviously falls far short of fully repealing Obamacare, which many conservatives insist should be the main goal. But Kingston said such a focus was not the best path.

""And there’s some criticism, 'Well, are you helping improve this law when you make that change? And should we be doing that?'"" Kingston said, referring to pushback against his bill. ""A lot of conservatives say, 'Nah, let’s just step back and let this thing fall to pieces on its own.' But I don’t think that’s always the responsible thing to do.""

""I think we need to be looking for things that improve health care overall for all of us,"" he added. ""And if there was something in Obamacare, we need to know about it.""

Listen:

Kingston spokesman Chris Crawford told the Hill, which first picked up Crawford's comments, that the congressman was pushing for a replacement to Obamacare.

""He essentially said that we don't just need to wait for Obamacare to die under its own weight, we need to be looking for solutions that would replace it,"" Crawford said.

Kingston has also repeatedly voted to defund Obamacare.

Kingston is running against seven other Republicans in the primary to replace the retiring Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.), and the winner is expected to face Michelle Nunn, the leading contender on the Democratic side, in the general election. An October survey by the Democratic Public Policy Polling found Nunn tied with with a generic Republican opponent.

Kingston's position is notable because his primary opponents have staked out positions far more to the right. On Monday, Rep. Paul Broun (R-Ga.), for example, posted an op-ed on the conservative site Breitbart titled, ""Stop Wasting Time Trying To Fix Obamacare.""

""Obamacare is simply not fixable, and Congress must stop wasting time passing bills which keep Obamacare in place,"" wrote Broun.

Rep. Phil Gingrey (R-Ga.) has promised to ""help repeal Obamacare in my first term, or go home"" and not run for reelection.

While every Republican seems to want to repeal Obamacare, there is no consensus on what should go in its place. Making sure people have health insurance is expensive and disruptive, and Republicans don't have much appetite for taking up that battle.

""If you think about it, it would be in the interest of conservatives who believe in the magic of markets to make this system work,"" wrote Norm Ornstein, a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. ""If it can be demonstrated that real competition in a real marketplace offers good services at lower overall costs, that adds powerful ammunition to the case for free markets. Let’s face it: The unrelenting opposition to all parts of the law ... is far more about Barack Obama than it is about the structure and nature of the Affordable Care Act."""
http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate/2013/12/23/2014-another-election-about-obamacare/,2013-12-23 00:00:00,"['Bill Schneider', 'Posted Azreb', 'Posted Pjkesq', 'Posted Factcorrect']",2014: Another election about Obamacare,"Here we go again.

2014 will be the third election in a row in which Obamacare is the central issue. The Affordable Care Act, which President Barack Obama signed into law in March 2010, contributed to a fierce voter backlash against Democrats in November 2010. After the Supreme Court upheld the law in June 2012, the issue seemed to be settled by Obama’s re-election that November.

But no.

The botched Obamacare rollout this year has again thrust the issue to the top of the political agenda. Republicans are counting on opposition to Obamacare to propel them to a majority in the Senate next year. A conservative group is already running an ad attacking Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) for supporting Obamacare: “Next November, if you like your senator, you can keep her. If you don’t, you know what to do.”

2013 came to a close with two big political stories. The government shutdown in October was immensely damaging to Republicans. So damaging that House Republicans defied their conservative base and voted for a compromise budget deal last week. Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) attacked the Tea Party, accusing them of pushing congressional Republicans “into this fight to defund Obamacare and shut down the government.” A fight Boehner said all along was unwinnable.

The message was, “No more shutdowns.” Republicans didn’t want to step on the second big political story, one immensely damaging to Democrats: the rollout of Obamacare.

While both parties were damaged by the year-end stories, the headline in the Washington Post last week was, “Obama suffers most from year of turmoil, poll finds.” The Democrats’ Obamacare disaster trumped the Republicans’ shutdown disaster.

The problems with Obamacare are likely to continue into 2014. The problem is that the young and the healthy are not signing up in anything close to the numbers needed to subsidize insurance coverage for the old and the sick. The incentives are not strong enough. Young people are convinced they are immortal. They don’t expect to get sick. Or to have a car crash — the leading health risk for young people.

The law says they have to spend $100 or $200 a month for health insurance or else pay a fine. How much is the fine? For the first year, $95. When do they have to pay it? In April 2015. Which sounds to them like the distant future.

Many young people will be willing to risk the fine and use the insurance money to buy a car. Or go to Cancun and party their brains out.

The New York Times and CBS News just polled uninsured Americans and found them highly skeptical of the Affordable Care Act. Among the uninsured, 53 percent say they disapprove of the new law. The poll found about the same disapproval among the insured (51 percent). Only a third of the uninsured believe the new law will actually help them.

There’s another problem. Many small businesses are being allowed to extend their employees’ current health insurance plans through next year. In October 2014 — a month before the election — insurance companies will notify those employers of the new premiums they will have to pay under Obamacare. In many cases, those premiums will go up. Way up. They may have gone up even without Obamacare, but any rate increases will be blamed on Obamacare. As one expert put it to Politico, “You own all the changes when you put in new rules.”

The Affordable Care Act does require more comprehensive coverage than many small business plans now provide. Companies that have younger and healthier workers will have to share the cost of covering firms with an older workforce. The Obama administration promised that the vast majority of workers with employer-based insurance would not be affected. That is almost certainly true. But the minority who see their premiums shoot up next year will complain. Loudly.

It’s the same thing that happened with people who had their individual policies canceled this year because they did not meet the Obamacare standards. Those people claimed they were betrayed because of Obama’s 2010 pledge, “If you like your insurance plan, you will keep it.”

“The way I put that forward unequivocally,” the president acknowledged last month, “ended up not being accurate.”

Very few Americans actually faced cancellations — because very few Americans purchase individual coverage. But those who were affected complained. Loudly. And those complaints made a powerful impression on the larger electorate.

Millions of Americans are benefiting from Obamacare. They are getting health insurance they could never get before. The working poor in many states are becoming eligible for the expanded Medicaid program. A lot of people, particularly women and older Americans, will see their coverage expanded and their premiums go down.

They are not being heard from, however. In the Times-CBS poll, only a third of the uninsured said that, when they evaluate their member of Congress, his or her position on Obamacare “will matter a lot.”

The Democrats’ challenge is to rally people who are being helped. That will not be an easy task. Satisfied people rarely make a lot of noise in politics — unless they feel threatened. The Democrats’ task in 2014 will be to dramatize the threat that a Republican Congress would pose to Obamacare.

The Affordable Care Act was passed nearly four years ago. But the struggle is still far from over.

Greg Sargent:

* With Healthcare.gov on its legs, the next big question is whether the administration can sell recalcitrant Republican states on Medicaid expansion. They’ve even got a conservative-compromise, in the form of letting very poor buy private insurance on the exchanges rather than folding them into Medicaid proper.

* Paul Krugman suggests what must never be suggested: Republicans could be badly overestimating the strength of their anti-Obamacare political strategy going into 2014.

In 1969-70, my first year in Washington, George McGovern memorably took to the Senate floor to reflect on his colleagues' culpability in the Vietnam War. He said, ""The walls of this chamber reek with blood,"" drawing a collective gasp from those on the floor and in the galleries. You weren't supposed to talk that way in the Senate. A week or so later, Bob Dole, then a freshman senator, took to the floor and ripped the bark off of McGovern for his apostasy.

But sometime later in the year, I saw McGovern and Dole walking arm in arm in the Old Senate Office Building. They forged a relationship that blossomed into a 40-year-plus friendship, based on their common interest in dealing with food issues. Dole, representing his Kansas farmers, embraced the food-stamp program on their behalf, a way to deal with farm surpluses. McGovern, with a deep passion to alleviate hunger in America, embraced a system of price supports that gave money to agribusinesses for not planting crops as a way to fund the food-stamp program.

Their alliance reflected a more than five-decade relationship between rural and urban lawmakers that made farm bills possible, a kind of model for how Congress, through compromises and trade-offs, can find majorities for legislation that primarily benefits minorities or narrower interests."

House GOP leaders voted early Sunday to delay implementation of Obamacare for one year

Senate Democrats and President Obama oppose any attempt to dismantle the law

The government will shutdown on Tuesday if no stopgap spending bill is enacted

WASHINGTON — Congress moved the nation closer to a government shutdown on Tuesday as House Republicans voted early Sunday 231-192 to advance a stopgap spending measure to delay implementation of President Obama's health care law for one year.

""We will do our job and send this bill over, and then it's up to the Senate to pass it and stop a government shutdown,"" House GOP leaders said in a joint statement.

The House voted just past midnight ET to send the bill back to the Senate following a day of vigorous debate over the Affordable Care Act, which begins open enrollment on Tuesday.

House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Md., countered that the public had litigated the health care law in 2012 with the re-election of Obama and accused Republicans of ""rampant irresponsibility"" that increased the prospects of an Oct. 1 shutdown.

""By the way, we won this debate in the election,"" Hoyer said on the House floor, ""But (Republicans) refuse to accept the results of the election.""

The House also voted 248-174 to repeal a 2.3% tax on medical devices enacted to help pay for implementation of the law.

The House then voted unanimously on a separate measure to ensure that the U.S. military continues to get paid if the government shuts down. Because no annual spending bills have been enacted, a shutdown would stop the flow of paychecks to troops.

Members of Congress, however, would continue to be paid if a shutdown occurs.

But the House GOP amendments affecting the Affordable Care Act face certain defeat in the Senate, where Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., said he will not support any bill that dismantles the law. Obama also said he would veto any such bill in the unlikely event it reaches his desk.

In a statement, Reid called the House's action ""pointless"" and reiterated that the Senate will reject the GOP's latest version of the stopgap bill.

""After weeks of futile political games from Republicans, we are still at square one: Republicans must decide whether to pass the Senate's clean (bill), or force a Republican government shutdown,"" Reid said.

White House spokesman Jay Carney called the plan ""reckless and irresponsible"" and said, ""Any member of the Republican Party who votes for this bill is voting for a shutdown.""

The House also voted to extend the length of the funding resolution by one month from Nov. 15 to Dec. 15, and included a controversial ""conscience clause"" that would delay a requirement under the health care law that employers provide health insurance that covers contraceptives for women.

House Republicans expressed confidence that the latest strategy could hold more promise in the Senate than their original effort to defund the health care law. ""I think there are some senators over there who may be in cycle that secretly want a one-year delay and we just got to find the right mix that enables them to justify that vote,"" said Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C.

However, during Senate votes this week, all 54 Senate Democrats stuck together to strip out language defunding the law. Republicans would need 14 Senate Democrats to break party ranks to side with all 46 Senate Republicans, and there is no indication those votes exist. Even if they did, the president has said he would veto any legislation to undermine the law.

House Republicans' maneuvering is unlikely to force the tough political votes on Senate Democrats they are seeking. Reid can use Senate procedures to table the two amendments in one vote, requiring only a 51-vote majority, on Monday. If that occurs — as expected — the stopgap bill remains in the House, increasing pressure on Boehner to allow an up-or-down vote on the floor to avoid the shutdown.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has said Democrats stand ready to provide votes to help moderate Republicans pass the Senate-passed stopgap bill. However, Boehner would likely lose most of his lawmakers and faces internal party pressures to hold firm against the health care law.

Reid warned Republicans that the only way to avoid a shutdown was to approve the Senate bill. ""This is it. Time is gone. Our rules are different than the House,"" he said Friday. The Senate is not in session this weekend.

""We're getting closer to a shutdown, but if the Senate acts as quick as it's capable we can avoid that. Let's see what they send back to us,"" said Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., on Saturday. ""We're working the process the way we're supposed to work it.""

Further fueling fears of a shutdown was Reid's acknowledgment that House and Senate leaders are not communicating. In previous budget clashes, behind-the-scenes negotiations were underway. ""We've made it very clear that the only way to solve this problem is just accept what we've done, just accept it,"" he said.

Boehner's office said Friday that they had not heard from Obama all week.

Most of the public would not feel the effects of a shutdown immediately. Government operations considered essential, like mail delivery, air-traffic control and Social Security and Medicare, would continue unabated, but national parks and museums would close. Certain government employees would not get paid, but they would receive back pay when the government reopens. A short-term shutdown is unlikely to cause much long-term economic damage unless it drags on longer.

House Republicans are also working separately to put together a legislative package tied to an impending vote to raise the debt ceiling, the nation's borrowing limit, that will hit Oct. 17, according to Treasury Secretary Jack Lew. The bill would suspend the debt ceiling through the 2014 elections in exchange for a one-year delay of implementation of the health care law and instructions on how to overhaul the federal tax code without raising additional revenue.

The package includes a grab bag of perennially popular GOP legislation that is unpalatable to Democrats, such as construction of a new oil pipeline from Canada to Texas, and increasing means testing for Medicaid recipients.

The package has also divided House Republicans for a number of reasons, forcing leaders to delay initial plans to vote on the package this weekend. Many lawmakers want to resolve the stopgap spending bill first, while others are concerned that the package does not include enough long-term deficit reduction.

Obama has maintained that he will veto any legislation that seeks to delay or defund his signature domestic achievement, and Democrats have vowed not to negotiate over the debt ceiling. There is no precedent for a U.S. debt limit default, but there is consensus that it could have sweeping, negative consequences for the U.S. economy."

Negotiators talked into the evening as senators from both parties coalesced around a plan that would lift the debt limit through Feb. 7, pass a resolution to finance the government through Jan. 15 and conclude formal discussions on a long-term tax and spending plan no later than Dec. 13, according to one Senate aide briefed on the plan.

But while both Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, and Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, praised the progress that was made in the Senate, it was already clear that the most conservative members of the House were not going to go along quietly with a plan that does not accomplish their goal from the outset of this two-week-old crisis: dismantling the president’s health care law.

“We’ve got a name for it in the House: it’s called the Senate surrender caucus,” said Representative Tim Huelskamp, Republican of Kansas. “Anybody who would vote for that in the House as Republican would virtually guarantee a primary challenger.”"

Those odds increase given he lives in Breathitt County

This , in Kentucky, sent shivers up the GOP's spine:This interview took place in Breathitt County, solid Red territory:Odds are that Hudson, a male, was a Republican.. The fact that he is white almost guarantees it (in 2008, just 34 percent of white Kentucky males voted for Obama, and Obama lost ground in the state in 2012). And his sentence formulation, ""I'm going to be"" clinches it.

Thus, we have the perfect illustration of why Republicans have fought Obamacare every step of the way, and are still working to sabotage it: A rural southern white male is openly talking about becoming a Democrat. Why? Because Democrats have now made his life a little better.

Republicans could've shared in the credit by working with Democrats to pass what was their Heritage-designed plan. Instead, they've staked their entire existence on its defeat. Thus, Hudson will have a stark choice in 2014: Vote for Mitch McConnell, who wants to take away his health security just as he finally gets it, or for Alison Lundergan Grimes, who won't (no matter how squishy she might currently be on the issue).

And if the GOP's last bastion of support starts liking the law, and as a result, Democrats, just imagine what might happen amongst more swingy demographics. What about married women, who lean GOP, but might suddenly see their families insured? What about Republican-leaning Gen-Xers hitting middle-age, were health issues become more prominent in their lives?

The fight for Obamacare has become an existentialist crisis for the GOP. And Ronald Hudson in Breathitt County, Kentucky, is turning that nightmare into reality.

Update: As pointed out in the comments, Breathitt County goes Democratic when there isn't an Obama on the ballot. Even in the 2010 GOP wave, Jack Conway won the county over Rand Paul. That doesn't change the gist of this post."
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/07/tea-party-obamacare_n_3719124.html,2013-08-07 00:00:00,['Senior Congressional Reporter'],"Tea Party's Obamacare Threat Could Harm GOP Election Chances, Republicans Warn","WASHINGTON -- Long-serving Republicans aren't engaged in an increasingly public smackdown of their tea party colleagues because they disagree with them -- it's more that they don't want a few hotheads to blow their party's best chance in years to retake control of the United States Senate.

Several tea party-powered senators have laid down a gauntlet of late, saying the GOP should refuse to pass a bill to fund the government in September unless all funding for the implementation of the health care reform law is cut.

It's a message -- championed by Sens. Mike Lee (R-Utah), Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) -- that appeals to the enthusiasms of a population that united against Obamacare under the banner of Taxed Enough Already in 2009, a year in which federal taxes actually hit historic lows.

Cruz has argued that united Republicans could force President Barack Obama and the Democratic-controlled Senate to accept a government-funding measure that essentially ends Obama's marquee achievement, the Affordable Care Act.

""I believe that if Republicans stand together, this is a fight we can win,"" Cruz told reporters last week. ""It represents our best opportunity to actually defund Obamacare, and potentially our last good opportunity to do so,"" he said, arguing that although his side doesn't have the votes now, that can change over the August break.

But more senior members of the GOP caucus -- most prominently Sens. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.), John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Richard Burr (R-N.C.) -- have said they see the idea as ill-conceived and unreasonable. In an unexpected twist, the veteran lawmakers who are not exactly known for being voices of moderation are appealing for a more deliberate approach. They worry that most of the nation simply is not ready to shutter the government just to hamstring Obamacare. And in interviews as Congress was getting ready to ready to adjourn until September, McCain, Coburn and other Republican leaders said that while they believe the health care law will be the train wreck the GOP is forecasting, following the path of Cruz, Lee and Rubio could produce a more immediate derailment -- of the GOP's electoral chances in 2014.

""I'm not sure why we should advocate for something that's absolutely impossible. The only way Obamacare is going to be repealed is with a 60-vote Republican Senate, and then, in order to override a presidential veto, I think it's 67 votes,"" McCain said. ""I haven't seen an attempt to override a veto in a long time. It's a non-starter.""

And a political land mine, he added.

""Those of us who have been around for a while know what happens when there's the threat of a shutdown of the government: It's the Congress that gets blamed,"" McCain said. ""If the minority uses its strength, its 41 votes [to filibuster government funding], then clearly the American people will blame the Congress. And they do -- that's the history. And those who say that's not the case ignore the lessons of history and the realities of American politics.""

One of those who remembers the history is Coburn, who was first elected as a member of the House in the Republican revolution of 1994 -- before the last time the GOP shut down the government under then-Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) in 1995 and 1996.

Coburn suggested that even then, when Republicans were more unified around the idea of a shutdown, they were not really all that committed to it -- making their efforts doomed to fail.

""Here's what I know. I saw the lack of us holding what we said was our strategy, and ultimately losing 9 seats in the House when we should have won 22, and being less effective in the long-run because we didn't hold onto our strategy,"" Coburn told The Huffington Post.

""The difference is you had the vast majority of Republicans wanting to do that. You don't have the vast majority of Republicans wanting to do that now. So if you could do it, you'd hold for even less time. So what you'd do is say, 'Yes, the government's shut down.' And the first time the pressure gets up with people not really sold on the strategy, they'll bail on you,"" he said.

""The only way that strategy works is if you're going to take the hostage and shoot it. Which means you're never going to open the government back up until Obama says uncle,"" Coburn said, arguing that there's no way a filibuster-strong 40 members of the GOP caucus would be willing to halt Social Security checks, mail delivery, passport services, construction work and the myriad other things constituents expect from the government in hopes of making Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) blink. ""What is the likelihood of that? And what is the probability that members of the Senate will hold on that? It's about zero.""

GOP strategists who lived through the Gingrich debacle are also keenly aware of the downsides.

""Shutting down the government never works at the end of the day,"" said longtime GOP consultant Ed Rollins, who rose to prominence under Ronald Reagan and most recently served a brief stint running Rep. Michele Bachmann's (R-Minn.) 2012 presidential campaign. ""Even though we shut it down last time, it helped the president [Bill Clinton] win reelection.""

Another strategist, former National Republican Senatorial Committee communications director Brian Walsh, said he found the tea party senators' push especially ill-timed because the GOP, he feels, is already scoring significant points by spotlighting and magnifying every new problem with the rollout of the health care law.

Having the tea party heroes launch a holy war against fellow Republicans over their alleged insufficient purity on Obamacare is just about as welcome as a bruising primary challenge, Walsh said.

""The frustrating part is politically we are on offense,"" Walsh said. ""You're seeing stories in a lot places about companies pulling out of the [Obamacare] markets, and small businesses cutting workers' hours. You're seeing all these stories about problems with the Obamacare implementation … So it's a little frustrating that instead of that being the focus, instead of keeping the Democrats on defense, there's a section of the party that would rather engage in fratricide.""

Walsh is an especially acute observer in this case because it was during his stint at the NRSC that Republicans failed to retake the Senate, largely thanks to stumbles from tea party candidates such as Christine O'Donnell in Delaware in 2010 and Nevada's Sharron Angle that same year. Last year featured failures by Richard Mourdoch in Indiana and Todd Akin in Missouri. They all triumphed over more mainstream candidates in primaries, but alienated too many voters in the general elections, even in red states.

""Conservatively, the party gave away five seats in those years,"" Walsh said.

Coburn probably would not agree that anyone lost by being too conservative. He's proud of his own right-wing philosophy, and suggests that some of today's younger firebrands might not do as well holding on to core conservative values amid the compromises and temptations of Washington.

""We'll see after 10 years if they still have a 99 [American Conservative Union] rating,"" Coburn said.

What Coburn worries about is his newer colleagues making dumb promises.

""If your strategy is to hold government funding hostage to defund Obamacare, the [Congressional Research Service] says as you do that, guess what's going to happen? Funding for Obamacare is going to continue,"" Coburn said, referring to a report by the nonpartisan CRS that explained most of the funding for the health care law is mandatory and not subject to Congress' annual appropriations battles. ""So it tells you the problem with the strategy.""

And of course, there are the electoral consequences.

""The other thing that's dangerous in it, is that you create the expectation in our base that you can do something that is absolutely not achievable. It may be achievable for two weeks or three weeks, but if your ultimate goal is to defund it, and you have a president and a Senate controlled by Democrats, and a thin majority in the House, the strategy doesn't work,"" Coburn said.

""If you pump the base up and say here's something we can do when in fact you can't, but they believe you could have done it, and then you don't do it -- I think it keeps a lot of people at home, because they say, 'Gosh, the Republicans wouldn't stand again,'"" he said.

Nevertheless, Cruz and Co. have embarked on a drive -- including an online petition that's racked up more than 250,000 signers -- to promote their shutdown showdown all through August, hoping to galvanize the same sort of 2009 outpouring that handed the GOP control of the House of Representatives the next year, and to pressure their colleagues into standing with them.

""I for one, and I know my colleagues as well, are not prepared to go home and tell people, ‘Well, we tried, but we couldn’t,’"" Rubio said in announcing the push last week. ""We have to go home and say, 'We did everything we could. We took every step available to us.' And that's why this is such an important issue.""

But McCain noted that a letter they circulated before the break was actually losing support. Indeed, one of the senators listed as uncommitted in the online petition, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, echoed her more conservative colleagues in slamming the shutdown threat.

""Let's be realistic. Obamacare, a law that I strongly oppose, is not going to be repealed. So the effect of trying to repeal the funding of government inevitably leads to a government shutdown, which I do not believe is good policy or good politics,"" Collins said. ""The American people want common-sense solutions. They don't want us to pursue policies that are pointless, that are going to end in government shutting down, more partisanship, more gridlock. They want us to actually get things done.""

Walsh argued that the dissidents should take a page from the conservative playbook of four years ago. ""When you look at 2009, the tea party ire was focused appropriately on Obamacare, and now you see some of that focused on the Republican Party,"" Walsh said, adding that the government shutdown threat is taking the GOP ""off message.""

Particularly confounding to him was the fundamental irrationality in a push that casts some of the opponents of the Cruz-Lee-Rubio effort -- who also include Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) -- as not real conservatives.

""When you're suggesting that anyone like Tom Coburn is less than conservative, you better look in the mirror,"" Walsh said.

The older Republicans did not disparage the motives of their younger brethren, but at least three of them -- Cruz, Rubio, and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) -- have openly flirted with a 2016 GOP presidential bid, which could benefit from tea party support. And the inboxes of just about anyone paying attention to the conservative movement has seen the steady stream lately of praise for the effort from groups like the Tea Party Express, as well as fundraising appeals.

Still, political veterans thought the hotshots would be wise to cool it, at least a little.

""Ted Cruz hasn't even been here two years, and he's got a bright, long future in the party,"" said Rollins. ""But he should be a little patient. You need make sure that whatever your goal is, it's something you can achieve. And you can't achieve this.""

In certain corners of the foreign policy community, two theories in particular have developed. The first is that U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice was promised the position of secretary of state only to have it taken away under the weight of Republican opposition. The second is that Obama never actually considered Rice for the post, instead, having her name floated to divert fire for his preferred choice, Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.).

The former theory is regarded as more plausible than the latter. But the latter still has its believers. Stephen Schlesinger, a fellow at the Century Foundation, pushed the theory in a blog post published on The Huffington Post on Tuesday arguing that former senior Obama adviser David Axelrod admitted that Rice was never considered during a recent interview on MSNBC's Morning Joe.

It is possible that Axelrod saw his remarks as a way to protect the president from any lingering criticism over his handling of the Rice issue. There had, after all, been some undercurrent of discontent among women's groups who were upset over Rice's public humiliation. Also, the very visible scuttling of Rice did suggest to many observers that, despite Obama's reelection, Obama was once again showing how he caves into Republicans under a barrage of partisan attacks.

But Axelrod never actually said that Obama didn't consider Rice for Foggy Bottom; in fact, in interviews during the process and as recently as today, he has said that Rice was very much in the mix. As he recounts, Obama surveyed a number of possible candidates, including Rice. He never came to a decision on who to appoint until he ultimately chose Kerry. The attacks on the U.N. ambassador over her role in disseminating talking points about the consulate attack in Benghazi factored into the administration's thinking. But they weren't disqualifying. If anything, Axelrod said, they made the president more sympathetic towards choosing her.

""There is a myth that has grown up that the president was run off from choosing her,"" Axelrod told The Huffington Post Tuesday. ""That just wasn't true. She was highly regarded and considered for the post.""

""So far as my conversations with him and everything I know, he had never made a decision on that particular appointment and it is a misstatement of history to suggest he had chosen her or never considered her,"" he added. ""Kerry always was a strong candidate for that position.""

In fact, many of those in the opposing Obamacare opposed it because it did not go far enough. It was not Medicare for all (single payer) nor did it have a public option. Corporate interest won the first round but they will lose the war and they know it. It is for this reason that the GOP continues to fight the battle against Obamacare just hoping that just maybe they can break it before metastasis.

When one is born, one does not choose gender, genetic makeup, or predisposition to any particular disease. As a mostly free society we do not dictate what foods people can eat, what “legal” vices they may indulge in, or whether they should be sedentary or active. We know that the vast majority will at some time get sick. Moreover, we know that some that live a very responsible and a healthy life will get sick often and some that live a rather unhealthy and irresponsible life will rarely get sick. Of course the converse is also true. My father cycled 10 miles frequently, walked 2 to 5 miles every day, ate well, got his annual exams and suddenly died of a heart attack at 77. My mother-in-law continues to eat badly, does no exercise, had a quadruple bypass and many other surgeries and thankfully remains with us.

As a civil and moral society we the people create institutions to do things that are done better together than as individuals. We don’t each build a piece of road in front of our homes or independent paths to a grocery store. Because roads, schools, national defense, satellites, etc. are of utmost importance to our continued existence, we the people collectively finance it. They are not free. We all pay towards it because individually it is impossible or unduly burdensome.

How can we not look at health insurance in that same light? How could we have sold our health and financial well-being to be traded like a commodity? You cannot be pro-life and support a health insurance system that discriminates by gender, pre-existing condition, or some other metric. Doing so is the potential abortion of a born human life.

This Thanksgiving, she and her family sat down to explore their options in the new insurance marketplace. After about 45 minutes online, they selected a midlevel, or silver, plan that would cost the family about $30 a month, after tax-credit subsidies based on income.

“We were shocked,” Ms. He said. “I actually called a few places to verify that.” [...]

At 61 years old, Bruce Kleinschmidt, a lawyer who is mostly retired, has no illusions about whether he needs health insurance. He has a chronic sinus condition that has required three operations, including one last year, and has had a few serious accidents over the years, including a fall that required back surgery. Doctors also recently diagnosed a heart condition. [...]

“I have been declined before,” he said.

The coverage available through the state high-risk pools for people like him, Mr. Kleinschmidt said, typically have “extraordinarily high premiums with really high deductibles.” On the state’s new online exchange, he was able to select a plan from a well-known insurer that came with a deductible of only $1,000.

“It’s a godsend,” he said. [...]

Tasha Huebner, 45, had long wanted to leave Chicago, but one of the biggest roadblocks was the fear of losing her health insurance. Ms. Huebner learned that she had breast cancer five years ago and, given her costly medical history, knew the chances of a new insurer accepting her were slim.

So when she finally sold her house and moved to Silverton, Ore., this year, she did so knowing that the new health care law would soon make it much easier for people like her to get coverage. Under the law, insurers cannot turn away people with existing medical conditions, nor charge them more for coverage. [...]

So she turned to the new exchange after it opened on Oct. 1. Oregon’s online marketplace has not worked properly, but Ms. Huebner figured out that a midlevel plan would cost her about $300 a month — within her budget. If she qualifies for subsidies — which is uncertain, given her unpredictable income —her bill may drop to about $150, she said. She applied through the mail and is awaiting approval.

Ms. Huebner said she is in good health and is training for two half-marathons. But she needs annual mammograms and checkups with an oncologist, and she lives with the knowledge that her cancer could return.

“I’m young,” she said. “The chances are that it will come back.”

For that reason, she said, being able to afford health insurance is “just a huge, huge relief.”"

http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate/2013/12/23/2014-another-election-about-obamacare/,2013-12-23 00:00:00,"['Bill Schneider', 'Posted Azreb', 'Posted Pjkesq', 'Posted Factcorrect']",2014: Another election about Obamacare,"Here we go again.

2014 will be the third election in a row in which Obamacare is the central issue. The Affordable Care Act, which President Barack Obama signed into law in March 2010, contributed to a fierce voter backlash against Democrats in November 2010. After the Supreme Court upheld the law in June 2012, the issue seemed to be settled by Obama’s re-election that November.

But no.

The botched Obamacare rollout this year has again thrust the issue to the top of the political agenda. Republicans are counting on opposition to Obamacare to propel them to a majority in the Senate next year. A conservative group is already running an ad attacking Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) for supporting Obamacare: “Next November, if you like your senator, you can keep her. If you don’t, you know what to do.”

2013 came to a close with two big political stories. The government shutdown in October was immensely damaging to Republicans. So damaging that House Republicans defied their conservative base and voted for a compromise budget deal last week. Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) attacked the Tea Party, accusing them of pushing congressional Republicans “into this fight to defund Obamacare and shut down the government.” A fight Boehner said all along was unwinnable.

The message was, “No more shutdowns.” Republicans didn’t want to step on the second big political story, one immensely damaging to Democrats: the rollout of Obamacare.

While both parties were damaged by the year-end stories, the headline in the Washington Post last week was, “Obama suffers most from year of turmoil, poll finds.” The Democrats’ Obamacare disaster trumped the Republicans’ shutdown disaster.

The problems with Obamacare are likely to continue into 2014. The problem is that the young and the healthy are not signing up in anything close to the numbers needed to subsidize insurance coverage for the old and the sick. The incentives are not strong enough. Young people are convinced they are immortal. They don’t expect to get sick. Or to have a car crash — the leading health risk for young people.

The law says they have to spend $100 or $200 a month for health insurance or else pay a fine. How much is the fine? For the first year, $95. When do they have to pay it? In April 2015. Which sounds to them like the distant future.

Many young people will be willing to risk the fine and use the insurance money to buy a car. Or go to Cancun and party their brains out.

The New York Times and CBS News just polled uninsured Americans and found them highly skeptical of the Affordable Care Act. Among the uninsured, 53 percent say they disapprove of the new law. The poll found about the same disapproval among the insured (51 percent). Only a third of the uninsured believe the new law will actually help them.

There’s another problem. Many small businesses are being allowed to extend their employees’ current health insurance plans through next year. In October 2014 — a month before the election — insurance companies will notify those employers of the new premiums they will have to pay under Obamacare. In many cases, those premiums will go up. Way up. They may have gone up even without Obamacare, but any rate increases will be blamed on Obamacare. As one expert put it to Politico, “You own all the changes when you put in new rules.”

The Affordable Care Act does require more comprehensive coverage than many small business plans now provide. Companies that have younger and healthier workers will have to share the cost of covering firms with an older workforce. The Obama administration promised that the vast majority of workers with employer-based insurance would not be affected. That is almost certainly true. But the minority who see their premiums shoot up next year will complain. Loudly.

It’s the same thing that happened with people who had their individual policies canceled this year because they did not meet the Obamacare standards. Those people claimed they were betrayed because of Obama’s 2010 pledge, “If you like your insurance plan, you will keep it.”

“The way I put that forward unequivocally,” the president acknowledged last month, “ended up not being accurate.”

Very few Americans actually faced cancellations — because very few Americans purchase individual coverage. But those who were affected complained. Loudly. And those complaints made a powerful impression on the larger electorate.

Millions of Americans are benefiting from Obamacare. They are getting health insurance they could never get before. The working poor in many states are becoming eligible for the expanded Medicaid program. A lot of people, particularly women and older Americans, will see their coverage expanded and their premiums go down.

They are not being heard from, however. In the Times-CBS poll, only a third of the uninsured said that, when they evaluate their member of Congress, his or her position on Obamacare “will matter a lot.”

The Democrats’ challenge is to rally people who are being helped. That will not be an easy task. Satisfied people rarely make a lot of noise in politics — unless they feel threatened. The Democrats’ task in 2014 will be to dramatize the threat that a Republican Congress would pose to Obamacare.

The Affordable Care Act was passed nearly four years ago. But the struggle is still far from over.

http://firstread.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/07/01/19232711-rising-texas-political-star-davis-takes-second-look-at-governors-race,2013-07-01 00:00:00,"[""Michael O'Brien"", 'Political Reporter', 'Nbc News']",Rising Texas political star Davis takes second look at governor's race,"It's been a sharp, quick ascent into national prominence for Wendy Davis, the Democratic state senator whose 13-hour filibuster against a restrictive Texas abortion law made her an instant heroine to progressives across the country – and a rising star in Texas politics.

Her activism has reignited the conversation about her political future which could include a run for governor. ""Of course it forces a second look, but I am not taking that look right now,"" Davis said in an interview with NBC News. ""Right now, I'm working to try to be very strategic, and a member of the team that has to work very hard in the next few weeks to defeat this bill.""

But asked directly whether she would rule out serving as Democrats' candidate for governor in 2014, Davis responded: ""I cannot rule that out.""

Davis's story is now well-known: the former single-mother-turned-Harvard-Law-grad stood and spoke for hours on end in opposition to a law that would effectively ban most abortions in Texas after the 20th week of pregnancy, and shutter most of the clinics in the state where abortions are performed. Her speech felled the abortion bill after the deadline by which it must have been passed expired.

That fight is about to escalate beginning on Monday, when a special session called by Texas Gov. Rick Perry, R, meets in Austin to work toward reconsidering and passing that abortion law. And all eyes will watching to see how Davis — who has emerged not just as a chief adversary to Perry, but also as a rising national Democratic star — proceeds.

""What I can say is, I don't underestimate at all the power that people have brought to this conversation,"" she told NBC News in a phone interview. ""And I will not underestimate the impact that they can have in the Capitol. And I expect they're going to be there, working hard alongside people who share their values.""

The Texas proposal, which is tentatively slated for a final vote in the state Senate next week, is likely to pass this time. Republicans in the legislature will not repeat their mistake of leaving the abortion law until the final moments of their session, the deadline which Davis used to fell the law with her filibuster. (Davis did suggest, though, that she has heard ""rumblings"" that some state lawmakers might reconsider their votes given the national attention to the debate now.)

Perhaps more significantly, the coming weeks might set the stage for a marquee showdown between Davis and Perry — who is yet to say whether he'll seek a fourth term as governor — in the 2014 governor's race.

Though Davis had previously said she planned to run for re-election to her state Senate seat, she acknowledged on Sunday that the national outpouring she's received has forced her to reconsider a showdown against Perry, or another Republican candidate.

If she were to run, Davis would be riding a wave of liberal enthusiasm behind her candidacy. Progressive blogs quickly hailed her filibuster with hopes that she would run, and heavyweight Democratic groups like the pro-abortion rights Emily's List have encouraged Davis to run in the past.

Davis said that in the days since the June 25 filibuster, she has been inundated with calls from support from fellow Democrats. Governors and senators have called with their well-wishes, Davis said. And House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who tweeted in support of Davis during her filibuster, sent the state senator flowers the day afterward.

If Davis were to challenge Perry, it could result in a Texas-sized showdown that would upend Republican dominance in Texas. There is already a fair degree of rancor after Perry, speaking last week at the National Right to Life Convention, singled Davis out and, referring to her pregnancy as a teenager, said it was ""unfortunate that she hasn’t learned from her own example.""

A Republican strategist close to Perry dismissed the idea that Davis could threaten the three-term governor. Democrats have been shut out of statewide elected office since 1994.

""Wendy Davis is not a threat to any statewide office in Texas. She will be lucky to hold her own senate seat in 2014,"" the Republican said. (Davis's district is one of the few competitive ones in the Lone Star state, and could be redrawn by redistricting set to move forward after last week's Supreme Court decision about the Voting Rights Act.)

The Republican argued that few Texans of any political party share Davis's views about abortion. ""It's not a winning hand for a non presidential year turn out election,"" said the strategist.

Democrats are hopeful, though, that they can turn the tide with a prominent figurehead like Davis at the top of their ticket. Changing demographics in Texas — namely, the growth of the Latino population — has prompted some observers to argue that the state would become more competitive in future elections. And groups like The Lone Star Project have been working to rebuild the state party's aged infrastructure to help Democrats.

As to whether she thinks Perry is ultimately beatable in 2014, Davis demurred.

""I just can't predict that,"" she said. ""Is he vulnerable? Yes."""

Silver said he thought ""it was a good interview"" but that Harris and VandeHei often mischaracterize his central criticism of Politico. ""It's striking how preoccupied Harris and VandeHei are with the perception that Politico is too 'insidery,'"" Silver wrote. ""My personal critique of their work cuts a little deeper than that, however. It's not that they are too 'insidery' per se, but that the perceptions of Beltway insiders, which Politico echoes and embraces, are not always very insightful or accurate.

But parties generally don’t get to reformulate their appeal from scratch. While Republicans can’t win with their base alone, they also can’t win without it. Religious conservatives, for example, are the single largest constituency within the GOP, and compose about a quarter of the entire electorate. Such voters are not baggage thrown overboard to lighten the ship; they are planks in the hull.

While the [abortion] vote offered a chance for members from socially conservative districts to flex their political muscles, some moderate Republicans grumbled about the leadership’s decision to hold a vote on a controversial measure with no chance of going beyond the House. “I think a lot of people are shaking their heads and not understanding why we’re doing this,” said one GOP official, who added that votes on hot-button social issues don’t help the party maintain much-needed Republican seats in moderate districts.

Republican Rep. Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania bluntly told The New York Times that the vote is “a stupid idea.”

They can't read polls , either. If you read Politico during 2012, you might have thought Romney was in contention. Mike Gerson has some words of wisdom to share on the Republican Party:Read that, then read this from MSNBC Every election matters. See 2010. But this is an example of Gerson's playing to the base.

Bigger picture from Gallup:

Americans still rate the Republican Party less favorably than the Democratic Party, 39% vs. 46%. But both parties' ratings are down from November 2012. The Democrats' rating dropped more, from 51% just after President Barack Obama won re-election. Americans' ratings of the Democratic Party are now more on par with readings earlier in 2012, while their ratings of the GOP are the lowest since May 2010.

There’s some interesting sleight of hand here. Note that Boehner seems more focused on enforcement and border security than on citizenship. The Speaker is claiming that if a majority of House Republicans thinks the emerging proposal isn’t tough enough on border security, then the House won’t vote on it. But the real Rubicon House Republicans must cross is the path to citizenship. What happens if a majority of House Republicans can’t support the path to citizenship, no matter how tough the border security elements are made? In that scenario, if Boehner holds to his vow, the House wouldn’t vote on anything that includes citizenship, right? And that scenario very well may come to pass. Someone needs to ask the Speaker: If a majority of House Republicans can’t accept a path to citizenship, will you really not allow a House vote on any emerging proposal that contains one?

Democrats on the House Oversight Committee have just released a full transcript of testimony from a key witness in the investigation of IRS targeting of conservatives — and it appears to confirm that the initial targeting did originate with a low-level employee in the Cincinnati office.

It also shows a key witness and IRS screening manager – a self described conservative Republican — denying any communication with the White House or senior IRS officials about the targeting.

and Greg Sargent The IRS, like Benghazi, is a nothingburger used for partisan reasons by the GOP. That conclusion is based on a Congressional investigation, not reflexive. Good to look. We looked. Dismissed.

Even hardened cynics speak about the possibility of a brighter economic horizon and the prospective easing of international sanctions that have throttled growth, spurred inflation and fostered a general malaise.

“It’s not in my genes to vote,” Ismael, a tea hawker and chess devotee, said as he poured cups of steaming tea for bazaar denizens and tradesmen. “But I am confident of a better economic situation once sanctions are lifted.”

Ismael said he had become so discouraged by Islamic rule that a few years ago he took the radical step of converting to the ancient faith of Zoroastrianism, a switch that earned him a jail term.

Throughout Iran, enthusiasm appears robust for Rouhani, who swept to a surprising landslide victory in last month’s election with pledges of change and reform. The fact that he is a cleric and mainstay of the religious-political establishment not known for progressive views — and someone who isn’t considered an economic expert — doesn’t seem to have dimmed the fervor that erupted in street celebrations after his election was confirmed.

Many Iranians apparently are eager to get past the gloom and bluster that defined the eight-year administration of outgoing President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

Anticipation of recovery and a shift in tone are evident from the warrens of Tehran’s central bazaar to the capital’s stylish coffee bars to the gardens and historical sites in the ancient city of Shiraz to the south.

Ahmadinejad seemed to revel in polemical salvos, targeting both the West and his political adversaries at home, but Rouhani has adopted moderation and change as his motto.

Advertisement

“Iranians chose a new path,” the centrist said in his first official comments after his election. “Iranians voted for moderation and logic.”

Rouhani also has said that compromise with the international community about difficult issues, notably Iran’s controversial nuclear program, would not amount to capitulation.

“Moderation in foreign policy is neither surrender nor conflict, neither passivity nor confrontation,” he said. “Moderation is effective and constructive interaction with the world.”

At an artsy cafe in Tehran, young people disenchanted with what they view as the grim dominion of the mullahs seemed eager for a more open era.

“Maybe now the police won’t hassle us so much,” said Siavash, a long-haired guitarist in his 20s, strumming tunes like “Hotel California” and “Oh! Susanna” with a makeshift band as admiring young women hummed along. Like many Iranians interviewed recently, he wanted only his first name used, fearing potential reprisal.

Siavash and his friends were jamming on a shaded patch of grass across the street from the former U.S. Embassy, now a Revolutionary Guard Corps compound where graffiti on the exterior walls proclaim “Stomp on America!” The student-led seizure of the site in 1979 resulted in a 444-day hostage drama that still colors U.S.-Iranian relations.

Noticeably absent in the capital after Rouhani’s election were the much-resented morality police, who look askance at freewheeling public gatherings of young men and women.

About 500 miles to the south in Shiraz, at the lush gardens of the tomb of the revered Persian poet Saadi, a waiter named Ali despaired at the plight of Iran’s many well-educated people unable to find good jobs.

“Many young in this country cannot afford to get married,” said Ali, 30, who voted for Rouhani. He said he was hopeful of progress but not delusional. “We have been living on hope for 34 years,” he said, referring to the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

At Tehran’s highly choreographed Friday prayers, chants of “Death to America!” remain a constant. But many Iranians not connected with the government indicated that for many people, economic well-being has trumped reflexive hostility toward the West.

Even many who favored more conservative candidates voiced hope that the new president will break the stranglehold of sanctions, restore the value of Iran’s currency, help create jobs and rein in inflation.

“I didn’t vote for Rouhani, but I do believe he can do something about these soaring prices,” said Hossian, 28, a laborer and father of a young child who was reclining on lush carpets in the sprawling, air-conditioned mausoleum of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, founder of the revolution, whose immense shrine in the southern reaches of the capital is a pilgrimage site for revolutionary die-hards.

“I have to work hard just to make ends meet,” said Hossian, who was visiting from the industrial town of Gorgan, near the Caspian Sea.

Back at the rambling bazaar, Sina, 30, said the dearth of employment opportunities had led him to find work in one sector that seems to be flourishing: sanctions-busting. He said he helps import smuggled aircraft parts, one of many items in short supply because of international bans.

“I think Rouhani was brought to the scene to get the sanctions lifted,” said Sina, a slim man who was among the people working their side deals outside the bazaar’s entrance. “Otherwise the survival of the ruling establishment is jeopardized.”

But with hopes so high, Rouhani’s allies have hastened to emphasize that a chief of state can do only so much. Some fear a crisis of dashed expectations, especially since Rouhani’s efforts will be subject to veto from Iran’s hard-line supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the last word on foreign policy and security issues, such as Iran’s nuclear program.

Advertisement

Former reformist President Mohammad Khatami, whose election in 1997 ushered in a similar period of hope for reform, has already advised Iranians not to look for a quick turnaround in the nation’s economic predicament.

“Be cautious, there is no rush, do not expect too much,” Khatami, who helped engineer Rouhani’s victory, said last week in one of a number of public statements designed to tamp down expectations.

There are, of course, pessimists, like Parviz, 68, a chain-smoking artisan encountered in the doorway of his Tehran apartment building along a once-notorious street called Lazar-e-Nou, home to cabarets, cafes and all-night bars before the revolution and now a drab strip that houses mostly shops selling fixtures for lamps. Some shuttered movie houses still bear scorch marks from the arson attacks that militants carried out after the revolution.

“The ones in charge now are so entrenched they will never give up power,” said Parviz, who recalled the days when men and women held hands in public after evenings spent in the bistros and cinemas. “Look at the faces of the people: No one is smiling today.”

Rouhani appears to have noticed too.

“I assure you that the ideals of the Islamic Republic of Iran did not include the suppression of joy and jubilation,” he told an Iranian youth magazine.

In his first major postelection speech, he seemed to acknowledge that the dour style of top-heavy leadership had gone too far.

“Happiness,” he said, “is our people’s right.”

By KEN THOMAS and DONNA CASSATA, The Associated Press

WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama's plea to Congress for the go-ahead for military strikes against Syria is forcing ambitious Republicans weighing a White House bid to choose sides, as the party is bitterly divided over the U.S. role in foreign policy.

Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky remains unequivocal in his opposition, tangling with Secretary of State John Kerry on Tuesday over constitutional powers and the possibility that a U.S. attack will further destabilize the Mideast. The tea party favorite and leading anti-interventionist in the GOP sees only a downside to a U.S. attack.

""There's no sentiment in Kentucky, and the people up here are so out of touch,"" Paul told reporters on a conference call after a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing with Kerry and other national security officials. ""These senators who are going to vote for this, they need to go home and talk to their people or look at what their people are saying because people do not want to get involved in Syria and, despite what the people want, their senators are going to vote the opposite way, I have a bad feeling.""

Paul didn't rule out a Senate filibuster of a resolution authorizing the president to use military force.

""Whether there is an actual standing filibuster, I've got to check my shoes and see if I can hold my water,"" he said. ""We'll see. I haven't made a decision on that.""

Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, a fierce foe of Syrian President Bashar Assad, expressed frustration with the Obama administration's handling of Syria and skepticism about U.S. involvement.

""When America ignores these problems, these problems don't ignore us,"" Rubio told senior administration officials at the Senate hearing. ""Yes, this is a horrible incident where perhaps 1,000 people died, but before this incident 100,000 people had died ... and nothing happened.""

The administration says it has proof that the Assad regime used deadly chemical weapons in an attack on Damascus suburbs and must respond. It places the number killed at 1,429 people, including 426 children. However, the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights puts the death toll at 502.

Potential Republican presidential candidates hardly want to appear weak on national security, an issue that traditionally has been a strength for the GOP. But no one knows whether the United States would be drawn into a protracted conflict or if limited military steps would prove unsuccessful in the 2-year-old civil war.

Any Republican who supports the use of force resolution essentially will be siding with Obama, who is despised in conservative circles, and a vote in favor could anger more isolationist Republicans who are wary of getting involved in another military conflict after more than a decade of fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan.

The votes could dog Republican candidates with voters in early primary states such as Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. Even the most nuanced explanation for a vote could be undermined by events on the ground.

Yet if Republicans oppose the resolution, they could be accused of giving Assad a pass after his regime used chemical weapons.

Republican strategist Steve Schmidt, who managed Sen. John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign, said a vote in favor of the resolution would be the equivalent of ""a purchase of stock over the long term in Obama's decision-making on Syria.""

""Any Republican may go into a vote thinking, `I have given authority for a limited scope of action to the president,' but the reality is you're buying stock in the president's current decisions on Syria and also his future actions in any escalation that may occur,"" Schmidt said.

Polls show public opposition to U.S. military intervention in Syria, regardless of whether Syria's government used chemical weapons on its people, and doubts about airstrikes across party lines.

A war vote can make or break a candidate. Just ask Hillary Rodham Clinton.

In the 2008 Democratic primary, Obama used the October 2002 vote for the Iraq war as a cudgel against Clinton, who along with John Edwards voted to give President George W. Bush the broad authority to invade Iraq. Edwards said his vote was a mistake; Clinton stood by her decision - and never recovered with strong anti-war Democratic voters.

Clinton, a potential Democratic candidate in 2016, has not spoken publicly about Obama's attempt to win congressional support for a military strike against Syria. But an aide to Clinton said Tuesday that she supports the president's effort in Congress to pursue a targeted response to the Assad regime's alleged use of chemical weapons.

In 2004, the first presidential election since the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, Democratic primary voters rejected the anti-war candidate, Howard Dean, and nominated John Kerry, the decorated Vietnam War veteran who had backed the Iraq war. Kerry was perceived as the stronger candidate on national security against the incumbent president, but he stumbled in explaining his Iraq war votes, saying he voted for an $87 billion war supplemental ""before I voted against it."" Bush prevailed in the election.

For Republicans, the debate over Syria foreshadows a fierce argument in the party over the role of U.S. foreign policy and military involvement after Iraq and Afghanistan. The divisions have been simmering for months.

Paul conducted a lengthy Senate filibuster in March to raise concerns over the president's use of aerial drones to kill suspected terrorists, rallying libertarians within the party. Some establishment Republicans opposed the filibuster and pushed back against criticism of the National Security Agency's collection of hundreds of millions of U.S. phone records, saying it was needed to keep Americans safe.

In July, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie called the libertarian strain within the GOP a ""very dangerous thought"" more than a decade after the Sept. 11 attacks. Paul responded, saying Christie was worried about the ""dangers of freedom"" instead of being concerned about losing those freedoms.

As Obama has pushed for the U.S. to intervene in Syria, the GOP divisions have emerged.

Texas Sen. Ted Cruz has expressed skepticism about possible intervention, saying the administration has yet to make a forceful case that it would protect U.S. national security interests.

The Syria question is easier to avoid outside Washington.

Christie, asked about the Syrian conflict Tuesday, told reporters the ""use of chemical weapons is something that just is intolerable for civilized society,"" but he said he would ""let the policymaking be done by the people who are getting the bulk of the briefing on this, which is our federal representatives."""

Pollak'],"Schumer Defects from Pro-Israel Cause, Backs Hagel for Defense; Confirmation Likely","Partisan loyalty trumped pro-Israel policy as Sen. Charles Schumer (D-NY) announced, over the objection of many of his constituents, that he would support the nomination of former Sen Chuck Hagel (R-NE) as Secretary of Defense today. Pro-Israel Democrats in the Senate majority who might have voted against Hagel, are now likely to support him in the wake of Schumer’s decision, making Hagel’s confirmation all but certain.

Even as pro-Israel advocates mobilized against Hagel’s appointment, the White House has worked hard behind the scenes to shore up his support. Yesterday, Hagel delivered a letter to Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-CA) in which he expressed regret for his controversial comments about a “Jewish lobby” (though, as with an anti-gay remark in 1998, Hagel made the apologetic gesture to a third party, not to the target of his offensive comment).

Schumer’s announcement coincides with a long essay by Arianna Huffington in today’s Huffington Post in which she describes Hagel as a “neoconservative nightmare” and attempts to debunk criticisms of his candidacy. As with other defenses of Hagel, the Huffington post article does not make the case for Hagel–whose focus was foreign affairs, not defense, in his Senate days–but rather argues against Hagel’s opponents.

For example, Huffington attempts to dismiss concerns about Hagel’s temperament, calling them a “modern-day male version of the old dig that used to be directed at women.” Yet President Barack Obama himself made John McCain’s “temperament” an issue in the 2008 campaign–even mentioning it in his nomination acceptance speech–and Democrats rejected UN Ambassador John Bolton based on “temperament” concerns.

Huffington makes clear that the primary reason that President Obama nominated Hagel, and that Democrats are willing to overlook his anti-abortion, anti-climate change views, is that Hagel emerged as a potent critic of the Iraq War. Like many on the left, Hagel also has expressed the view that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is the “core” of Middle East turmoil, and now supports defense cuts that he once warned strongly against.

Hagel’s supporters have been at great pains (even to the point of concocting outright lies) to defend him against charges of antisemitism–charges prompted by his poor record on Israel and his statement that members of Congress were “intimidated” by the so-called “Jewish lobby.” More than a poor choice of words, his critics argue, Hagel’s statement reflects a particular animus towards Israel and its political supporters.

The 2006 speech on the Senate floor in which Hagel called for a more even-handed approach to Israel and the Arab world is a case in point. Hagel’s words came at a time when Israeli civilians were under attack by Iranian-backed Hebollah, and Israel was isolated at the United Nations. Hagel’s premature call for an immediate cease-fire would have prevented Israel from responding to the threat–and sent a message of opposition.

Other critics, such as Alan Dershowitz, have focused less on Hagel’s position on Israel or his statement about a “Jewish lobby” and have instead questioned his policy towards Iran. Hagel has not only opposed military action to stop the Iranian nuclear program; he has also, at times, opposed sanctions. His appointment as Secretary of Defense sends a signal that the United States is not serious about countering the Iranian nuclear threat.

Huffington’s article barely mentions Iran, but does attempt to deal with another serious problem in Hagel’s record: namely, his staunch opposition to the surge in Iraq, which Hagel predicted would fail. Not only does Huffington defend Hagel’s position, but she even attempts to claim he was right: “Since then it’s become accepted gospel in Washington that the surge was successful. Accepted gospel that is, once again, wrong.”

Hagel’s supporters are not concerned about the facts of the surge, or whether Hagel is qualified for the job. What they want is a weakened Department of Defense, and with the appointment of an anti-war war veteran, they have one. Hagel’s opponents have not given up, but Schumer’s defection from the pro-Israel cause, and the willingness of gay advocates and green activists to overlook Hagel’s contrary past, have virtually sealed the win."

WASHINGTON, Sept 18 (Reuters) - Iranian President Hassan Rouhani vowed on Wednesday that his government will never develop nuclear weapons, his strongest signal yet that he may be seeking a diplomatic thaw with the West after decades of acrimony.

In an interview with NBC News days before he travels to New York for a U.N. appearance, the new Iranian president also insisted that he has ""complete authority"" to negotiate a nuclear deal with the United States and other Western powers.

""We have time and again said that under no circumstances would we seek any weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons, nor will we ever,"" Rouhani said when asked whether he would forswear nuclear arms.

Rouhani's conciliatory comments appeared to be another sign of his willingness to work toward a diplomatic solution in Iran's bitter nuclear standoff with the West. Washington and its allies are intrigued but still wary, making clear they hope to see tangible steps to back up his words.

Speaking to the U.S. network at his presidential compound in Tehran, Rouhani said the tone of a letter he had received from President Barack Obama, part of a recent exchange of messages between the leaders, was ""positive and constructive.""

""It could be subtle and tiny steps for a very important future,"" Rouhani said six days before he is due to address the U.N. General Assembly, a speech that will be closely watched for fresh diplomatic overtures.

Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has said that nuclear weapons development would be inconsistent with Islamic values. But a willingness by a newly elected president to rule out nuclear arms could help provide a new opening in long-stalled international nuclear talks.

Questions remain about how much bargaining room Khamenei, a staunch promoter of Iran's nuclear program, will give his negotiators, whether in secret talks with Washington or in multilateral discussions with major powers.

Comments on Tuesday by Khamenei about the need for ""flexibility"" suggests a new willingness at the highest level to explore a compromise solution to Tehran's dispute with the West.

'COMPLETE AUTHORITY'

""This government enters with full power and has complete authority,"" Rouhani said, according to an NBC translation. ""I have given the nuclear negotiations portfolio to foreign ministry. The problem won't be from our side. We have sufficient political latitude to solve this problem.""

The White House responded cautiously.

""The world has heard a lot from President Rouhani's administration about its desire to improve the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran's relations with the international community, and President Obama believes we should test that assertion,"" White House spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan said.

""We hope that this new Iranian government will engage substantively in order to reach a diplomatic solution that will fully address the international community's concerns about Iran's nuclear program.""

The United States and its allies suspect Iran is seeking bomb-making capability despite Tehran's insistence that its program has only peaceful aims. Israel, believed to be the Middle East's only nuclear weapons power, has repeatedly called for a credible military threat to halt Iran's nuclear advance.

Since Rouhani was elected president in June, the centrist cleric has called for ""constructive interaction"" with the world, a dramatic shift in tone from the strident anti-Western rhetoric of his predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

Obama said in a television interview on Tuesday that he was prepared to test Rouhani's willingness to open a nuclear dialogue, but he did not back away from previous U.S. demands.

The United States and Iran cut diplomatic relations in 1980, after students and Islamic militants stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took American diplomats hostage.

Obama ran for president in 2008 in part by vowing to engage with Iran. But Tehran continued its nuclear development and tough sanctions imposed by Washington and the United Nations have taken a severe toll on Iran's economy."

But after weeks of internal debate across the Obama administration over how to respond to the ongoing struggle between the president and the generals, Mrs. Clinton touched on it only lightly, saying she looked forward to working “to support the military’s return to a purely national security role.”

State Department officials said the meeting itself sent a historic message. Seated in an ornate room in the presidential palace, Mrs. Clinton smiled for cameras and traded pleasantries with President Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist jailed more than once by the American-backed autocracy overthrown 18 months ago. She became the highest ranking United States official to meet Mr. Morsi since he was sworn in two weeks ago as Egypt’s first democratically elected president.

But her outreach to the new president appeared constrained by evident reluctance to address his struggle to pry power from the generals. Her muted tone, State Department officials said, reflected a growing sense that American attempts to intercede may be futile in a contest where the outcome remains uncertain, all the players are deeply suspicious of American motives, and almost any statement could elicit a popular backlash.

Instead of calling for an immediate handover of power as American officials have in the past, Mrs. Clinton instead emphasized only the need for “building consensus across the Egyptian political spectrum.” In brief remarks after the meeting with Mr. Morsi, her sole reference to the military decrees dissolving the Islamist-led Parliament and eviscerating his powers was a call for “consensus” among all sides in order “to work on a new constitution and Parliament, to protect civil society, to draft a new constitution that will be respected by all, and to assert the full authority of the presidency.”

A senior State Department official, speaking on the condition of anonymity in a briefing to reporters, said Mrs. Clinton planned to deliver virtually the same message in a private meeting with Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, Egypt’s top military commander, as she did in public remarks on Saturday."

“I drink malunggay juice… as a matter of precaution at my age. And then I eat pasteurized celery, squash, carrots, and onions together. They juice it and then I drink it,” Enrile said.



He was also reportedly a fan of stem-cell therapy.



However, Enrile doesn't want to push himself too far and is actually mulling to quit politics come 2016.



Enrile, who still has three more years to finish his term as senator, announced he will be leaving the political scene by 2016.



“This will be my last senatorial campaign because I’m leaving the Senate already. I just need to complete my term if God will allow me and leave the scene,” Enrile told reporters.



“I will have to leave the Senate because I'm no longer young. Let the younger people take over,” he added.

He has also been going around the country endorsing other candidates running under Vice President Jejomar Binay’s line-up, a few weeks before the official start of campaign period began on February 12.



Meanwhile, Enrile also cannot help but compare the modes of campaigning during the time he was just starting out in politics.



He explained that new culture in political campaign today such as the use of social media, as well as the need for more television and radio ads, cannot compete with physical interaction with voters.



“Now, you have the Twitter, the Facebook, the blogs and all the internet so that additional instruments of reaching the people communicating with them,” Enrile said.

In Egyptian Sinai just hours later, thousands of Islamists rallied under the black flag of jihad and cheered widely at calls for “a war council” to roll back Mr. Morsi’s ouster. “The age of peacefulness is over,” the speaker declared in a video of the rally. “No more peacefulness after today.”

“No more election after today,” the crowd chanted in response.

In the United Arab Emirates, where the authoritarian government just sentenced 69 members of a Brotherhood-linked Islamist group to prison in an effort to stop the spread of Arab spring revolts, Islamists said the crackdowns were driving a deeper wedge into their movement.

Anti-Americanism, which has long been an undercurrent here, is erupting again as Egyptians battle over the future of their country. Each side accuses the United States of backing the other and alleges conspiracies in which the Obama administration is secretly fostering dissent in an attempt to weaken Egypt.

It’s a damned if you do, damned if you don’t quagmire in which the U.S. appears to have alienated both sides, underscoring waning American influence and credibility as it attempts to navigate the turmoil.

Islamists at a large pro-Morsi rally Friday afternoon questioned how the U.S. — which claims to stand for the rule of law and free elections — could so quickly abandon Egypt’s first democratically elected president and fail to condemn, or even acknowledge, Wednesday’s military coup.

“The morals of America are not being reflected in their politics toward Egypt,” said Sharif Hegazy, 37, who manages the Cairo office of a U.S. company he preferred not to name. “Because of its past support for [deposed President Hosni] Mubarak, America has always been seen as a veiled enemy. Now they are just waiting to see which side will win. That’s not ethical. The U.S. should support the election.”

Though U.S. officials and analysts say American influence in Egypt is increasingly limited, many Morsi supporters are convinced that a U.S. hand is at work behind the scenes in the country’s recent troubles. A common viewpoint expressed on the streets is that the Obama administration worked with the Egyptian army to cause power outages, fuel shortages and other problems that soured public support for Morsi.

The deposed president’s supporters complain that the U.S. never supported Morsi because of his roots in the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood.

“The U.S. silence [to Morsi’s ouster] proves that the U.S. has always been against political Islam, even when political Islam arises through democratic means,” said Mohamed El Sayad, 40, a Cairo father of three.

Sheik Abdel Khalea Fahmi, 33, struggling to be heard over buzzing military helicopters that protesters say were sent to intimidate pro-Morsi crowds, saw an even more devious U.S. conspiracy. Mindful of the rising anti-American sentiment, he said the United States pretended to embrace Morsi’s government as a way of discrediting him.

“It was part of the U.S. plot to support Morsi so that the people would turn against him,” Fahmi said.

Just a few miles away in Tahrir Square, anti-Morsi protesters insist the U.S. is on the ousted president’s side, just as Washington supported Mubarak. They have been holding up signs reading “Obama supports terrorism” and pictures of U.S. Ambassador Anne Patterson with an “X” mark.

Now many of the young Egyptians whom Obama tried to reach out to in his landmark 2009 speech here view the U.S. president as a hypocrite.

“America is using the Muslim Brotherhood to impose the kind of order they want to create a new Middle East, which would guarantee Israel’s security and U.S. interests,” said Ahmed Salam, 20, a law student and member of the Rebel movement, which organized the massive protest Sunday that helped bring down Morsi.

“The U.S. isn’t listening to the people,” he said, speaking from a tent in the middle of Tahrir Square.

Much of their anger has been focused on Patterson, ambassador since 2011. She infuriated anti-Morsi activists last month by saying she was “deeply skeptical” about calls to use street protests to unseat Morsi, adding that elections are a better route. She also explained U.S. support of Morsi by noting that he was the nation’s democratically elected leader.

After that, activists used a variety of foul language to describe Patterson and called for her to be kicked out of the country. Anti-Morsi protesters say such criticism is justified because the U.S. failed to speak out more aggressively when Morsi was accused of cracking down on political opponents, journalists and judges.

“It’s not only about elections,” said Mohammed Farahat, 27, an advertising account manager. “Hitler was elected too. It bothers me that the U.S. presents itself as a peacemaker, but then they supports a fascist regime like Morsi’s.”

Asked whether he was worried that the United States might cut off $1.3 billion in annual aid to Egypt, Farahat said his country could do fine without it, a statement that seemed to ignore Egypt’s deep economic troubles. A 2011 Gallup poll found that 70% of Egyptians were opposed to their country accepting further American assistance.

Yair Lapid, the charismatic former news anchor whose meteoric rise in Israel’s election Tuesday has made him the key to the country’s next ruling coalition, rode to success by tapping into a wave of social discontent that could define the agenda of the next Israeli government.

Lapid favors a return to negotiations with the Palestinians, but that was not what won him votes. His electoral appeal stemmed mostly from his image as a champion of Israel’s struggling middle class. The focus of his centrist party’s campaign was what many secular Israelis see as the inequity of exempting tens of thousands of ultra-Orthodox Jews from the draft so they can pursue religious studies with government stipends.

Lapid’s party, Yesh Atid, which won 19 seats and unexpectedly became the second largest in Israel’s next parliament, owes its success to people like Efrat Shemesh. The 35-year-old teacher and mother of three said she had voted for Lapid in the hope that he would “weigh in on social issues” in the next administration of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

“We want a better future for our children, affordable housing and better education,” she said. “And too much is going to the ultra-Orthodox at the expense of secular people.”

Her complaints are shared by many Israelis, for whom worries about making ends meet — not peace with the Palestinians — were a decisive factor in a vote that carried echoes of the social justice protests that swept Israel 11 / 2 years ago.

Lapid, a 49-year-old former newspaper columnist and host of TV talk shows and news programs, has followed in the footsteps of his father, Yosef Lapid, a journalist who entered politics at the head of the staunchly secular Shinui party, leading it to electoral success and joining the government of then-Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.

The younger Lapid established Yesh Atid, or There Is a Future, just nine months ago and quickly built a following among mostly secular Israelis drawn to his plainspoken messages.

In a typical pitch in one of his TV ads, Lapid’s image was projected upside-down as he announced that “everything is backward.”

“Those who serve in the army are not taken care of, while those who don’t serve are given money. Isn’t that backward?” Lapid said. “Those who pay the most taxes get the least education from the state. It’s all backward. The middle class, those who work the hardest, will never be able to buy an apartment. Those who don’t work get apartments at half-price. I’m telling you, it’s backward. So I ask, isn’t it about time to turn things around?”

Although he has put domestic issues first, Lapid says Israel cannot allow a continued impasse in peace efforts, and he suggests that they should be revived along the lines of previous Israeli proposals.

He favors a return to talks with the Palestinians to reach a two-state solution to the conflict but says the deal should leave large Jewish settlements in the West Bank under Israel’s sovereignty, with possible land swaps. To drive that point home, he launched his election campaign in Ariel, a large settlement town deep in the northern West Bank.

Like Netanyahu, Lapid rejects ceding East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians seek as the capital of a future state, and asserts that the entire city should remain under Israeli sovereignty.

Although Lapid could make a resumption of peace negotiations a condition for joining Netanyahu’s next government, the presence of rightist partners in the coalition could leave little leeway for concessions in such talks, particularly on building in West Bank settlements, which Lapid endorses for purposes of “natural growth.”

But Lapid’s main call has been for “equal sharing of the burden,” in which the ultra-Orthodox would join the workforce and serve a stint of military or civilian national service as other Israelis do. The demand has become a rallying cry for many people who are resentful of what they see as preferential treatment gained through a disproportionate influence of politicians from religious blocs.

Carmel Cohen, 18, said she voted Tuesday for the first time and chose Lapid’s party because “I have to go to the army in a month, while the ultra-Orthodox are getting stipends.”

Lapid’s direct manner and outsider status appealed to many young Israelis disenchanted with the rhetoric of mostly familiar political faces competing in the campaign.

“There was something fresh and young about him, and I wanted to give a chance to something new,” said Rachel Zohar, 35, a bagel cafe manager who voted for Lapid. “He’s not condescending, he understands us, and he gets it. We’ve tried Netanyahu already.”

Lapid will have a harder time translating his campaign pledges into action in a government that economic experts say will have to institute painful budget cuts and tax hikes to cope with a ballooning deficit.

At the moment, however, he holds the key to the next governing coalition, with Netanyahu dependent on his partnership to secure a parliamentary majority. In a nod to Lapid’s concerns, Netanyahu swiftly declared in a post-election speech that he would make “equal sharing of the burden” a priority of his next administration.

Lapid called for “the broadest possible government that will include moderate forces from the right and the left,” though he did not specify which partners he preferred. He also alluded to his party’s demand for a resumption of peace talks with the Palestinians, warning that “we are facing a world that could ostracize us because of the diplomatic deadlock.”

“Whoever voted today for Yesh Atid,” he said, “voted for normalcy.”"

My guess is that Priebus' real concern has nothing to do with pro-Hillary collusion between NBC News and NBC Entertainment. He just doesn't want Hillary Clinton, the presumptive favorite for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, to get extra air time, adulatory or otherwise, as the election season approaches. But is that really a big concern in this multiplatform age? Surely we've progressed past the time when people worried that Arnold Schwarzenegger the politician would receive some unfair political advantage if ""Terminator"" were rerun on TV (as if susceptible voters couldn't watch it on a DVD). And isn't it patronizing to suggest that voters could be manipulated by a miniseries or a documentary? The best answer to Preibus' complaint is that, whatever her political prospects, Hillary Rodham Clinton is a historical figure with a fascinating personal backstory. That she's also a potential candidate for president doesn't change those facts. So let the cameras roll. And rather than agonize about whether the movies will mess with their brand, reporters at CNN and NBC should focus on covering the 2016 campaign fairly.

Presidential debates have not been debates for a long time. In the primaries, they’re cattle shows where a half dozen or more would-be nominees recite talking points hoping for a sound bite that sticks for 24 hours. In the general election, they’re press conferences with two participants trying to avoid stepping on landmines. The most memorable moments have had less to do with substantive discussion than appearance, like President Obama sleepwalking through his first encounter with Mitt Romney in 2012. But even from that low starting point, Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, has dragged the idea of presidential debates farther down. [...] On one level, Mr. Priebus is right. Debate moderators have not been people whose interest was promoting the Republicans or their nominees. They have been journalists whose interest was in asking questions dispassionately. That’s how it is supposed to be. If the Mr. Priebus wants debate moderators to lob softballs designed to let the candidates look good and avoid areas that might hurt them, he should just give Fox News an exclusive.

The Republican House caucus has probably stopped comprehensive immigration reform this year. If the GOP succeeds in blocking the path to citizenship for immigrants, the Republicans will fail at the polls next year. When Republicans aren't blocking reform legislation, they spend their time trying to kill reforms that are already law. House Republicans have now voted 40 times to kill the Affordable Care Act, which Hispanic Americans support in large numbers. The GOP's electoral problems extend far beyond Hispanic voters. A national poll that CBS conducted in July indicated that Americans are much more concerned about the economy (40 percent) than the budget deficit (16 percent), or anything else for that matter. By focusing like a laser beam on the deficit, the GOP is blissfully ignoring the problem that concerns large numbers of voters. Meanwhile President Obama has spent the last two weeks on the road, talking about the economy.

the humanities are not about success. They’re about questioning success — and every important social value. Socrates taught us this, and we shouldn’t forget it. Sure, someone who studies literature or philosophy is learning to think clearly and write well. But those skills are means to an end. That end, as Plato said, is learning how to live one’s life. “This discussion is not about any chance question,” Plato’s Socrates says in “The Republic,” “but about the way one should live.” That’s what’s at the heart of the humanities — informed, thoughtful dialogue about the way we ought to conduct life. This dialogue honors no pieties: All positions are debatable; all values are up for discussion.

Teaching should be among the most respected professions. Teachers should be paid extremely well, and they should have tremendous amounts of support, resources and quality professional development. Teachers should bring out the creative spark in children. Teachers should help students gain high levels of rigorous knowledge and skills. And teachers should be held to high standards that look at how they and their students perform on a variety of measures, year after year. These “shoulds” build on one another; they do not tear one another down. For low-income children and parents, there are many comprehensive services that can help level the playing field, and not just academically. Housing policy is education policy. Transportation policy is education policy. Health-care policy is education policy. Criminal justice policy is education policy. Food policy is education policy. And, yes, education policy is education policy. I do not know anyone involved in the education reform movement worth his salt who thinks that schools are the sole answer; I do not know anyone opposed to the education reform movement worth her salt who thinks schools don’t matter. [...] There’s only one divide that matters: the one between those who believe all kids can succeed regardless of the circumstances of their birth and the color of their skin, and those who don’t.

If you’re running for office, it’s best not to make incendiary comments about rape. That appears to be as much the case in Indonesia as it is in the United States.

Daming Sanusi, a candidate for the Indonesian Supreme Court, has fueled outrage in the predominantly Muslim country by suggesting that rape victims enjoy being violated.

He made the comments Monday in front of a parliamentary commission hearing to determine if he was a fit for the top court, according to the official Indonesian news agency Antara.

In response to a question about whether the death penalty should be applied in rape cases, Daming reportedly said, “Consideration needs to be taken thoroughly for the imposition of death penalty for a rapist because in a rape case both the rapist and the victim enjoy it.”

News of his comments quickly spread on social media, prompting anger, disgust and calls for Daming’s candidature for the Supreme Court to be shot down.

“We ask legislators not to give the judge position to Daming, as he had offended people`s feeling by uttering inappropriate statement,” Ridwan Bakar, a spokesman for the Indonesian Legal Aid Foundation, said Tuesday.

As the furor grew, Daming issued an apology, acknowledging that his words were “out of control.”

In a news conference, he said that he was nervous in the session in front of the lawmakers and made the comment as a joke.

“I made the remark without realizing it can harm people’s feeling,” Antara cited him as saying.

Damage is done

But his contrition appeared to be too little too late.

“The damage has been done,” Primastuti Handayani, the managing editor of the Jakarta Post wrote in a commentary published Wednesday. “Nothing he said in his apology can heal the wound he caused.”

She also noted that Daming is not the first Indonesian official to make controversial comments about rape, highlighting the case last year of Jakarta Governor Fauzi Bowo, who said women should avoid wearing miniskirts on public transport to avoid “any unwanted consequences.”

Indonesian political figures began to distance themselves from Daming amid the outrage this week, and his chances of being selected as a Supreme Court justice seemed to wither.

Opinion: Why have men lost touch with reality over rape?

The chairman of the parliamentary commission, Gede Pasek Suardika, said that Daming’s remarks were inappropriate and that the public outcry against him would be taken into consideration. Members of the commission from the Prosperous Justice Party recommended against selecting him.

The controversy that sprung up around Daming mirrors outrage in the United States over remarks about rape made by Republicans Richard Mourdock and Todd Akin.

Once leading in the polls, Mourdock and Akin both lost their Senate races to Democrats in November after their comments on pregnancy and rape were widely circulated.

When asked on a local news show what he thought about abortion in the case of rape, Akin set off the controversy when he said, “First of all, from what I understand from doctors, that’s really rare. If it’s a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.”

Mourdock was participating in a televised debate when he said, “Life is that gift from God that I think even if life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that it is something that God intended to happen.”

And Rep. Phil Gingrey, Republican of Georgia, revived the furor last week when he commented on the cases of Mourdock and Akin, and reportedly suggested Akin was “partly right.”

Gingrey later said his words, reported by the Marietta Daily-Journal, had been misconstrued.

Ted Cruz, a leading opponent of Obama’s plan for military action in Syria, had shifted his position on the conflict with an eye towards running for President in 2016. The article, by Alexandra Jaffe, insinuates that Cruz has abandoned his previous hawkish views for one that better positions him to contest the GOP nomination. It is a complete misreading of Cruz’s consistent views on the issue.

To build her argument, Jaffe points to a line Sen. Cruz said on the Senate floor back in June:

“We need to be developing right now a clear, practical plan to go in, locate the weapons, secure or destroy them, and then get out. The United States should be firmly in the lead to make sure the job is done right,” Cruz said.

That is not what President Obama is proposing. Obama has called for a “limited,” or in the words of John Kerry “unbelievably small”, military strike with the intention of “punishing” Syrian strong-man Bashar Assad to deter him from using chemical weapons again. Obama’s planned strike would try to “degrade” Assad’s ability to use chemical weapons in the future.



If Obama’s strike were executed, the Syrian regime would still possess stockpiles of chemical weapons. They would still be vulnerable to seizure by the al-Qaeda-backed terrorists who make up the bulk of Syrian rebels opposing Assad. Obama’s action could even weaken the Assad regime to the point that terrorists in the rebel forces had easier access to these weapons.

Cruz’s position on Syria has always been predicated on keeping these weapons out of the hands of terrorists. In an interview on the Sean Hannity show in late August, Cruz said:

With 9 major rebel groups, 7 of them may well have some significant ties to Al Qaida. If Assad is toppled and replaced by a radical Islamist regime, what would be truly dangerous for the United States, for our allies like Israel and Jordan, is for a radical Islamic government to seize control of those chemical weapons and to deploy them against us or our allies. That should be the focus of the President, and as we’ve seen throughout the Middle East that has not been the focus of the President.

And:

[O]ur concern should be those chemical weapons, preventing them from falling into the hands of Hezbollah, preventing them from falling into the hands of Al Qaida, that should be guiding our actions, not expressing some moral outrage from a university facility lounge.

This week, in The Washington Post, Cruz spelled out a situation wherein he would support military action:

Should we in the future have intelligence that al-Qaeda or Hezbollah is on the verge of acquiring chemical weapons or that Iran is nearing a nuclear breakout, I would support aggressive military action to prevent them from acquiring those weapons because the alternative is unacceptable.

The Hill article would have been more correct if it had detailed Cruz’s consistency on Syria, notwithstanding the political calculus of a potential run for President in 2016. That story, however, would hardly be worth Jaffe hitting her keyboard. While Obama’s foreign policy lies tattered, more useful for her to parse the words of Republicans and pull things out of context."

Speaking after the party suffered heavy losses to the UK Independence Party in the local council elections, the MP for Haltemprice and Howden said David Cameron should stop surrounding himself with fellow Old Etonians and show he understood the concerns of ordinary people.

He issued the same warning in 2005 during a Sky Tory leadership debate when he said it was paramount voters understood that the Conservatives were ""not a privileged elite interested only in ourselves"", but ""that actually we're on their side"".

With the Tories losing 340 councillors and the control of 10 councils, some Tory right-wingers have called on the Prime Minister to firm up his commitment to holding a referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union to counter the appeal of UKIP.

However, Mr Davis said the priority for Mr Cameron - who recently appointed Old Etonian Jo Johnson to head the No 10 policy unit - was to reconnect with voters who thought the Conservatives lived in a different world to them.

""The fact is that if we want to win the next election, we have to break this impression of being privileged and out of touch,"" he said in an article for The Daily Telegraph.

""The British public are neither snobs nor inverted snobs, but they do expect the Government to understand their problems and do something about it.

""That means more straight talking and fewer focus groups; more conventional Tory policies, not because they are Tory, but because they work; less pandering to metropolitan interest groups; and please, please, no more Old Etonian advisers.""

Home Secretary Theresa May, who has been touted as a possible future Tory leader, refused to be drawn on the argument, and insisted the party was focused on ""bringing people back to voting Conservative"".

Story continues

She told Sky News: ""The Government has shown that it understands some of the problems that hard-working people are facing - the efforts we've taken to helping local councils freeze their council tax, hold down fuel duties, two million people have been taken out of paying income tax, and an income tax cut for 24 million people.

""There are other areas we know the task is a sizeable one - controlling welfare and immigration. We are already on the right track in dealing with these issues.""

She added: ""What we will be doing over the next couple of years is working hard to bring people back to voting Conservative - showing them what we are doing in those areas ... and how the choice in the next election will be Conservatives who will control welfare and immigration and deal with the deficit, and the same old Labour Party who will just ask for more spending, more borrowing, more debt.""

Former Tory councillor Rory Love, who contested the Folkestone South seat for the first time and finished second with 989 votes behind UKIP's Robert Neaves who polled 1,006 votes, dismissed the row as ""nonsense"".

""This isn't about Old Etonians, about public schools ... if you want to get into that sort of nonsense, Nigel Farage, I understand is a public schoolboy.

""The issue is about the policies, about how we can better demonstrate to the public that what we are doing is the very thing ... they asked us to do ... and that is to look again at our relationship with the European Union, the effects of mass immigration from eastern Europe ... that's what we need to concentrate on.""

UKIP's gains of 131 councillors in the council elections were dubbed a ""game changer"" by leader Nigel Farage.

While Labour made gains - picking up 268 councillors and taking control of two councils - analysts said they fell short of the numbers needed to show that Ed Miliband was on course for Downing Street.

For the Liberal Democrats it was another grim set of results with the loss of 110 councillors while crashing to a humiliating seventh place in the South Shields parliamentary by-election, just ahead of the Monster Raving Loony Party.

Mr Cameron pledged to work really hard to win back voters who abandoned the Conservatives for the UKIP, promising action to turn round the economy, cut immigration and sort out the welfare system.

Having previously derided UKIP as ""fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists"", the Prime Minister adopted a softer approach, promising to show ""respect"" for those who voted for them.

Mr Miliband insisted that Labour had made ""good gains"" but acknowledged there was ""more work to do"".

""These elections show many people have lost trust in David Cameron's ability to change Britain. But our task is to win the trust of the people we haven't yet persuaded that Labour can make the difference,"" he said.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the Lib Dems' poor showing reflected their journey from ""a party of protest to a party of government"".

""I have always said it is understandable why it is that people might be attracted to the simple answers that the UK Independence Party is offering to deal with this country's complex problems,"" he said."

His Latest Book Is', 'Code Red', 'How Progressives', 'Moderates Can Unite To Save Our Country.']",E.J. Dionne: Political dysfunctions spells trouble for democracies,"We know American politics are dysfunctional. But after a week of scandal obsession during which the nation’s capital and the media virtually ignored the problems most voters care about — jobs, incomes, growth, opportunity, education — it’s worth asking if there is something especially flawed about our democracy.

Our circumstances certainly have their own particular disabilities: a radicalization of conservative politics, over-the-top mistrust of President Obama on the right, high-tech gerrymandering in the House and a Senate snarled by non-constitutional super-majority requirements.

Still, while it may not be much of a comfort, the democratic distemper is not a peculiarly American phenomenon. Across most of the democratic world, there is an impatience bordering on exhaustion with electoral systems and political classes.

Citizen dissatisfaction is hardly surprising in the wake of a deeply damaging economic downturn. That doesn’t make the challenge any less daunting. We should consider whether democracy itself is in danger of being discredited. Politicians might usefully disentangle themselves from their day-to-day power struggles long enough to take seriously their responsibility to a noble idea and the systems that undergird it.

It’s not hard to discover that this conundrum is global and not just our own. “Has democracy had its day?” is the headline on Columbia University historian Mark Mazower’s cover story in the May issue of Prospect, a British magazine. The subhead: “Electoral politics has had a bad decade.”

Earlier this month, the Transatlantic Academy, a global partnership of think tanks led by the German Marshall Fund of the United States, issued “The Democratic Disconnect,” a sober report by a group of distinguished academics.

“Democracy is in trouble,” the report begins. “The collective engagement of a concerned citizenry for the public good — the bedrock of a healthy democracy — is eroding. Democratic governments often seem crippled in their capacity to deliver what their people want and need. They are neither as responsive nor as accountable as they need to be in an era of hard choices and rising nondemocratic powers. There is widespread concern about apparent declining rates of voter participation and about the alienation or disaffection of citizens from the political process.”

In Europe, the authors noted, “there is fear that the distance between ordinary citizens and the politicians and bureaucrats in Brussels compromises democratic legitimacy.” In the United States, “lamentations about gridlock and polarization are the order of the day.” Even our peaceable neighbor Canada is not immune. “Canadians,” they write, “worry about the tendency of their political system to place largely unaccountable power in the hands of the prime minister.”

The report does include some useful suggestions for reviving the democratic spirit and improving democratic practice. But it is not alarmist to be uneasy about democracy’s prospects. Ernst Hillebrand, the head of international policy analysis for the Friedrich Ebert Foundation, the German Social Democratic Party’s think tank, describes a chilling finding in a 2009 survey by the German polling firm Forsa: “that zero percent — yes, zero percent — of workers in Germany believe they can have a significant impact on how policy in Germany is shaped via the ballot box.”

And bear in mind that a poll released last week by the Pew Global Attitudes Project found that Germans are far more satisfied with their country’s situation than are their European neighbors.

In a conversation last week during a visit to Washington, Hillebrand pointed to two streams of discontent the world’s democracies face. One is material. The other might be called spiritual.

On the one side, large numbers of lower-middle-class and working-class voters have seen their economic standing deteriorate over two or three decades. There has been a substantial transfer of wealth and income from labor — which is how most people pay their way — to capital. Productivity gains no longer lead to wage gains. This builds justified frustration.

At the same time, he said, many citizens, especially the young, have enhanced expectations for “participation, self-realization and control over their lives.” They do not see current electoral arrangements in democracies giving them much chance to achieve any of these goals.

Since World War II, bouts of economic growth have allowed democracies to buy their way out of trouble. One can hope this will happen again — and soon. In the meantime, politicians might contemplate their obligations to stewardship of the democratic ideal. They could begin by pondering what an unemployed 28-year-old makes of a ruling elite that expends so much energy feuding over how bureaucrats rewrote a set of talking points.

Ex-president and Ahmadinejad critic Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani also registered to run

The Guardian Council vets candidates and decides who can run

Hundreds of candidates are vying to become Iran's next president, with hopefuls ranging from friends to foes of current President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

A total of 686 candidates have registered for the June election, Iran's state-run Press TV reported.

Ahmadinejad is term-limited and cannot run for a third straight term.

But other big names are in the mix, including Ahmadinejad's top aide Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei and former Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.

Ahmadinejad has been grooming Mashaei to take over for years, and the two are like-minded in their nationalism and shared disdain for the clerical establishment, according to Geneive Abdo , a fellow at the Stimson Center's Middle East Program and a nonresident fellow at the Brookings Institution.

But the Guardian Council, which is controlled by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, vets candidates and decides who is allowed to run for president, Abdo said. She said the council is not expected to allow anyone from the so-called ""deviant faction"" of Ahmadinejad's supporters to run.

Rafsanjani, on the other hand, has long been a staunch critic and bitter political rival of Ahmadinejad's. He served two terms as president from 1989 to 1997.

Weeks after the 2009 elections, Rafsanjani condemned the regime's violent crackdown against the opposition movement and spoke out for the people's right to peacefully protest.

He later toned down the attacks and made statements of apparent support of the regime and the supreme leader, Khamenei."

USA TODAY

Vulnerable Democrats in red states may fear siding with Obama

Rand Paul%27s leadership of anti-war effort may make tight spot for Sen. Mitch McConnell

If military action becomes prolonged%2C any %27yes%27 vote is a liability

The debate over military intervention in Syria has exposed rifts in both political parties that could seep into campaigns in 2014 and beyond.

President Obama's request that Congress authorize strikes against Syria because of its use of chemical weapons has divided Democrats supporting the president from those who oppose the United States undertaking another Mideast military action. Republicans are split between those favoring an aggressive response to the Bashar Assad regime and the bloody civil war and libertarian-leaning conservatives who oppose an overseas intervention.

On Wednesday, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted to approve authorization, over the ""no"" votes of two possible GOP 2016 presidential candidates, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida. Both the full Senate and House are likely to vote on the resolutions next week.

Whatever the outcome of the vote, Syria could be an issue in key Senate races next year, when Republicans hope to wrest six seats away from Democrats and take control of the chamber. ""If (a war in Syria) gets complicated, then it could become a problem for everybody,"" says Jennifer Duffy of the Cook Political Report.

Arkansas Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor, considered vulnerable by Republicans, could support a president unpopular in his state by voting for authorization — he has some cover because his opponent, GOP Rep. Tom Cotton, endorsed military action in a Washington Post op-ed Wednesday. One state over, Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., is considered a prime target for Republicans, and voting with Obama may be hazardous for her in a state that he lost badly in the 2012 presidential election.

In Kentucky, where Democrats would like to unseat Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader faces a Tea Party primary challenger who opposes military action. Neither Pryor nor McConnell have said how they would vote but have said they have questions about the president's plan.

McConnell may ultimately join with the rest of congressional leadership to support the authorization, but he must tread carefully because Paul — a hero of the Tea Party movement — is leading opposition from Republicans. ""He needs that symbolic link between them,"" said political scientist Steve Voss of the University of Kentucky. ""It's likely he just doesn't want to undermine his junior colleague's position by being too public in his support for the president. If he's going to break with an ally like that, he needs to make it clear he's done so carefully and thoughtfully.""

Democratic candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes hasn't said how she might vote on Syria, but there is less pressure on her, Voss says. Democrats want to beat McConnell ""so badly,"" she will be given party support no matter what her position on Syria. In addition, Voss said, swing voters in Kentucky ""hate Obama, but they also tend to like a more muscular foreign policy. Siding with him on this one is not going to cost her a lot of political capital.""

On all sides, the longer the United States remains engaged in Syria, the bigger a political liability a ""yes"" vote would become — as did the 2002 Iraq vote.

""These kinds of votes on war and peace and casualties, the proof is in the pudding and we won't know the pudding for three months, six months or longer,"" said political columnist Stuart Rothenberg.

Some political observers see the divide on Syria in terms of Washington insiders favoring Obama's position vs. outsiders who do not. ""This is the establishment circling the wagons, but there are more outsiders at the table and grass roots … have an ability to express a louder voice than in 2008,'' says Matt Kibbe, president of FreedomWorks, a Tea Party-aligned group that does not take positions on foreign policy matters. Opinion surveys show Americans oppose military intervention in Syria, he points out.

""The verdict on this is already pretty clear from voters: They do not want to see another conflict,"" Kibbe says. ""Politically, the bottom line is, I think anybody that's up in 2014 ignores that at their peril.''

Democratic voters who oppose military action may be less likely to punish candidates who side with Obama. ""I'm not sure the anti-war movement at this point in time has what it takes to give many members heartache over this,"" says Jim Manley, former Senate aide and now Democratic political consultant.

But no politician can ignore the fact that a vote on military action can be a powerful weapon for an opponent. The obvious example: In 2008, presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton was forced to defend her Senate vote in favor of war with Iraq by her top rival Barack Obama, who was the anti-war candidate in the Democratic primary.

Now, Republican criticism of the Obama administration's previous handling of Syria is implicit criticism both of the former secretary of State and Vice President Biden, both potential contenders in 2016.

""Votes you take on issues related to war will stay with you forever,"" Manley said.

Even if voters are more worried about pocketbook issues next year than foreign affairs, ""these members are going to think that the vote that they're going to cast on this resolution could have staying power into the next election. And that's all that matters,"" Rothenberg says."

Campaign advice:

Nationality

What's your nationality?

Iranian

Other

Iranian

Other

As well as being Iranian, all the candidates for president are expected to be devoted to Islamic Republic of Iran and keen to make sacrifices for it. According to the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, you will need to be 'tenacious and resistant to pressures from enemies.'

As with most states, the president of Iran must be Iranian. If you're really serious about this, you could try changing your passport.

Gender

Are you male or female?

Male

Female

Male

Female

Women have been elected to the parliament in Iran but the rules say that presidential candidates must be 'statesmen'. What's not clear is if this requirement is intended to exclude women. Thirty women registered to run for president this year but they were all disqualified. Whether this was because they weren't men is not known.

Are you sure you wouldn't rather run as a male candidate? Iran is one of the very few Muslim countries where gender reassignment is recognised by the state.

Religion

Which religion do you follow?

Islam

Other

None

Shia

Sunni

The population of Iran is more than 90% Shia and its elected leaders ultimately have to follow the Shia interpretations of Islamic law handed down by the Supreme Leader. There are very few Sunni public officials in office, even in regions where Sunnis are in the majority.

People are going to want to know which form of Islam you practice.

That's going to be a problem. Let's assume that you're willing to convert to Islam. Which form of Islam would it be?

Iranian revolution

Where do you stand on the 1979 revolution and the Islamic Republic?

Strongly pro

Pro with reservations

Strongly pro

Pro with reservations

There is little tolerance of views that criticise the Islamic Republic or its institutions. Public officials need to demonstrate their belief in the central values of the republic as established by Ayatollah Khomeini - who remains a key figure in Iranian politics even 20 years after his death.

The Guardian Council is probably looking for a slightly more committed stance.

Previous elections

The results of the 2009 election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad were disputed by some. What are your feelings?

Fair election

Question the result

Fair election

Question the result

The results of 2009 election was disputed by all three of Mr Ahmadinejad's opponents and led to violent protest. Two opposition leaders were placed under house arrest and remain there today. Ruling conservatives reject any candidates who have indicated support for those protests, which may be the reason for disqualifying former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani from this election.

President Ahmadinejad has said that his re-election was 'a great victory' and 'completely free'. I'm sure, on second thoughts, you agree.

Leadership issues

President Ahmadinejad and the Supreme Leader have had a few disagreements recently. Who has your support?

Supreme Leader

President Ahmadinejad

Supreme Leader

President Ahmadinejad

President Ahmadinejad's close ally, Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei, was banned from running this year in a move that may have been aimed at preventing a challenge to the power of the Supreme Leader. The list of candidates that have been approved suggests the establishment is determined to find an obedient president who won't stray off-message.

After the election Mr Ahmadinejad will be the former president. The Supreme Leader will still be the Supreme Leader. Does that help with your decision?

Congratulations!

Your views should endear you to the establishment. You can run for president. You are one of the lucky few: 686 candidates registered this year with only 8 approved.

Plato was “a bit of a fascist,” he said, but had a point.

Imagine the chagrin Mr. Assange must feel now, given that not only did he fail to win a place in the Senate in the recent election, but he was less successful than Ricky Muir from the Motoring Enthusiasts Party. Mr. Muir, who won just 0.5 percent of the vote, is most famous for having posted a video on YouTube of himself having a kangaroo feces fight with friends.

Mr. Assange, who was born and raised in Australia, has radically redefined publishing and provoked an unprecedented global debate about state secrets by subverting established practices and common wisdoms.

It seems odd, then, that his bid for political power, carried out in his absence by the WikiLeaks Party, was drowned by the greatest and most conventional of clichés: power corrupts. His campaign was saddled with the usual backbiting, arguing, dysfunction and even leaks."

President Barack Obama has decided to delay the delivery of four F-16 fighter jets to Egypt in a sign of U.S. pressure for the military there to move quickly restore civilian rule following its ouster of President Mohamed Morsy.

Pentagon spokesman George Little said Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel called Egypt’s military chief, Gen. Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi, on Wednesday to inform him of the decision.

Hagel and al-Sisi also discussed the general’s call on Wednesday for mass demonstrations in Egypt for support of the military.

The Obama administration has so far not called Morsy’s removal earlier this month a military coup, which could cut more than $1 billion in U.S. aid to Egypt if that characterization is made.

Obama has expressed deep concern about the removal of Egypt’s first democratically elected president, calling for a quick return to civilian leadership. He also ordered a review of U.S. law regarding aid to the vital Middle East ally.

The four jets were due to be sent to Egypt by the end of August as part of a $1.3 billion arms package that included additional F-16s and some Abrams tank parts.

It has not been decided when or if the F-16 deliveries will resume, Little said. Also not clear is what conditions the United States would impose on their delivery or whether the balance of the overall arms sale would be met.

Little also said the administration will still proceed with its major military exercise known as “Bright Star” scheduled with the Egyptians for later this year.

The delay will not significantly impact Egypt’s military capabilities. But it is a sign of U.S. pressure to get Egypt to move quickly toward civilian rule.

Little said the decision was made “given the overall situation” in Egypt, but added the administration still hasn’t made a decision on the question whether events in Egypt should be called a coup.

Little said the United States was not suspending its overall arms sales to Egypt currently.

Earlier this month, administration officials said they expected the four aircraft to be delivered even as the White House was continuing to review assistance programs with Egypt."

Australia%27s conservative opposition has swept to power in a national election

Prime Minister Kevin Rudd conceded defeat Saturday

The win comes despite the relative unpopularity of party leader Tony Abbott

CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — Australia's conservative opposition swept to power Saturday, ending six years of Labor Party rule and winning over a disenchanted public by promising to end a hated tax on carbon emissions, boost a flagging economy and bring about political stability after years of Labor infighting.

""I know that Labor hearts are heavy across the nation tonight, and as your prime minister and as your parliamentary leader of the great Australian Labor Party, I accept responsibility,"" Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said in a speech to supporters, after calling opposition leader Tony Abbott to concede defeat. ""I gave it my all, but it was not enough for us to win.""

A victory for the conservative Liberal Party-led coalition comes despite the relative unpopularity of Abbott, a 55-year-old former Roman Catholic seminarian and Rhodes scholar who has struggled to connect with women voters and was once dubbed ""unelectable"" by opponents and even some supporters.

But voters were largely fed up with Labor and Rudd, after a years-long power struggle between him and his former deputy, Julia Gillard. Gillard, who became the nation's first female prime minister after ousting Rudd in a party vote in 2010, ended up losing her job to Rudd three years later in a similar internal party coup.

The drama, combined with Labor reneging on an election promise by imposing a deeply unpopular tax on the nation's biggest carbon polluters, proved deadly for Labor's re-election chances.

In his concession speech, Rudd said he would be stepping down as party leader.

""The Australian people, I believe, deserve a fresh start with our leadership,"" he said.

Former Labor Prime Minister Bob Hawke blamed the party's loss on its inability to unite. ""This is an election lost by the government rather than won by Tony Abbott,"" he told Sky News.

With more than 90 percent of votes counted late Saturday night, official figures from the Australian Electoral Commission showed the Liberals ahead 53 percent to Labor's 47 percent. The coalition was on track to win 91 seats in the 150-seat House of Representatives, and Labor 54.

Abbott, who becomes Australia's third prime minister in three months, will aim to end a period of extraordinary political instability in Australia.

The swing away from Labor was a resounding rejection of Australia's first minority government since World War II. Voters disliked the deals and compromises struck between Labor, the minor Greens party and independent lawmakers to keep their fragile, disparate and sometime chaotic coalition together for the past three years, including the carbon tax.

Abbott has vowed to scrap the carbon from July 2014 — two years after it was implemented — and instead introduce taxpayer-funded incentives for polluters to operate cleaner.

It is unclear whether Abbott will be able to pass the necessary law changes through Parliament, but he has threatened to hold early elections if the Senate thwarts him.

Abbott's popularity seems to have peaked at the right time. Two polls published this past week by Sydney-based market researcher Newspoll are the only ones in which Abbott beat Rudd as preferred prime minister since Newspoll first began comparing the two leaders in 2010.

There is unlikely to be any honeymoon period for Abbott, as he inherits a slowing economy, hurt by the cooling of a mining boom that kept the resource-rich nation out of recession during the global financial crisis.

Australia's new government has promised to slash foreign aid spending as it concentrates on returning the budget to surplus. Labor spent billions of dollars on stimulus projects to avoid recession. But declining corporate tax revenues from the mining slowdown forced Labor to break a promise to return the budget to surplus in the last fiscal year.

Abbott has also promised to repeal a tax on coal and iron ore mining companies, which he blames in part for the downturn in the mining boom. The 30 percent tax on the profits of iron ore and coal miners was designed to cash in on burgeoning profits from a mineral boom fueled by Chinese industrial demand. But the boom was easing before the tax took effect. The tax was initially forecast to earn the government 3 billion Australian dollars ($2.7 billion) in its first year, but collected only AU$126 million after six months.

Abbott was a senior minister in the government of Prime Minister John Howard, who ruled for 11 years until Rudd first took office in 2007.

Under Howard, Australia — one of the world's worst greenhouse gas polluters on a per capita basis — and the United States had been the only wealthy countries to refuse to ratify the Kyoto Protocol on reducing global warming.

One of Rudd's first acts as prime minister was to ratify the Protocol, and he became Australia's most popular prime minister of the past three decades with his promise to introduce a carbon emissions trading scheme. His popularity fell after he failed to persuade the Senate to deliver the scheme.

Saturday's election likely brought Australia's first Aboriginal woman to Parliament. Former Olympian Nova Peris is almost certain to win a Senate seat for Labor in the Northern Territory, but the final results will not be known for days. Less likely is WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange's bid for a Senate seat in Victorian state."

“It is paramount, essential, urgent that the Egyptian economy get stronger, that it gets back on its feet,” Mr. Kerry told a group of Egyptian and American business executives in Cairo. “It’s clear to us that the I.M.F. arrangement needs to be reached, that we need to give the market that confidence.”

Mr. Kerry’s visit — his first trip to an Arab capital as secretary of state — comes at a time of economic peril in Egypt. The country’s economy has teetered near collapse for months, with soaring unemployment, a gaping budget deficit, dwindling hard-currency reserves and steep declines in the currency’s value.

The fund’s loan is critical, economists say, because it would provide a seal of approval that Egypt’s economy is on a path toward self-sufficiency, allowing it to obtain enough other international loans to fill in its deficit. Both the United States and the European Union are prepared to provide substantial additional assistance if Egypt and the I.M.F. can come to terms."

Yair Lapid, the charismatic former news anchor whose meteoric rise in Israel’s election Tuesday has made him the key to the country’s next ruling coalition, rode to success by tapping into a wave of social discontent that could define the agenda of the next Israeli government.

Lapid favors a return to negotiations with the Palestinians, but that was not what won him votes. His electoral appeal stemmed mostly from his image as a champion of Israel’s struggling middle class. The focus of his centrist party’s campaign was what many secular Israelis see as the inequity of exempting tens of thousands of ultra-Orthodox Jews from the draft so they can pursue religious studies with government stipends.

Lapid’s party, Yesh Atid, which won 19 seats and unexpectedly became the second largest in Israel’s next parliament, owes its success to people like Efrat Shemesh. The 35-year-old teacher and mother of three said she had voted for Lapid in the hope that he would “weigh in on social issues” in the next administration of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

“We want a better future for our children, affordable housing and better education,” she said. “And too much is going to the ultra-Orthodox at the expense of secular people.”

Her complaints are shared by many Israelis, for whom worries about making ends meet — not peace with the Palestinians — were a decisive factor in a vote that carried echoes of the social justice protests that swept Israel 11 / 2 years ago.

Israel’s parliamentary election results (The Washington Post/Source: Staff reports)

Lapid, a 49-year-old former newspaper columnist and host of TV talk shows and news programs, has followed in the footsteps of his father, Yosef Lapid, a journalist who entered politics at the head of the staunchly secular Shinui party, leading it to electoral success and joining the government of then-Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.

The younger Lapid established Yesh Atid, or There Is a Future, just nine months ago and quickly built a following among mostly secular Israelis drawn to his plainspoken messages.

In a typical pitch in one of his TV ads, Lapid’s image was projected upside-down as he announced that “everything is backward.”

“Those who serve in the army are not taken care of, while those who don’t serve are given money. Isn’t that backward?” Lapid said. “Those who pay the most taxes get the least education from the state. It’s all backward. The middle class, those who work the hardest, will never be able to buy an apartment. Those who don’t work get apartments at half-price. I’m telling you, it’s backward. So I ask, isn’t it about time to turn things around?”

Although he has put domestic issues first, Lapid says Israel cannot allow a continued impasse in peace efforts, and he suggests that they should be revived along the lines of previous Israeli proposals.

He favors a return to talks with the Palestinians to reach a two-state solution to the conflict but says the deal should leave large Jewish settlements in the West Bank under Israel’s sovereignty, with possible land swaps. To drive that point home, he launched his election campaign in Ariel, a large settlement town deep in the northern West Bank.

Like Netanyahu, Lapid rejects ceding East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians seek as the capital of a future state, and asserts that the entire city should remain under Israeli sovereignty.

Although Lapid could make a resumption of peace negotiations a condition for joining Netanyahu’s next government, the presence of rightist partners in the coalition could leave little leeway for concessions in such talks, particularly on building in West Bank settlements, which Lapid endorses for purposes of “natural growth.”

But Lapid’s main call has been for “equal sharing of the burden,” in which the ultra-Orthodox would join the workforce and serve a stint of military or civilian national service as other Israelis do. The demand has become a rallying cry for many people who are resentful of what they see as preferential treatment gained through a disproportionate influence of politicians from religious blocs.

Carmel Cohen, 18, said she voted Tuesday for the first time and chose Lapid’s party because “I have to go to the army in a month, while the ultra-Orthodox are getting stipends.”

Lapid’s direct manner and outsider status appealed to many young Israelis disenchanted with the rhetoric of mostly familiar political faces competing in the campaign.

“There was something fresh and young about him, and I wanted to give a chance to something new,” said Rachel Zohar, 35, a bagel cafe manager who voted for Lapid. “He’s not condescending, he understands us, and he gets it. We’ve tried Netanyahu already.”

Lapid will have a harder time translating his campaign pledges into action in a government that economic experts say will have to institute painful budget cuts and tax hikes to cope with a ballooning deficit.

At the moment, however, he holds the key to the next governing coalition, with Netanyahu dependent on his partnership to secure a parliamentary majority. In a nod to Lapid’s concerns, Netanyahu swiftly declared in a post-election speech that he would make “equal sharing of the burden” a priority of his next administration.

Lapid called for “the broadest possible government that will include moderate forces from the right and the left,” though he did not specify which partners he preferred. He also alluded to his party’s demand for a resumption of peace talks with the Palestinians, warning that “we are facing a world that could ostracize us because of the diplomatic deadlock.”

“Whoever voted today for Yesh Atid,” he said, “voted for normalcy.”"

Pollak'],Democrats' Agenda for Benghazi Hearing: Protect Hillary at All Costs,"Ahead of Wednesday’s long-awaited hearings at the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee about the Benghazi terror attack of Sep. 11, 2012, Democrats have a clear agenda: protect Hillary Clinton at all costs.

Clinton, the former Secretary of State and likely frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016, could be severely damaged by testimony about the attacks, which occurred in part because of security lapses for which the State Department is primarily responsible.

Past testimony about the attacks has also revealed that President Barack Obama did nothing once informed the attacks were under way, and that there was no communication among key members of the administration and military who could have responded.

In her own testimony before Congress in January before leaving office, Clinton was evasive, famously shouting at Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI), “What difference does it make?” in reference to the question of who had edited the administration’s talking points to remove references to Islamist terror and emphasize a protest that never happened.

The media applauded her performance, but her outburst left an impression of apathy about the four Americans who were killed that night in Benghazi, including U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens.

Since the day after the attacks, Democrats and the media have treated Benghazi as an unfair political attack by Republicans, rather than a legitimate national security crisis in its own right.

Media coverage in the fall focused on Republican Mitt Romney’s response to the attacks, rather than Obama’s actions as commander-in-chief. When questions were raised about whether Obama had lied to the public about the attacks, the media covered Obama’s tracks, with CNN’s Candy Crowley intervening in the second presidential debate to defend the president, and CBS News suppressing damning footage of the president until shortly before the election.

With Obama safely re-elected, the goal is now to protect Hillary Clinton. Last week, Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD) called upon Speaker of the House John Boehner not only to retract, but to apologize publicly for, an inter-committee report that suggested Clinton had ignored requests for additional security in Libya.

On MSNBC, a channel that serves as the mouthpiece for the Democratic Party, Rev. Al Sharpton–who also serves as an informal White House adviser–described the Benghazi investigation as the “new vast right-wing conspiracy,” a reference to Clinton’s claim, as First Lady, that Republicans were merely out to target her husband and that he had not committed any wrongdoing in the Monica Lewinsky affair that led to his impeachment.

Though there are undoubtedly some political motives present, Democrats’ claims are largely a projection of their own political agenda in Benghazi, which has remained consistent from the start: to shield the party and its leaders from responsibility for a major terrorist attack on American sovereign territory.

That agenda far exceeds any pursued by Republicans, whose goals, however political, happen to include the national security interests at stake.

On this past weekend’s Sunday shows, Democrats showed unusual willingness to criticize the Obama administration over Benghazi, acknowledging that the Benghazi talking points had been false.

Yet that willingness to criticize may be a way of inoculating the party against further revelations to come; it may also be easier because new information about the Benghazi talking points has tended to implicate the White House rather than Clinton herself, even if State Department officials have also been listed among those involved.

Clinton’s role in Benghazi is particularly damaging because it risks becoming the signature legacy of her tenure at the State Department. Despite racking up an exhaustive travel record, Clinton had few actual achievements to show for her four years as Secretary of State–a burden as she contemplates her 2016 ambitions.

At least one key witness in Wednesday’s hearing, Mark. I. Thompson, is expected to offer testimony highly damaging to Clinton. He has alleged that Clinton sidelined the State Department’s counter-terrorism operation during the Benghazie attacks: “You should have seen what (Clinton) tried to do to us that night,” he has said, according to Fox News.

Though Democrats seem to have shifted their focus to Clinton’s prospects, Obama himself is not free of the troubles Benghazi presents. Evidence continues to emerge that senior White House officials were directly involved in the manipulation of the Benghazi talking points, suggesting that there had been a deliberate decision to mislead the public.

Obama has yet to explain his own actions–or inaction–during and after the attack. His activities throughout the evening of Sep. 11 are unknown; he flew to Las Vegas for a fundraiser the next day."

A Brief Look At Who Pulls The Political Strings,"As North Korea intensifies its belligerent rhetoric against Washington and Seoul, the world has turned its eyes on Kim Jong Un -- the country's enigmatic leader.

The young Kim rose to power after the death of his father, Kim Jong Il, in December 2011. But is the 30-year-old ""Dear Leader"" the only one pulling North Korea's political strings? HuffPost World investigates.

THE INSTITUTIONS

The International Crisis Group explains that the Korean Workers Party (KWP) is North Korea's main political organ. The 124 members of the party's Central Committee select a General Secretary, the 10-member Secretariat, a 14-member Politbureau, a Presidium and the members of the powerful Central Military Commission (CMC).

As the ICC notes, the party structure fully support the dictatorship. Deceased leader Kim Jong Il is the party's ""Eternal Secretary,"" while Kim Jong Un is First Secretary. Kim Jong Un also heads the powerful National Defense Commission (NDC), a position that gives him control over the armed forces.

Powerful figures in the regime can take up different mandates within the party or the security apparatus over time and can even combine several positions.

THE FIGURES

Kim Kyong Hui Since the death of her brother Kim Jong Il, Kim Kyong Hui has become one of North Korea's most powerful officials. The Dear Leader's 66-year-old aunt was appointed the most important member of the KWP's Politburo and first among members of the Secretariat. In addition, she was made a general in the army.

Jang Song Thaek Kim Kyong Hui's husband, Jang Song Thaek, is deputy chairman of the powerful National Defense Commission and an alternate member of the Politburo, Reuters explains. The Soviet-trained technocrat was first spotted in a general's uniform in the wake of Kim Jong Il's death.

Kim Jong Un's aunt and uncle were crucial figures in the transition of power after Kim Jong Il's death in December 2011. John Park of the U.S. Institute for Peace told the Associated Press after the former leader's passing that the powerful couple are ""key pillars"" of the young Kim's reign.

While analysts speculated the duo's power would gradually decline as young Kim gained ruling experience, thus far, the duo's influence has not waned -- as evidenced by their frequent appearances flanking their nephew on official events. ABC points out that the leader's aunt and uncle were present on stage when Kim reaffirmed his country's commitment to nuclear weapons during a speech on March 31.

This power couple appears to occasionally live through its version of drama, too. According to ABC, Jang did not support North Korea's long-range missile launch last December, ""but was overruled by his wife.""

Pak Pong Ju On Monday, North Korea appointed Pak Pong Ju as its new prime minister. The 70-year-old Pak has been a confidant to the Kim family and earlier served as prime minister from 2003 until 2007. He was tasked with implementing economic reforms to lift the country out of poverty, but was dismissed when the measures appeared to fail.

Pak is closely associated with Jang Song Thaek and Kim Kyong Hui, Reuters notes, and while his reappointment is meant to strengthen Kim's grip on power, it makes the young leader ""dangerously dependent"" on the power duo.

Ri Yong Ho Ri Yong Ho appeared to be one of the main beneficiaries of the political appointments in the wake of his Kim Jong Il's death. Ri became the head of the North Korean army, was a member of the Politburo and Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC).

Although Ri was initially considered close to the new leader, the army chief was dismissed from all official posts in July 2012. The BBC's Seoul correspondent Lucy Williamson noted at the time that while Ri's resignation was officially attributed to ""illness,"" a health crisis was unlikely the real reason for the purge. As the Crisis Group explains: ""Senior officials normally remain in office despite poor health, even terminal illness."" Kim Jong Un solidified his control of the army following Ri's removal.

Kim Kyok Sik Current Defense Minister Kim Kyok Sik, who succeeded Kim Jong Gak in 2012, has been described as a hardliner. The Chosun Ilbo writes that Kim previously had served as North Korea's army chief but was demoted in February 2009. He became corps commander at the Northern Limit Line and was reportedly involved in the attack on a South Korean submarine in 2010.

Kim Ki Nam Kim Ki Nam is a member of the KWP's Politburo and vice chairman of the Committee for Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland. The AP reports that the 83-year-old also serves as North Korea's main ideologue. As the Wall Street Journal explains, Kim heads the Propaganda and Agitation department, responsible for myth building and glorifying the ""Dear Leader.""

Updated 11:03 a.m. ET, 7/2

(CNN) - In a rare joint appearance, first lady Michelle Obama and Former first lady Laura Bush were on stage, laughing about shared experiences and giving advice to fellow first ladies–even talking about Michelle's 'bang backlash' that swept the nation.

The two women spoke at the First Ladies Summit in Africa on Tuesday, as President Barack Obama and the first family wrapped up their week-long trip to the fast-developing continent.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

First to address the crowd, Mrs. Bush began by acknowledging that she, Mrs. Obama, and the nine other African first ladies were voted into their role by one person, and that they can choose to take advantage of their positions.

""Lady Bird Johnson realized that she had a podium because her husband was president and she chose to use it,"" Mrs. Bush said. ""I know that the first ladies in this room are also using their podiums.""

Calling the women in the room 'advocates' and 'agents for change', Mrs. Bush announced the Bush Institute is now supporting efforts to continue bringing together these influential women, saying ""none of you needs to do it alone, that's why we are launching the First Ladies initiative at the Bush Institute."" Mrs. Bush said they will be convening the first ladies together annually ""to highlight the significant role they can play in addressing significant issues in their countries.""

The current first lady shared Mrs. Bush's sentiments.

""Being able to pursue our passions and do things that not only help our country and connect us with the rest of the world, it's a great privilege,"" Mrs. Obama said.

It's also a ""freeing and liberating opportunity"" from the tight security and restrictions the first family faces in the White House.

Asked by the moderator if she feels like a prisoner–a reference to Martha Washington, the first ever first lady, who told her niece she felt like a ""state prisoner""–Mrs. Obama jokingly replied: ""No, there are prison elements to it. But it's a really nice prison, so–""

""But with a chef,"" Mrs. Bush interjected, drawing laughs from the crowd.

""You can't complain,"" Mrs. Obama added, jovially. ""But there is definitely elements that are confining.""

However, she added, being first lady is better than being president.

""We have probably the best jobs in the world because, unlike our husbands who have to react and respond to crisis on a minute by minute basis, they come into office with a wonderful, profound agenda, then, they are faced with the real world. On the other hand, we get to work on what we are passionate about and that is something that I would encourage all first ladies to never lose sight of. You have an opportunity to speak to your passions and to really design and be very strategic about the issues you care about.""

Both first ladies agreed there can be distractions when they are really trying to get a point across. Mrs. Obama's fresh cut bangs, for example, threw the public into a media frenzy.

Mrs. Obama's advice? Stand strong by the issues you believe in.

""While people are sorting through our shoes and our hair and whether we cut it or not... whether we have bangs. Who would have thought? I didn't call that one...We take our bangs and we stand in front of important things that the world needs to see, and eventually people stop looking at the bangs and they start looking at what we are standing in front of,"" she said.

Mrs. Bush said she and her husband had many issues they were passionate about when George W. Bush first took office – but then, America was attacked on 9/11 and they had to put those goals on hold. Mrs. Bush said she stepped up to the microphone that evening and soon after addressing the nation on behalf of her husband, she realized the power of her position.

""Right after the attacks of September 11th, I gave the presidential radio address to talk about women in Afghanistan, and right after that I was in a department store with my daughter, Jenna; she was a freshman in college and I was in Austin seeing her and we went to a department store and the women who sold cosmetics at the department store said, 'thank you so much Mrs. Bush, thank you for speaking for the women in Afghanistan.' And that was the first time it really occurred to me that people really did hear me and that I really did have that podium that Lady Bird Johnson knew about and had told us about,"" she said.

That podium, however, does not extend into their husband's office. Mrs. Obama and Mrs. Bush were quick to concur that their husbands, as presidents, have no need for any more political advisers.

""I found that my husband needs time to be off, and the only time is when he walks into the doors of the residence and we sit down and we have a family dinner,"" Mrs. Obama said.

While the first ladies agree that it's not their place to criticize their husband's job performance, all bets are off when it comes to their daughters.

""You know, the fortunate thing about having young children and girls is that truly, they could care less...there are times when Malia is like, so what about climate change? What about the tigers?"" Mrs. Obama said.

In addition to support from one another, the first ladies of the world will also now have the Bush Institute's First Ladies Initiative to ""connect to one another and develop private-public partnerships,"" according to the Bush Initiative's website.

""I want to encourage every first lady to speak out and speak up and let people know, because people are watching and they are listening and you can be so constructive for your country if you speak up about issues that you think are important,"" Mrs. Bush said."

BANGALORE — In a morale booster for the governing Congress Party in New Delhi, its regional unit stormed into power in the south Indian state of Karnataka on Wednesday, as trends show, relegating the rival Bharatiya Janata Party, which governed the state for the last five years, to a distant second place.

As of Wednesday afternoon, as Sunday’s election results were being tallied in Karnataka, the Congress Party was winning or leading in 122 of the total 224 constituencies (of which the election process was suspended in one following the death of a candidate). Final results are due Wednesday night.

The regional election is one that a beleaguered Congress Party would like to view as a presage for a big fight for New Delhi, the upcoming Lok Sabha elections slated for mid-2014. Some analysts are going so far as to suggest that this is a trial round for the prime ministerial aspirants, Rahul Gandhi of the Congress Party and Narendra Modi of the B.J.P. Both campaigned in the regional elections but with restraint.

The B.J.P. suffered a humiliating defeat, trailing far behind the Congress Party with around 40 seats, ousted from the only state it has ruled in southern India. The result is widely being interpreted by analysts as a voter backlash against the scandal-ridden B.J.P. rule rather than a vote for the Congress. Over 70 percent of the state’s registered voters showed up to cast their ballot, a record turnout and the highest in 35 years.

In Bangalore, Karnataka’s capital, the government has paid scant attention to creating infrastructure or providing basic services like a reliable water supply and garbage clearance.

The B.J.P.’s losses offered a small reprieve to the Congress-led government in New Delhi, which is reeling under recent scandals dubbed Coalgate and Railgate, concerning the allocating of coal mining blocks and bribery allegations over a railways post. The uproar over these scandals has led the opposition B.J.P. to blockade parliamentary proceedings in recent days and the governing party to adjourn the Parliament session on Wednesday.

In Bangalore, the country’s job and technology hub, a chief minister has yet to be chosen by the Congress Party. Among the front-runners are Siddaramaiah, a widely respected local strongman from the backward classes, who is the party’s only mass leader. Also in the running are two Karnataka ministers in the New Delhi government, Labor Minister Mallikarjuna Kharge and Petroleum Minister Veerappa Moily.

Another potential candidate, G. Parameshwara, appeared headed for defeat in the election, thus taking himself out of contention."

Friedman'],This Ain’t Yogurt - The New York Times,"AN Arab friend remarked to me that watching the United States debate how much to get involved in Syria reminded him of an Arab proverb: “If you burn your tongue once eating soup, for the rest of your life you’ll blow on your yogurt.”

After burning our tongues in Iraq and Afghanistan, and watching with increasing distress the aftermath of the revolutions in Libya, Tunisia and Egypt, President Obama is right to be cautious about getting burned in Damascus. We’ve now seen enough of these Arab transitions from autocracy to draw some crucial lessons about what it takes to sustain positive change in these countries. We ignore the lessons at our peril — especially the lesson of Iraq, which everyone just wants to forget but is hugely relevant.

Syria is Iraq’s twin: an artificial state that was also born after World War I inside lines drawn by imperial powers. Like Iraq, Syria’s constituent communities — Sunnis, Alawite/Shiites, Kurds, Druze, Christians — never volunteered to live together under agreed rules. So, like Iraq, Syria has been ruled for much of its modern history by either a colonial power or an iron-fisted autocrat. In Iraq, the hope was that once the iron-fisted dictator was removed by us it would steadily transition to a multisectarian, multiparty democracy. Ditto for Egypt, Libya, Tunisia and Yemen.

But we now see the huge difference between Eastern Europe in 1989 and the Arab world in 2013. In most of Eastern Europe, the heavy lid of communist authoritarian rule was suppressing broad and deeply rooted aspirations for democracy. So when that lid was removed, most of these countries relatively quickly moved to freely elected governments — helped and inspired by the European Union."

In fact, Enrile remains active, as he has yet to miss United Nationalist Alliance's provincial campaigns.



“I’m used to it (campaigns). I’ve gone around the country seven times already standing on a pick-up but I do not know. Only God knows (if I’m strong enough),” Enrile said.

In an interview, he said drinking virgin coconut oil and eating organic food help him keep up.



“I drink malunggay juice… as a matter of precaution at my age. And then I eat pasteurized celery, squash, carrots, and onions together. They juice it and then I drink it,” Enrile said.



He was also reportedly a fan of stem-cell therapy.



However, Enrile doesn't want to push himself too far and is actually mulling to quit politics come 2016.



Enrile, who still has three more years to finish his term as senator, announced he will be leaving the political scene by 2016.



“This will be my last senatorial campaign because I’m leaving the Senate already. I just need to complete my term if God will allow me and leave the scene,” Enrile told reporters.



“I will have to leave the Senate because I'm no longer young. Let the younger people take over,” he added.



The top official in the United Nationalist Alliance (UNA) has been joining the opposition coalition’s sorties to help in the senatorial bid of his son, Cagayan Rep. Juan Ponce “Jack” Enrile.



He has also been going around the country endorsing other candidates running under Vice President Jejomar Binay’s line-up, a few weeks before the official start of campaign period began on February 12.



Meanwhile, Enrile also cannot help but compare the modes of campaigning during the time he was just starting out in politics.



He explained that new culture in political campaign today such as the use of social media, as well as the need for more television and radio ads, cannot compete with physical interaction with voters.



“Now, you have the Twitter, the Facebook, the blogs and all the internet so that additional instruments of reaching the people communicating with them,” Enrile said.



“You can use that but you cannot substitute your going to the people directly. They want to see who you are, they want to see you face to face. Whether you quack like a duck or walk like a duck,” he added.

Ms. Napolitano, a former Arizona governor who for four and a half years shaped the administration’s response to hurricanes, terrorist attacks, illegal immigration and a catastrophic oil spill, will leave in September to become president of the University of California system. Ms. Napolitano had her eye on becoming the next attorney general, but now is taking herself out of the Washington arena.

Her departure deprives the administration of one of its most prominent voices on immigration even as it is in the throes of pushing Congress for an overhaul that would provide a pathway to citizenship for most of the 11 million foreigners who are here illegally. Ms. Napolitano said she decided to leave only after concluding that her absence would not affect chances for the immigration legislation, a person close to her said, but confirmation of a successor could become wrapped up in the larger immigration debate.

Her move west creates an opening that could be hard for President Obama to fill. The secretary of homeland security presides over a sprawling department that was created after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, by combining nearly two dozen agencies as varied as the Secret Service, the Transportation Security Administration, the Coast Guard and the Federal Emergency Management Agency."

Underlying the discussion was a simple fact: It was an election year. And Mr. Obama might lose.

For nearly four years, the president had waged a relentless war from the skies against Al Qaeda and its allies, and he trusted that he had found what he considered a reasonable balance even if his critics did not see it that way. But now, he told his aides, he wanted to institutionalize what in effect had been an ad hoc war, effectively shaping the parameters for years to come “whether he was re-elected or somebody else became president,” as one aide said.

Ultimately, he would decide to write a new playbook that would scale back the use of drones, target only those who really threatened the United States, eventually get the C.I.A. out of the targeted killing business and, more generally, begin moving the United States past the “perpetual war” it had waged since Sept. 11, 2001. Whether the policy shifts will actually accomplish that remains to be seen, given vague language and compromises forced by internal debate, but they represent an effort to set the rules even after he leaves office.

“We’ve got this technology, and we’re not going to be the only ones to use it,” said a senior White House official who, like others involved, declined to be identified talking about internal deliberations. “We have to set standards so it doesn’t get abused in the future.”"

The reporter interviewing Hagel then asked, ""So in general then, you could see yourself favoring a ban on assault weapons?"" Hagel responded, ""Yes."" Hagel said Wednesday that he should have never answered that question without reading the bill. The Omaha investment banker said that was a lesson he learned.

""It's a bad bill,"" Hagel said. If he were in the Senate, Hagel said he would vote to repeal the ban."

(CNN) —

If any doubt remains that the world stands shivering in a cold moral vacuum – devoid of meaningful leadership – they are quickly fading.

The starkest example came in Washington on Tuesday, when President Barack Obama, inarguably the world’s most powerful man, stood before the press and recited a series of positions, some of them built on solid moral arguments, only to conclude that there is not much he can do to turn them into reality.

Obama explained at length why the world cannot tolerate the use of chemical weapons in Syria, why the U.S. should not keep open the prison at Guantanamo Bay, why Washington is acting foolishly with the infamous “sequester” – the blunt and unjust budget cutter. But then he went on to explain just how difficult it is to do anything to solve these problems.

The president is smart and eloquent. But leadership, especially for someone who has achieved that level of power, requires three elements: It must communicate a clear vision and a commitment to its realization; it must mobilize and inspire others into action; and it must produce results.

Proclaiming high standards only to leave them unachieved demoralizes those you might have hoped to inspire. Rather than bending the arc of history toward justice, it unleashes a chain reaction of disenchantment.

Consider the Guantanamo prison. You might have thought Obama was a candidate again when he declared, just as he did years ago on the campaign trail that America must shut down the prison. Holding prisoners without charges and trial, he said persuasively, is “contrary to who we are.” It’s not just an ethical question, it is a practical matter. “It hurts us in terms of our international standing. It lessens cooperation with our allies on counterterrorism efforts. It is a recruitment tool for extremists. It needs to be closed.”

He might have added that Guantanamo is also the world’s most expensive prison, costing about $800,000 per prisoner per year, or some $800 million each year.

Everyone knows that Congress has made it difficult to close the prison. But legal experts say the Obama administration could do much more and, in fact, “has done little to make good on [its] promise” to shut down the prison. The executive branch, as legal expert David Cole notes, has a number of options, including prosecuting detainees or declaring the transfer of some detainees to other countries is “in the national security interest” of the U.S.

Obama came to office with a mandate to restore America’s standing in the world. He went a long way in achieving that simply by not being George W. Bush, but it’s difficult to point to real successes in fulfilling his pledge to exert moral leadership.

America and the rest of the world seem frozen in place with major institutions and personalities incapable of responding to challenges.

One can argue that it is not America’s job to fix the world’s problems, to stop the killings in distant lands even if, as we now know, those killings involve horrific weapons banned by international agreements that set a limit to our inhumanity even in times of war.

I am referring to Syria, which allegedly used chemical weapons in a two-year-old civil war. Taking action to stop the use of chemical weapons is in the interest of everyone on earth, with the possible exception of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Chemical weapons can kill in more brutal ways than other instruments of death. And if they are successfully used, dictators and terrorists will make more of them. They make us all less safe.

Since this problem is not just America’s, perhaps we should leave it up to others to act. But who?

Who in the world today has the moral standing and the practical ability to take meaningful action? It would be nice if the conscience of humanity had a way to express itself and make a difference. The obvious place would be the United Nations and its Security Council. But the UNSC is hopelessly mired in power struggles. On this as in so many other issues, the power politics involving Russia, China and the U.S. stop the world from speaking out with one voice.

Obama had repeatedly drawn a “red line” on the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime, warning President Bashar al-Assad that using or moving chemical stockpiles was the one thing that would “change my calculus” on that war.

The “red line” has become an object of tragicomic ridicule, especially after Tuesday’s press conference. Cartoonists in the Middle East and elsewhere are joking about Obama and his red line, depicting the Syrian dictator painting a red line right over the American president’s face.

During his press conference, the president seemed to backtrack. What initially seemed like a clear, if controversial, position suddenly became so complicated and hazy that even the Washington Post editorial board called it a “muddle.”

Eventually, the United States will have to take a stand and help Syria’s rebels, without sending American troops into its civil war. But so far, Obama’s equivocations are exposing America’s self-proclaimed place as “leader of the free world” to ridicule.

Sure, Obama faces a stubborn Congress that makes his life difficult. And Americans’ exhaustion with wars overseas undoubtedly makes him more reluctant to act, but the president’s persuasive powers can be deployed to good effect, especially since meaningful results can be achieved without the proverbial American boots on the ground.

Of course, the problems he has to deal with are difficult and often offer choices between bad and worse. But the time is right for a new display of conviction, of effectiveness, of leadership.

In a speech Thursday at the National Defense University in Washington, Obama said he would narrow the use of drone attacks against suspected terrorists and seek to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who serves on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said on Fox News on Sunday that he had “never been more worried about national security” and called the president “tone deaf” on the issue.

“I see a big difference between the president saying the war’s at an end and whether or not you’ve won the war,” said Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.). “We have still tremendous threats out there, that are building — not declining, building — and to not recognize that, I think, is dangerous in the long run and dangerous for the world.”

Democrats such as Sen. Charles Schumer of New York defended the President’s anti-terrorism policy, contending that the revised approach would address concerns about the lack of transparency in the deployment of drones without sacrificing security.

“There are new types of threats that we have to be vigilant about. But he said, under this long-term war on terror, where small groups of individuals can hurt us, we need some rules,” Schumer said. “We need some rules, we need some transparency, so American citizens and the citizens of the world know we’re not just going willy-nilly. Having transparency, having rules and engaging other activities other than military to help curb the war on terror — diplomacy, economic sanctions and things like that — is going to be useful as well.”

Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) has bucked his party’s support of wide-ranging drone strikes, in March leading a filibuster in the Senate over concerns that the government could kill U.S. citizens with drone strikes without giving them due process.

On ABC’s “This Week,” Paul said that the president’s pivot on drone strikes did not satisfy his qualms. “Due process to most of us is a court of law. It’s a trial by a jury,” Paul said. “And right now their process is him looking at some flashcards and a PowerPoint presentation on ‘Terror Tuesdays’ in the White House. For a lot of us, that’s not really due process.”

Guests on the Sunday talk shows spoke of the various scandals that buffeted the Obama administration this week, including the Internal Revenue Service’s greater scrutiny of conservative nonprofits and the Justice Department’s wiretapping of journalists to whom administration officials had leaked national security information. The only issue that seemed to escape partisanship on the Sunday shows was sexual assault in the military, after disturbing news in recent weeks from all branches of the armed forces. Guests on the talk shows from both parties commended Obama for bringing up the issue at the Naval Academy graduation last week and agreed that strong steps needed to be taken against offenders."

She was admitted to hospital Sunday after blood clot was discovered

A date for Clinton's return to the State Department has not been set



Medical team says Clinton will fully recover

WASHINGTON (AP) — Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton was released from a New York hospital on Wednesday, three days after doctors discovered a blood clot in her head.

Clinton's medical team advised her Wednesday evening that she was making good progress on all fronts and said they are confident she will fully recover, said Clinton spokesman Philippe Reines. Doctors had been treating Clinton with blood thinners to dissolve a clot in a vein that runs through the space between the brain and the skull behind the right ear.

""She's eager to get back to the office,"" Reines said in a statement, adding that the secretary and her family are grateful for the excellent care she received at New York-Presbyterian Hospital.

Reines said details of when Clinton will return to work will be clarified in the coming days.

Clinton had been in the hospital since Sunday, when doctors discovered the clot on an MRI test during a follow-up exam stemming from a concussion she suffered earlier in December. While at home battling a stomach virus, Clinton had fainted, fallen and struck her head, a spokesman said.

""Grateful my Mom discharged from the hospital and is heading home,"" the secretary's daughter, Chelsea, wrote on Twitter. ""Even more grateful her medical team (is) confident she'll make a full recovery.""

Earlier on Wednesday, the State Department said Clinton had been speaking by telephone with staff in Washington and reviewing paperwork while in the hospital.

""She's been quite active on the phone with all of us,"" said State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland.

Before being released from the hospital, Clinton was photographed Wednesday getting into a black van with her husband, Bill, Chelsea and a security contingent to be taken elsewhere on the sprawling hospital campus. The last time Clinton had been seen publicly was on Dec. 7.

Clinton's physicians had said Monday that there was no neurological damage but that they planned to keep her in the hospital while they established the proper dose for the blood thinners. They said Clinton, 65, had been in good spirits and was engaging with doctors, family and aides.

Sidelined by her illness for most of December, Clinton was absent on Dec. 21 when President Barack Obama nominated Democratic Sen. John Kerry to succeed her when she steps down at the start of Obama's second term, as had long been planned. The illness also forced to cancel scheduled testimony before Congress about a scathing report into the attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans, although she could still testify in the future.

""She has said that she is open"" to going before Congress, Nuland said Wednesday, while Clinton was still hospitalized. ""We are working with them now on their schedule, because there's also a question of when they are going to be in.""

Clinton had expected to return to work this week and had already started to resume regular phone contact with her foreign counterparts. On Saturday, the day before the clot was discovered, Clinton had a half-hour conversation with Lakhdar Brahimi, the U.N. envoy to Syria, in which the two discussed the state of affairs in that country, her spokeswoman said.

Also on Saturday, Clinton spoke by telephone with Qatari Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Hamad bin Jassim Al Thani, discussing recent developments in Syria, Afghanistan and the Palestinian territories.

The illness has also raised questions about Clinton's political future and how her health might influence her decision about whether to run for president in 2016, as prominent Democrats have been urging her to consider.

Clinton suffered from a blood clot in 1998, midway through her husband's second term as president, although that clot was located in her knee."

But parties generally don’t get to reformulate their appeal from scratch. While Republicans can’t win with their base alone, they also can’t win without it. Religious conservatives, for example, are the single largest constituency within the GOP, and compose about a quarter of the entire electorate. Such voters are not baggage thrown overboard to lighten the ship; they are planks in the hull.

While the [abortion] vote offered a chance for members from socially conservative districts to flex their political muscles, some moderate Republicans grumbled about the leadership’s decision to hold a vote on a controversial measure with no chance of going beyond the House. “I think a lot of people are shaking their heads and not understanding why we’re doing this,” said one GOP official, who added that votes on hot-button social issues don’t help the party maintain much-needed Republican seats in moderate districts.

Republican Rep. Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania bluntly told The New York Times that the vote is “a stupid idea.”

They can't read polls , either. If you read Politico during 2012, you might have thought Romney was in contention. Mike Gerson has some words of wisdom to share on the Republican Party:Read that, then read this from MSNBC Every election matters. See 2010. But this is an example of Gerson's playing to the base.

Bigger picture from Gallup:

Americans still rate the Republican Party less favorably than the Democratic Party, 39% vs. 46%. But both parties' ratings are down from November 2012. The Democrats' rating dropped more, from 51% just after President Barack Obama won re-election. Americans' ratings of the Democratic Party are now more on par with readings earlier in 2012, while their ratings of the GOP are the lowest since May 2010.

There’s some interesting sleight of hand here. Note that Boehner seems more focused on enforcement and border security than on citizenship. The Speaker is claiming that if a majority of House Republicans thinks the emerging proposal isn’t tough enough on border security, then the House won’t vote on it. But the real Rubicon House Republicans must cross is the path to citizenship. What happens if a majority of House Republicans can’t support the path to citizenship, no matter how tough the border security elements are made? In that scenario, if Boehner holds to his vow, the House wouldn’t vote on anything that includes citizenship, right? And that scenario very well may come to pass. Someone needs to ask the Speaker: If a majority of House Republicans can’t accept a path to citizenship, will you really not allow a House vote on any emerging proposal that contains one?

Democrats on the House Oversight Committee have just released a full transcript of testimony from a key witness in the investigation of IRS targeting of conservatives — and it appears to confirm that the initial targeting did originate with a low-level employee in the Cincinnati office.

It also shows a key witness and IRS screening manager – a self described conservative Republican — denying any communication with the White House or senior IRS officials about the targeting.

and Greg Sargent The IRS, like Benghazi, is a nothingburger used for partisan reasons by the GOP. That conclusion is based on a Congressional investigation, not reflexive. Good to look. We looked. Dismissed.

PS Responsible journalists will mention that every time they bring up this disproven ""scandal""."

Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants and potential 2016 presidential candidate, said roughly 95 percent of the bill is in “perfect shape” and that the full chamber debates are off to a good start.

However, he expressed concerns about whether the legislation ensures adequate border security and said Americans have “valid issues” about the matter.

""The vast majority of Americans, the vast majority of conservative Republicans, are prepared to support immigration reform, but only if we can ensure that we're not going to have another wave of illegal immigration in the future,"" he told ABC’s “This Week.""

He declined to say whether he would vote for the measure unless changes are made.

South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, who also helped write the bipartisan immigration bill, told NBC’s “Meet the Press” that conservatives trying to block the measure will doom the party and all but guarantee a Democrat will remain in the White House after the 2016 elections.

""After eight years of President Obama's economic policies, and quite frankly foreign policy, people are going to be looking around,"" he said. ""But if we don't pass immigration reform, if we don't get it off the table in a reasonable, practical way, it doesn't matter who you run in 2016. We're in a demographic death spiral as a party and the only way we can get back in good graces with the Hispanic community in my view is pass comprehensive immigration reform. If you don't do that, it really doesn't matter who we run.""

A Democrat also involved in crafting the bill, New Jersey Sen. Robert Menendez, went a step further by predicting on CNN’s “State of the Union” that ""there'll never be a road to the White House for the Republican Party"" if immigration overhaul fails to pass.

The Senate last week overcame a procedural hurdle in moving forward on the first immigration overhaul in a generation.

Lawmakers from both parties' voted to begin formal debate on a proposal that would give an estimated 11 million immigrants in the U.S. illegally a long and difficult path to citizenship.

The legislation also creates a low-skilled guest-worker program, expands the number of visas available for high-tech workers and de-emphasizes family ties in the system for legal immigration that has been in place for decades. It also sets border security goals that the government must meet before immigrants living in the U.S. illegally are granted any change in status.

In addition to tougher border-security measures, Republicans are demanding stricter standards for who qualifies for government programs such as Social Security and health care.

Rubio is trying to balance concerns from his party's conservative flank that has great sway in picking a nominee with the political attempt to win over Hispanic and Asian American voters who overwhelmingly favored President Obama's re-election in 2012.

Further complicating Rubio's presidential aspirations, the Republican-led House is considering its own version of immigration proposals that more closely follow their own perspective, which hews toward Tea Party principles.

In 2012, Obama won re-election with the backing of 71 percent of Hispanic voters and 73 percent of Asian voters. A thwarted immigration overhaul could send those voting blocs more solidly to Democrats' side in future elections. That has led some Republican lawmakers to support immigration reform, but the party's conservative base still opposes any legislation that would create a pathway to citizenship for immigrants living here illegally.

Democrats are well aware of the numbers.

""I would tell my Republican colleagues, both in the House and the Senate, that the road to the White House comes through a road with a pathway to legalization,"" Menendez said. ""Without it, there'll never be a road to the White House for the Republican Party.""

http://news.yahoo.com/house-passes-measure-deport-young-114320823.html,,[],House passes measure to deport young immigrants,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican-controlled House voted Thursday to resume the deportation of hundreds of thousands of immigrants brought illegally to the United States as children, a largely symbolic move in the first immigration-related vote in either chamber of Congress this year and a measure of the daunting challenge facing supporters of a sweeping overhaul of existing law on the subject.

The party-line vote of 224-201 was aimed at blocking implementation of President Barack Obama's 2012 election-year order to stop deportations of many so-called DREAM Act individuals. Democrats on the House floor reacted with boos when the provision was added to a routine spending bill for the Department of Homeland Security.

The administration has threatened to veto the overall legislation on budgetary grounds. It nevertheless stood as a stark warning from conservatives who dominate the ranks of the Republican House majority about attempts in the Senate to grant a chance at citizenship to an estimated 11 million immigrants residing in the country illegally.

And the White House reacted sharply, saying the House-passed measure would affect ""Dreamers"" who are ""productive members of society who were brought here as young children, grew up in our communities, and became American in every way but on paper.""

Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, said in a statement that the vote prohibits the administration ""from implementing executive amnesty"" without congressional action. ""Bipartisan support for my amendment is the first test of the 113th Congress in the House of Representatives on immigration. My amendment blocks many of the provisions that are mirrored in the Senate's 'Gang of Eight' bill. If this position holds, no amnesty will reach the President's desk,"" he said.

The vote took place as Senate leaders set Friday for the opening of debate on White House-backed legislation that would create a chance at citizenship for those in the country unlawfully, at the same time it takes steps to assure the borders are secure against future illegal immigration.

Story continues

The measure was drafted by a bipartisan group of eight senators, then approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee last month on a vote of 13-8. It also creates a new low-skilled guest-worker program, expands the number of visas available for high-tech industry workers and reorders the system for legal immigration that has been in place for decades.

Debate is expected to consume weeks on the Senate floor as lawmakers of differing views try to change it more to their liking. Notably, Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican who was part of the group that drafted the legislation, is saying he wants changes before he will support it on final passage. His office did not respond to a request for reaction to the House vote.

In the House, 221 Republicans and three Democrats voted for King's proposal, while 195 Democrats and six Republicans opposed it.

""I can't believe they just did that,"" said Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., a leading supporter of the DREAM Act. Ana Avendano of the AFL-CIO, said in a statement that King and his allies are playing to ""a dwindling base of anti-immigrant Republican primary voters. We hope and expect that the leadership of the Republican party will understand that this is not only abhorrent policy but suicidal politics.""

Speaking to a group of reporters, a White House official, Cecilia Munoz, said, ""If part of what is driving this debate is a recognition, particularly on the Republican side, that they need to do better with the Latino community, this is really not the right way.""

Obama announced a new policy in June 2012 that puts off deportation for two years for many of those brought to the United States as children, specifically if they were under 16 at the time and are no older than 31 now. They also must be in school, graduated from high school or have served in the military and have no criminal record. The order offers relief from deportation from many young immigrants who would be covered by the so-called DREAM Act, which has repeatedly failed in Congress.

Democrats argued vociferously against King's proposal when it was debated Wednesday evening. ""We should not hold children responsible for the actions of adults and their parents. We should give them an opportunity,"" said Rep. Luis Gutierrez, an Illinois Democrat who has been involved in a sputtering attempt to produce a compromise immigration bill in the House.

Those efforts were dealt a potentially fatal blow on Wednesday, when Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, announced he was leaving the group because of a dispute over health care.

House GOP leaders have not yet announced a plan for considering immigration legislation, although it appears likely that several smaller bills will be considered rather than a comprehensive measure that covers the elements that are combined into one in the Senate.

One of them, introduced during the day by Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., permits state and local authorities to enforce federal immigration laws.

There is little, if any, support among the GOP rank and file for a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million or so immigrants estimated to be living in the United States illegally, although there appears to be some sentiment to allow many such individuals to remain in the country.

Speaker John Boehner has said privately he hopes to have committee action complete by the end of June, with a vote in the House by the end of July.

(CNN) - As Congress prepared to return to immigration reform next week, the debate over the issue continued Sunday, with the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee saying the Senate bill just throws ""a bunch of candy"" at the border ""to gain votes.""

""What the Senate just passed was, again, a bunch of candy thrown down there - a bunch of assets thrown down there to gain votes, but without a methodical, smart border approach. We want a smart border; we also want a smart immigration plan - something that makes sense,"" Rep. Mike McCaul, R-Texas, said on CBS's ""Face the Nation.""



The Senate passed a bipartisan immigration reform bill last month, 68-32. House Republicans will meet behind closed doors on Wednesday to discuss their next steps on the issue, but Republican leaders in the House say the bill is a nonstarter in their chamber, considering it includes a pathway to citizenship for most undocumented immigrants.

Meanwhile, a bipartisan group in the House is working on a separate immigration proposal, requiring border security be improved before citizenship provisions kick in. House Speaker John Boehner has said that lawmakers will craft their own bill or series of bills, separate from the Senate legislation.

The Senate bill included a last-minute, bipartisan amendment calling for tighter border security, to make the overall legislation more acceptable to Republicans.

McCaul called the amendment ""not a responsible plan.""

""I believe it was hatched at the last minute to get votes to pass in the Senate,"" he said.

Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, also took issue with the amendment allowing the administration to ""determine when the border is secure."" Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano has already said the border is secure, he pointed out.

""I think immigration reform is necessary,"" he said on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ""My concern with the Senate bill is that they put the legalization of 11 million people ahead of security. The legalization happens first, and then the security happens second. And I think the American people are not going to stand for that.""

Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, said he hopes Republicans take up the Senate bill and insisted that Senate Republicans are not trying to ""dictate"" how House Republicans act on the legislation.

""We hope and pray that our Republican colleagues will take up the issue, and we can join together, Republicans and Democrats,"" he said, also appearing on ""Face the Nation."" ""I believe that if they can come up with a bill we would be more than eager to negotiate with them. A failure to act is de facto amnesty for 11 million people living in the shadows.""

But if Republicans fail to pass the Senate bill, will it hurt the party on the national front?

Asked if Senate Democrats are setting House Republicans up to fail, McCaul said, ""My concern is that the political backdrop could be to see this fail in the House, so that they can blame the House of Representatives for that and then try to take back the House of Representatives.""

The 1,200-page bill, which now faces a stern test in the Republican-controlled House, carries a $50 billion price tag. It would double the number of U.S. Border Patrol agents along the southern border and require the construction of 700 miles of fencing there. It also would place new burdens on employers, who would be required to check the legal status of all job applicants using the government’s E-Verify system.

Senators approved the plan 68 to 32, capping more than six months of negotiations that began behind closed doors and concluded with almost a month of debate on the Senate floor. Fourteen Republicans voted with every member of the Senate Democratic caucus to approve the bill — an impressive bipartisan margin in a chamber that has become sharply partisan.

“Before the American people give up on the Congress, look at what we achieved today in a bipartisan fashion,” said Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.), a key member of a group of Democrats and Republicans who wrote the bill.

But the path ahead is likely to be increasingly acrimonious because the bill is now in the hands of the House, where intense GOP opposition threatens to kill it outright.

View Graphic What happens next with the immigration bill?

House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) on Thursday laid down stern conditions for what kind of immigration bill he would allow the House to vote on, and it was not the one that came of out the Senate.

Boehner said that any bill would need majority support among his GOP colleagues before it could get a vote in the House. “For any legislation, including a conference report, to pass the House, it’s going to have to be a bill that has the support of the majority of our members,” he said. Recent history suggests that assembling such a majority will be difficult to achieve.

If the Senate legislation were to be signed into law, it would set millions of eligible immigrants on a 13-year course toward achieving permanent residency status or U.S. citizenship, but it would also require them to pay thousands of dollars in fines and back taxes.

Before those things could happen, however, the federal government would be required to spend tens of billions of dollars fortifying the U.S. border with Mexico with thousands of new federal agents as well as radar and unmanned aerial drones to track illegal border crossings. The Department of Homeland Security also would have to establish a biometric tracking system at the nation’s 30 largest airports.

Rep. Peter Roskam (Ill.), a deputy GOP whip, on Thursday labeled the Senate bill a “pipe dream” that won’t come up for a vote in the House.

“The House has no capacity to move that bill in its entirety,” Roskam said at a breakfast hosted by the National Review. “It just won’t happen.”

Most conservative Republicans have dismissed the Senate bill as insufficient in its attempts to protect the southern border and not tough enough on people who have broken U.S. laws.

To mark the significance of the Senate vote, Vice President Biden presided over the chamber while Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) made the rare request that senators sit at their assigned desks and stand to vote during the roll call.

After the last vote was cast, there was a long pause. The chamber was unusually packed. Several House lawmakers had joined staffers along the walls, and above, the public galleries were at capacity. One section was full of young people wearing blue T-shirts that read: “11 Million Dreams.”

After Biden read the final tally, some spectators clapped but were quickly quieted. The silence did not last.

“Yes we can! Yes we can!” the group in blue chanted.

“Thank you!” shouted a man wearing a graduation gown.

President Obama, traveling in Africa, hailed the results.

“Nobody got everything they wanted. Not Democrats. Not Republicans. Not me,” Obama said. “But the Senate bill is consistent with the key principles for common-sense reform that I — and many others — have repeatedly laid out.”

“Today, the Senate did its job,” he added. “It’s now up to the House to do the same.”

But House Republicans have adopted a piecemeal approach to the immigration issue, departing sharply from the comprehensive strategy carried out by the Senate.

On Thursday, the House Judiciary Committee approved a proposal for visas for high-skilled workers. Earlier, the panel backed legislation that would make it a federal crime to be in the United States illegally and a new agricultural guest-worker program that differs from the Senate proposal.

Anticipating the House-Senate divide, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said after the vote that he had a simple request of his former House colleagues: “We ask for your consideration and we stand ready to sit down and negotiate with you.”

The political consequences going into the 2014 and 2016 election years could be significant. Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.), who worked with McCain on the bill, reminded his fellow GOP colleagues that failure to agree on immigration reform could spell more trouble for the party at the polls.

“Self-deportation as a policy of the Republican Party is in our rearview mirror, thank God,” he said, recalling Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who suggested last year that illegal immigrants would “self-deport” when they realized they couldn’t get jobs without proper legal documentation. Many in the GOP saw Romney’s comment as an example of the many ways in which the party had alienated Latino voters, thereby costing itself support at the polls.

Thursday’s vote would not have been possible without the “Gang of Eight,” which united McCain and Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), two of the chamber’s most high-profile senators, with Durbin, Graham, Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.).

After releasing the group’s compromise agreement with great fanfare in April, its members helped approve significant changes over 37 hours of deliberations in the Senate Judiciary Committee that spread over three weeks. Debate did not go as smoothly when it began in the full Senate this month. Party leaders often clashed over how many amendments would be considered and whether those proposals would require a simple majority or a supermajority of 60 votes to pass.

Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), who voted against the bill Thursday, complained that it “came about as a direct result of the fact that the forces that shaped it had goals that were important to them, but these goals are not coterminous with, they’re not in harmony with, the nation as a whole. The realpolitik gang that put it together seemed fine with that.”

The agreement would increase the number of visas available to high-skilled workers, most of whom work in the fields of science and technology, and also to lower-skilled people who take jobs in the construction and hospitality industries. Immigrant farmworkers also would be admitted under a temporary guest-worker program.

A cross section of society — dairy farmers, educators, religious leaders, labor officials and corporate titans, including Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer — hailed the Senate vote and called on the House to debate the immigration issue in an equally bipartisan fashion.

McCain credited the coalition of supporters, “not ever assembled before,” for helping push the Senate to act.

“What we’re going to have to do if we want to see this bill through to fruition is to have that coalition out there working actively on behalf of this legislation,” McCain said.

For generations, the West was a Republican stronghold, the land of Goldwater and Reagan and sagebrush rebels. But a change began under President Clinton and was hastened under President Obama, who twice added Nevada and Colorado to the Democrats’ stable of support in the West.

The reason, in short, is Latino voters.

The rise of Latino power, which began in California as a backlash to the heated rhetoric surrounding Proposition 187, the 1994 anti-illegal-immigration initiative, has steadily spread eastward, giving once-red states a distinctly more blue tinge.

There may be no better illustration than California’s next-door neighbor.

Obama won Nevada in 2008 by a whopping 12 percentage points. By all rights, however, Republican Mitt Romney should have been strongly competitive there in 2012. He had an organizational base among the state’s large Mormon population, and Nevada has been an economic basket case for years, with jobless, foreclosure and bankruptcy rates that set a national standard for awfulness.

Obama carried the state, however, winning in November by more than 6 percentage points.

Strong Latino support is one reason. What happened in Nevada reflected the results nationwide: The percentage of Latino voters grew to 18% of the electorate, from 15% in 2008, and Obama won their support by a crushingly large margin.

Immigration has become the Democrats’ wedge issue, drawing small-business-owning and culturally conservative Latinos away from the GOP in the way Republicans long used abortion and other contentious social issues to pry working-class Democrats away from their party moorings.

As an added political benefit to Democrats, the issue of illegal immigration splits the GOP between enforcement-only hard-liners and advocates of a more balanced approach that would mix fortified borders with some path to citizenship for the millions of immigrants in the United States illegally. To hard-liners, that amounts to amnesty for lawbreakers and an unacceptable capitulation to Obama and his fellow Democrats.

The president used last week’s inaugural address to signal that immigration reform, one of the unfulfilled promises of his first term, would no longer be overlooked.

America’s journey “is not complete until we find a better way to welcome the striving, hopeful immigrants who still see America as a land of opportunity,” he said to strong applause from the hundreds of thousands gathered on the National Mall.

Latinos in Congress who met with Obama on Friday said the president described the issue as his top legislative priority.

Obama’s remarks in Las Vegas are likely to cover proposals he has called for in the past: tougher border security, a crackdown on employers who hire illegal workers and a way for undocumented immigrants to responsibly “earn” their way to U.S. citizenship. More details are expected in the president’s State of the Union address on Feb. 12.

The political message on Tuesday, however, may be more significant than the substance.

The goal for Democrats is to lock in their strong Latino support and the votes of succeeding generations, the way the party has in California, so candidates can devote more time and resources to red states like Arizona and Texas that should, the demographics suggest, grow more competitive in 2016 and beyond.

Obama may have run his last election campaign. But one thing he would like to bequeath to fellow Democrats is a solid electoral college base rooted in the West to offset the advantage Republicans enjoy across the South.

His Las Vegas appearance is a step toward that second-term goal.

According to a report in the National Journal, House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH), House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-VA), and House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) think the “tactical play” will “boost” the reform’s changes.

Breitbart News reporter Matthew Boyle reported ten days ago that House Republicans were planning to pass various piecemeal bills and hope to conference with the Senate to get a more comprehensive bill enacted. Conservatives expressed to Boyle their concerns that conferencing with senators–and potentially the White House–would transform whatever is passed in the House into something resembling the Senate’s bill, which Numbers USA Executive Director Roy Beck said, on Breitbart News Sunday, was an “end of America” bill.

Last Friday, Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) essentially made the strategy public at a town hall event in his district, confirming Boyle’s reporting.

National Journal noted that House Republican leaders wanted to keep immigration “on the back-burner” to lessen the type of “backlash” that coalesced against Obamacare in August 2009.

As Politico reported, five “a la carte” immigration bills have already passed two key committees in the House while the Senate was debating its immigration bill.

Bills passed in either the Homeland Security or Judiciary Committees include a border security bill that has weaker provisions than the Senate’s, a plan to award 500,000 visas to agricultural workers, which “can be adjusted according to market needs,” a bill to lift the current cap on high-skilled visas, a bill to give states more power to enforce federal immigration laws, and an E-Verify trigger that will make newly-legalized immigrants “undocumented” again if E-Verify is not in place by five years."

Ask Lyndon Johnson or George W. Bush. Or Harry Truman. Unending, seemingly pointless wars are the one sure way to ruin a presidency.

Now, I’m not saying that’s in the cards; in fact, I don’t think it is. I’m just saying: that’s the kind of thing that really does matter a lot to presidencies. And if you do believe that the administration is going down a path that winds up there, or a path that has a high risk of winding up there, then you should be very worried about the health of this presidency.

If not? None of the other permutations here are anywhere close to that kind of threat to the Obama presidency. Presidents lose key votes which are then mostly forgotten all the time. They pursue policies which poll badly, but are then mostly forgotten, all the time."

John McCain (R-AZ) gave the clearest indication that proponents of comprehensive immigration reform may make their final–and strongest–push to get legislation passed next year after House Republicans make it through their primaries.

“I think conventional wisdom is that time is not on our side,” McCain told reporters on Monday after an event in Chicago. “But there are a number of members of Congress who have primaries and when those primaries are done, they may be more inclined to address the issue of comprehensive immigration reform.”

President Barack Obama has urged Congress to pass immigration reform legislation this year. House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) is reportedly going to bring legislation to the floor within the next month and other House Republican leaders have indicated support for piecemeal pieces of legislation that can make it to conference with the Senate, where proponents and opponents of immigration reform had said a pathway to citizenship will prevail.

Though the Congressional Budget Office has determined the Senate’s immigration bill would lower the wages of working class Americans, House Republicans are reportedly working on piecemeal pieces of legislation to eventually get to conference with the Senate. McCain also said on Monday that the House should just “pass something” to get to conference with the Senate. House Republicans like Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) are reportedly working on legislation that would grant a pathway to citizenship to all of the country’s illegal immigrants.

McCain’s comments indicate even if the current push to enact comprehensive immigration reform fails, the real fight may be in the spring and summer of next year, when Obama could use immigration as a midterm election issue and Republican lawmakers will not be worried about primaries in the 2014 election cycle.

In 2010, McCain made a right turn on immigration, infamously promising to “complete the danged fence” as he was fighting for his political life to win re-election in Arizona. Shortly after he got elected to serve another term, McCain quickly lurched back to the left, becoming a champion for comprehensive immigration reform and calling Tea Partiers whose support he needed in 2010 “hobbits” and “wacko birds.”"
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/04/jeb-bush-book_n_2806602.html,2013-03-04 00:00:00,['Deputy Enterprise Editor'],Jeb Bush Book: Undocumented Immigrants Should Be Ineligible For Citizenship,"WASHINGTON -- In a new book, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (R) makes a notable reversal on immigration reform, arguing that creating a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants would only encourage future unauthorized immigration.

""It is absolutely vital to the integrity of our immigration system that actions have consequences -- in this case, that those who violated the law can remain but cannot obtain the cherished fruits of citizenship,"" Bush and lawyer Clint Bolick argue in a new book, Immigration Wars: Forging an American Solution. ""To do otherwise would signal once again that people who circumvent the system can still obtain the full benefits of American citizenship.""

The book, which The Huffington Post obtained before its Tuesday release, lays out the two men's proposals for comprehensive immigration reform. Both are longtime proponents of reform, and Bush in particular has long beat the drum for the GOP to take a new tone on the matter.

But the book's treatment of a pathway to citizenship stands in contrast to Bush's previous statements on immigration reform. And ironically, later in the book Bush argues that former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee in 2012, suffered immense political damage by moving to the right on the issue during the GOP primary.

""Mitt Romney moved so far to the right on immigration issues that it proved all but impossible for him to appeal to Hispanic voters in the general election,"" Bush and Bolick write. ""Although Romney eventually called for comprehensive immigration reform, a platform that hardened the party's stance on immigration hung like an anvil around his candidacy,"" they continue.

Bush's reversal doesn't appear as severe as some of the tough rhetoric used by Romney during the primary. Still, it creates a contrast between him and some of Bush's possible 2016 Republican primary opponents, and shows what could be the biggest problem in finding a compromise on immigration reform this year. While some Republicans, including potential 2016 candidate Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), are calling for a pathway to citizenship, most members of the party are arguing for only legalization. Democrats, meanwhile, argue a special road to become citizens is absolutely necessary. The American people for the most part also support such a measure, according to a number of polls.

As of June 2012, Bush asserted that he supported a pathway to citizenship.

""You have to deal with this issue,"" Bush told CBS' Charlie Rose. ""You can't ignore it, and so either a path to citizenship, which I would support -- and that does put me probably out of the mainstream of most conservatives -- or ... a path ... to residency of some kind.""

In the book, however, Bush and Bolick write that there should be ""two penalties for illegal entry: fines and/or community service and ineligibility for citizenship.""

They don't fully rule out citizenship, however, despite what that sentence implies. Although Bush and Bolick state there should be no special pathway, they say undocumented immigrants should be allowed to go through normal channels to naturalize by going to their native country to apply. That process currently requires three- or 10-year bars and no guarantee of return, making it untenable to many undocumented immigrants.

""A grant of citizenship is an undeserving reward for conduct that we cannot afford to encourage,"" they write. ""However, illegal immigrants who wish to become citizens should have the choice of returning to their native countries and applying through normal immigration processes that now would be much more open than before.""

Bush and Bolick propose a different solution for Dreamers, young undocumented immigrants who entered the United States as children. They argue citizenship should be granted to people who entered the country under the age of 18, have lived in the U.S. for at least five years, committed no ""significant crimes"" and either graduated from high school, obtained a GED or entered military service.

For legal immigration, they argue there must be a better process that makes it less appealing to come to the United States without authorization.

""There is one reason above all others that we have millions of illegal immigrants in our country: because under our current immigration system, there is no lawful avenue for them to enter the country. ... So that saying 'they should wait in line like everyone else' is hollow because there is no line in which to wait,"" they write. ""The days in which people could lawfully emigrate to the United States just because they wanted to pursue the American Dream are as much a memory as Ellis Island.""

UPDATE: 2:55 p.m. -- Bush defended his stance to the Miami Herald's Marc Caputo after an anonymous Romney adviser accused him of advocating for the same positions that he said tanked the former GOP presidential candidate.

""[I] am not advocating self deportation. read the book,"" Bush wrote in an email.

The advisor argued to Caputo that it was the same stance.

""Where the hell was this Jeb Bush during the campaign?"" the advisor said. ""He spent all this time criticizing Romney and it turns out he has basically the same position. So he wants people to go back to their country and apply for citizenship? Well, that's self deportation. We got creamed for talking about that. And now Jeb is saying the same thing."""

The folks who run this site have taken on the dispiriting task of gathering together statements from the many commentators who work in the right’s quasi-religious netherworld, a weird land that exists out beyond even the rants of Rush Limbaugh. Here are just a few samples of what has been on their minds in recent weeks:

• Rick Wiles, host of a so-called Christian radio talk show called TruNews, said President Obama is “looking, acting and talking more and more like a man who is applying for the job of Antichrist.” Wiles went on to say, “Mr. Obama may simply be the latest incarnation of Satan’s spirit inside a human being in a high public office. There have been many such men throughout history, tyrants such as Adolf Hitler.”

• Another right-wing commentator, California-based pastor Jim Garlow, warned of America’s doom should Obama be reelected. “Then came November 6, 2012,” Garlow said recently. “If a tombstone were to be prepared for America, I think it might say: ‘1776-2012.’”

• Paul Cameron, chairman of the Family Research Institute, said, “The long term goal of the homosexual movement is to get every little boy to grab his ankles and every little girl to give it a try.”

• At the National Religious Broadcasters convention in February, Jerry Boykin of the Family Research Council (different from the Family Research Institute) made the bogus claim that there have been 50 examples of American judges invoking Muslim Sharia law, and he called for states to follow the lead of Oklahoma by passing legislation to ban Sharia.

• On Generations Radio, pastor Kevin Swanson declared that Obama’s reelection “solidified our doom.” Swanson went on to say there is no difference between the leader of North Korea and Obama because “they’re both committed to Marxism.”

• Swanson also said that the Democratic Party’s vision is “to make sure everybody is committing homosexual acts and they’re high on drugs, and then they vote for Democrats to increase the size of government and provide pretend security for the people high on drugs.”

• On the right-wing website WorldNetDaily, commentator Larry Klayman made this wild claim: “To insure that Obama’s mission to enslave the nation in his brand of Marxist ideology succeeds in the face of imminent rebellion by the informed masses, his government has armed itself to the teeth, unleashed black helicopters in our major cities to intimidate the people and set up committees to determine who in its estimation is a ‘subversive’ and may have to be eliminated with drone and other strikes on American citizens on U.S. soil.”

• And here is how Buster Wilson of the American Family Assn. (what is the deal with all these “family” organizations?) responded to a caller on his radio show who was concerned about government agents coming to take his guns: “I don’t want to have a discussion about how we are ready, willing and able to shoot down United States marshals when they come to take our weapons. I’m not saying you wouldn’t do that or you shouldn’t do that, I’m just staying neutral on that right now.”

The examples go on and on. The trouble for Republicans is that these cranks are shaping the opinions of a significant share of the party faithful. Many GOP luminaries such Mike Huckabee, Rick Santorum and Rand Paul cater to these people, and more than a few GOP members of Congress and a legion of state legislators share the same wacky ideas.

[For the Record, 5:20 a.m. PDT, April 9: An earlier version of this post gave the name of a Republican politician as Mick Huckabee. His name is Mike Huckabee.]

Editor’s Note: Tamar Jacoby, a fellow at the New America Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank, is president of ImmigrationWorks USA, a national federation of small-business owners in favor of immigration reform.

(CNN) —

Members of Congress working to pass immigration reform are divided on many issues, but there’s one they agree on. Democrat and Republican, virtually all have been adamant since the debate began that President Obama should stay out of it– that pressure from the White House would only spur resistance on Capitol Hill.

Still, there’s an exception to every rule. The president has the power to transform the immigration debate by one simple action: nominating a tough, law-enforcement Republican to replace Janet Napolitano as secretary of Homeland Security.

The prospects of passing reform hang uneasily in the balance this month as members of Congress spend time at home in their districts. Back in Washington, an all but unbreakable House rule mandates that passage of any law as momentous as immigration reform requires a “majority of the majority” – in today’s House, 118 GOP votes. And many Republicans—a majority, I believe–are still up for grabs.

Tamar Jacoby

In the past, many House Republicans have opposed immigration reform, but attitudes have changed dramatically in recent months, thanks largely to a new understanding of the Latino vote’s power. A dwindling minority still oppose reform at all cost. A growing but still small minority is generally favorable to an overhaul. And the rest – the majority in the middle – are wrestling to come to terms with an issue they’re suddenly seeing in a new light. They are reexamining the facts, questioning old assumptions, trying on new policy ideas and asking themselves how far they can stretch. The ferment is palpable –as are the possibilities.

Opinion: Key to immigration reform – worker visas

The biggest obstacle: House Republicans don’t trust that Obama will enforce the law.

This mistrust has deep roots, and Obama has only inflamed it in recent years. The last time Congress passed an immigration overhaul, in 1986, it was cast as a grand bargain: amnesty for the millions of immigrants then living in the country illegally in exchange for tough enforcement on the border and in the workplace.

By the early 1990s, 3 million formerly unauthorized immigrants had earned legal status and were on their way to citizenship. But the border was more porous than ever, and workplace enforcement had all but ground to a halt, as a new cottage industry in forged identity documents erased all hope of meaningful control and a frustrated immigration service threw up its hands.

Enter President Obama, who from day one has shown what House Republicans consider a decidedly selective approach to the law. Whatever you think of Obamacare or the Defense of Marriage Act, they are the law of the land – but the president has enforced them only when he felt like it, if he felt like it at all–putting a hold, for example, on the Obamacare employer mandate. On other issues, he has thumbed his nose at the Constitution’s federal balance of power, bypassing Congress to appoint members of the National Labor Relations Board and grant legal status to young immigrants brought to the U.S. as children.

As for immigration enforcement, there has been some progress in the Obama years on the border and in the workplace, but two huge congressional directives remain just that, unfulfilled directives. One is completing the 700 miles of fence mandated in 2006, the other building an electronic “exit” system to track that foreigners visiting the United States on visas leave the country when they say they will – a mandate that dates to 1996.

There’s nothing Obama can do to restore Republicans’ faith in him – that horse left the barn years ago. And not any Republican appointment to the top immigration enforcement job will reassure the GOP.

A Republican seen as a dove on immigration will change nothing – might as well go with a Democrat. So, too, a Republican popular in the mainstream media or among sophisticated elites, and that rules out even accomplished law enforcement officials like, say, Bill Bratton, former police commissioner in New York and Los Angeles, or Raymond Kelly, now the top cop in New York City.

Opinion: Crunch time for immigration, budget fights

What’s needed is someone so reliably tough and so committed to enforcing the law that even diehard immigration hawks do a double-take when the name surfaces. Part of the point, after all, is neutralizing criticism from immigration restrictionists. And of course, such a choice will make many Democrats gasp. That, too, is part of the point. Without it, skeptical Republicans will not be convinced.

The other indispensable requirement is that a nominee should be someone with enough national stature – a household name, if possible – to push back against the president if need be. House Republicans need to know that this person will hold the line, no matter what the president tries, will take his or her case to the media if necessary, and will have enough popular support to make a national appeal effective.

Who fits this bill? It’s not a long list. Would Rudy Giuliani take the job? Condoleezza Rice? A respected general? Someone who proved his law and order bona fides in the last Bush administration – former Attorney General John Ashcroft, for example? Or former Sen. Jon Kyl of Arizona, a committed immigration enforcement hawk and among the Republican lawmakers, sitting or retired, most knowledgeable about the issue?

Coming up with the right name won’t be easy, but ultimately this is a question about Barack Obama. Is he strong enough – and self-confident enough – to take this step? Can he brook the dissent and give up control? If he means what he says when he talks about enforcing the law, he should put his money where his mouth is. Nothing would do more to improve the chances of passing immigration reform on his watch.

Thursday, with over 100,000 supportive signatures from the Daily Kos community in hand, I was in the audience at the U.S. Capitol while Sen. Harry Reid gave his victory speech following the successful nuking of the filibuster.

As epic as it was to defeat Joe Lieberman seven years ago, Thursday's gutting of the filibuster was a much bigger victory for the progressive netroots. Here's why:

The key similarity

What makes primarying Joe Lieberman over his support for the Iraq war and nuking the filibuster both epic netroots victories is that both campaigns were conceived and incubated entirely within the progressive blogosphere and netroots.

When they started in 2005 and 2009 respectively, no one in traditional media, establishment progressive advocacy, or the Democratic leadership considered these campaigns to be in the realm of the possible (often, not even within the bounds of polite conversation). It was just a bunch of cheeto-munching bloggers and professional left types who embraced the ideas and slowly pushed them into the mainstream.

The key difference

In 2006, when Joe Lieberman returned to the Senate following his defeat in the primary, he was famously given a standing ovation by his Democratic colleagues.

Yesterday, the entire national Democratic congressional leadership, the heads of several major progressive advocacy organizations, and numerous big-time center-left media types were on hand to give Harry Reid a standing ovation for nuking the filibuster. Here is the video I took of that ovation with my phone:

This time, despite suffering repeated setbacks over several years, we eventually broughtin the Democratic - progressive ecosystem with us.

The result will be thoroughgoing, long-lasting change as the doors to the judicial branch of government are finally unlocked and thrown open to progressives. All the destructive court decisions we have recently suffered through on reproductive rights, on rights at work, on Citizens United, on the Voting Rights Act, on making the expansion of Medicaid optional to states and so much more—we now finally have a path to reverse all of that damage.

You did this, all 271,514 member of the Daily Kos community who collectively took nearly 1,000,000 actions relentlessly urging Senate Democrats to reform the filibuster. This is your victory. You were the pebbles that started this avalanche. You have made change happen.

Now please, take a bow, and never again doubt if the actions you take really make a difference.

CNN gives credit where credit is due:



What was known as the nuclear option yesterday is known as the Reid Rule today. Time will only tell if the Reid Rule is productive or destructive. But we'll leave that to the historians.



As for how it became the Reid rule, it took a coordinated and sustained effort from an unlikely place -- progressive activists on the blogosphere.

Our very own David Waldman, aka Kagro X, gets some tremendous and well-deserved credit in that article. He really was the first pebble in all this."
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/17/magazine/ted-kennedy-jr-is-finally-ready-for-the-family-business.html,2013-03-17 00:00:00,['Mark Leibovich'],Ted Kennedy Jr. Is (Finally) Ready for the Family Business,"Entire touch-football rosters could be filled with Kennedys who could never have been elected at their tender ages without their last names. In November, Ted’s 32-year-old cousin, Joseph Kennedy III — the son of a former U.S. representative, Joseph Kennedy II — became the latest pledge when he won the congressional seat left by Barney Frank, who retired. Even Ted Jr.’s son, Edward Kennedy III, has announced his intention to run for U.S. senator from Massachusetts someday. He was, at the time of his announcement, 11.

“There is this question with every member of my family,” Patrick Kennedy said. “How do we fit into this amazing legacy that we have been given by dint of our birth?” That is not a sentence most people utter. But his point was that simply running for an office because it is available is the family default option, and it’s not necessarily the best one.

Patrick did not seek re-election in 2010 and now devotes much of his life to promoting treatment and research for his twin causes, mental illness and brain injuries. He married, moved to New Jersey and has two children. He has sad green eyes, a big pillow of red hair and the gawky bearing of an overgrown boy. But he also has the weary voice of someone who could be 65.

Patrick told me he has no regrets about his career choices, but his own life proves his original point: that the family reflex to run early is not for everyone. He has battled depression and alcohol and drug addictions for years, and he admits that the United States Congress was not the best place to wrestle these goblins. “When you grow up in my family, being somebody meant having power, having status,” Patrick told me back in 2006, when I was reporting an article for The Times not long after police found him disoriented, having crashed his car into a barrier near the Capitol at 2:45 a.m. “The compensations you got were all material and superficial,” he said. “I’ve come to realize, in the last few months, that that life made me feel all alone.” After the article ran, Patrick told me his father was furious at him for unburdening himself publicly. “Save that stuff for your shrink, not a reporter,” Senator Kennedy said to him.

Ted Jr. is less the unburdening type. He has granted few interviews and he seemed nervous when we talked, or perhaps a bit suffocated by Keil, who was always with us. Keil, whom I first met back in his journalism days, is a friendly and earnest operator who, like many in Washington, is always working. (I ran into him once at the supermarket and teased him about the work Purple Strategies was doing to help BP “reposition” its image after the spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Without missing a beat, Keil unleashed his own gusher, calling BP the “the greatest corporate turnaround story in history” before moving on to the deli counter.) He sat in on all three of my meetings with Ted Jr., monitored a subsequent phone call and also stayed close by during my meeting with Patrick. He made backup recordings of all of our conversations, which is not unusual for public-relations people to do, but typically happens with high-level subjects, not with someone who has never run for office and wasn’t really running for anything now. The aggressive “management” of the story conveyed an impression of both loftiness and hand-holding — or, at worst, of a Not Ready for Prime Time Kennedy being propped up by consultants.

All of that said, there’s something innately likable about Ted Jr. People who have known him over the years generally describe a solid, down-to-earth guy who is quite normal, given his royal lineage. And his instinct to become a fully formed human being before answering the “call to service” was admirable. His priority, by all accounts, has always been to raise a family and nurture them as unassumingly as possible (again, for a Kennedy). As he put it, “I pretty much spent half my life trying to resist other people’s timetables.” Later, when I asked him to elaborate on this, he added: “My father was the single most important person in my life. But in some ways, we all live our lives resisting what our parents want us to become.”

In early 1985 Ted Jr. was 23 and living in Somerville, Mass., outside Boston. Tip O’Neill, the district’s longtime representative, had announced he would retire at the end of his term. This seemed an obvious starter gig, but Ted Jr. was not interested. His 34-year-old cousin, Joe — Robert F. Kennedy’s son — ran and won instead. “I never seriously considered that race,” Ted Jr. told me. “My father was strongly considering me.” Ted Sr. commissioned a poll that came back “a slam dunk for Ted,” said Steve McMahon, who was one of the people then running Senator Kennedy’s political operation. Ted Jr.’s decision not to run, McMahon said, “was against the advice and counsel of pretty much everyone around him.” Senator Kennedy was disappointed, Ted Jr. told me. “He couldn’t understand why someone with all the built-in advantages would not take advantage of the opportunity.”"

Last week, RNC communications director Sean Spicer appeared on The Wilkow Majority with guest host and Breitbart News Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon, and said Levin was one of the people who should be asking questions at the debates instead of mainstream media journalists.

After Breitbart News reported on the interview, the movement to allow conservatives like Levin to potentially moderate a debate picked up momentum and “took on life.”

Levin, in comments picked up by The Right Scoop, said he was of two minds after reading the Breitbart News report about Spicer’s comments. He said he believed the RNC was either “sucking up” to him so he does not criticize them or actually serious.

“I accept,” Levin said. “Yes, I’ll do it.”

He said he would like to ask Republican New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, if he were to run, why he refused to sign a brief opposing Obamacare. Levin said he would also like to ask Christie why he was weak on border security, soft on the Ground Zero Mosque, favored gun control, and supported environmentalists.

Levin said he would like to ask former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, if he were to run, if he felt there should be a “two Bush limit on the presidency” and why he “supports anarchy on the border” by promoting comprehensive immigration reform so fervently.

The talk radio host said he still did not fully believe the RNC would actually extend an offer to him because the Republican establishment “buffoons” who are “destroying the Republican Party from within” loathe him.

“You know how much they despise me,” Levin said. “I think I am hated more [at the Republican National Convention] than at the Democrat convention.”

“So yeah, I’m available [to moderate the debates],” Levin said. “I don’t believe it for two seconds.”"

The RNC report audited everything surrounding the Republican agenda -- except the product itself.

Republicans have let the salesmen take control%2C replacing principles and values with consultants.

We don%27t need 100 pages. Our agenda can be tweeted in less than 140 characters.

In private enterprise, a business fails when it ceases to meet the demands of the consumer. Senior management, out-of-touch and complacent, loses the vision that made the start-up a success in the first place. The sales pitch and cash flow replace innovation and product quality. And when the stale product ceases to create value for its customers, buyers look elsewhere or simply stay home.

This story should sound familiar to the ""senior management"" of the Grand Old Party, who asked a group of their peers to produce a report --""The Growth and Opportunity Project"" -- to explain the underperformance of the GOP product line in 2012.

But the RNC report audited everything surrounding the Republican agenda -- except the product itself.

Republicans have let the salesmen take control of their company, replacing principles and values with consultants flacking a slicker sales pitch for the wrong ideas. And the jig is up. Too many Americans are no longer buying what the GOP is selling.

The Republican Party needs to revisit their business model, once built on the core values of individual freedom, economic opportunity for all, and constitutionally-limited government. In my lifetime, these quintessential American principles have guided the GOP to its three great electoral successes, in 1980, 1994, and 2010.

Winning on principle and then reverting to consultant-driven campaigns about nothing has been a ""Groundhog Day"" style political nightmare for grassroots activists. So while Republican cognoscenti continue to learn the same lesson over and over, we are moving ahead.

The grassroots freedom movement (including tea partiers, small-l libertarians, constitutional conservatives, and independents who don't see much to like in either party) is on the ascent. Our community is growing because our allegiance is not to political party, but to the shared values of fiscal sanity and individual freedom.

We don't need 100 pages. Our agenda can be tweeted in less than 140 characters:

Build community voluntarily working together. Be authentic. Treat people equally. Don't hurt people and don't take their stuff.

Building community.

Paradoxically, Republicans claim a long-term economic vision in their political rhetoric, but view their customers through the short-term lens of election cycles. It feels, at best, like a one night stand. You never get the callback after the first Tuesday in November. Real political and policy change comes from a long-term relationship, and that is never going to come out of a campaign consulting shop.

True cultural change starts with education and building relationships at the local level. Candidates who represent the values of the freedom movement and bring fresh ideas and innovative solutions to the Republican Party are selected from the bottom-up.

Rock star fiscal conservatives like Senators Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Tim Scott were not hand-picked by the GOP establishment in a politically correct attempt to ""recruit diversity."" Grassroots enthusiasm for the candidates generated organically behind the ideas and the values for which they stood.

Using this authentic and principle-driven process, our movement has begun to repopulate the Republican Party with an upstart generation of leaders who are younger and more diverse than ever before in the Party's history. We will return their call if they stay faithful to the ideas that won their elections.

Freedom as our strategy.

The primary process – much like the free market- is a discovery process. Competitive primaries allow us to look for qualitative upgrades and hold politicians accountable regardless of political party. While the billions of dollars spent on TV ads in 2012 are swept into the dustbin of history, the future of political campaigning is becoming more transparent, decentralized and democratic.

Thanks to the Internet, our community is fueled by the decentralization of information and the ease of connecting with like-minded individuals through social media. The costs and barriers to entry into political activism are lower than ever before. Disintermediation politics has shifted the balance of power away from Washington insiders, putting citizens back in the driver's seat.

Freedom, transparency and individual choice are trending. A new Republican Party would respect the choices of the millions of ""kingmakers"" who make electoral impact at the margin.

Don't hurt people and don't take their stuff.

While Republicans struggle to define a principled agenda, the ethos of the freedom movement is simple: Be authentic and consistent. Treat every American equally under the law. Don't hurt others, and don't take their stuff.

The freedom movement is a coalition of the willing, operating on a voluntary and value-for-value basis. We oppose the government's habit of subsidizing the irresponsible with other people's stuff. We are sick of watching politicians and corporate lobbyists pick winners and losers in the marketplace at the expense of everyday individuals. We use politics as a means to advance our values, not an end.

Lastly, we believe that Washington answers to its citizen shareholders, not the other way around. The RNC's 100-page attempt to rebrand themselves to the American public highlights the fatal conceit of the GOP's senior management. The challenge is not finding a way to ""open America's ears"" from the top-down. The solution is to open your own.

NEW YORK — Ed Koch is being remembered as the quintessential New Yorker – an admired but tough, colorful former mayor who will be honored at his funeral by former President Bill Clinton.

At the service Monday morning at Manhattan's Temple Emanu-El, mourners will also hear about Koch's other fierce loyalty: Israel. The Israeli consul general is set to speak, along with New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

Clinton interrupted a trip to Japan to return to New York for the funeral, according to Koch spokesman George Arzt.

He said Koch was a friend of both Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton, and was helpful during her successful campaign for the U.S. Senate from New York. Koch also backed Hillary Clinton in her presidential run.

Bill Clinton will serve as a representative for President Barack Obama at the funeral.

Koch died Friday of congestive heart failure at age 88.

Friends from his weekly Greenwich Village luncheon gathering got together on Saturday, two weeks after his last meal with them.

The funeral will be held at one of the nation's most prominent synagogues, a Reform Jewish congregation on Fifth Avenue. Bloomberg is a member, as are comedian Joan Rivers and former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer.

""I don't want to leave Manhattan, even when I'm gone,"" he told The Associated Press in 2008 after purchasing a burial plot in Trinity Church Cemetery, at the time the only graveyard in Manhattan that still had space. ""This is my home. The thought of having to go to New Jersey was so distressing to me.""

Koch led his city for 12 years, with a brash, humor-tinged style that came to personify the New York of the 1980s.

The Democratic mayor is credited with helping save New York from its economic crisis in the 1970s and leading it to financial rebirth. But during his three terms as mayor, he also faced racial tensions and corruption among political allies, as well as the AIDS epidemic, homelessness and urban crime.

In his weekly radio address, Bloomberg called Koch ""our most tireless, fearless, and guileless civic crusader.""

The mayor said his predecessor's ""tough, determined leadership and responsible fiscal stewardship ... helped lift the city out of its darkest days and set it on course for an incredible comeback.""

He added, ""When someone needed a good kick in the rear, he gave it to them.""

Koch lost the Democratic nomination for mayor in 1989 to David Dinkins, who succeeded him.

Koch said he was defeated ""because of longevity."" In his words, ""people get tired of you.""

But as the votes were coming in, he said he told himself, ""I'm free at last."""

The thrill is back for many Americans as President Obama’s second inauguration approaches — though maybe a bit less intense.

This inauguration’s celebration will be shorter, and almost certainly smaller and less expensive, than the gala that drew nearly 2 million people to witness the first time an African American president took the oath of office.

There will be no massive rock concert on the Mall, as there was last time, and there will be only two official evening balls, including one dedicated to military personnel, instead of 10. Even the massive security cordon, which seemed to shut down most of downtown Washington four years ago, will be relatively modest.

But this year’s inauguration will fall on the national holiday honoring the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., and that coincidence, along with an enduring fascination with the first family, is expected to boost attendance above any other second-term inaugurations.

And then there are people who stayed away four years ago for one reason or another and who want to make sure they don’t miss history this time.

“I watched on TV, and I wished I was in D.C.,” said Kaye Lin, 26, a producer with Voice of America who is hosting four friends, so far, at her townhouse near the District’s Eastern Market. “This is still as historic and as memorable as before. When is the next time you’re going to see a black man be reinaugurated and get his second term? It might be a long time. So I’m right there.”

Planners have spent months choreographing what one Air Force general called “quite a ballet” to guide the president’s steps and an army-sized support staff through the oath-taking ceremony at the U.S. Capitol, a grand parade down Pennsylvania Avenue and the events that follow.

The festivities will begin the Saturday before the 57th inauguration with a National Day of Service — which Obama is eager to make a permanent tradition — and wind down with a national prayer service the following Tuesday at Washington National Cathedral. As before, a huge security detail of military personnel and law enforcement officers, led by the U.S. Secret Service, will operate checkpoints, close roads and manage crowds.

Members of the newly sworn 113th Congress will be handing out about 250,000 tickets, although this time there will be no purple-coded ones — and, organizers hope, no repeat of the “Purple Tunnel of Doom,” an episode in which thousands bearing purple color-coded tickets were inadvertently blocked in 2009 from reaching their seats on the Capitol lawn.

Obama’s second time around will also have some firsts, or at least near-firsts. He will become the first president since Franklin D. Roosevelt to take the oath of office four times. That’s because of the do-over performed after Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. flubbed his lines during Obama’s first inauguration, and because Jan. 20, the date prescribed for taking the oath, falls on a Sunday this time.

Although hotel bookings have not kept pace with bookings last time, when there was a 90 percent occupancy rate on inauguration eve, tourism officials say the tempo picked up after the holidays. Still up for grabs for well-heeled revelers were faux presidential suites at the Willard InterContinental with a view of Pennsylvania Avenue. The “Oval Suites,” featuring marble-floored entryways and a design based on the Oval Office, were going for $5,700 a night, with a four-night minimum and a $27,000 catering minimum.

Metro will expand service to handle crowds, and there will be a water taxi running from Alexandria. But Amtrak says it expects business as usual, and Virginia Railway Express won’t be running at all.

Doug Anderson, 55, who owns a charter bus company in Greenville, Pa., said nine groups have plunked down $2,000 each for 56-seat buses to Washington, compared with 25 buses last time.

“It was a monumental event when President Obama was initially elected, and it was a turning point in a number of ways in the national political arena. This year, it wasn’t quite as dramatic or climactic as it was the first time,” Anderson said.

Four years ago, inauguration planners initially braced for as many as 4 million people. An estimated 1.8 million people attended, making it the largest event ever in Washington.

Elliott Ferguson, president of Destination DC, a nonprofit group that promotes District tourism, said his organization is working on an estimate of 800,000 visitors this time, which is still higher than attendance generally expected for second inaugurals. President George W. Bush’s drew about 400,000 people in 2005.



Last time around, the cost was difficult to pin down because of the many groups involved. Government officials and media organizations estimated that Obama’s first inauguration’s total cost was about $150 million, including $54.3 million in private money raised by the Presidential Inaugural Committee, a principal organizer of events before and after the oath-taking ceremony.

The Presidential Inaugural Committee has not yet come up with an estimated cost for this year’s festivities.

The Constitution doesn’t have much to say about inaugural events, prescribing only such basics as the time and date and the wording of the oath. Everything else has evolved through tradition. And like all rituals, the quadrennial exercise creates tensions between the need to adhere to tradition and the desire to acknowledge cultural or political change.

Every gesture has the potential to create meaning — sometimes by adding something, sometimes by omission — in a ceremony whose overarching purpose is to display a peaceful transition of power, or its peaceful renewal, in a democracy.

“I think what an inauguration does is it gives you constancy, and you get some comfort in it. The idea of beginning anew is a very powerful idea, even if it’s a second term,” said Mark R. Kennedy, a former member of Congress who heads the Graduate School of Political Management at George Washington University. “They all, perhaps, have twists.”

Obama’s inauguration festivities will begin, as four years ago, with a National Day of Service on Saturday, Jan. 19, whose centerpiece will be a tented service fair on the Mall. Visitors will be encouraged to sign up and pledge a year’s effort to one or more of about 100 local and national community organizations.

On Sunday, the president will take the oath in a private ceremony; on Monday, he will repeat it in public. Roberts will give the oath to the president both times. Vice President Biden will receive the oath from Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the first Hispanic appointed to the high court.

This will be the fifth time that a president takes the oath in private and repeats the process in public because of a quirk in the calendar, said Beth Hahn, historical editor in the U.S. Senate Historical Office. Four presidents — Ronald Reagan, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Woodrow Wilson and Rutherford B. Hayes — took the oath in private and then again in public because the constitutionally mandated date for the oath fell on a Sunday, a tradition grounded in the desire to honor Sunday as the sabbath.

After the oath-taking ceremony Monday, the president will attend a congressional luncheon and then lead the parade from the Capitol to the White House.

The Obamas will then attend the Inaugural Ball and the Commander-in-Chief’s Ball, both of which will be held at the Washington Convention Center.

The next day, Washington National Cathedral will host an invitation-only interfaith National Prayer Service, with the president and the vice president. There will also be a live webcast of the event.

On Monday, Metrorail will open an hour early, at 4 a.m., and service will be provided for an extra two hours, until 2 a.m. Tuesday. To help offset the costs of expanded service, Metro will charge peak fares until 9 p.m. Metrobus will operate weekday rush-hour service in the morning, followed by an early afternoon rush. Many routes will have detours related to inaugural events. There are also plans to accommodate an expected 2,500 motorcoaches and tour buses.

Republicans wanted to fund national parks%2C Veterans Affairs

Senate Democrats said they wouldn%27t support piecemeal measures

Politics of 2014 may favor Republicans more than %2795-96 shutdowns%2C analyst says

WASHINGTON — Congressional Republicans failed to move forward Tuesday with a piecemeal approach to fund popular parts of the federal government to lessen the impact of the first government shutdown in 17 years.

House and Senate Republicans had offered short-term funding plans to keep open national parks, the Department of Veterans Affairs and other government services in the nation's capital. House Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers, R-Ky. said the piecemeal approach would ""continue to move the ball down the field"" towards finding an agreement to resume full government funding.

However, the GOP efforts failed to win the necessary support in the House of Representatives to advance to the Senate. The votes fell well short of the two-thirds threshold needed to suspend House rules.

The Senate had already warned that the plan would meet fate there as every previous attempt by the House to amend the stopgap funding bill. In that chamber, Democrats maintain the only way to end the shutdown is for the House to allow a vote on a stopgap measure to fund the government through mid-November that does not include legislation affecting President Obama's health care law.

Senate Appropriations Chairwoman Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., said she did not support funding the government in ""bits and pieces.""

""We're the entire United States of America. You keep the whole government going, that's what you're supposed to do,"" she said. ""All they have to do in the House is let the House vote on the Senate (bill) and let the House work it's will.""

The White House agreed. ""These piecemeal efforts are not serious, and they are no way to run a government. If House Republicans are legitimately concerned about the impacts of a shutdown — which extend across government from our small businesses to women, children and seniors — they should do their job and pass a clean CR to reopen the government,"" said Amy Brundage, a White House spokeswoman.

Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said Democrats were not against debating some of the proposals that Republicans offered in the weeks leading up to the shutdown on the Affordable Care Act. He cited as an example a proposal to repeal a 2.3% tax on medical devices enacted to help pay for the law. However, Durbin said Democrats would not negotiate on the stopgap spending bill, or on a pending vote to increase the debt ceiling, the nation's borrowing limit.

""After the CR and the debt ceiling, I have been open to that,"" Durbin said, ""Doing this with a gun to your head, as we've said over and over again, is not the appropriate way to bargain.""

House Republicans huddled in private earlier Tuesday, and lawmakers showed no signs of losing cohesion on the first day of the shutdown. Republicans are bullish about the politics of a shutdown and they have reason to be, said David Wasserman, an analyst for the non-partisan Cook Political Report.

""Democrats have always believed a shutdown would finally make voters pay attention to how 'extreme' House Republicans are. So far there's not a ton of evidence that the game has changed,"" Wasserman said.

The 2014 national landscape still tilts in favor of House Republicans, where only one lawmaker, Rep. Gary Miller, R-Calif., sits in a district currently rated as a ""toss-up"" by Cook. Following a remapping of congressional districts in 2012, House Republicans represent fewer swing seats and are beholden to more conservative constituencies. There is also little institutional memory from the shutdown fights of nearly two decades ago.

Just 37 Republicans currently serving in Congress were present for the shutdowns during the Clinton administration, while 111 Republicans have been elected since President George W. Bush left office, Wasserman said.

In the last shutdown, there was also bipartisan interest in resolving the impasses. At the time, 79 Republicans represented districts President Clinton won. Today, just 17 Republicans represent districts carried by President Obama. ""If anything, Obama has negative leverage with House Republicans,"" Wasserman said.

The polling today is in Democrats favor. A Quinnipiac national poll released Tuesday show American voters oppose 72%-22% Congress shutting down the government in their effort to block implementation of the law. Voters also choose a Democratic candidate over a Republican candidate 43%-34% in a generic ballot, the widest Democratic margin measured so far for the 2014 elections.

""Americans are certainly not in love with Obamacare, but they reject decisively the claim by congressional Republicans that it is so bad that it's worth closing down the government to stop it,"" said Peter Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute."

The 2014 midterm elections are just around the corner. These are the races to watch.

The 2014 midterm elections are just around the corner. These are the races to watch.

The 2014 midterm elections are just around the corner. These are the races to watch.

The U.S. Senate, once considered the most exclusive and chummiest club in America, has in recent years been transformed into an ideological war zone, where comity and compromise have lost their allure, while confrontation and showmanship now pay big dividends.

“The only way you get something is to become obnoxious,” Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) declared during the recent immigration debate, explaining her threat to block the entire process. “We have turned from a Senate to a theater, and I’m tired of being part of a theater. If I wanted to be part of a theater, I would have gone to New York.”

The theatrics reached a new crescendo Thursday when Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) confronted each other over Reid’s effort to change the filibuster rules in ways that would strip the GOP’s ability to block confirmation of executive branch nominees and that could ultimately weaken the minority party’s ability to slow the majority agenda.

Reid’s move provoked some of the most personal attacks two Senate leaders have leveled against another in decades; Reid described McConnell as untrustworthy, while McConnell countered that the Nevada Democrat would go down in history as the worst Senate leader ever.

Suddenly, the world’s greatest deliberative body just isn’t that much fun anymore.

“I miss it like an abscessed tooth,” former senator Christopher S. Bond (R-Mo.), a 24-year veteran, said on a recent visit to the Capitol.

The dysfunction fever is so strong that Reid and McConnell relented to a rank-and-file request to set up a rare meeting for senators of both parties Monday night in the Old Senate Chamber.

Those working at the last-gasp filibuster compromise fear that if they fail, the Senate will put itself on a permanent downward spiral later this week.

“There’s no doubt that it’s harder and it’s more partisan,” said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who has spent the past few days talking with senators and White House allies hoping to hatch a compromise on Senate rules. McCain has succeeded twice before at reaching a compromise to avoid partisan rule changes, first in 2005 and again this year.

“Each time we come closer and closer to having this happen,” McCain said Friday.

Interviews with more than a dozen current and recently retired senators paint a mostly dismal picture of life in the Senate. There is a growing sense of despair among the rank-and-file senators, who privately grouse that the two leaders, despite many similarities in style and background, have become so distrustful of one another they barely speak to each other, except for small talk about their shared love of the Washington Nationals.

One GOP senator last week pleaded with McConnell to reach out to Reid to establish some regular channel of communication, maybe a biweekly breakfast, to try to solve their problems. McConnell declined, saying he simply could not trust Reid, according to the Senate Republican, who asked for anonymity to speak about the relationship.

Reid and McConnell are “institutionalists” who shared the same career goal — to be Senate majority leader. Reid has been since 2007, McConnell will probably need six additional Republican seats in the 2014 midterms to reach his lifelong prize. By those elections, they will have served as party leaders longer than any duo since Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.) and Howard Baker (R-Tenn.) in the late 1970s and early 1980s. However, instead of growing closer, Reid and McConnell have grown more distant and distrustful of each other, according to senators on both sides of the aisle.

But in some way the Reid-McConnell clash is a symptom of other changes in the Senate.

The giants of the Senate

In the past five years, through death and retirement, the Senate has lost a clutch of legends, powerful voices whose decades of service gave them enough influence to rival that of the leaders.

John W. Warner (R-Va.), Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) and Ted Stevens (R-Alaska). These were Senate barons who could roll their own leadership when it was required to make a deal. Warner retired in 2008. Stevens and Kennedy died in 2009.

A treasured requirement for freshman orientation used to be a rules lecture inside the chamber from Byrd, the longest-serving senator ever, who wrote a book on parliamentary rules. But no senator has taken up that role since Byrd grew ill and died in 2010.

There has been a shift away from “senators who carried with them the sense of the history and the traditions of the Senate,” said Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), who arrived in 2003. “There was that class of senior senators that were accorded a great deal of respect and authority.”

They have been replaced by a historically large group of newcomers who are generally more partisan and have pushed leaders, their party and the Senate to a more combative footing.

In March, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), a 20-year veteran, bristled at freshman Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) for what she described as his condescending tone during a debate about gun control, lecturing Cruz that she was not a sixth-grader. A week earlier, McCain, responding to a filibuster led by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) against the confirmation of John Brennan as CIA director, called Paul and his younger libertarian-leaning Senate allies a bunch of “wacko birds.”

If there is any hope that better is possible, it comes from Sen. Timothy M. Kaine (D-Va.). Six months into his first term, Kaine has been pleasantly surprised. In the past two months the Senate has approved, by large bipartisan margins, legislation to shore up the nation’s waterways, an overhaul of farm policy and a comprehensive immigration bill.

Each of those were approved after lengthy, freewheeling debate on amendments in line with Senate traditions. At this stage of 2011, the Senate had held only 106 roll-call votes; this year, 171. Yet some basics, such as the budget resolution, have ground to a procedural halt.

“The notion that we can’t work together on anything, I’m not finding that to be true,” Kaine said. “But I’m also finding things that ought to be simple are hard. It’s like parallel universes. I’m trying to understand how an institution can be both.”

During his 24 years in the Senate, Bond remembers strong cross-party alliances that ended up with bills that got huge bipartisan majorities when they came to the floor.

“Those were the good ol’ days,” Bond said.

No punching, at least

Nostalgia for the more genteel Senate is a favorite pastime of senators and other close observers of the body.

“I’m exhausted from hearing about the good ol’ days,” said Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.), a 30-year senator who retired, like Bond, at the end of 2010.

Dodd mocked the idea that the chamber is “too partisan,” noting that the Senate’s heyday in the 19th century — when legends such as Henry Clay, John Calhoun and Daniel Webster served — included fistfights and the occasional gun duel.

Dodd said today’s newcomers will rise to the occasion if they get the time and chance to legislate in the Senate. There are 55 senators who have taken office since January 2007, never having experienced a GOP majority. It’s the third large wave of new senators in the past 100 years, the first coming after World War II and the second coming on the heels of the Watergate scandal and the Reagan landslide of 1980.

In his first term, in the early 1980s, Dodd spent several days a week angling for a seat in the crowded, private, senators-only dining room on the Capitol’s first floor, soaking up the wisdom of the likes of Sens. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.), John Stennis (D-Miss.) and Robert J. Dole (R-Kan.). Those three alone served more than 100 combined years and chaired several of the most powerful committees.

“It was my PhD in my first seven, eight years,” said Dodd, who made a habit of showing that dining room to new senators in his last days before retiring. “It was as good an education as could be had in the Senate.”

Nowadays, that room is dormant. Each party schedules mandatory lunches for its own caucus almost every day the Senate is in session.

“I don’t know if the dining room is still open,” Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV (D-W.Va.), a 27-year veteran, recently confided.

There was one occasion recently that recalled the old days. In April, to mark the 40th anniversary of McCain’s release from his long captivity as a prisoner of during Vietnam, Reid hosted a luncheon for McCain.

“Nobody can recall the last time there was one,” McCain said of such a bipartisan gathering, “and everybody walked out of that room with goodwill, good feelings.”

There are those who hold on to the possibility that things can improve.

As he considered whether to make a Senate bid, Kaine approached Warner, the venerable Republican first elected in 1978 who served 30 years. From the opposite party, Warner could offer only advice, not an endorsement. He said that the Senate used to be such a wonderful place to be that anyone with even a “2 percent chance to win” should take the chance.

“I can’t tell you that so unequivocally now, because so many things have changed and it’s so much more difficult,” he said, according to Kaine’s recounting.

But Warner urged Kaine to run because he believed that the problems were fixable.

“It’s not in the water supply,” Warner said. “It’s not sick-building syndrome. It’s just the character and inclination of the people who walk in the building every day.”

“So it could be different tomorrow,” he added."

prev Image 2 of 2

Ship of State Obama (conveniently SOS Obama) is sailing forward Monday on the next leg of its journey amidst battles over guns, immigration, debt and pretty much everything else. The big question is whether the media will continue to serve as crew for another four years.

That has been the policy for the first cruise. Capt. Obama, who seems to have learned the trade from Queeg, Bligh, and Hook, set sail pretending to chart a neutral course. The actual path was far different. Four years under Obama have been reminiscent of a pirate voyage and not the Caribbean kind with Johnny Depp playing a quasi-good guy.

No, it’s been all a plunder-the-rich, take-no-prisoners trip infuriating close to half the American population – just none of them in the news media. Obama didn’t have to press gang any of them to get on board. Journalists signed up to serve king and country, especially the king part. It didn’t matter whether it was taxes, Libya, Fast & Furious or gun control (er, “gun violence”), the media have followed Obama like he is their personal master and commander-in-chief.

Let’s talk a little mutiny and remind journalists they don’t have to jump when the captain says so, they can jump ship. Had they tried that, we might have heard more about some of these stories and many more.

• The Choom Gang: Even when we found Bill Clinton was one toke over the line, some in the media actually covered it. When the Post’s David Marianiss revealed that the president hadn’t just inhaled, but that he’d been a full-fledged Hollywood-teen-flick-style stoner, the media briefly noted it and moved on. Little-known Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin gets the VP nod and half the American media descend on the tundra. Obama runs for president and major news organizations believe his autobiographies like they were divine writ.

• The Other Phony Girlfriend: Long before Notre Dame’s Manti Te'o redefined the term incomplete pass, it was Obama’s dating life that was fictional. In one of the most entertaining revelations of the Marianiss book, we learned Obama’s autobiography “Dreams From My Father,” was heavy on “dreams.” “;Obama acknowledged that, while Genevieve was his New York girlfriend, the description in his memoir was a ‘compression’ of girlfriends,” quoted Politico. Ironically, after these revelations, Marianiss grew concerned the right was using his book to show “all the things in Obama's autobiography which are not true.” Horrors!

• The Transparent Lie: When Obama took office, he promised “transparency.” There’s even a memo to that effect on the White House website. Reality has been far different. Team Obama has fought the press, opposed document releases even after the fact, and helped keep newsies out of the oil disaster area in the Gulf after the BP spill. Had any Republican president treated the media that way, he’d have been skewered. With Obama, journalists mocked slightly and continued to support his every move. The liberal Politico sarcastically called the administration the “Most transparent White House ever,” for one of its endless anti-press efforts.

• Freedom of What? Under the Obama administration, freedom of religion has become hotly contested and often litigated. The idea about faith and “prohibiting the free exercise thereof ”; has gone out the stained-glass window. Catholic groups and businesses from the church to companies like Hobby Lobby are fighting against new healthcare mandates that force them to violate their faith. That controversy and what it likely means to 75 million Catholics got almost no coverage from secular journos bent on sweeping it under the pew. Reporters were too bashing Chick-fil-A.

• Gaffe Masters: Who can forget Republican VP Dan Quayle and “potato?” Or George Bush and “stategery?” GOP gaffes become enshrined in political discourse – like “47 percent.” Democratic gaffes get either ignored or soon dropped into the recycling bin (only green for Team Obama!). From VP Joe Biden’s “big f***ing deal”; to Obama’s “57 states,” Team Obama has made some classics. My favorite is when he tried to curry favor with Argentina and undercut our ally Britain. He wanted to call the Falkland Islands their Argentinean name, the Malvinas. Instead, he called the islands the Maldives, off by half a planet. Where’s Carmen Sandiego when you need her?

• That Pesky Economy: When George Bush ran for reelection, and the economy was good, the media criticized him for it and then blamed him. When Obama ran for reelection and the economy was bad, not so much. America has undergone four years of awful economic circumstances and the Democratic media apparatus blames Bush or the House GOP, which is somehow now the most powerful branch of government according to the media.

Every one of those stories, and hundreds more, should get significant coverage by our press. It’s time they either shape up or ship out."

Allen and VandeHai, whose day jobs are to undercut the GOP and its candidates, feign concern that the party isn’t doing enough to appeal to voters who don’t support the party. A more interesting story for the democrats-with-by-lines is the precipitous drop in support for Obama on every major issue.

According to Gallup, just 35% of Americans support Obama’s handling of the economy. In early June, before Obama embarked on an extensive tour of speeches about the economy, 42% approved of his efforts. In other words, the more he talked about the economy, the less Americans approved of how he was handling it.

It isn’t just the economy, though. Americans don’t support how Obama is handling virtually every issue. Only 26% support Obama’s handling of the federal deficit. Taxes? 36% approve. Foreign Affairs? 40%. Immigration? 39%. Health Care? 39%. Only on fighting terrorism (50%) and race relations (51%) does Obama win the backing of a majority, just, of Americans.

Obama basically has the backing of the Democrat base and no one else. With Republicans holding the House, 30 Governorships and more state legislative districts and statewide offices than almost any time in history, and likely to make gains in the Senate next year, it seems it is the Democrats who are on Allen and VandeHai’s “eve of destruction.”

To stitch together their partisan theory, Allen and VandeHei point to perceived problems the GOP has with African-Americans, Hispanics and gays. None of these demographic groups ever formed any meaningful part of a winning coalition for the GOP. No political party should actively try to alienate a block of voters, but the GOP’s path to future victory isn’t paved with pandering appeals to these groups either.

Politico’s editorial is largely built around the presumed need for the GOP to pass some kind of amnesty legislation to appeal to Hispanic voters. While it is certainly true that the nation needs to reform its broken immigration system, reform comes in many varieties. A recent poll found that 60% of Hispanics want the border secured before amnesty is granted, a position in line with a majority of the GOP caucus in the House. Allen and VandeHai make the mistake of accepting the conventional wisdom in DC that “immigration reform” means accepting the Senate “Gang of 8” bill. In the alternative universe that is reality, the issue is far more complex.

Even if the House GOP were to reverse course and embrace amnesty, it isn’t at clear they would benefit at the ballot box. George H. W. Bush was part of an Administration that actually granted amnesty to illegal immigrants, and he received the lowest percentage of support from Hispanics than almost any time previously. If Mitt Romney had magically received 70% of the Hispanic vote last year, he still would have lost to President Obama. There just aren’t enough voters in any of the demographics Politico focuses on to make that much of a difference for the GOP.

Mitt Romney largely lost the election last year because millions of conservatives and working-class whites failed to show up at the polls. In the last two cycles, the party nominated the moderate, centrist candidates the media barks the GOP needs and large swathes of the party’s base stayed home. The GOP would be better served “auditing” its outreach and messaging to these groups than fine-tune its messaging to groups preternaturally wired to vote against the party.

In modern political history, the GOP has won when it has embraced its conservative principles and articulated a message of freedom and enterprise. Freedom is the most inclusive message in politics. As the late Andrew Breitbart used to say, “If we can’t sell Freedom, we suck.”

Allen and VandeHei would rather the GOP adopt the Democrat playbook and make explicit appeals based on identity politics. An healthy dash of racial politics with a pinch of feminist rhetoric. It is a recipe for disaster for the GOP. Which is, of course, why Politico is pushing it.

If Republicans choose to take advice from hacks like Allen and VandeHai, then they deserve the failures they will surely reap."

Republicans will release the results of their post-election self-analysis next week, but a hint of the way forward may come from a meeting chairman Reince Priebus had Monday with African-American leaders in Brooklyn: A return by the national GOP to playing in local elections.

""We have to be a party that's community based, we can't just be a party that shows up three months before the election and expects to do well. We have to be an organization that embraces candidates at a local level,'' Priebus said in an interview Tuesday morning.

To do so may mean reviving the GOP's local election division, founded in the 1970s by then-Republican National Committee Chairman Bill Brock, to train local candidates and campaign staff, Priebus said. That would allow Republicans to begin ""building a bench of African Americans and Hispanics that are running for things like city council and school board.""

Priebus' visit to the Christian Cultural Center in Brooklyn, N.Y., on Monday was the last stop on his listening tour, part of the GOP's self-examination after losing the presidential election and failing to take a majority in the U.S. Senate last November.

The GOP has also acknowledged a big disadvantage in using technology to reach voters, track them and turn them out — and Priebus said local elections are good places to test new technology. ""One of the issues that we have to do a better job with is testing our technology and our data before a major election. You can use the local elections as a place to do testing,'' he said."

Kelly Ayotte (R-NH) is the unsung heroine of the foreign policy debates of the past few months. A Tea Party candidate who was elected in the 2010 wave, Ayotte has been one of the most reliable voices on the Benghazi attacks, the Hagel nomination, and the prosecution of terrorists. She has worked with Sens. John McCain (R-AZ) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC)–without joining their withering attacks on the party’s libertarian wing.

In the Hagel confirmation process, though much of the mainstream media’s attention focused on the aggressive questioning by McCain, Graham, and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), it was Ayotte’s line of questioning that was most effective in exposing Hagel’s position on Iran, which is the most pressing national security challenge the nation faces at the moment. Ayotte eschewed theatrics and flash for patient and yet penetrating questions.

In one particularly revealing exchange, Ayotte pinned Hagel down on his opposition to a “military option” on Iran:

Ayotte: Can you help me understand, when you went to Islamabad, Pakistan in 2006, you said at that time that a military strike against Iran, an military option, is not a “viable, feasible or responsible option.” And it strikes me that what you’re saying about the military option now and even–it seems inconsistent with that statement. And why would you make that statement in Pakistan that it’s not a “viable, feasible or responsible option” in light of your statement today that you do, I have, and I strongly agree that a military option should be on the table? Hagel : That statement was made in a context of all options regarding Iran. And Pakistan was where I was at the time. And the larger context of that was nuclear powers, which certainly Pakistan is part of that club. And not unlike what Secretary Gates said about a strike on Iran, my point was that this would not be a preferable option. There would be consequences to this option. Things would happen as a result of it. If we could find a better option, a better way to deal with Iran to assure they do not get nuclear weapons, then we’re far better off. That was the context of that statement. Ayotte: Senator Hagel, I know that my time is up and I know we’ll have an opportunity for a second round of questions, but as I see your quote it didn’t say “preferable option;” it said, was not a responsible option.

During the debate over UN Ambassador Susan Rice’s potential candidacy as Secretary of State, Ayotte joined McCain and Graham in stressing their objections to Rice over her role in spreading the story that the Benghazi terror attack on Sep. 11, 2012 had been a protest over an anti-Islam video. In an effort to characterize opposition to Rice as racist and sexist, the president and his party pointedly ignored Ayotte’s role in the debate.

Ayotte refused to take the bait, remaining focused on the issues at hand. Her remarks after a meeting with Rice–“I want to say that I’m more troubled today”–marked a turning point, after which Democrats knew that Rice’s candidacy would be a losing proposition.

In her remarks at the Conservative Political Action Conference this morning, Ayotte touched on foreign policy but returned to the domestic issues that were the theme of her election campaign in 2010:

Let me tell you about some of the things that keep me up at night. Too many Americans are out of work. Federal regulations are strangling businesses. Obamacare is increasing health care costs and stopping so many of those businesses from hiring. And I come from a small business family. I know what that’s like. How hard the small businesses work. We have a broken tax code and the president and Senate Democrats, they just want to keep increasing taxes, making it harder and harder, for our small businesses to hire and grow and put people to work in this country. Our nation is drowning in debt. We have had four straight years of trillion dollar deficits.

In 2012, Ayotte was considered a long-shot contender to be Mitt Romney’s running mate. While that may have been premature, it likely portends Ayotte’s future. She is one of the few conservatives who is fluent in both the Tea Party’s constitutionalism and the hawkish policy prescriptions of the national security wing of the Republican Party."

Although there was plenty of discussion during the 2012 presidential campaign about the Hispanic vote and how intense black turnout would be, the press was preoccupied with the white vote: the white working class, white women and upscale whites.

Largely missing from daily news stories were references to research on how racial attitudes have changed under Obama, the nation’s first black president. In fact, there has been an interesting exploration of this subject among academics, but before getting to that, let’s look back at some election results.

In the 16 presidential elections between 1952 and 2012, only one Democratic candidate, Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964, won a majority of the white vote. There have been nine Democratic presidential nominees who received a smaller percentage of the white vote than Obama did in 2008 (43 percent) and four who received less white support than Obama did in 2012 (39 percent).



In 2012, Obama won 39 percent of the white electorate. Four decades earlier, in 1972, George McGovern received a record-setting low of the ballots cast by whites, 31 percent. In 1968, Hubert Humphrey won 36 percent of the white vote; in 1980, Jimmy Carter got 33 percent; in 1984, Walter Mondale took 35 percent of the ballots cast by whites. As far back as 1956, Adlai Stevenson tied Obama’s 39 percent, and in 1952, Stevenson received 40 percent – both times running against Dwight D. Eisenhower. Two Democratic nominees from Massachusetts, Michael Dukakis in 1988 (40 percent) and John Kerry in 2004 (41 percent), got white margins only slightly higher than Obama’s in 2012 — and worse than Obama’s 43 percent in 2008. In other words, Obama’s track record with white voters is not very different from that of other Democratic candidates.

Ballots cast for House candidates provide another measure of white partisanship. These contests have been tracked in exit polls from 1980 onward. Between 1980 and 1992, the white vote for Democratic House candidates averaged 49.6 percent. It dropped sharply in 1994 when Newt Gingrich orchestrated the Republican take-over of the House, averaging just 42.7 percent from 1994 through 2004. White support for Democrats rose to an average of 46.7 percent in 2006 and 2008 as public disapproval of George W. Bush and of Republicans in Congress sharply increased.

How can the percentage of people holding anti-black attitudes have increased from 2006 to 2008 at a time when Obama performed better among white voters than the two previous white Democratic nominees, and then again from 2008 to 2012 when Obama won a second term?

In the aftermath of Obama’s election, white support for Congressional Democrats collapsed to its lowest level in the history of House exit polling, 38 percent in 2010 — at once driving and driven by the emerging Tea Party. In 2012, white Democratic support for House candidates remained weak at 39 percent.

Despite how controversial it has been to talk about race, researchers have gathered a substantial amount of information on the opinions of white American voters.

The political scientists Michael Tesler of Brown University and David O. Sears of UCLA have published several studies on this theme and they have also written a book, “Obama’s Race: The 2008 Election and the Dream of a Post-Racial America,” that analyzes changes in racial attitudes since Obama became the Democratic nominee in 2008.

In their 2010 paper, “President Obama and the Growing Polarization of Partisan Attachments by Racial Attitudes and Race,” Tesler and Sears argue that the

evidence strongly suggests that party attachments have become increasingly polarized by both racial attitudes and race as a result of Obama’s rise to prominence within the Democratic Party.

Specifically, Tesler and Sears found that voters high on a racial-resentment scale moved one notch toward intensification of partisanship within the Republican Party on a seven-point scale from strong Democrat through independent to strong Republican.

To measure racial resentment, which Tesler and Sears describe as “subtle hostility towards African-Americans,” the authors used data from the American National Election Studies and the General Social Survey, an extensive collection of polling data maintained at the University of Chicago.

In the case of A.N.E.S. data, Tesler and Sears write:

The scale was constructed from how strongly respondents agreed or disagreed with the following assertions: 1) Irish, Italian, Jewish and many other minorities overcame prejudice and worked their way up. Blacks should do the same without any special favors. 2) Generations of slavery and discrimination have created conditions that make it difficult for blacks to work their way out of the lower class. 3) Over the past few years, blacks have gotten less than they deserve. 4) It’s really a matter of some people not trying hard enough; if blacks would only try harder they could be just as well off as whites.

The General Social Survey included questions asking respondents to rate competing causes of racial discrimination and inequality:

The scale was constructed from responses to the following 4 items: 1) Irish, Italian, Jewish and many other minorities overcame prejudice and worked their way up. Blacks should do the same without any special favors. 2) A 3-category variable indicating whether respondents said lack of motivation is or is not a reason for racial inequality. 3) A 3-category variable indicating whether respondents said discrimination is or is not a reason for racial inequality. 4) A three-category variable indicating whether respondents rated whites more, less or equally hardworking than blacks on 7 point stereotype scales.

Supporting the Tesler-Sears findings, Josh Pasek, a professor in the communication studies department at the University of Michigan, Jon A. Krosnick, a political scientist at Stanford, and Trevor Tompson, the director of the Associated Press-National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago, use responses from three different surveys in their analysis of “The Impact of Anti-Black Racism on Approval of Barack Obama’s Job Performance and on Voting in the 2012 Presidential Election.”

Pasek and his collaborators found a statistically significant increase from 2008 to 2012 in “explicit anti-black attitudes” – a measure based on questions very similar those used by Tesler and Sears for their racial-resentment scale. The percentage of voters with explicit anti-black attitudes rose from 47.6 in 2008 and 47.3 percent in 2010 to 50.9 percent in 2012.

Crucially, Pasek found that Republicans drove the change: “People who identified themselves as Republicans in 2012 expressed anti-Black attitudes more often than did Republican identifiers in 2008.”

In 2008, Pasek and his collaborators note, the proportion of people expressing anti-Black attitudes was 31 percent among Democrats, 49 percent among independents, and 71 percent among Republicans. By 2012, the numbers had gone up. “The proportion of people expressing anti-Black attitudes,” they write, “was 32 percent among Democrats, 48 percent among independents, and 79 percent among Republicans.”

At the moment, the population of the United States (314 million) is heading towards a majority-minority status in 2042.

The American electorate, on the other hand (126 million) is currently 72 percent white, based on the voters who cast ballots last November.

Obama’s ascendency to the presidency means that, on race, the Rubicon has been crossed (2008) and re-crossed (2012).

What are we to make of these developments? Is the country more or less racist? How can the percentage of people holding anti-black attitudes have increased from 2006 to 2008 at a time when Obama performed better among white voters than the two previous white Democratic nominees, and then again from 2008 to 2012 when Obama won a second term?

In fact, the shifts described by Tesler and Pasek are an integral aspect of the intensifying conservatism within the right wing of the Republican Party. Many voters voicing stronger anti-black affect were already Republican. Thus, in 2012, shifts in their attitudes, while they contributed to a 4 percentage point reduction in Obama’s white support, did not result in a Romney victory.

Some Republican strategists believe the party’s deepening conservatism is scaring away voters.

“We have a choice: we can become a shrinking regional party of middle-aged and older white men, or we can fight to become a national governing party,” John Weaver, a consultant to the 2008 McCain campaign, said after Obama’s re-election. Mark McKinnon, an adviser to former President George W. Bush, made a similar point: “The party needs more tolerance, more diversity and a deeper appreciation for the concerns of the middle class.”

Not only is the right risking marginalization as its views on race have become more extreme, it is veering out of the mainstream on contraception and abortion, positions that fueled an 11 point gender gap in 2012 and a 13 point gap in 2008.

Given that a majority of the electorate will remain white for a number of years, the hurdle that the Republican Party faces is building the party’s white margins by 2 to 3 points. For Romney to have won, he needed 62 percent of the white vote, not the 59 percent he got.

Working directly against this goal is what Time Magazine recently described as the Republican “brand identity that has emerged from the stars of the conservative media ecosystem: Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Bill O’Reilly, Ann Coulter, and others.”

It is not so much Latino and black voters that the Republican Party needs. To win the White House again, it must assuage the social conscience of mainstream, moderate white voters among whom an ethos of tolerance has become normal. These voters are concerned with fairness and diversity, even as they stand to the right of center. It is there that the upcoming political battles — on the gamut of issues from race to rights — will be fought."

WASHINGTON (AP) - Former senator. Richard Lugar is being knighted on orders from the queen of England, joining a select list of Americans to receive the distinction.

The Indiana Republican, who this year left the Senate after serving 36 years, will receive the rank of honorary Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire during a ceremony at the British Embassy in Washington on Tuesday. The British ambassador, Sir Peter Westmacott, is set to preside.

Since leaving the Senate, Lugar has taken on various roles, including leading the Richard G. Lugar Institute for Diplomacy and Congress with the German Marshall Fund. He also serves as a distinguished scholar and professor at the Indiana University School of Global and International Studies.

Lugar said he is deeply honored to be knighted. ""I will focus my service on solving our most serious challenges in a spirit of cooperation between our countries,"" he said in a statement Monday.

He said he was first inspired by Queen Elizabeth's leadership ""when she received me as the young Rhodes Scholar in London, 58 years ago and asked me about Indiana.""

Lugar's studies at Oxford University were his first outside of the United States. He went on to become one of the Senate's foremost foreign policy experts, focusing much of his work on nuclear proliferation issues and relations with Europe. Along with former Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., Lugar crafted legislation that helped eliminate nuclear warheads in the former Soviet Union.

Lugar will not be known as ""sir"" Lugar - only royal subjects can carry that title. But few Americans have received honorary knighthood, including Presidents Dwight Eisenhower, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush.

Lugar was defeated in a Republican primary in 2012, finishing his sixth term in office early this year. Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly won the race to replace him."

Washington (CNN) - A new national survey confirms what a months long, top-to-bottom Republican Party review finds as well: That the GOP ""is out of touch"" and seen as the party of ""stuffy old men.""

A CNN/ORC International poll also indicates that President Barack Obama's job approval rating has dipped below 50% for the first time since September, with half of the public saying they disapprove of the job he's doing in the White House. And it appears that the president's stand on the issues and the glaring spotlight in recent months on fiscal and budget issues, never Obama's sweet spot, are contributing to the drop in his overall numbers.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

According to the poll, 54% of Americans have an unfavorable view of the Republican Party, with less than three in ten saying they view the GOP in a favorable light. The poll's Monday release came on the same day that the Republican National Committee released a major review of their performance in the 2012 elections, and how to fix what went wrong.

""The Democrats are not overwhelmingly popular - 46% of Americans have a favorable view of the Democrats, compared to 48% with an unfavorable view - but in a two-party system, you only need to be more popular than your opponent to have an advantage,"" says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland.

""Unfavorable views of the GOP extend into nearly every other major demographic,"" adds Holland. ""The Republican Party's unfavorable rating is over 50% among men, women, the young, the old, the rich, the poor, and just about every region of the country besides the South, where the GOP can manage no better than a 45%-45% tie on the question.""

Just over two-thirds of those questioned in the survey say the Republican Party favors the rich and nearly half think the GOP's policies are too extreme.

While the Republican Party's numbers are nothing to celebrate, it's not as if the president can brag about his polls. Forty-seven percent say they approve of the job Obama's doing in office, down eight points since the start of the year, with 50% saying they disapprove. That's up seven points from January and it's the highest that number has been in over a year. The 47% approval rating in the CNN poll is in line with recent numbers from surveys from other news organizations.

The poll finds the expected partisan divide, with Democrats overwhelmingly approving of the president and Republicans overwhelmingly disapproving, and Obama at 41% approval – 53% disapproval among independent voters.

By a 57%-42% margin, the public says Obama has the personal qualities a president should have.

""Americans still respond positively to the president's personal characteristics - it's his stands on the issues that they disagree with,"" says Holland. ""Fewer than a third approve of how the president is handling the government's budget and fiscal policies, and the White House's 'charm offensive' has not registered with the American public.""

Fifty-six percent say Obama is not doing enough to cooperate with the Republicans in Congress. Not great, but less than seven in ten who feel that the Republicans are not doing enough to cooperate with Obama.

Only 31% say they approve of how the president's handling the budget and fiscal policy. Again, nothing to brag about but higher than the 19% who give the Republicans in Congress a thumbs up on the issue. And Americans are divided on whether the White House or congressional Republicans has the better budget and fiscal policies.

As for the forced federal spending cuts, which started kicking in at the beginning of the month, six in ten said the cuts were having a great deal or some effect on the nation's economy, and 35% said the cuts were having a great deal or some effect on their own financial situation.

The poll also has new favorable ratings on some Republicans in the news. Mitt Romney stands at 41% favorable and 52% unfavorable, close to his numbers in mid November, soon after the 2012 GOP presidential nominee lost the November election to Obama. The previous GOP nominee, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, stands at 46%-42%. But it's a different story for his running mate in 2008. Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who got a very warm reception this past weekend at the Conservative Political Action Conference, has a 34% favorable rating and a 58% unfavorable rating.

The poll was conducted March 15-17 for CNN by ORC International, with 1,021 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points."

In other words—the vast majority of folks in the U.S seem to fall into some group Teapublicans are taking out their ire upon.

It’s amazing to me when I add up the numbers.



My first face-to-face encounter with Teapublicans was back in 2010, in my neighboring town of Kingston, New York, which I wrote about in a piece called "" Social Justice is Tyranny ,"" the title taken from one of the many signs held up by people with hate-filled faces.

Trying to talk to them was futile. They were opposed to paying taxes, yet wanted the government to keep its dirty hands off their Medicare. They had been fed on a steady diet of anti-government sentiment and conspiracy theories from Faux News. Their heroes are the Glenn Becks and Rush Limbaughs of the world.

I had a strong feeling then that we were going to be in trouble as a nation if these people, and people like them, were going to elect representatives who held their views. Yes, they didn't win the presidency (twice), but their elected cabal in Congress could care less. They don't recognize him as legitimate.

These people are not rich. They depend on government services. Yet their hate, deeply rooted in fear, keeps them from voting in their own interest.

Democracy Corps' ""Republican Party Project"" has recently issued a report from focus groups conducted with the three main factions that currently comprise a majority of the Republican Party, which helps to illuminate the forces behind the Teapublican shutdown:



Evangelicals. Social issues are central for Evangelicals and they feel a deep sense of cultural and political loss. They believe their towns, communities, and schools are suffering from a deep “culture rot” that has invaded from the outside. The central focus here is homosexuality, but also the decline of homogenous small towns. They like the Tea Party because they stand up to the Democrats. Tea Party. Big government, Obama, the loss of liberty, and decline of responsibility are central to the Tea Party worldview. Obama’s America is an unmitigated evil based on big government, regulations, and dependency. They are not focused on social issues at all. They like the Tea Party because it is getting “back to basics” and believe it has the potential to reshape the GOP. Moderates. Moderates are deeply concerned with the direction of the country and believe Obama has taken it down the wrong path economically. They are centrally focused on market-based economics, small government, and eliminating waste and inefficiency. They are largely open to progressive social policies, including on gay marriage and immigration. They disdain the Tea Party and have a hard time taking Fox News seriously.

And while few explicitly talk about Obama in racial terms, the base supporters are very conscious of being white in a country with growing minorities. Their party is losing to a Democratic Party of big government whose goal is to expand programs that mainly benefit minorities. Race remains very much alive in the politics of the Republican Party.

In the analysis of the focus group results (PDF) they point out:The first two groups are holding any elected moderate Republicans (a minority) hostage, just as they hold all of us hostage to their obsessions, paranoia, and hate.

The most important thing we each can do is fight this in every district currently controlled by Teapublicans.

MoveOn/PPP has identified seats that could be vulnerable:



Twenty-four new surveys in GOP-held House districts, commissioned by MoveOn.org and conducted in the wake of the government shutdown, make clear that Republicans could easily lose control of the House if the next election were held today. The surveys challenge conventional wisdom that gerrymandering has put the House out of reach for Democrats and indicate the shutdown has significant electoral implications.

Yes, 2014 elections are a year away.

We have to put in the footwork now, registering new voters, fighting voter disenfranchisement efforts and making plans to get voters to the polls."

After the Republican-controlled House of Representatives decided to shut down the government in a desperate attempt to take away the ability of the less fortunate to get health insurance, their polling took a major hit. Over half the country now thinks that it's a bad thing that the Republican Party controls the House; three quarters of Americans believe that Republican members of Congress don't deserve re-election.

All of those numbers would be bad in their own right, but there's one that's even worse, as Steve Benen at MSNBC reports:



The results cover quite a bit of ground, but there was one question in particular that stood out for me: respondents were asked whether they believe the various officials in Washington are more interested in doing what’s best for the country or what’s best for themselves politically. It’s an interesting question because it speaks to something that isn’t often polled: perceptions of motivations. I put together the chart above to capture the results, which should terrify Republican officials. By a nearly four-to-one margin, Americans believe GOP lawmakers in Congress aren’t concerned with the nation’s best interests. That’s just astounding.

Given the revulsion that the American public feels toward Congress in general, it's unsurprising that Democrats on Capitol Hill are operating at a deficit in this regard as well, even if it isn't nearly as steep as that faced by their Republican counterparts. But what should scare Republicans even more than their own abysmal numbers? President Obama's. Despite every single thing that Republicans have said and done to delegitimize the President, ascribe evil intentions to him, and impute that he does not share American values, a majority of Americans think that he cares about what is best for the country more than being motivated by selfish intentions.

Yet despite these drastically horrible numbers, some in the tea party faction seem predisposed to favor yet another shutdown, yet another hostage fight with President Obama as the country's economic future hangs in the balance. If that is indeed what they choose to do, the message is very simple: this group of House Republicans simply does not care about this country and its people. It's a stark message, but the polling bears out its resonance. Even though the midterm elections are over a year away, Democrats have the best opportunity they have had in many years to permanently damage the opposing brand.

The specifics of policy positions are relevant to this opportunity, of course; but far more relevant is the simple fact that House Republicans have placed their political vendettas over the well-being of the country as a whole. The American public no longer trust that these Republicans are the type of people who want to do the right thing, and that is far bigger than any policy issue."

“I think it’s very surprising to accuse somebody of espionage who hasn’t worked for a foreign government, who didn’t covertly pass information to an adversary-enemy of the United States, who didn’t sell any top secret information, who simply went to newspapers, asked newspapers to very carefully vet the information to make sure that the only thing being published are things that inform his fellow citizens but doesn’t harm national security,"" Greenwald said in a phone interview. ""That is not espionage in any real sense of the word.”

If I could have a word with Greenwald, I'd give him this advice to keep him from absolutely making a fool of himself. I'm afraid it's to late:

1. Just write the stories and shut-up. Your advocacy journalism is reminding me of James O'keefe. That's foolish, my man.

2. Quit responding to every one of your critics. Makes you look childish and petulant.

3. Quit managing Snowden's image--you're supposed to be a ""journalist,"" not his publicists.

4. Quit telling me what I should be outraged about--that's offensive and foolish.

5. Quit taking everything Snowden's says for absolute law. There's still a healthy skepticism about the veracity of some of his claims.

6. Quit claiming to speak for the American people and let your work speak for itself.

7. Cancel your TV tour...you look angry and out of control.

8. Now that Snowden has been charged, don't become a co-conspirator in this mess.

9. Quit playing the god of America's consciousness...it's getting old.

10. It is absolutely foolish to think that any president (regardless of party) would allow ""any leaker"" to distribute intelligence information around the world without repercussions. For you to think this President would give him an ""ata-boy"" and open the door to a flood of others is utterly foolish and devoid of understanding.

Yes, I believe Greenwald has poisoned this story."

I put together the chart above to capture the results, which should terrify Republican officials. By a nearly four-to-one margin, Americans believe GOP lawmakers in Congress aren’t concerned with the nation’s best interests. That’s just astounding.

Given the revulsion that the American public feels toward Congress in general, it's unsurprising that Democrats on Capitol Hill are operating at a deficit in this regard as well, even if it isn't nearly as steep as that faced by their Republican counterparts. But what should scare Republicans even more than their own abysmal numbers? President Obama's. Despite every single thing that Republicans have said and done to delegitimize the President, ascribe evil intentions to him, and impute that he does not share American values, a majority of Americans think that he cares about what is best for the country more than being motivated by selfish intentions.

Yet despite these drastically horrible numbers, some in the tea party faction seem predisposed to favor yet another shutdown, yet another hostage fight with President Obama as the country's economic future hangs in the balance. If that is indeed what they choose to do, the message is very simple: this group of House Republicans simply does not care about this country and its people. It's a stark message, but the polling bears out its resonance. Even though the midterm elections are over a year away, Democrats have the best opportunity they have had in many years to permanently damage the opposing brand.

The specifics of policy positions are relevant to this opportunity, of course; but far more relevant is the simple fact that House Republicans have placed their political vendettas over the well-being of the country as a whole. The American public no longer trust that these Republicans are the type of people who want to do the right thing, and that is far bigger than any policy issue."

Well, his half-comeback. His halfback?","Restless, a little wistful and sharply critical of President Barack Obama's second term, Mr. Romney said in an interview that he plans to re-emerge in ways that will ""help shape national priorities.""

As a first step, the former Republican presidential nominee plans to welcome 200 friends and supporters to a three-day summit next week that he will host at a Utah mountain resort. He is considering writing a book and a series of opinion pieces, and has plans to campaign for 2014 candidates.

There is so much gold in this Wall Street Journal article about Mitt Romney's future plans that I am already giddy with anticipation His first priority is apparently going to be selling Utah timeshares—I mean, bringing his friends together for a few days of privately talking about stuff. Then it will be on to Having Opinions In Public.The WSJ report says the Utah Friends o' Romney Summit and Failure Emporium will be ""splashy, expensive, and closed to outsiders and the press,"" which makes it sound a bit like either a Roman orgy or a Gatsby shindig. I look forward to hearing nothing of substance about it. (If you don't think Mitt's team will be confiscating everything that even looks like a camera and throwing them all into the fires of Mt. Doom before the event begins, oh my—you and I may have a wager to make. I'm not sure they'll allow pencils.)

But don't even tempt us with the possibility of a Mitt Romney book tour. No. Watching Mitt Romney do the talk show rounds to promote a hip new policy prescription for America would be too fine a thing to ask for. Mitt's already offering great, great advice—like how the GOP needs to ""translate our message in a way that minorities understand."" (These new efforts to ""translate"" their message to minorities so far seem to be based on the usual way people attempt to communicate with ethnic people who don't seem to understand them: Say the same thing, but talk LOUDER.)

His Utah event, though, really shows just how much ol' Mitt has his finger on the pulse of Regular Guy America:



The retreat will offer some unusual extracurriculars: Skeet shooting with Mr. Ryan; golfing with Mr. Paul; horseback riding with Mitt and Ann Romney; hiking with Hewlett-Packard CEO Meg Whitman.

Oh dear Lord, thank you for this sweet bounty. ""Hiking with Meg Whitman"" should be the title of Mitt's book. Just throwing that out there."

Story highlights NEW: Some in Congress say they're planning on giving their pay to charity during shutdown Thousands of federal workers have been furloughed and will lose pay in the shutdown Members of Congress will still get paid, as mandated by the 27th Amendment Some lawmakers say they will give their paychecks to the Treasury or to charity

Are you affected by the shutdown? What’s your message for Washington? Send it to CNN iReport and you could be part of CNN’s coverage.

(CNN) —

In an extended shutdown, most of the federal workforce would go without pay, but the checks will keep coming to the 533 current members of Congress.

Who gets paid in a shutdown and who doesn’t?

“That is disgraceful in my view,” said freshman Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, told CNN. “Basically the only people who get paid in a shutdown are members of Congress, and that is irresponsible.”

Gabbard plans to send any pay she receives during a shutdown back to the Treasury. The combat veteran said she was shocked to find out recently that members’ pay is protected.

It is – by the Constitution.

Opinion: Taxpayers, you deserve your money back

The 27th Amendment to the Constitution restricts any Congress from changing its own pay. The measure was proposed in the first days of the Republic but was not ratified until 1992, after a grass-roots movement promoted the idea and the necessary number of state legislatures approved it.

While many may have wanted to restrain Congress from increasing its pay, the amendment also blocks Congress from freezing or cutting its compensation.

The result? Congress gets paid no matter what. Gabbard is not the only member surprised.

The list: What’s open, what’s closed

“I don’t even know whether it stops or not,” Rep. John Fleming, R-Louisiana, said when asked about his pay during a shutdown.

When told that the Constitution mandates congressional paychecks stay as-is, Fleming responded that he hadn’t thought through what he would do yet but would likely donate his pay during a shutdown to charity.

“Obviously we need to share the pain of the American people,” he concluded.

The offices for the top two members of Congress – House Speaker John Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid – wouldn’t respond to specifics about their pay.

According to a report by the Lexington Herald-Leader newspaper, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, plans to donate his salary to charity during the shutdown.

Rep. Pete Gallego, D-Texas, told CNN he is urging his fellow members of Congress to donate their pay to charitable causes.

“I don’t think we should get paid until (the shutdown) is resolved,” Rep. Pete DeSantis, R-Fla, told CNN’s Jake Tapper on Tuesday. “I’ve asked the clerk to withhold any pay for me until we get this up and running. I just think that that’s fair for the folks involved who’ve been negatively affected by this.”

House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, disagreed with DeSantis. “I think that’s another game (House Republicans) want to play, appealing to a demagogic approach to this,” Hoyer told Tapper on Tuesday.

Shutdown ‘extremely damaging’ to U.S. intelligence operations

“Members of Congress ought to be on the job working hard,” Hoyer added, “getting this job done to the American people, getting their government opened, getting federal employees back to work and serving the public, serving the growth of our economy, serving our national security ends.”

While members will get paid, they must decide which of their own office staff have to go home.

Members of Congress run their own office payroll and will decide who is essential and non essential. But even congressional staff members who work during a shutdown would not get paid until later – only their bosses will get paid on time.

“My staffers are working with pay. Right now,” Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Oklahoma, said Tuesday on “Crossfire.”

“They’re doing oversight on the federal government. … They’re continuing to work on the waste.”

Coburn also said he’s keeping his salary earned during the shutdown. “I’m going to keep my salary and going to make sure I spend it and tithe it and give to it charities and do the thing that I’ve always done. … I’m not going to stop working.”

But Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, who appeared alongside Coburn on “Crossfire” on Tuesday, is taking a different approach.

“Eighty percent of my staff, unfortunately, is on furlough,” she said, “I’m going to be contributing [my salary] on a daily basis. For every day we are not seeing an open – a government that’s open, I’m contributing.”

The July 28 episode featured several reporters, including the show’s senior producer Jim Harper (played by John Gallagher Jr.), getting thrown off the Romney presidential campaign bus for asking tough questions.

Did something like that actually happen?

Patrick Hynes, an adviser to Gov. Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign who worked with online media for the communications department, answered some questions from Breitbart News about the show via email.

Big Hollywood: What was your reaction to The Newsroom scene description about reporters getting booted off the Romney campaign?

Patrick Hynes: My initial reaction was that once again the Hollywood left is out to depict Republicans as unreasonable, authoritarian, stupid, hostile and mean spirited because in the absence of such a stereotype, Republicans might actually win some elections, and well, we can’t have that, can we?



BH: To your knowledge, did any such event ever take place during the campaign?

PH: No, nothing like that ever took place, as far as I know. Don’t get me wrong, relations between the campaign and the press were not good and there were frequent moments of hostility every day. But I don’t recall ever hearing of reporters getting thrown off the bus.

BH: If such an event occurred, would you have heard about it? Would Gov. Romney have heard about it?

PH: I would have heard about it. We would almost certainly have been in rapid response mode if something like this had happened. In fact, it would have been impossible for anyone not to hear about it, as anything like this fictional account would have consumed a day’s worth of campaign coverage. There is nothing the press likes to cover more than itself.

BH: Why do you think a show would manufacture such an event?

PH: To make a boring and insufferable program slightly more interesting and to make Republicans look stupid."

I encourage everyone to get involved.

The right-wing's stranglehold on state houses across the country is a real problem progressives need to address -- Republicans don't need Congress to push their radical right-wing agenda. They're doing it right now, on the state level, in states across the country:

-- Ending women's right to choose

-- Busting unions

-- Deregulating industries and pillaging the environment

-- Giving away huge tax breaks to big corporations and the super rich

Needless to say, we need to stop their radical agendas before they go any farther.

That's why DFA is launching the Purple to Blue Project, a new multi-year effort dedicated to winning state House and Senate chambers across the country -- starting right now in Virginia.

In 2011, Mr. Christie held a news conference where he accused State Senator Richard J. Codey of being “combative and difficult” in blocking two nominees. Mr. Codey, a Democrat who had served as governor following the resignation of James E. McGreevey, responded that he had not only signed off on the nominations, but had held a meeting to try to hurry them along.

Three days later, Mr. Codey was walking out of an event in Newark when he got a call from the state police superintendent informing him that he would no longer be afforded the trooper who accompanied him to occasional public events — a courtesy granted all former governors. That same day, his cousin, who had been appointed by Mr. McGreevey to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, was fired, as was a close friend and former deputy chief of staff who was then working in the state Office of Consumer Affairs.

“I understand politics, that a new administration comes in,” Mr. Codey said, but he believed this was not about Mr. Christie bringing in his own people. “This was all about sending a message.”

The governor laughed at the allegation of retribution, and his spokesman belittled the Democratic Party chairman who complained about it.

Later that year, the governor was pressing hard on Alan Rosenthal, the Rutgers political scientist whom Republicans and Democrats had chosen as the tiebreaking member of the commission that was redistricting the state’s legislative districts. Mr. Christie wanted Mr. Rosenthal to vote for the map put forward by the Republicans on the commission, but instead he chose the Democrats’ plan, saying it offered more stability.

Soon after, Mr. Christie used his line-item veto to cut $169,000 for two programs at Mr. Rosenthal’s institute at Rutgers.

The apparent payback is not always directed at Democrats — Mr. Christie can be just as hard on Republicans in an attempt to enforce party discipline."

(CNN) – President Barack Obama expressed gratitude last week to former President Jimmy Carter's grandson, who had a role in leaking secretly-recorded video of Mitt Romney's infamous ""47%"" comments, James Carter said Thursday on CNN.

Obama met James and his cousin, Georgia state Sen. Jason Carter, last week when the president was in Atlanta for a post-State of the Union visit.

""After (Jason) got his picture taken, he told Obama that I was the one that had found the 47% tape,"" James Carter said on CNN's ""The Situation Room.""

""Then Obama said, 'Hey, great, get over here.' And then he kind of half-embraced me, I want to say, put his arm around me, and we shook hands. He thanked me for my support, several times,"" he said.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

In the video, Romney argued at a private fundraiser in Florida that nearly half of Americans were victims ""dependent"" on the government and would vote for Obama ""no matter what.""

""There are 47% of people who are with him, who are dependent on government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, you-name-it,"" Romney said on the tape.

Adding to his argument about entitlement, Romney said his ""job is not to worry about those people.""

The moment caught on camera is still noted as a major turning point in the race and cited-even by Republicans-as one of the main reasons Romney lost the election. Many potential GOP 2016 contenders have sought to distance themselves from those comments.

Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, for example, said a week after Election Day that in order for the GOP to be ""competitive,"" it has to ""go after 100% of the votes, not 53%. We need to go after every single vote.""

James Carter, an opposition researcher, said he found the video online and got the person responsible for the tape in touch with a writer for the left-leaning magazine Mother Jones.

Asked by CNN's Wolf Blitzer if the person who filmed the video was a guest or a waiter at the event, Carter said, ""It wasn't one of the people who had paid $50,000 to be there. But I'm not going to say anything more than that.""

Carter added he had only seen a small portion of the hour-long tape at the time and had no idea it would blow up as much as it did last September.

""I obviously hoped that everything that I found would make a difference,"" he said. ""It ended up being way beyond my wildest dreams.""

Carter's grandfather, Jimmy Carter, bragged about his grandson's efforts in a separate interview to air Thursday on CNN's ""Piers Morgan Tonight.""

The former president said he thought the video was a ""pivotal moment"" in the election.

""It was something (Romney) could not deny and it stuck with him for the rest of the election and I think it was a major factor, if not the major factor,"" he said.

""Carter won Obama the election,"" Morgan joked.

""I think so,"" Carter said, laughing.

Carter added he was not at last week's Atlanta event himself, as he was giving his own speech in the same city, but was invited.

Last year, the former president told Morgan that he didn't have much of a relationship with Obama.

Asked if that had changed, Carter said it was ""about the same.""

""He and I respect each other,"" he said.

Peters'],Michele Bachmann Won’t Seek Re-election Next Year,"WASHINGTON — Representative Michele Bachmann, the Minnesota Republican whose status as a leading Tea Party voice in Congress has faded in the wake of a failed bid for president and a widening investigation into her campaign spending, said Wednesday that she would not seek re-election.

Mrs. Bachmann, defiant as ever as she insisted that she would have won re-election had she tried, said the legal inquiries had nothing to do with her decision. She vowed to continue to fight for the principles she said she holds dear: religious liberty, traditional marriage, family values and opposition to abortion.

“I fully anticipate the mainstream liberal media to put a detrimental spin on my decision not to seek a fifth term,” she said in a gauzy network-television quality video posted on her campaign Web site. “They always seemed to attempt to find a dishonest way to disparage me. But I take being the focus of their attention and disparagement as a true compliment of my public service effectiveness.”"

He Previously Wrote About The Russia Investigation.']",California fines groups $16 million for funneling money to campaigns,"SACRAMENTO — California officials are imposing a record $16 million in penalties on secretive political groups that funneled money into initiative campaigns in 2012, ending a yearlong investigation that showed gaps in state disclosure laws.

Two campaign committees in California are being ordered to pay a total of $15 million to the state, a sum equivalent to the donations they received, which regulators said were improperly reported. Two Arizona nonprofits, one linked to billionaire Republican donors Charles and David Koch, will pay a combined $1-million fine as part of a settlement.

The nonprofits are not being required to reveal their donors’ identities, even though disclosure was at the root of the investigation. Under existing campaign finance laws, the state cannot force the groups to release the names, officials said.

“California law doesn’t provide adequate disclosure of political contributions made through dark-money nonprofits,” said Fair Political Practices Commission Chairwoman Ann Ravel, who announced the investigation’s resolution Thursday along with the commission’s largest-ever penalties.

The case highlighted how some big-ticket donors have sought to influence political campaigns by relying on off-the-books methods. Anonymous donations have exploded in popularity since 2010, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the Citizens United case that many nonprofits can spend unlimited money on elections.

The controversial donations in California last year bankrolled two of the biggest conservative election causes: derailing Gov. Jerry Brown’s ultimately successful tax hike and supporting an unsuccessful ballot measure intended to limit unions’ political power.

Only a haphazardly redacted list of names, uncovered by state officials through their investigation, provides clues to some of the original donors’ identities.

Charles Schwab, the San Francisco investor, gave $6.4 million. The Fisher family, owners of clothing retailer Gap Inc., where Brown’s wife was once an executive, donated more than $9 million.

Los Angeles philanthropist Eli Broad provided $1 million, despite his public support for higher taxes on high-earning Californians. And casino owner Sheldon Adelson, one of the biggest Republican donors in the country, and his wife gave $500,000. B. Wayne Hughes, founder of Public Storage, donated $450,000.

None could be reached for comment.

The donors gave to Americans for Job Security, a Virginia trade association, as a first step in what officials characterized as a scheme designed to hide the original sources of campaign money. As the money was channeled to California, some of the transfers were not properly disclosed and therefore violated state law, officials said.

Thursday’s announcement drew mixed reactions from experts and advocates, who praised state officials for their aggressive probe and expressed concern about loopholes in disclosure laws across the country.

It’s rare for regulators to pursue such cases, said Paul S. Ryan, senior counsel for the Campaign Legal Center in Washington: “Voters don’t have the information they need to make informed decisions on election day.”

Phil Ung of California Common Cause, an advocacy group that filed the original complaint about the controversial donations last year, said new laws will be necessary to dissuade secret donors.

“You know they’ll be back. And they’ll be more sophisticated,” he said.

The donations that were routed through the Arizona nonprofits were solicited by Tony Russo, a California-based Republican political consultant, according to state officials.

Russo did not return calls requesting comment. But a state interview transcript shows he told investigators he wanted to use nonprofits to help with California campaigns.

“Koch, our understanding was, had a pretty significant network of groups,” Russo said. “So that’s why we went to Sean.”

Advertisement

Russo was referring to Sean Noble, a political operative who has worked with the Kochs and is president of the Arizona-based Center to Protect Patient Rights.

Donors wanted to remain secret, Russo said, “because of all the risk [of retribution] involved with the unions,” the interview transcript shows, and Noble seemed interested in helping.

A spokesman for the Koch brothers and their company, Robert Tappan, said they had no involvement in the battles over Propositions 30 or 32.

Officials said Russo offered donors two options: provide money directly to a California group called the Small Business Action Committee and have your identities revealed, or give to Americans for Job Security, and remain anonymous because the law does not require that group to identify its donors.

The money sent to Americans for Job Security was intended for “issue advocacy,” meaning advertising that doesn’t expressly urge Californians to vote one way or another. Because of laws on how and when such funds can be used, the group passed the money to the Center to Protect Patient Rights in Arizona.

The center then sent $11 million to a Phoenix group, Americans for Responsible Leadership, which provided it to the Small Business Action Committee.

Advertisement

In another transaction, using a separate source of money, the Center to Protect Patient Rights provided more than $4 million to the America Future Fund in Iowa, which relayed the money to the California Future Fund for Free Markets, a campaign committee supporting Proposition 32.

The settlement the state reached with the two Arizona nonprofits said violations of California law were inadvertent, and the investigation did not result in any criminal charges.

Kirk Adams, president of Americans for Responsible Leadership, said people who have a problem with anonymous political money “can take it up with the First Amendment.”

“What’s happened here is an attempt to intimidate groups like ours from participating in California politics,” Adams said.

Representatives from the Small Business Action Committee said they plan to fight the $11-million penalty.

http://news.yahoo.com/ap-interview-njs-christie-blames-aid-delay-dc-043519935.html,,[],AP Interview: NJ's Christie blames aid delay on DC,"TRENTON, N.J. (AP) — Gov. Chris Christie says he understands victims' frustrations a year after Superstorm Sandy but maintains that his administration isn't to blame for delays in aid reaching victims.

In an interview with The Associated Press as the anniversary of the Oct. 29 megastorm approached, Christie blamed Congress, which took three months to approve a $50.7 billion relief package for the region, and a thicket of red tape put in place to prevent the type of fraud that occurred after Hurricane Katrina.

""We've done everything we possibly can, and I think in the immediate aftermath did a very good job,"" Christie told the AP. ""Since then, we've kind of been hostage to two situations, the delay in the aid itself and then what I call the 'Katrina factor,' which is the much more detailed and difficult rules surrounding the distribution of the aid.""

Christie, widely believed to be positioning himself for a 2016 Republican presidential run, saw his popularity skyrocket after Sandy as he donned a blue fleece pullover and doggedly led the state through its worst natural disaster, a freakish storm that plunged 5.5 million state residents into darkness, damaged 360,000 homes and businesses, and disrupted gasoline supplies for days.

Christie was in many ways the face of the storm, whether he was embracing President Barack Obama during a visit to the battered coast or consoling a tearful 9-year-old girl who had lost her house and told the governor she was scared.

Lately, though, some of his admirers have become detractors.

Frustrations boiled over at a hearing last week on the pace of the recovery in Toms River, one of the hardest-hit communities. Storm victims there complained of insurance companies trying to lowball them on payouts, and stringent aid rules delaying them from rebuilding.

""These programs are intended to help; they're not. They're just putting more obstacles on you,"" said Vincent Giglio, a doctor from the Ortley Beach section of Toms River, which was devastated by the storm and remains sparsely populated a year later. He said getting insurance payouts and government aid has been daunting.

Story continues

""When I needed my government — the people I voted for — they failed me,"" said Danielle Vaz, of Toms River, who brought her 4-year-old autistic son along to show how months of being displaced has severely affected them both.

Christie refused to send an administration representative to any of four post-Sandy hearings because, he said, the sessions were led by Democrats out to score political points. He did assign staff to monitor the hearings and follow-up with anyone who complained.

""I get the that fact that until any one particular person you speak to is back in their homes and their lives are back to normal, they are going to be incredibly frustrated and upset and, in some cases, distraught,"" he said. ""I think most people, if you talk to them, would say we've done a good job. Not a perfect job, but a good job.""

Since the first $1.8 billion in federal recovery aid was approved, New Jersey has set up 17 separate programs for homeowners, renters, small businesses, local governments, nonprofits and developers. Counselors and administrative staff who were rude or unhelpful have been fired, he said.

The largest homeowner aid program, which provides as much as $150,000 for reconstruction, repairs, to elevate a house or protect against future flooding, has been criticized for not making any payouts from a $600 million allocation. One hundred grant applications totaling $7.8 million in assistance were signed last week, and the administration expects 200 more to be finished within days. About 4,000 homeowners are expected to benefit eventually.

Asked about the delay, Christie said cumbersome federal requirements are responsible.

After Katrina, homeowners proved their losses and got their money, he said. Under the new rules, checks go directly to builders, so the jobs are being awarded through public bidding, slowing the process. Also, environmental and historical reviews are required for post-Sandy rebuilding of homes and businesses. Those reviews weren't required after Katrina.

Though he said he understands the insistence on increased oversight, Christie, a former federal prosecutor, said he would have done some things differently. For example, he would have cut checks to homeowners instead of builders in the remediation program but required residents to keep living in their homes for a certain time as a condition of receiving the grant.

""To the victims, I'd say you're right, it is too slow, and I wish that the federal government would allow us the flexibility to get you aid more quickly,"" Christie said."

He noted that one of the surest signs of a marriage in trouble was that both parties were convinced that they had been forgiving of various betrayals and accommodating of various foibles, yet this generosity hadn’t been reciprocated. Naturally, this brought to mind the increasingly strained relationship between Tea Party conservatives and Republican regulars. What better way to describe how Ted Cruz must feel about John Boehner, the sellout, and how John Boehner must feel about Ted Cruz, the zealot?

Molly Ball of the Atlantic recounts the quasi-mutinous musings of various conservative luminaries, like Glenn Beck of TheBlaze, Erick Erickson of RedState.com, and Sean Hannity of Fox News, among others. As recently as 2010, the notion that the Tea Party movement would bolt from the GOP to establish a party of its own would have seemed absurd. But now, in the wake of a fiscal showdown that’s proven to be an utter fiasco for congressional Republicans, the idea of a bona fide divorce is gaining credence. Among the Tea Party faithful, there is a widespread conviction that the effort to defund Obamacare would have proven successful had Speaker Boehner and his anxious allies been tougher, and more willing to risk breaching the debt ceiling. Republican regulars, meanwhile, are largely convinced that the defund Obamacare effort was a hopeless indulgence that exacted a real political cost. At least one critic of the Tea Party movement, David Frum of the Daily Beast and CNN, has argued that Republicans would benefit if “the Sarah Palins and the Ted Cruzes who have done so much harm to their hopes over the past three election cycles” were to bolt.

This isn’t the first time libertarian-minded conservatives have contemplated a formal exit from the GOP. In the 1970s, William A. Rusher, the publisher of National Review and a staunch, Rockefeller-hating Goldwaterite, frequently made the case for a new conservative party, which he hoped would be led by Ronald Reagan. After Reagan’s narrow defeat in the 1976 contest for the Republican presidential nomination, however, the former California governor stood by his moderate rival Gerald Ford, and in doing so he dashed the hopes of Rusher and other third-party enthusiasts. The Libertarian Party, established in the early 1970s, has long been divided over whether to appeal to disaffected Republicans or hippies. In the 1980 presidential election, the Libertarians achieved great success by espousing a pacifist, left-leaning brand of “low-tax liberalism,” while in 1988 the party turned to Ron Paul, the libertarian populist who would later make waves as a Republican presidential candidate in 2008 and 2012. The 2012 Libertarian presidential nominee, former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson, an unpretentious Republican who combined familiar Tea Party bromides with a commitment to ending the War on Drugs, had some promise as an alternative to Mitt Romney, but in the end his candidacy proved to be a footnote, in part because the septuagenarian Paul stole his thunder. The Constitution Party, first established as the U.S. Taxpayers’ Party in 1991, is a vehicle for a hard-edged Christian conservative politics that has never found much success. And in 2000, Pat Buchanan tried to transform Ross Perot’s Reform Party into a nationalist conservative party in line with his own idiosyncratic, anti-trade populism.

Given that all of these efforts have failed, why would the Tea Party movement succeed in establishing itself as a real rival to the GOP? I doubt that it would. But it is true that the political landscape has changed in recent years. Over the past decade, formal party organizations have grown progressively weaker, to the point where they are hollowed-out shells often overshadowed by well-funded independent expenditure groups. This is despite the fact that broad-based party organizations have a number of advantages over non-party outfits, including greater accountability and autonomy. The Tea Party movement already operates as a kind of shadow party within the larger Republican universe, with independent expenditure groups, think tanks, and overlapping networks of intellectuals and activists serving as its foundation. Getting on the ballot would be difficult, as the Democratic-Republican duopoly in most states actively works to suppress political competition from minor parties, but it wouldn’t be impossible.

The obvious downside of a Tea Party exit for conservatives is that the U.S. relies almost exclusively on first-past-the-post elections, in which the candidate with the most votes wins the election. Countries that use various forms of proportional representation are far friendlier to minor parties, which is why Germany, Israel and New Zealand tend to have several parties represented in their national legislatures and not just two. Tea Party candidates in congressional races would presumably be splitting the right-of-center vote with GOP candidates, thus allowing Democrats to slip into office in areas that are now monolithically Republican. Moreover, Tea Party stalwarts have good reason to believe that they can eventually take over the national Republican Party. Why abandon it now when victory is within reach? Of course, the prospect of a Republican Party dominated by the Tea Party movement isn’t exactly heartening to mainstream conservatives who fear that Tea Party excesses will cement a generation-long Democratic majority.

Rather than an outright divorce, Republicans ought to consider a different approach. Right now, Tea Party activists are pledging to launch a new round of primary challenges against Republicans deemed “squishy.” The big problem with primary elections, however, is that they attract relatively few voters, and even fairly well-informed party members often know little about the candidates on primary ballots. Knowing a candidate’s party is tremendously useful — it offers a quick shorthand as to what candidates believe. Primary ballots are bereft of this kind of useful information. Yes, you can generally be assured that the candidates running in a GOP primary are Republicans. But which kind of Republican?

In “Informing Consent: Voter Ignorance, Political Parties, and Election Law,” Christopher Elmendorf of the UC Davis School of Law and David Schleicher of the George Mason University School of Law propose providing primary voters with on-ballot guides to candidates’ issue stances, as well as endorsements. For example, if a Tea Party candidate runs against a regular Republican, she can include endorsements by current officeholders (like Ted Cruz or Rand Paul) or widely-recognized political groups (like Tea Party Express). Republican primary voters would have a much easier time making a meaningful choice between candidates if they knew that one had been endorsed by the Tea Party Express while the other had been endorsed by the centrist Main Street Partnership. This wouldn’t make the GOP’s warring factions fall in love all over again. Indeed, it could intensify intra-party conflict by encouraging the formation of new pressure groups. But it would help settle the question of whether Republicans want to be the party of Sarah Palin and Ted Cruz or of Chris Christie and Jeb Bush. And that’s not nothing.

Supreme Court Justice Joan Orie Melvin and Janine Orie were convicted of campaign corruption

Former state Sen. Jane Orie is already in state prison

Melvin will likely face impeachment if she does not resign

PITTSBURGH (AP) — The story has more irony than a Greek tragedy. Three sisters from a devoutly Catholic family have seen their personal and political careers ruined by a scandal that began with, of all things, a letter to some nuns.

Thursday's conviction of suspended state Supreme Court Justice Joan Orie Melvin along with her aide and sister, Janine Orie, on campaign corruption charges mean they might join a third sister — former state Sen. Jane Orie — in state prison. No sentencing date has been set.

The former senator was sentenced last year to 2½ to 10 years for using her state-paid staff to run her campaigns, though she was acquitted of having them campaign for Melvin, then a lower appellate court judge, who was running for the Supreme Court in 2003 and 2009. Joan Orie Melvin and Janine Orie were convicted in a spinoff investigation and found guilty of similarly misusing Melvin's former staff and the senator's.

Even before the convictions, their careers — and the family from which they sprang — were extraordinary.

Dr. John Orie, now 90, and his late wife, Jean, raised nine children including five attorneys, Joan and Jane among them; two cardiologists; a teacher; and a human resources manager, Janine, who worked for her sister Joan Orie Melvin in the lower Superior Court before moving up with her to the Supreme Court.

""It's all pretty unbelievable,"" said John Burkoff, a university of Pittsburgh law professor who has closely followed the cases. ""Whatever you thought about the Orie sisters, whether you liked or didn't like them, you have to look at all of this as tragic.""

Jim Roddey is a prominent businessman who heads the Republican Party in Allegheny County, where Republicans are outnumbered more than 2 to 1 by Democrats and where Pittsburgh, the county seat, hasn't elected a GOP mayor since the Great Depression.

Before 2010, when Republican Tom Corbett was elected governor, Jane Orie was the state Senate majority whip — the highest-ranking elected Republican politician not just in Pennsylvania, but also of several states in the Northeast, Roddey said. And Melvin, elected in November 2009, was one of seven members of the state's highest court.

And now? Jane Orie resigned her Senate seat in May, and Melvin's status on the state's highest court figures to change, one way or another.

State lawmakers have already asked her to resign or face articles of impeachment. If those are approved by the state House, Melvin would be tried by the Senate, which could remove her from office if she hasn't already been removed by the state's Court of Judicial Discipline.

Now that she has been convicted, Melvin has 30 days to respond to charges of misconduct filed with that court by the state's Judicial Conduct Board. If it is determined Melvin has violated professional conduct rules or the state Constitution, or brought disrepute to the judiciary, the court can remove her from office.

Melvin's criminal defense attorneys and her disciplinary court attorney didn't return calls Friday.

The Ories have argued the prosecution is the result of a political vendetta by Allegheny County District Attorney Stephen Zappala Jr., a Democrat, who has repeatedly denied ulterior motives.

When the investigation first became public in late 2009, the sisters claimed they were being targeted because Zappala's family has interests in legalized gambling, which the Ories opposed expanding in Pennsylvania.

The allegations grew uglier, when Melvin — after it was known Sen. Orie was being investigated but before the justice was charged — called for an audit of two child care centers that paid kickbacks to two judges in northeastern Pennsylvania's Luzerne County who sent troubled youths to the facilities. The facilities were co-owned by Gregory Zappala, the prosecutor's brother, who was never charged in the scheme and has repeatedly denied wrongdoing.

To this day, some Orie supporters still believe those politics — not justice — drove the prosecution.

Roddey acknowledges the sisters' success in a politically hostile environment has something to do with that chatter.

""That's part of it,"" Roddey said. ""But the other half of the equation is that her prosecutor was Stephen Zappala, and Joan's biggest public battle was she chastised the Supreme Court for what happened in Luzerne County.""

Whatever the motivations, two juries have now found enough evidence to bring the overachieving siblings from triumph to tragedy despite a raft of supporters — Sen. Orie spent $420 on a chartered bus to bring 50 character witnesses to her trial — and, even, efforts to seek divine intervention.

During the investigation, which centered on the sisters' emails, prosecutors stumbled onto messages Sen. Orie and Melvin sent to the ""angel lady,"" a Philadelphia psychic who read her client's written questions aloud before claiming to receive a whispered answer from an angel.

The senator and justice sought assurances from the $85-an-hour medium that Zappala's investigation wouldn't result in criminal charges.

But rather than being touched by an angel, the sisters were undone by some nuns.

That happened in late October 2009 — days before Melvin won her Supreme Court seat — when a Senate intern complained to Zappala that Sen. Orie's staff was doing campaign work for Melvin.

The complaint centered on a letter Sen. Orie wrote on Melvin's campaign stationery asking Pittsburgh-area nuns to vote for Melvin.

When Orie and Melvin learned of the whistleblowing intern, the senator had a staffer prepare another letter — a ""cover-up"" letter, according to prosecutors. This time, Sen. Orie — on her own stationery — spoke about civic events of interest to nuns but didn't mention Melvin.

Prosecutors contend the letter was created to make it appear the intern was simply mistaken about what she saw and was never mailed. Eventually, Sen. Orie's and Melvin's staffs told a grand jury about other illegal campaign work done in Orie's Senate offices and Melvin's chambers.

""Frankly, it's a smart group of people. How could they put themselves in this kind of situation?"" Burkoff said. ""This is the kind of thing we'll be puzzling about for years."""

What a raging jagoff! So I'm sure you recall that the other day, Mark Sanford had the brilliant idea to run a full-page newspaper ad filled with an incredibly lengthy and self-serving series of b.s. explanations for why he trespassed at his ex-wife's home, followed by a whole lot of moaning about negative ads being run by Democrats, and capped off with a comparison of his situation to that of the men who defended the Alamo (who, of course, almost all died). In the middle, though, Sanford made this bizarre offer:



The Democrats' ads will tell you none of this, so if you have further questions, go to www.marksanford.com , call me at the campaign office at 843-764-9188, or even on my cell at 843-367-1010.

""Desperate"" and ""weird"" hardly begin to describe it, but one of the groups whose ads Sanford complained about, the House Majority PAC, decided to take him up on it. In a post-script to a fundraising email, they reprinted Sanford's cell phone number and suggested that their supporters ""[g]ive him a call and ask why he spent hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars on luxury travel."" A number of them did just that, so guess what Sanford did in response?

He published the phone numbers of the people who called him. These are ordinary citizens—perhaps a little brasher than average—but I'm sure they had no expectation that their numbers would get printed on Mark Sanford's campaign website. I don't want to even link to the document Sanford originally posted, but here's a redacted version, and to be clear, every black box you see obscures a number that Sanford had no problem reproducing in full:



You'll notice that all the numbers are from out-of-state, so I'm guessing Sanford wanted to make some kind of point that no one from South Carolina cared to ring him up—though iPhone users can prune their call logs, so Sanford may have erased any Palmetto State callers. Of course, the more important point is that Mark Sanford is an absolute schmuckface for publicizing the personal information of average Americans who had the temerity to take him up on his offer to talk to him. Sadly, though, that's hardly a surprise. I guess the only real question is, did he ever even answer the phone?"

Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli II on Wednesday condemned an anti-Semitic joke told by a Republican activist who spoke before him at a rally this week.

“I wasn’t there, but I heard about it that night, and, obviously, I think it was inappropriate and certainly unfortunate and something, if I’d heard it at the time, I’d have spoken to right there,” Cuccinelli, the Republican nominee for Virginia governor, told reporters after a candidates’ forum in Richmond on Wednesday morning.

But the incident put a spotlight on a GOP organizer who has close ties to Cuccinelli and who has helped steer the state party to the right this year.

John Whitbeck, the chairman of Virginia’s 10th Congressional District Republican Committee, is one of a half-dozen district leaders who pushed for a nominating convention over a primary this year. The move all but assured that Cuccinelli would win the nomination over Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling because conservative activists are more likely to attend a convention.

Whitbeck was also among those who took the dais to formally nominate Cuccinelli at the May convention.

At a rally Tuesday in Sterling, attended by Cuccinelli and conservative talk radio host Mark Levin, Whitbeck warmed up the crowd with a joke that made use of a stereotype about Jews. He described “the head of the Jewish faith” as presenting the pope with “the bill for the Last Supper.”

Democrats pounced on the chance to assail Cuccinelli for the company he keeps. Cuccinelli’s top strategist, Chris LaCivita, initially remarked, “I don’t even know who that guy is,” but he later said he did not mean to suggest that Cuccinelli and Whitbeck don’t know each other.

Cuccinelli, who is in a hard-fought race against Democrat Terry McAuliffe, was asked Wednesday if he knew about Whitbeck’s joke when he took the stage a few moments after it was delivered. He replied, “I didn’t know about it until last night.”

Whitbeck, a Leesburg lawyer, ran unsuccessfully in 2011 for the state House seat now held by Del. J. Randall Minchew (R-Loudoun). Until this week, Whitbeck was also seen as a leading candidate to run for state Sen. Mark R. Herring’s (D-Loudoun) seat if Herring is elected to succeed Cuccinelli as attorney general.

Asked about the joke at the Sterling event, Whitbeck said: “I heard it in church one day. The priest told it one day. I was at Mass. It was my daughter’s first day at Communion, I think. I thought, you know, I gotta do something, so I ran up there and told my story.”

Whitbeck has not responded to subsequent requests for comment on the reaction to his joke. He told the Loudoun Times-Mirror on Wednesday: “I did not tell an anti-Semitic joke. I told a joke I heard from a priest at a church service,” and then he said the controversy had been “wholly manufactured” by liberal groups.

Others defended Whitbeck and suggested that the joke was told in a moment of poor judgment.

“I’ve always known John to be a good-natured individual that people appreciate and who is a hard worker,” said Beau Correll, a member of the 10th Congressional District Republican Committee.

Not just Democrats and liberal groups have been critical of the remarks.

“It is not funny,” said Bobbie Kilberg, the president and chief executive of the Northern Virginia Technology Council and an active player in state Republican politics. Kilberg is Jewish. “It is totally inappropriate, and it is offensive. I conveyed that to him in an e-mail last night. I have not heard back.”

Ronald Halber, executive director of the Jewish Community Relations Council, also took Whitbeck to task.

“Clearly, it was inappropriate and an offensive remark,” said Halber, whose nonpartisan group represents more than 100 Jewish organizations in the Washington area. “It really has no place in civil discourse. It shows really bad judgment. I don’t understand why Mr. Whitbeck thought that picking fun or making stereotypes about a certain group would be a good opening act when [someone’s] running for governor.”

But Halber also praised the Cuccinellli campaign’s quick response.

“We are very appreciative that Ken Cuccinelli’s campaign denounced it right away after it happened,” Halber said. “That’s a good thing.”

The move to hold a convention that Whitbeck was a part of was seen as a turning point for the state Republican Party, a key victory in an internal battle between conservatives and moderates for control of the party.

But the switch to a convention also led to the selection of Chesapeake minister E.W. Jackson as the nominee for lieutenant governor. Jackson, who won an upset victory over six other candidates at the convention in Richmond, is popular with grass-roots conservatives but has a history of controversial comments about gays and abortion, among other subjects.

Virginia’s first lady has taken the field as a cheerleader for both the Washington Redskins and her husband.

Virginia’s first lady has taken the field as a cheerleader for both the Redskins and her husband, Gov. Robert. F. McDonnell.

Virginia’s first lady has taken the field as a cheerleader for both the Redskins and her husband, Gov. Robert. F. McDonnell.

Virginia first lady Maureen McDonnell bought nearly $9,800 in clothing with money from her husband’s political action committee and tapped into his campaign and inaugural funds to buy $7,600 in mostly unspecified items, according to records and a representative for the PAC.

The spending is legal under Virginia’s lax campaign finance laws, which prohibit the conversion of political funds for private use only when a PAC or campaign committee disbands — not while it is operating.

But the purchases are unusual in Virginia, where campaign finance records indicate that candidates do not routinely dip into political funds to buy personal items such as clothing for themselves or their spouses.

Maureen McDonnell’s use of political donations comes to light at a time when she and her husband, Gov. Robert F. McDonnell (R), are under intense scrutiny for accepting luxury items and $120,000 in loans from wealthy Virginia businessman Jonnie R. Williams Sr. Federal and state investigators are probing the Star Scientific executive’s ties to the McDonnells, who promoted his firm’s nutritional supplement, Anatabloc. Last week the governor apologized for embarrassing the commonwealth and repaid the loans.

Several gifts that have drawn investigators’ attention seem aimed at polishing Maureen McDonnell’s image as first lady. They are looking into whether the former Washington Redskins cheerleader and mother of five received free cosmetic dental work from a Richmond-area dentist, jewelry from a state delegate and a $15,000 Bergdorf Goodman shopping spree from Williams.

Using political money for clothes helped McDonnell step up her style while her family’s finances were hit by the plunging real estate market.

Bob McDonnell won the 2009 governor’s race as several properties that he and his family bought for a combined $3.84 million at the height of the real estate boom had lost value. Maureen McDonnell complained to officials at Opportunity Virginia PAC that she didn’t have the wardrobe or resources necessary for her new role as first lady, according to a person familiar with the PAC’s operations, who spoke on condition of anonymity to maintain a relationship with the McDonnells.

Maureen McDonnell was given a PAC credit card, according to that person. A representative of the PAC confirmed Friday that the card was provided to the first lady, but he added that she no longer has it. The representative answered questions on behalf of the committee on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the ongoing investigations.

Rich Galen, a private spokesman for the governor and first lady on matters related to the investigations, said that Maureen McDonnell was borrowing the clothes, which would be donated to charity after Bob McDonnell completes his term in January. The PAC also said that the items will be returned to the committee and then donated to charity.

Asked in a brief phone interview whether the committee spent money on department-store clothing, Phil Cox, director of the PAC and executive director of the Republican Governors Association, said: “All of the PAC expenditures are publicly available. What’s there is there.” Cox does not sign off on the PAC’s expense reports.

Outfitting herself

Maureen McDonnell has charged about $9,800 in clothing to the PAC, but that is not obvious from campaign finance reports filed by the committee.

None of the items the first lady put on the PAC credit card was identified as clothing in public records available online through the nonpartisan Virginia Public Access Project. The purchases are billed as “event expenses” and “travel expenses.” At times, however, the vendor listed suggests clothing: Nordstrom, Macy’s, Saks Fifth Avenue, Lord & Taylor and Ann Taylor. In all, the PAC spent $6,300 at those stores.

In those cases where the stores are identified, nothing in the public record links the purchases to Maureen McDonnell.

Her name is listed on three additional PAC expenses totaling about $3,500. But in those instances, the records do not indicate what was bought or where. Instead of clothing stores, the vendor listed is “Maureen McDonnell.” The purchases are identified as “travel expenses” and “event expenses.”

But the PAC representative confirmed that $9,800 in purchases — all of those publicly linked either to the clothing stores or to the first lady — were clothing for her. He said they were bought for official gubernatorial or political events.

She spent $2,379 at Nordstrom over two days in March 2012 and another $535 there a month before that, all to prepare for a trip to California to market Virginia products and attend a Republican Governors Association meeting.

She spent $1,121 in July 2012 at Saks to buy clothes for a gala celebrating the bicentennial of the governor’s mansion.

She spent about $6,000 around the time of McDonnell’s January 2010 inauguration, about half of that for clothing charged to the PAC. The other half: $3,087 that Bob McDonnell’s inaugural committee paid to her for unspecified “event expenses.”

The PAC representative said it was not clear what she bought with the inaugural funds. With the committee now closed and original receipts and other records in storage, he said the answer was not readily available.

Maureen McDonnell also received payments from two other committees associated with her husband. The Bob McDonnell for Governor committee paid her $2,369 in unspecified “event” and “travel” expenses in July and September 2009. Bob McDonnell for Attorney General reimbursed her $1,021 for a camera in August 2007 and $1,104 that December for unspecified “event supplies.”

The representative said he did not know what the camera was for. The nature of the other reimbursements also was unclear because records from those now-closed committees also are in storage, he said. Also unexplained was the $1,100 that Bob McDonnell for Governor spent at Dick’s Sporting Goods over three days in late October 2009.

‘No restriction’

When a campaign committee or PAC is being disbanded, candidates are prohibited from converting any surplus funds to personal use for themselves or immediate relatives. But while a political committee is running, “there are no restrictions,” said Nikki Sheridan, spokeswoman for the Virginia State Board of Elections.

“If they wanted to use the money to send their kids to college, they could probably do that,” she said. “There is no restriction on clothing, grooming or legal fees unless you’re shutting down your PAC.”

The law is one of the nation’s most lax. Most states restrict personal use at any stage in the life of a political committee, according to Karen Shanton, a legislative studies specialist with the National Conference of State Legislatures. But it is in keeping with Virginia’s no-limits, full-disclosure approach to campaign finance generally. The state has no caps on political contributions. And officeholders are allowed to take personal gifts of any value as long as they report those worth more than $50.

State elections officials said it is not unusual for candidates to call asking if they can charge their campaigns for the clothing they wear in the course of running for office. They are told that it is not illegal.

Whether it is a wise public relations move is another matter.

Del. Onzlee Ware (D-Roanoke) drew attention in 2009 for using campaign funds for personal items, including a YMCA membership.

State Board of Elections officials reviewed his spending but concluded there was no violation of the law after the attorney general’s office advised them in writing that the law “does not prohibit the personal use of campaign contributions by candidates or office holders unless or until” they disband their committees.

Even so, it appears to be more the exception than the rule that Virginia politicians use political funds to fill their closets.

U.S. Sen. Timothy M. Kaine (D) has had one clothing expense paid for with campaign funds — $708 at Nordstrom — since he ran for governor in 2004.

State Sen. A. Donald McEachin (D-Richmond), charged a $794 tuxedo from Franco’s Fine Clothier to his campaign account in early 2009 but refunded his campaign in mid-2010. McEachin said he had meant to pay personally for the tuxedo, which he was buying for an Urban League dinner, but accidentally pulled out his campaign credit card. He said he made the refund after discovering the error.

At least a handful of other Virginia candidates have billed their campaigns for relatively modest clothing or tailoring services.

The man Bob McDonnell defeated in 2009, state Sen. R. Creigh Deeds (D-Bath) charged $42 at Macy’s, $38 in Kohl’s and $84 at Dick’s Sporting Goods in the course of his campaign. All of the purchases were identified on his reports as clothing. He also billed his campaign for more than $500 in dry cleaning charges while he was on the campaign trail.

Deeds said he couldn’t recall what any of the clothing purchases were for, but said they were small and probably related to the difficulties of the hectic campaign pace.

“You’re out and you spill coffee on a necktie in the morning and you have big things to do the rest of the day,” he said, speaking hypothetically. “You’ve got to go out and buy a new necktie.”

Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli II’s gubernatorial campaign spent $182 at Macy’s in May after the Republican showed up to shoot a TV commercial with two blue shirts.

“[W]e needed the AG in various color shirts, so a staffer went to Macy’s and purchased what was needed,” campaign spokeswoman Anna Nix said via e-mail. “As a practice, the AG does not believe [in using] nor use campaign funds for personal use.”"

Mark Sanford fits both the ""adulterer"" and ""crook"" label, yet Republicans in the 1st Congressional District of South Carolina elected him to the U.S. House of Representatives anyways.

He disappeared for nearly a week during his second term as Governor of South Carolina and, when he returned to the United States, revealed that he had been unfaithful to his then-wife Jenny Sanford. It was later revealed that he had flown to Argentina and had an affair with the woman that he is now engaged to.

Sanford settled 37 ethics charges that stemmed from his affair and he paid the largest ethics fine in South Carolina history after settling the charges.

Weiner campaign manager Danny Kedem, 31, called it quits after days of punishing press for his boss.

“You know, we have an amazing staff, but this isn’t about the people working on the campaign,” Weiner told reporters Sunday after news broke of Kedem’s resignation.

Staff turnover is common for many high-profile political campaigns that hit the rocks, but Weiner’s struggles have stood apart.

Weiner had entered the mayoral race warning that more instances of his past sexual behavior might go public, but he struggled mightily Tuesday when a young woman told a website that she’d received sexual texts from Weiner long after he quit Congress over the same issue in June 2011.

Despite the public support of his wife, Huma Abedin, who addressed reporters alongside her husband when the allegations broke, questions about the extent of Weiner’s extramarital proclivities continued to dog him over the week.

On Thursday, after the young woman came forward, Weiner, 48, was unable to definitively answer exactly how many women he’d digitally flirted with after resigning from Congress. “I don’t believe I had any more than three,” he told reporters.

Sydney Leathers, 23, told “Inside Edition” that she and Weiner began corresponding in July 2012 -- about 13 months after he resigned from Congress.

Weiner has lost not just his campaign manager, but the polling lead that he had held. In the most recent NBC 4 New York/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll, Weiner’s unfavorability rating among New York Democrats rocketed to 55% after registering just 36% in June.

Weiner now trails Democratic rival and City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, 25% to 16%, for the party’s nomination. On Sunday, Quinn didn’t mind a dig at Weiner over the issue, which local media has dubbed “Weinergate.”

“That’s an answer he has to give New Yorkers, but I think clearly we’ve seen a pattern of reckless behavior and an inability to tell the truth,” Quinn told CBS2 in New York.

Also piling on was Republican candidate John Catsimatidis, who was far more blunt when addressing local media Sunday: “It’s over. I think he should just resign or just go away, take care of his family, and move on.”

Paladino easily defeated Adrian Fitzgerald Harris 79 percent to 20 percent to capture a seat representing the south Buffalo neighborhood. The move comes 2 1/2 years after Paladino lost the race for the governor's mansion to Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) by 29 percentage points after upsetting New York's Republican establishment in the GOP primary.

Paladino has described African American women school board members as a ""parasitic black sisterhood."" In 2010, the Buffalo Common Council considered a resolution condemning Paladino for racial insensitivity.

In 2011, Paladino proposed that Buffalo's school system create boarding schools in order to improve test scores. He said boarding schools would provide children with study skills, meals and a chance to escape dysfunctional families. He repeated the boarding school proposal during his school board campaign.

Despite his business success, Paladino has struggled in elective politics. In 2008, he used his own money in an unsuccessful effort to oust a Republican state senator he did not like.

Paladino won the 2010 Republican primary over former Rep. Rick Lazio, who was backed by the state GOP, based largely on landslide numbers in western New York, where he captured 93 percent of the vote in Buffalo's Erie County."

[…] One former RNC field staffer, who is Hispanic, described a culture of cynicism among his predominantly white colleagues when it came to minority outreach. He said that in his office, whenever they were notified of a new Republican outreach effort, they would pass around a Beanie Baby — which they had dubbed the ""pander bear"" — and make fun of the ""tokenism.""

He also recalled a Mitt Romney rally last year featuring Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, during which the staffer and his coworkers were tasked with finding Hispanics in the crowd who they could place on stage for the benefit of the TV cameras. It's a common, bipartisan practice in campaign politics — but one that his colleagues resented. ""My white peers were clearly not understanding what a powerful image a Hispanic senator standing in front of a sea of Hispanic Romney supporters would be,"" he said. ""They grumbled about it, treated it like a chore. Not racist or anything like that, just didn't understand why they were doing it.""

Who would have figured that Republican efforts at minority outreach have not been entirely sincere? No, really!Anytime you have to explain to someone that your crowd is ""not racist,"" but, you may have a problem. Anytime you try to hold a panel discussion on how not to be a racist only to have it interrupted by racists, you may have a problem. Anytime your minority outreach efforts have been assigned their own mocking Beanie Baby mascot by the office staff, you might just have a problem. (Then again, asking staffers to go out and find Hispanic Mitt Romney supporters in the crowd does sound like a special kind of torture.)

This points to the rather awkward problem faced by the GOP in their new ""minority outreach"" efforts. They know they're insincere, and everyone else knows they're insincere, so the entire episode has the element of farce built into it from the get-go. While Reince Preibus touts his new $10 million plan to have actual Republicans go out and talk to actual black and brown people, $10 million is not much of an ad budget when the rest of your organization has gone all-out on mocking and despising the very concept of diversity for more decades than most of your target audience has been alive.

Also a core part of this story: The ongoing cat fight between ex-RNC chair Michael Steele and the suit-wearing pickled egg that took over that slot, Reince Preibus. Steele's obvious disgust at Preibus and, by extension, the entire party apparatus propping him up gets funnier the longer it goes on."

""I have not received the letter,"" McCain told CNN Thursday morning. ""They sent the letter to Sen. Levin. It was Sen Graham and I and Ayotte that asked for an answer. We haven't received an answer."" In the interview, he said the letter's delay was a chief reason he was holding up a vote on Hagel's nomination. ""I have to receive a letter, I have to receive a letter, see whether I receive a letter or not, and there are other questions that other senators have raised which are not answered as well,"" McCain told CNN.

So McCain said he was upset that Sen. Carl Levin (D-MI) had received a letter with answers to his questions, but that he hadn't received it. Fair enough, except the thing is, McCain actually had received the letter—the very same letter that had been sent to Sen. Levin. The only catch: McCain had been cc'd.

The White House responded to McCain's concern by sending the exact same letter it had already sent to him, but this time it put him on the ""To:"" line and cc'd Levin. Problem solved, right? Sure, except by Thursday afternoon McCain had decided the reason Republicans were filibustering Hagel is that they are bitter about him saying they were wrong to support George W. Bush and Iraq.

This is all a dark comedy, really. Actually, more like a tragedy, because all this nonsense could have been avoided if a handful of Democrats hadn't killed filibuster reform last month. That's a mistake they can fix, however. Please sign the petition to tell Harry Reid: Re-open filibuster reform in light of continued Republican obstructionism."

There are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the president no matter what.

Perhaps the simple fact that it's exactly what you said?It'd be one thing if Mitt Romney apologized for his comments—or if he defended them. But pretending that he never even said them in the first place? That's like saying that not only does he believe 47 percent of Americans are lazy freeloaders who refuse to take personal responsibility for themselves, they—along with the rest of Americans—are stupid idiots who would trust Romney's revisionism over their lying eyes.

Rick Scott

Two months after contributing $110,000 to Gov. Rick Scott's re-election campaign, an upstart property insurance company is likely to reap a $52 million windfall, paid from the coffers of Citizens Property Insurance Corp.

If this isn't crooked, it's only because we've defined crookedness down so much that it doesn't exist anymore Here's the deal. Citizens Property Insurance Corp. is a state-run Florida insurance company. Because Florida has hit a lucky streak over the last years and not had as much hurricane damage as they had feared, they're sitting on a cash surplus of $6.4 billion dollars. But that surplus could go away if a devastating hurricane season does hit, and (shudder) there's even the possibility that a future bad hurricane could force the state to raise taxes to pay for the damage, so the governing state Republicans have a great plan to deal with that: They'll pay private companies to take profitable policies off their hands. (The premise is that this will mitigate possible losses later, presumably because if any of these smaller, privatized insurance companies were to later fail the state would tell disaster victims that were clients of those smaller firms to piss off.)

In this particular case, that has led to that not-too-unique special business flower: A new company apparently formed specifically to go after a single government contract and reap the rewards, and whose bid for the free government money consists in large part of investing in politicians:



Sitting on a record cash surplus of $6.4 billion, Citizens is hoping to sign a special deal today with Heritage Property and Casualty Insurance Co., a St. Petersburg firm that opened nine months ago and has made significant political contributions. Heritage has donated more than $140,000 to Scott and the Republican Party of Florida in recent months, and spent tens of thousands more lobbying the Legislature.

A nine-month-old company that's donated $140,000 to Rick Scott and the Republican Party, and which is now suddenly in line for $52 million in government money? Wow. That's not at all crooked-sounding. Note, especially, that Heritage donated its first $30,000 to the Florida GOP only two months after the company was founded—and the other $110,000 to Rick Scott just two months ago, while Heritage was in the midst of lobbying Scott and state legislators for the contract.

This isn't even a one-time thing:



It's the second time this year Citizens is looking to subsidize an upstart private insurer using its massive surplus, which has been built up over seven years as the state has dodged hurricanes. In February, Citizens' board approved a deal with Weston Insurance, agreeing to pay the young company $63 million to take out 30,000 policies. Weston has spent more than $250,000 on lobbying this year, and two of Citizens' seven board members abstained from voting because of conflicts of interest.

There's even more sketchiness to all this, including an apparent government-to-private-sector revolving door racket by one of the participants. If nobody ends up in jail because of this then it's Florida's own fault. You elect crooks to write your laws, they're going to write crooked laws."

— Reversed a $2.2 billion deficit and brought it into balance without raising taxes, largely by reduced spending and eliminating wasteful and unaffordable programs, allowing for a projected fiscal 2014 budget surplus of $300 million.

— Bipartisan pension and benefits reforms, saving the state $120 billion over 30 years.

— Streamlining government by eliminating 5,200 government jobs.

— Vetoing tax increase bills three times while cutting taxes for job creators.

More On This...

— Reforming the nation’s oldest teacher tenure law by making it conditional on teacher performance in the classroom.

— Reduced property tax increases to a 21-year low and capped them at a maximum 2 percent.

There’s more, but shouldn’t conservative Republicans be ecstatic by this record compiled by New Jersey Republican Governor Chris Christie?

[pullquote]

Not the folks at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), which decided not to invite one of the party’s superstars to its annual gathering in Washington. Apparently, the reason had to do with Christie upsetting conservative orthodoxy by saying something nice about President Obama for approving emergency aid to distressed New Jerseyans affected by Super Storm Sandy.

I’m all for orthodoxy, which some call principle. I am orthodox in many things, but in politics, compromise in the pursuit of ultimate goals does not necessarily make one a compromiser.

Gov. Chris Christie is no liberal. He is proving his ideas work, which is why, according to a recent Quinnipiac University poll, he has a 74 percent approval rating in one of the bluest states in the country.

Most politicians would, as they say, “kill” for a number like that, but instead CPAC organizers “killed” Christie from their list of speakers.

Conservative Republicans have a unique opportunity to present a positive, forward-looking and reform-minded agenda at a time when most voters’ approval of government is scraping rock bottom. Americans are aware of the current dysfunction in Washington and may be ready for a creative message if Republicans could show them how a 21st-century model would mutually benefit themselves and the nation.

Former George W. Bush aide Peter Wehner offers some suggestions in a Time magazine essay:

“First, Republicans should make front-and-center their plans to reform public institutions that were designed for the needs of the mid-20th century. Our health-care and entitlement system, tax code, schools, immigration policies and regulatory regime are outdated, breaking down, and creating substantial wreckage. If I had to boil it down to a single sentence, I’d urge the GOP to develop its reputation as the party of reform and modernization. Second, Republican leaders at every level need to conduct themselves in a manner that not just reassures voters but appeals to them. As former Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels has put it, ‘as we ask Americans to join us on such a boldly different course, it would help if they liked us, just a bit.’ … Third, Republicans must resist the temptation of defeatism, enervation, and turning against the country. It is entirely within the power of the GOP to both remain principled and appeal to a majority of Americans. An intellectually self-confident party would, in fact, be energized by a challenge of this scale.”

Read this line again: “It is entirely within the power of the GOP to both remain principled and appeal to a majority of Americans.”

A bold agenda that does these things reflects Gov. Christie’s record in New Jersey. By not inviting him to speak, CPAC invites comparison with a pessimistic and hypercritical political environment of the past. If the Republican “tent” isn’t large enough for Chris Christie, then it will resemble a pup tent for some time to come.

Republicans should be focused on deconstructing failed liberalism and styling their alternative in positive terms, not rejecting one of their own. Hating President Obama is not a policy. Intellectually defeating his policies is."

Yelton said Voter ID law would hurt Democrats%2C referenced %22lazy blacks%22

Local%2C state GOP representatives denounced Don Yelton%27s comments

Yelton said he would not change anything%2C and he refused to apologize

After bragging in a TV interview that the state's Voter ID regulations would ""kick the Democrats in the butt,"" and after making reference to ""lazy blacks that want the government to give them everything,"" a North Carolina conservative activist has stepped down from his Republican Party post.

Don Yelton made the decision to leave after the Buncome County GOP asked him to resign his position as a precinct chairman, according to the Asheville Citizen-Times. Yelton made the comments on Wednesday's edition of Jon Stewart's The Daily Show on television, setting off a firestorm of reaction in social media land.

Yelton told the Citizen-Times that in spite of the circumstances, he would not change anything, and he refused to apologize.

""There's nothing I said that I would take back – so be it,"" Yelton told the news organization.

Voter ID laws, which require would-be voters to present identification when registering to vote and/or when voting, have been criticized as damaging to Democratic voters who are more likely not to have identification.

""The law is going to kick the Democrats in the butt,"" Yelton told Daily Show correspondent Aasif Mandvi. ""If it hurts a bunch of college kids too lazy to get up off their bohonkas and go get a photo ID, so be it. If it hurts a bunch of whites, so be it.""

Yelton also said, ""If it hurts a bunch of lazy blacks that want the government to give them everything, so be it.""

The Buncombe County GOP released a statement via Facebook denouncing Yelton's comments, calling them ""outrageous and intolerant"" and indicating North Carolina Republican Party Chairman Claude Pope was calling for Yelton's resignation.

""The North Carolina Republican Party finds the comments made by Mr. Yelton to be completely inappropriate and highly offensive,"" the statement read. ""I would like to make it very clear that Mr. Yelton does not speak for either the Buncombe County Republcan Party or the North Carolina Republican Party.""

Buncombe County GOP chairman Henry Mitchell echoed those comments, according to Politico.

""Let me make it very clear, Mr. Yelton's comments do not reflect the belief or feelings of Buncombe Republcians, nor do they mirror any core principle that our party is founded upon,"" Mitchell said in a statement. ""this mentality will not be supported or propagated within our party."""

Paul Ryan (R-WI): don’t commit political suicide by becoming the House’s version of Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL).

“We are still astonished and disappointed in how Florida Senator Marco Rubio squandered his conservative and Tea Party movement base by becoming the face of S. 744 – [the Senate’s bill],” the outlet wrote on Thursday.

Rubio’s support among conservatives and Republicans has plummeted since he championed the Senate’s bill, and he has not mentioned the bill since it passed the Senate more than three weeks ago.

Conservative HQ does not want to see Ryan meet the same fate. The site’s staff members write that “it looks like another promising Republican,” Ryan, “is about to follow Rubio down the plank and over the side into the shark-infested waters of granting amnesty to illegal immigrants.” Ryan, they argue, “should be smarter than to get sucked-into supporting anything remotely resembling the corrupt pork and special interest favor bloated Senate bill.”

Ryan recently told the Associated Press that he is keeping in touch with the House’s “Gang of Seven,” a group of bipartisan lawmakers focusing on immigration law. The “Gang” includes Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-IL), who said Ryan is his “guiding light. I know I get him in trouble every time I say it.” Ryan has also clashed with conservative talk radio hosts Laura Ingraham and Mark Levin about the immigration bill’s impact on working-class Americans.

Senior White House aides reportedly “often mention” Ryan “as crucial to the prospects for legislation this year” and hope that Ryan could “sway recalcitrant House members.” In addition, Ryan is associated with business and Catholic groups who are “backing an overhaul of immigration laws.” The Associated Press states Ryan urged House Republicans in a closed-door meeting last week to seize the moment to pass sweeping immigration reform.

Conservative HQ claims that Ryan has a “penchant for granting the kind of deference to the interests of the establishment Republican Party’s corporate paymasters,” which include the “shills for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the cheap labor opportunists and the inside-the-Beltway party hacks of the ‘buy the Hispanic vote’ wing of the Republican Party.”

According to Conservative HQ, while Tea Partiers and conservatives want to have honest discussions about how to solve the country’s immigration problem but are wary of harmful side effects which could result from the current legislative push:

What they are not prepared to do is dole out millions of dollars in slush funds to radical Hispanic political organizations like La Raza, grant vast new powers to the federal executive branch, insulate it from Congressional direction and oversight, bring millions of new clients for the welfare state from illegal and ineligible for benefits status to legal and eligible for benefits status and grant blanket amnesty to illegal immigrants who are in jail.

The authors urge Ryan to preserve his political capital and reject attempts to pass comprehensive immigration reform legislation akin to the Senate bill.

“We welcome Paul Ryan to the debate on how best to apply conservative principles to immigration reform – something that eluded Senator Rubio,” Conservative HQ writes. “However, if Paul Ryan wants to avoid Marco Rubio’s fate he must begin by publicly and forcefully rejecting the corruption, pork and special interest favors of Rubio’s Gang of Eight bill.”"

In the early minutes of a marathon meeting of House Republicans on Tuesday morning, Rep. Steve Southerland, a funeral director from Florida, rose to suggest the lawmakers sing “Amazing Grace” — and his colleagues joined him in a rendition of the burial hymn.

Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail,

A life of joy and peace.

It was an appropriate choice, for the House GOP is practicing its own form of mortuary science: It is burying both the Republican brand and America’s standing in the world.

On Monday night, Washington was finally moving toward an agreement — albeit a temporary solution — to end the government shutdown and avoid a default on the national debt. The agreement in principle, negotiated by Senate Democratic and Republican leaders, probably would have sailed through the House. But then House Speaker John Boehner preempted the bipartisan agreement with a new plan of his own that had no Democratic support. It was difficult to see any reason for the proposal other than blocking progress on an agreement — and it succeeded at that. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell called off a meeting in which he was to have unveiled the agreement, and Democrats lined up to denounce the new tactic, which emerged just two days before the Treasury runs out of room to maneuver on the nation’s bills.

Yet even that nasty piece of work didn’t have enough support from Boehner’s GOP caucus, because tea party Republicans were still holding out for an assault on Obama­care. After a two-hour caucus meeting — twice the usual length — Boehner emerged admitting there were “a lot of opinions” but “no decisions.”

Surely, he can’t be surprised. If a sizable minority within his caucus is here in Washington with the main purpose of disabling federal power, why would this faction be eager to end a government shutdown or avoid a default? Some of them are “default deniers” who think the whole threat to the full faith and credit of the United States is a hoax. Perhaps some others are of the mind that if they shock the economy back into recession, President Obama’s party will be blamed in next year’s elections for high unemployment.

Whatever their reasons, lawmakers took turns at the open microphones for two hours in the closed-door session — and they weren’t singing karaoke for Boehner. When they emerged to find 150 reporters lining the hallways of the Capitol basement, they clearly had no message worth delivering.

Rep. Mo Brooks (Ala.): “I have no comment.”

Rep. Trent Franks (Ariz.): “I never speak of things we talk about in conference. That’s rude.”

One claimed he was going to the men’s room. Others clutched phones to their ears. Rep. Patrick McHenry (N.C.) tried to create a diversion. “Hey, that was Tom Cotton,” he told reporters. “He’s running for Senate. He’s twice my height and three times as good-looking.”

GOP leaders apparently had nothing to say for themselves either, because they settled on a theme of saying their last-minute monkey wrench was meant “to provide fairness to the American people under Obamacare,” as Boehner put it.

“There should be fairness,” Majority Leader Eric Cantor agreed.

“Individuals should be treated fairly,” concurred Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy.

Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (Wash.), the conference chairwoman, contributed her belief in “fairness for all.”

Fair for all? More like a free-for-all.

NBC’s Kelly O’Donnell asked Boehner whether he could guarantee that there would be no default.

“The idea of default is wrong, and we shouldn’t get anywhere close to it,” the speaker replied.

But Boehner had just put the country close to default by preempting the Senate compromise. With the country up against the debt ceiling, he had renewed the fight over Obamacare and inflamed Democrats by proposing to limit a president’s flexibility to avoid defaults in the future. (Boehner later revised the proposal to recruit conservative support, but late in the day that, too, fell apart.)

Twenty minutes after Boehner’s appearance, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid interrupted proceedings on the Senate floor to say that he spoke “for many of us who have been working in good faith when I say that we felt blindsided by the news from the House.” He pronounced himself “very disappointed with John Boehner, who would once again try to preserve his role at the expense of the country.”

Boehner and his colleagues can sing “Amazing Grace” in the Capitol basement, but if they get the blame for a shutdown and a default, the only way they’ll be able to preserve their majority is with embalming fluid.

Mark Sanford won a runoff for U.S. House seat in South Carolina He'll now face Democrat Elizabeth Colbert Busch, sister of ""The Colbert Report"" star National Democrats started attacks against Sanford shortly after Tuesday's win While GOP acknowledges Sanford's liabilities, his district might be more forgiving than others

Watch the Jake Tapper interview with Mark Sanford on “The Lead,” Wednesday at 4 p.m. Eastern on CNN.

(CNN) —

Mark Sanford is another step closer to political redemption, but the real headline out of his Tuesday victory in a Republican primary runoff for his old congressional seat was a rare public appearance by his former mistress – who’s now his fiancée.

And while the former South Carolina governor is considered the favorite in next month’s general election showdown with Democratic nominee Elizabeth Colbert Busch, the sister of satirist and Comedy Central host Stephen Colbert, his past infidelity remains front and center in the race and could continue to hurt him with crucial female voters.

Democrats wasted no time in attacking Sanford over the affair.

“This is the same Mark Sanford who, as governor, disappeared from office and used taxpayer money to visit his mistress. With all the issues we are working on, we do not need him in Congress,” wrote Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York in a fundraising e-mail for Colbert Busch sent in the hours after Sanford’s victory. “Fortunately, there is a strong independent woman running to give us a better alternative named Elizabeth Colbert Busch.”

Sanford addressed his “incredibly long journey” at his victory celebration over former Charleston County Councilman Curtis Bostic. “In that journey, I am humbled.” He added that while God forgives, “sometimes the voters aren’t so forgiving.”

Sanford thanked supporters, family, and his fiancée, Maria Belen Chapur of Argentina. The former governor said Wednesday on CNN’s “The Lead with Jake Tapper” that he was surprised by her appearance at the victory celebration.

“She completely surprised me,” Sanford told CNN Chief Washington Correspondent Jake Tapper. “It was an awfully, awfully nice surprise.”

Sanford wins GOP nomination for House seat

“I didn’t know she was coming, but I’m excited to see her,” he said.

The affair came to light in 2009, after Sanford disappeared from public view for several days and re-emerged, claiming he’d been hiking the Appalachian Trail. He later admitted that he was actually in Argentina, seeing his lover. The episode sank any hopes Sanford had of making a bid for the 2012 GOP presidential nomination. Sanford and then-wife Jenny were divorced in 2010 and he finished his second term as governor in January 2011, exiting to what many thought would be political obscurity.

Sanford is touting his fiscal conservative credentials as he campaigns for Congress, but he’s also asking the public for a second chance, telling CNN that he was seeking “redemption” by running for office again.

He came in first in a 16-candidate primary two weeks ago, but only with 37% of the vote, far short of the 50% needed to avoid a runoff. He topped Bostic in Tuesday’s runoff by a 57%-43% margin.

Bostic appeared to try to make infidelity a key issue in the runoff campaign. “Trust is a crucial issue. In fact, it has become a crucial issue in this race,” the candidate said at a debate with Sanford last week. Bostic added that the former governor was a “compromised candidate” because of the affair.

Now Sanford faces off May 7 with Colbert Busch, an official with Clemson University’s wind turbine drive testing facility. She is expected to have an uphill climb in the general election because the district is heavily Republican. The 1st District has been in GOP hands for more than three decades.

Rep. Tim Scott won re-election to the seat by 27 percentage points in last November’s election. But when Republican U.S. Sen. Jim DeMint stepped down from his seat late last year to take over as the head of the conservative Heritage Foundation, GOP Gov. Nikki Haley named Scott to fill the seat, triggering the special election to fill the seat that Sanford held for three terms before becoming governor.

Mark Sanford: Shamed politician fights for comeback

Colbert Busch’s famous brother has campaigned on his sister’s behalf.

“She’s my sister, and I’m willing to, you know, break the jewel of my own creation to try to do something for her,” Colbert told Jake Tapper, CNN’s chief Washington correspondent and anchor of CNN’s “The Lead.”

Colbert will team up again with his sister for fundraisers later this month in the nation’s capital and in New York.

But Democrats are focusing on Sanford’s affair.

“The families of this district need a representative who they can trust,” Colbert Busch campaign spokesman James Smith said Tuesday night. “Mark Sanford simply has the wrong values for our community.

Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee press secretary Emily Bittner tried to put Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a senior House Republican, on the spot.

“Even Republicans acknowledge that Congressman Sanford’s behavior was a disgrace and that he betrayed the public trust, so will Congresswoman McMorris Rodgers support Mark Sanford in his quest to return to Washington?”

Sanford disagrees, saying his runoff victory shows he doesn’t have a problem with female voters, at least those in his party.

There were a lot of Republican conservative women that voted last night. And what they did was decided to send me in as the Republican standard-bearer in this congressional seat,” Sanford told Tapper.

But some South Carolina Republicans disagree, saying that the female vote could be an issue for Sanford.

“Surveys show Sanford has a problem with women, and some may never forgive him,” said Republican strategist Bruce Haynes, a partner in the consulting firm Purple Strategies. “Acknowledgment of perceptions is the first step in rebuilding any reputation, and his choice to bring his fianceé forward is smart.”

“His past and his present relationship with her is an unavoidable issue in this race. It’s best that he acknowledge it, deal with it on his terms rather than let others define it for him. Otherwise, silence is hiding, and hiding is guilt, and guilt is losing,” added Haynes, who served as chief of staff for former Republican Rep. Bob Inglis of South Carolina, and as a staff member for former GOP Gov. Carroll Campbell.

Haynes thinks Sanford can win a race that focuses on policy, but says a race on personality will be much harder to win.

Republican strategist Hogan Gidley, who served as executive director of the South Carolina Republican Party, agreed.

“It’s going to be virtually impossible for Mark Sanford to attack Colbert Busch,” said Gidley, who worked for Sanford rival state Sen. Larry Grooms in the primary. “It’s extremely tricky political territory for several reasons: One, Sanford can’t effectively execute an apology tour and consistently be on the attack; two, any political attack on Colbert Busch would be used against Sanford and the party as proof of a perceived ‘war on women;’ three, we have a huge problem right now with the women vote – so any candidate perceived to be one who disregards women – is going to face issues getting votes.”

But the geography of the district may be in Sanford’s favor.

“The new 1st District is a coastal area, so it’s generally the most socially liberal of South Carolina’s GOP-held districts,” Haynes said. “This is because coastal communities are historically more diverse and concerned about issues like the environment that carry less importance inland.”"

(Republican attempts to lure black voters),"My latest loud guffaw came while reading ""Conservatives Try to Rewrite Civil Rights History (Again)"" which opened with:



Rand Paul’s unsuccessful speech at Howard University—where he tried, and failed, to paint the Republican Party as the true home for African American voters—didn’t happen in a vacuum. It drew from a heavily revisionist history of American politics, in which the GOP never wavered in its commitment to black rights, and the Democratic Party embraced its role as a haven for segregationists. In this telling of history, black support for Democrats is a function of liberal demagoguery and crude identity politics. If African Americans truly understood their interests, the argument goes, they’d have never left the Republican Party.

The piece went on to explore recent attempts at re-writing racist southern-strategy architect Barry Goldwater's contributions to black folks.

Write-on R's. You will write in vain.

We don't need degrees in political science, or to read right-wing bloggers to know our history. Many of us had Republican grandparents. I know I did, and wrote about it. Black folks talk about politics in barber shops, beauty parlors, sittin' on bar stools, on the bus on the way to work and around the dinner table. We don't form our opinions based on punditry. We deal with the daily reality of walking, eating, sleeping, working, driving, shopping and breathing while black.

Black people are not stupid.

The R's have convinced themselves that the last two national election cycles are some sort of aberration, that just because Democrats had some black guy at the top of the ticket black folks blissed out and will come to our senses once he is no longer the Democrats' standard bearer. They are completely ignoring the fact that black folks have been voting for white Democrats since FDR started luring us away from the R party of old a long time ago.

Sure, they can buy off a few dusky faces to spout their rhetoric. Just see how well choosing Michael Steele worked out for ya. Opportunists come in all colors. Pasting a dark visage on tainted ideology does nothing to mask the stench of rotting food for thought.

Black people are not stupid.

Nor have we been struck blind, deaf and senseless. We hear dog whistling and the dulcet tones of patronizing put-downs quite well, thank you.

We may not all be PhDs, but a degree from the university of the streets serves us well—we have learned the hard way how to survive in a hostile America. We begin learning the day we are born, drink it in with our mother's milk or formula and before we are in the second or third grade we learn daily lessons in blackness.

You have Bell-Curve'd us, and Willie Horton'ed us, and Welfare Queen'ed us, as you stand-your-ground and stop-and-frisk us.

The latest cause for R hand-wringing and lamentation and attempts at re-invention is the much touted poll on black voter turnout, surpassing whites.

Even news stories questioning the data results conclude:

Data-parsing aside, what’s clear is that in the last two presidential elections, blacks and whites turned out at roughly the same rate. Coming less than 50 years after systematic efforts to prevent blacks from voting were banned by the Voting Rights Act, that’s a historic milestone. The Supreme Court is set to rule in June on whether to strike down a key provision of the 1965 law. The news also bolsters the case that the Republican effort to make voting harder for racial minorities—including strict photo ID laws, cutbacks to early voting, and purges of voting rolls—may have backfired, by stoking outrage in the African-American community in particular. “It made the case very clear-cut to people about what was happening,” Marvin Randolph, the NAACP’s vice president for campaigns, told MSNBC.com. “We could say to people: This is a poll tax.” “Politics is a lot like physics,” Randolph added. ”Every action has an equal and opposite reaction.”



Yeah. 'Cause we are not stupid we have a re-action. We've been reacting for many years. From slave rebellions, resistance and revolts, through the tough years of reconstruction into the anti-lynching organizing and civil rights movement, we've fought, pushed-back and died. We are not stupid. Republicans aren't the ""party of Lincoln."" We know where the Dixiecrats fled to. We've watched you eat your own and cast them out when they even approach something resembling reason.

Republican attempts to limit our hard won right to vote just adds fuel to the fire. And they ain't stopping.

Ari Berman in The Nation last week reported on new voter repression legislation proposed and introduced for 2013 :



• Mandating a government-issued photo ID to cast a ballot: Arkansas, Connecticut, Iowa, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Washington, Wyoming • Restricting voter registration drives: Illinois, Indiana, Montana, New Mexico, Virginia • Banning election-day voter registration: California, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska • Requiring proof of citizenship to register to vote: Massachusetts, Missouri, Nevada, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia • Purging the voter rolls: Colorado, Indiana, New Mexico, Texas, Virginia • Reducing early voting: Arizona, Indiana, South Carolina, Texas, Wisconsin • Disenfranchising ex-felons: Virginia.



Oh, and by the way: Latinos and Native Americans don't cotton to the nickname Tonto. That may have worked well for the Lone Ranger and his ""sidekick"" Indian buddy who was named ""stupid"" on tee-vee in the 50's, but promoting Marco Rubio as a patently obvious ploy to get a flood of browns to swamp the voting booths for you ain't gonna happen.

As my Puerto Rican husband said yesterday, ""Nosotros no somos estúpidos.""

So we'll be gathered together under the Democratic party big tent, seeking shelter from the acidic rain of the Republican hate-fest for the forseeable future.

Guess who is stupid?"

(CNN) - As Ted Cruz's profile has skyrocketed in the last year–thanks to his election to the U.S. Senate and an attention-grabbing itinerary to early presidential voting states–the Texas Republican's eligibility for president has come under question.

Born in Canada to a U.S. mother and a Cuban father, most legal experts have said Cruz qualifies as a ""natural-born citizen,"" a requirement for the White House job, as stated in the Constitution.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker'] [twitter-follow screen_name='KilloughCNN']

And Cruz seems to agree. He told ABC News in July that he's not ""going to engage in a legal debate.""

""The facts are clear,"" he continued. ""I can tell you where I was born and who my parents were. And then as a legal matter, others can worry about that. I'm not going to engage.""

But he will release his birth certificate. In fact, he already has.

The Dallas Morning News ran a story late Sunday analyzing Cruz's documents, which he released to the newspaper on Friday.

Legal experts told the paper that Cruz is not only eligible for president in the United States, he's also technically a Canadian citizen and can even run for Parliament. Unless he renounces his citizenship there, he could also obtain a Canadian passport, according to the Dallas Morning News.

The senator's office, however, said Cruz has never embraced his legal rights in Canada, a country that he left when he was four.

""Senator Cruz became a U.S. citizen at birth, and he never had to go through a naturalization process after birth to become a U.S. citizen,"" spokeswoman Catherine Frazier told the newspaper. ""To our knowledge, he never had Canadian citizenship, so there is nothing to renounce.""

The recent debate has invoked the controversial ""birther"" movement that questioned President Barack Obama's eligibility for president. He put the issue to rest in 2011 when he released his long-form birth certificate proving he was born in Hawaii–though a small amount of conspiracists still maintain doubt about the president's place of birth.

Cruz will attend a GOP fundraiser in New Hampshire on Friday. Earlier this summer, he traveled to Iowa twice and stopped in South Carolina in May. All three states typically hold the first three contests in the presidential primary process.

Pssst. Michele. You might want to pay your staff before they spill even more of your dirty little secrets.

Michelle [sic] Bachmann's high-profile debate coach, Brett O'Donnell, developed an ""unnatural"" and ""Rasputin-like"" relationship with his candidate during her failed 2012 presidential campaign, another former aide told BuzzFeed, a charge O'Donnell denies.

Peter Waldron, her controversial former national field coordinator, told Salon the dispute started when former Iowa straw poll staffers refused to sign a nondisclosure agreement that would bar them from discussing any “unethical, immoral, or criminal activity” they witnessed on the campaign with police or reporters. [...] Waldron said the staffers are owed a mere $5,000, and that Bachmann has more than $2 million in her campaign account, but has refused to pay unless the staffers sign the agreement.

""He prohibited her husband, Dr. Marcus Bachmann, from sleeping in the same room with wife while on the campaign trail,"" Waldron said in an email to BuzzFeed.

Today in why you shouldn't treat your staff badly, then refuse to pay them when they refuse to retroactively agree to aid and abet your potentially criminal activities , we have this juicy little nugget from Andrew Kaczynski at Buzzfeed:The former aide who's keeping us entertained with the trash-talking is Peter Waldron—the same Peter Waldron who's had an awful lot to say lately about his former employer:Of course, that whole refusing-to-pay-staff thing was last week's news. This week, Waldron is regaling us with tales of how easily Bachmann was apparently brainwashed by her debate coach who, Waldron says, had an ""unusual power over Mrs. Bachmann."" How powerful was he? This powerful:Marcus was no doubt heartbroken about that.

Too bad Michele Bachmann is so busy still trying to repeal Obamacare instead of keeping her former campaign staffers happy. Probably a bad idea to screw them over when they're obviously sitting on a goldmine of gossip—and potentially criminal activities—about the queen of batshit crazy.

Tell the FEC to investigate the alleged crimes of Michele Bachmann's presidential campaign."

The scheme involves six states, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida, all of which voted for President Obama in 2012 but have Republican-controlled state legislatures and governorships, proposing and enacting state laws changing the way it allocates its electoral votes from the ""winner-take-all"" system, in which the Presidential ticket that receives the most number of votes in any state that allocates its electoral votes that way win's all of that state's electoral votes, to a ""closed party list"" system, in which electoral votes are allocated roughly in proportion to the percentage of the vote that each presidential ticket receives in any state that implements such a scheme.

Here's how Nichols described this latest GOP-backed scheme:



Priebus initially talked up the idea of to having Virginia, Florida, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania abandon the current model of assigning electoral votes to the winner of the state and instead implement a model where the allotment would be based on the winners of congressional districts. That plan, which would have allowed the loser of the popular vote in many states to ""win"" most of the electoral votes, was such a blatant rip-off that shamed Republicans in Virginia, Florida, Wisconsin and other states abandoned it. But they did not abandon the basic premise laid out by Priebus -- that states that are ""controlled red"" by the Republicans should game the rules so that they are less ""consistently blue"" in presidential politics. They've just shifted strategy. Under the plan now being entertained by Pennsylvania Republicans, electoral votes would be distributed based on the percentage of the vote received by the contenders. Had the plan been in place in 2012, President Obama, who won 52 percent of the Pennsylvania popular vote, would have gotten 11 or 12 electoral votes, while Republican Mitt Romney would have gotten 8 or 9. That looks like a more reasonable result than under the plan for allocating by congressional district results, which would have given Romney most of Pennsylvania's electoral votes despite Obama's popular vote win. But here's where things get tricky. If Pennsylvania and other swing states that tend to back Democrats move to the proportional model, while big states such as Texas and Georgia that have been voting Republican stick with a winner-take-all plan, they will lock in a national advantage for the Republicans. The Pennsylvania initiative may not be quite as ""sweet"" for Republicans as the initial Priebus plan. But if states that vote Democratic assign substantial numbers of their electoral votes to the Republican loser, while states that vote Republican make no such concession, it will be a lot easier to chart a course where a Republican nominee who is trounced in the national popular vote might still ""win"" the electoral vote and the presidency.

Republican Pennsylvania State Senate Majority Leader Dominic Pileggi says that he will introduce legislation that would change the way Pennsylvania's electoral votes are allocated from the winner-take-all system to the proportional system.

Once again, Republicans are plotting to steal the 2016 presidential election. Let's hold them accountable another time!"

In 2011, Mr. Christie held a news conference where he accused State Senator Richard J. Codey of being “combative and difficult” in blocking two nominees. Mr. Codey, a Democrat who had served as governor following the resignation of James E. McGreevey, responded that he had not only signed off on the nominations, but had held a meeting to try to hurry them along.

Three days later, Mr. Codey was walking out of an event in Newark when he got a call from the state police superintendent informing him that he would no longer be afforded the trooper who accompanied him to occasional public events — a courtesy granted all former governors. That same day, his cousin, who had been appointed by Mr. McGreevey to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, was fired, as was a close friend and former deputy chief of staff who was then working in the state Office of Consumer Affairs.

“I understand politics, that a new administration comes in,” Mr. Codey said, but he believed this was not about Mr. Christie bringing in his own people. “This was all about sending a message.”

The governor laughed at the allegation of retribution, and his spokesman belittled the Democratic Party chairman who complained about it.

Later that year, the governor was pressing hard on Alan Rosenthal, the Rutgers political scientist whom Republicans and Democrats had chosen as the tiebreaking member of the commission that was redistricting the state’s legislative districts. Mr. Christie wanted Mr. Rosenthal to vote for the map put forward by the Republicans on the commission, but instead he chose the Democrats’ plan, saying it offered more stability.

Soon after, Mr. Christie used his line-item veto to cut $169,000 for two programs at Mr. Rosenthal’s institute at Rutgers.

The apparent payback is not always directed at Democrats — Mr. Christie can be just as hard on Republicans in an attempt to enforce party discipline."

Gov. Candidate Admits He Funded Mysterious Group Behind Mailers,"On Friday night Corey Stewart, one of seven candidates seeking the Republican nomination for Lieutenant Governor in Virginia, admitted to a crowd of 50 Tea Party activists that he was not only “connected to” the mysterious Virginians for Limited Government (VLG) group that has paid for attack mailers on five of his opponents; he’s also provided funding for the group.

Larry Nordvig, the Executive Director of the Richmond Virginia Tea Party who attended the Friday meeting, told Breitbart News on Monday that Stewart admitted his connection to VLG during a public question and answer period. Holding two of the VLG funded attack mailers in his hand, Nordvig described this back and forth he had with Stewart:

Nordvig Question: “Do you agree with these ads and did you have any connection to them whatsoever for the record?”

Corey Stewart Answer: “Am I connected? Yes. I have donated money to that organization.”

Nordvig Question. “At least a couple of these candidates fought against these budget increases, specifically Steve Martin…The information on the flyer is not correct so this information is misleading. Will you do the right thing and publicly condemn these ads as false?”

Corey Stewart Answer: “No, I’m not going to do it. I play hardball. This is politics.”

Sue Sadler, who is with a concerned citizens group in James City County and was present at Friday’s event, told Breitbart News on Monday that “Nordvig’s account is absolutely correct.”

Carolyn Worssam, a member of the Richmond Tea Party, told Breitbart News on Monday “that sure is an accurate description of the conversation between Larry and Corey Stewart.”

A third source, who is one of the 13,000 delegates to the convention that will select the Republican Party’s nominee for Lieutenant Governor in Richmond on Saturday and was present at the Friday event, told Breitbart News on Monday “that’s an accurate and balanced description” of the exchange between Nordvig and Stewart.

A fourth source, who was also at the meeting on Friday, told Breitbart News on Monday “that’s completely accurate.”

The meeting was held at Mimi’s Cafe in Henrico, Virginia, near Richmond, and was moderated by Carol Stopps, a supporter of Mr. Stewart. Ms. Stopps told Breitbart News on Tuesday: “That was an accurate description of the conversation between Larry and Corey. Corey did not deny he knows the organization and contributed to the organization. In my opinion this is typical campaign material and there were no misstatements in the mailers.”

Stewart’s admission could be a violation of Virginia election law, which requires that independent expenditure political action committees not coordinate their activities with the campaigns of any candidates. It is unclear how much Stewart has contributed to VLG, since it has failed to file its Statement of Organization with the Virginia State Board of Elections.

The exact organizational structure of VLG remains unclear. On Monday the group changed its “about us” description on its website to say that it is a 501(c)4 tax exempt non profit corporation.

A search of Guidestar, the online source that provides information about non profit corporations that have received 501(c)3 and 501(c)4 tax-exempt status from the IRS shows no entry for “Virginians for Limited Government.” By law, 501(c)4 organizations are prohibited from “primarily” engaging in political communications.

On Tuesday, Corey Stewart emailed this statement to Breitbart News: “Over the course of my life, I have supported and recommended several conservative organizations including the Family Foundation, Gun Owners of America, National Right to Work, Campaign for Liberty and Virginians for Limited Government to various people.”

Stewart emphasized that neither he nor his campaign “had any coordination” with Virginians for Limited Government. “I am proud to support these like-minded organizations over the course of my political career,” his email statement continued. “What these groups do, I have no control over. Neither myself or my campaign have had any coordination with this group.”

Ted Stevens, convicted of corruption charges, said Monday he will fight the verdict ""with every ounce of energy I have."" He added he will not give up his bid for re-election.

""I am innocent,"" the Alaska Republican said in a statement that indicated he will appeal. ""This verdict is the result of the unconscionable manner in which the Justice Department lawyers conducted this trial. I ask that Alaskans and my Senate colleagues stand with me as I pursue my rights. I remain a candidate for the United States Senate.""

A jury on Monday found Stevens guilty of seven corruption charges, throwing into limbo the 40-year career of Alaska's political patriarch.

There is no automatic Senate punishment for Stevens. The most severe potential consequence in Congress is expulsion by a two-thirds majority of the Senate. That normally would follow an investigation by the Senate ethics committee.

""I am obviously disappointed in the verdict but not surprised given the repeated instances of prosecutorial misconduct in this case. The prosecutors had to report themselves to the Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility during the trial for ethical violations,"" Stevens' statement said.

""Exculpatory evidence was hidden from my lawyers. A witness was kept from us and then sent back to Alaska. The government lawyers allowed evidence to be introduced that they knew was false. I will fight this unjust verdict with every ounce of energy I have.""

Prison time?

Stevens, 84, was found guilty of lying about free home renovations and other gifts he received from a wealthy oil contractor. Jurors began deliberating last week.

Visibly shaken after the verdicts were read, Stevens tried to intertwine his fingers but quickly put his hands down to his side after noticing they were trembling. As he left the courtroom, Stevens got a quick kiss on the cheek from his wife, Catherine, who testified on his behalf during the trial. He declined to talk to reporters waiting outside.

Stevens faces up to five years in prison on each count when he is sentenced, but under federal guidelines he is likely to receive much less prison time, if any. The judge originally scheduled sentencing for Jan. 26 but then changed his mind and did not immediately set a date.

The jurors left the court without comment.

Said U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan: ""The jurors have unanimously told me that no one has any desire to speak to any member of the media.""

The verdict, coming barely a week before Election Day, increased Stevens' difficulty in winning what already was a difficult race against Democratic challenger Mark Begich. Democrats hope to seize the once reliably Republican seat as part of their bid for a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate.

""It's a sad day for Alaska, and a sad day for Senator Stevens and his family,"" Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, the Republican vice presidential candidate, said in Richmond, Va., where she was campaigning.

""The verdict shines a light though on the corrupting influence of the big oil service company up there in Alaska that was allowed to control too much of our state. And that control was part of the culture of corruption that I was elected to fight.""

She added: ""As governor of the state of Alaska, I'll carefully monitor now the situation and I'll take any appropriate action as needed. In the meantime I do ask that the people of Alaska join me in respecting the workings of our judicial system, and I'm confident that Senator Stevens, from this point on, will do the right thing for the state of Alaska.""

She ignored a question on whether she would vote for Stevens next week as she climbed the stairs to catch a plane to Roanoke.

Career in jeopardy

The monthlong trial revealed that employees for oil services company VECO Corp. transformed the senator's modest mountain cabin into a modern, two-story home with wraparound porches, a sauna and a wine cellar.

The Senate's longest-serving Republican, Stevens said he had no idea he was getting freebies. He said he paid $160,000 for the project and believed that covered everything.

Stevens had asked for an unusually speedy trial, hoping he'd be exonerated in time to return to Alaska and win re-election. He kept his campaign going and gave no indication that he had a contingency plan in case of conviction.

Despite being a convicted felon, he is not required to drop out of the race or resign from the Senate. If he wins re-election, he can continue to hold his seat because there is no rule barring felons from serving in Congress. The Senate could vote to expel Stevens on a two-thirds vote.

In the event Stevens resigns, Alaska's governor cannot appoint a successor and a special election would be held between 60 and 90 days of his vacating his Senate seat, according to Alaska state rules.

""Put this down: That will never happen — ever, OK?"" Stevens said in the weeks leading up to his trial. ""I am not stepping down. I'm going to run through and I'm going to win this election.

Democrats have invested heavily in the race, running television advertisements starring fictional FBI agents and featuring excerpts from wiretaps.

Old friend's testimony crucial

Stevens' conviction hinged on the testimony of Bill Allen, the senator's longtime drinking and fishing buddy. Allen, the founder of VECO, testified that he never billed his friend for the work on the house and that Stevens knew he was getting a special deal.

Stevens spent three days on the witness stand, vehemently denying that allegation. He said his wife, Catherine, paid every bill they received.

Living in Washington, thousands of miles away, made it impossible to monitor the project every day. Stevens relied on Allen to oversee the renovations, he said, and his friend deceived him by not forwarding all the bills.

Prosecutors used a barrage of witnesses to question how Stevens could have been in the dark about VECO's work on the project. VECO employees testified to seeing Stevens at the house. One left him a company business card. Stevens sent thank you notes to others.

Stevens' conviction is the highlight of a lengthy FBI investigation into Alaska corruption, but prosecutors noted that it is not the end. Stevens' longtime Republican colleague, Rep. Don Young, remains under investigation for his ties to VECO. Stevens' son, Ben, a former Alaska lawmaker, is also under investigation.

Stevens is a legendary figure in Alaska, where he has wielded political influence since before statehood. His knack for steering billions of dollars in federal money to his home state has drawn praise from his constituents and consternation from budget hawks.

Call for resignation

There was no immediate word on Stevens' campaign plans. His spokesman, Aaron Saunders, did not immediately return a message seeking comment on whether Stevens would stay in the race.

In Alaska, the Democratic Party issued a statement calling for Stevens to resign immediately. ""He knew what he was doing was wrong,"" the party said. ""But he did it anyway and lied to Alaskans about it.""

Stevens is the sixth senator convicted of criminal charges. The last previous one was Republican David Durenberger of Minnesota, who was indicted in 1993 on charges of conspiring to make fraudulent claims for Senate reimbursement of $3,825 in lodging expenses. He later pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges and was sentenced to one year of probation and a $1,000 fine."

What a raging jagoff! So I'm sure you recall that the other day, Mark Sanford had the brilliant idea to run a full-page newspaper ad filled with an incredibly lengthy and self-serving series of b.s. explanations for why he trespassed at his ex-wife's home, followed by a whole lot of moaning about negative ads being run by Democrats, and capped off with a comparison of his situation to that of the men who defended the Alamo (who, of course, almost all died). In the middle, though, Sanford made this bizarre offer:



The Democrats' ads will tell you none of this, so if you have further questions, go to www.marksanford.com , call me at the campaign office at 843-764-9188, or even on my cell at 843-367-1010.

""Desperate"" and ""weird"" hardly begin to describe it, but one of the groups whose ads Sanford complained about, the House Majority PAC, decided to take him up on it. In a post-script to a fundraising email, they reprinted Sanford's cell phone number and suggested that their supporters ""[g]ive him a call and ask why he spent hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars on luxury travel."" A number of them did just that, so guess what Sanford did in response?

He published the phone numbers of the people who called him. These are ordinary citizens—perhaps a little brasher than average—but I'm sure they had no expectation that their numbers would get printed on Mark Sanford's campaign website. I don't want to even link to the document Sanford originally posted, but here's a redacted version, and to be clear, every black box you see obscures a number that Sanford had no problem reproducing in full:



You'll notice that all the numbers are from out-of-state, so I'm guessing Sanford wanted to make some kind of point that no one from South Carolina cared to ring him up—though iPhone users can prune their call logs, so Sanford may have erased any Palmetto State callers. Of course, the more important point is that Mark Sanford is an absolute schmuckface for publicizing the personal information of average Americans who had the temerity to take him up on his offer to talk to him. Sadly, though, that's hardly a surprise. I guess the only real question is, did he ever even answer the phone?"

USA TODAY

Tea Party-groups requesting tax exempt status were filtered out for additional scrutiny

A Cincinnati-based IRS office is responsible for such applications nationwide

The IRS says applications were delayed%2C but none was denied

WASHINGTON — Washington's latest political scandal involves a little-known unit of the Internal Revenue Service that determines which groups don't have to pay taxes. Staff in that unit had singled out conservative political groups for greater scrutiny of their applications for tax-exempt status, an IRS official said last week. President Obama said Monday the IRS must not be ""anything less than neutral in terms of how they operate ... I have no patience for it. I will not tolerate it.""

The IRS inspector general is likely to report this week on what the agency was doing, but here is what we know:

Q: What exactly has the IRS apologized for?

A: The IRS says it subjected Tea Party-affiliated groups to additional scrutiny based solely on the name and stated goals of the organization. Often, those groups were asked invasive questions about their donor lists, affiliations and contacts with the media — questions not routinely asked of other groups.

Q: What prompted this?

A: The number of applications for tax-exempt social welfare organizations doubled from 2010 to 2012, to 3,400 a year. That's largely because of a surge in politically oriented groups before the 2012 presidential election and in the wake of favorable court rulings, the IRS says. In response, an IRS unit in Cincinnati began to sort politically oriented groups into a separate ""bucket"" of applications. IRS Exempt Organizations Director Lois Lerner said this was done for consistency and is not unlike what the IRS has done with special treatment of other groups that raise new tax law issues, such as credit counseling agencies and non-profit news organizations.

Q: What is the normal process for seeking tax-exempt status?

A: The organization files an application and answers a 36-item questionnaire on its structure, purpose and activities. Based on those answers, the IRS may seek additional information. An organization can skip the recognition step and simply file a tax return.

Q: Is this like an audit?

A: No. The Tea Party groups were seeking tax-exempt status even before filing a tax return. Tax-exempt groups accused of violating tax laws by directly engaging in political campaigns can have their status revoked — but that's a separate process conducted by a different IRS unit in Dallas.

Q: How many Tea Party groups were affected?

A: Lerner said about 300 groups went into a ""bucket"" of applications getting more scrutiny. About a quarter of them were groups that had ""Tea Party"" or ""Patriot"" in their names, she said. The others may have drawn scrutiny based on broader criteria that pulled out groups whose issues involved government spending or debt, or whose goals were critical of the government, according to a timeline provided to members of Congress.

Q: This happened at the IRS office in Cincinnati. Were groups in other parts of the country affected?

A: Yes. The Cincinnati office handles the intake of tax-exempt applications for all organizations in the country.

Q: When did the targeting of Tea Party groups begin? When did it end?

A: According to a timeline compiled by independent IRS investigators, the IRS first began searching for Tea Party-related groups in March 2010. The policy underwent several revisions through 2011 and 2012 and now involves only organizations with ""indicators of significant amounts of political campaign intervention.""

Q: How were the Tea Party groups harmed?

A: The additional scrutiny held up tax-exempt applications for months, although the IRS says no applications have been denied. Groups caught in this process did not receive IRS documentation, which can provide legitimacy and assist with fundraising. Some conservative groups say their rights to freedom of association were violated through invasive questioning.

Q: How has the IRS attempted to fix the problem?

A: The IRS says it has destroyed any donor lists that were improperly obtained. It says it has begun to clear out the backlog of tax-exempt applications, approving about 130 of the initial 300. About 25 groups have withdrawn their applications.

Q: Who at the IRS was involved?

A: Lerner said Friday it was ""low-level"" and ""front-line"" employees who made the initial determination. The timeline shows that Lerner herself was briefed in 2011 and that lawyers and managers from several units were involved. It's unclear when IRS Commissioner Douglas Shulman — appointed by President George W. Bush to a five-year term in 2008 — first learned of the practice. Shulman stepped down in November. The acting commissioner is Steven Miller. Lerner said she never discussed the issue with the Department of the Treasury or the White House. White House spokesman Jay Carney said the White House counsel first learned of the investigation last month, and the president learned Friday.

Q: What happens next?

A: The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration says it will release its report on the matter this week. The chairmen of the tax-writing committees in the House and Senate have promised hearings, the first of which will be before the House Ways and Means Committee on Friday.

Gary Bauer, while running for president in 2000.

A few weeks ago I put together this handy chart of the various components of the GOP coalition. While we already know that the various factions have their own pet issues and causes, the current GOP civil war is exposing the actual distaste the various groups have for each other.

Jed already hit the Christian Right's whining of Republicans abandoning them on marriage equality. But I want to refocus on Gary Bauer's comments, because they go beyond simple grousing over a wayward coalition partner:



""If we gave our voters an accurate portrayal of our ideas, that we want to cut the rate of growth on Social Security, give tax cuts to billionaires and then the values issues, the values issues would be more popular than the economic agenda of the current Republican Party,” said [social conservative leader Gary] Bauer...

give tax cuts to billionaires

Ignore the fact that there's nothing popular about the GOP's ""values."" Just note how he portrays his party's economic agenda:That's how we liberals frame the Mitt Romney wing of the GOP. Economic conservatives might pretend that there's more to them than tax cuts for billionaires, but even their own partners disagree. And Bauer can't even be bothered to pretend otherwise anymore.

That's not a characterization that suggests mutual respect and agreement, but one of barely disguised disgust. Theirs is a marriage of convenience—the Gordon Geckos don't care for the Bible Thumbers, the Bible Thumpers don't care for the Gordon Geckos. And now that their collective suck isn't leading to White House victories, the knives are out.

Funny thing is, both those sides are equally to blame for the GOP's woes. Mitt Romney conservatism (aka ""tax cuts for billionaires"") is as unpopular as Rick Santorum conservatism (aka ""hate the gays""). They need each other to amount to something, but that's no longer a nationally viable party.

http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/31/why-republicans-miss-the-realists/,2013-07-31 00:00:00,['Topics.Nytimes.Com Top Opinion Editorialsandoped Oped Columnists Rossdouthat Index.Html'],Why Republicans Miss The Realists,"Chris Christie’s comments attacking Rand Paul and other right-wing civil libertarians, extracted by my colleague Jonathan Martin in an Aspen forum last week, have generally been interpreted as setting Christie up as a spokesman for Republican hawks in a looming 2016 battle over the party’s direction on foreign policy. On Friday, Politico’s Alexander Burns ran down some polling numbers that help explain why the more hawkish perspective is no longer an obvious political winner, even in a G.O.P. primary:

… there are also more than a few daunting data points for the anti-Paul coalition within the GOP – signs in public opinion research that the country has moved substantially from the Bush-era national security consensus. A Washington Post poll this week showed 67 percent of Americans believe the war in Afghanistan is not worth fighting, including a bare majority of Republicans. An extensive Pew survey published Friday found a mixed public attitude on surveillance: half of Americans said they approve of the government’s information-collecting, but 56 percent said courts weren’t providing adequate oversight and a 47-percent plurality said the government had done too much to limit civil liberties. And public polls consistently show public hesitation about possible U.S. intervention in Syria …

As Matt Yglesias pointed on Twitter, those Pew numbers on civil liberties included a striking turnaround since 2010 (not 2008, as one would expect if it were all just a partisan swing) among Tea Partiers and conservatives, who now tilt more sharply than G.O.P. moderates in favor of the proposition that the government has traded too much liberty for security. So as odd as it is, especially for anyone who experienced the Bush era, to hear a non-interventionist Republican attacking a tough-on-terror Republican for being too “liberal,” given the current shape of Republican opinion Rand Paul’s framing of his debate with Christie is defensible: By invoking 9/11 to defend the N.S.A.’s surveillance programs, the New Jersey governor was arguably attacking Paul from the left.

With the Bush-era categories thus scrambled, it will be extremely interesting to see how this plays out. The good news for Republicans is that the debate itself is a sign of intellectual health: After the foreign policy failures of the Bush era, the party needs a vigorous internal argument about national security — at least if it ever hopes to regain the public’s trust on those issues, instead of just recycling cliches about toughness and resolve a la the Romney campaign. But the bad news is that in the short term, this argument has the potential to open a real cleavage in the right-of-center coalition. I don’t think John McCain would actually endorse Hillary Clinton in 2016 because I don’t think Rand Paul will actually be the G.O.P. nominee, but neither do I think McCain is just making an empty threat in this interview: A G.O.P. primary campaign carried out along the lines of his Senate feud with Paul really would have the potential to fracture the party’s general-election unity.

With that being said, the “hawk vs. libertarian, McCain vs. Paul” binary is also not the only way a savvy Republican politician might approach these debates. For instance, there is no necessary reason why, having taken the pro-N.S.A. position on one front, a figure like Christie would also need to support an American military intervention in Syria or a permanent U.S. presence in Afghanistan. Indeed, from a purely political, poll-reading perspective he would have every reason to cast his domestic tough guy routine as an alternative to foreign warmaking: Both the country and his party may be divided on civil liberties, but there’s a clear American and Republican consensus against, say, adding Syria to the list of American kinetic military actions. Whatever you think of the position that George W. Bush was right about the war on terror but wrong about regime change, it’s a potential sweet spot for a conservative politician trying to appeal to a war-weary party and country both.

However, I’m doubtful that Christie will ultimately take this kind of split-the-difference tack, because with the eclipse of foreign-policy realism within the G.O.P. there’s a shortage of potential advisers and influencers who represent any kind of middle way between crusading interventionism and Paul-style libertarianism. And if that debate does end up splitting the party in 2016, it could be a case study in why the Eisenhower/Nixon/H.W. Bush realists were so useful to the Cold War-era G.O.P., and why the party misses them today.

The realists weren’t particularly liked by anyone else within the conservative tent: They were too squishy for the Birchers and later too cautious for the neocons, too internationalist for the party’s Jacksonian base, too pro-defense spending for the libertarians, too Arabist for pro-Israel Republicans, too willing to use force for the paleocons and Buchananites. (This is part of why Eisenhower’s presidency is criminally underrated within his own party.) And there were many non-foreign policy reasons why their influence diminished over time: They were mostly social liberals and economic moderates, and as time went by and WASP Republicanism waned as a force in our politics, they increasingly lacked any electoral constituency to speak of on the right.

But their persistent role in Republican administrations, from Ike’s two terms down to Robert Gates’s tenure as Bush’s defense secretary, was deeply important to the G.O.P.’s longstanding advantage on foreign policy. By embodying a version of internationalism that clearly put the national interest first, and a form of Daddy-Party toughness that didn’t necessarily entail starting wars willy-nilly, the realists both helped the party manage its internal tensions on foreign policy — bridging divides between isolationists and advocates of “rollback,” paleocons and neocons — and present a credible, competent and non-scary face to the American public as a whole.

That’s something the post-Bush party has thus far failed to do. And if any 2016 candidate wants to unite their party on foreign policy rather than just polarizing it, reaching for the realist legacy might be a decent place to start."

USA TODAY

It took nearly five years to overcome Republican edge

But %22senior%22 judges give GOP continued advantage

Republicans block confirmation at nation%27s No. 2 court

WASHINGTON — The federal judiciary — long the province and priority of Republicans — is turning more Democratic.

The number of full-time federal judges named by Democratic presidents will draw even Friday with the number named by Republicans, following two retirements. The next of President Obama's nominees to replace a Republican-named judge will tilt the balance in Democrats' favor; that majority will grow for the remainder of his term.

The trend is particularly noteworthy at the nation's 13 appeals courts, 10 of which had a majority of Republican appointees by the end of George W. Bush's presidency. Although the Supreme Court remains 5-4 in Republicans' favor, judges named by Democratic presidents now dominate seven appeals courts, and two more are split down the middle.

""It is an important milestone,"" says Kathryn Ruemmler, the White House counsel. ""It is a good indicator that the president is making his mark on the courts.""

The federal courts — particularly the appeals courts — often set precedents in areas ranging from national security and economic regulation to abortion, immigration, voting rights, affirmative action, gun control and gay marriage.

""The impact that the president can have on the federal judiciary is perhaps the single-most important legacy issue for any president,"" says Doug Kendall, president of the Constitutional Accountability Center, a liberal advocacy group.

Both parties have fought wars over judicial nominees since 1987, when Democrats blocked Ronald Reagan's nomination of Robert Bork to the Supreme Court. The arch-conservative Bork was replaced by the more moderate Anthony Kennedy, now the GOP appointee who most often sides with liberals.

So fierce is the battle for judicial control that, on Thursday, Senate Republicans blocked confirmation of Obama's top choice to fill a vacancy on the federal appeals court for the District of Columbia Circuit. That is the nation's second most powerful court, with vast jurisdiction over federal agencies and regulations.

The court has eight active judges, split among Democratic and Republican appointees, and three vacancies. There are six ""senior"" judges who usually serve part-time — five of them appointed by Republican presidents.

Obama, who had one nominee for that court blocked by Senate Republicans before winning confirmation of Sri Srinivasan in May, introduced three more nominees in June. The Senate Judiciary Committee voted along party lines to confirm them, but Senate Republicans maintain the court doesn't need any more judges. On Thursday, they blocked action on Patricia Millett, 50, who has argued the second most cases before the Supreme Court among all female litigants.

""The reason they want to put more judges on the D.C. Circuit is not because it needs them,"" Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said. He quoted an administration ally who had acknowledged that ""the president's best hope for advancing his agenda is through executive action, and that runs through the D.C. Circuit.""

Liberal activists have another explanation for GOP obstruction. ""It's the farm team,"" says Nan Aron, president of the liberal Alliance for Justice, of the court's historic role as stepping-stone to the Supreme Court. ""Republicans have always fought holy wars over filling those seats.""

Despite that setback, Democrats' steady progress on other appeals and district courts has not been denied. It's been a long time coming; Obama, preoccupied by two Supreme Court nominations in his first two years, got a slow start on filling lower court vacancies. Senate Republicans have been even slower to confirm his nominees.

Lining the federal bench with judges who enjoy lifetime tenure is one of the most significant perks of the presidency. Two-term presidents generally appoint nearly 40% of the 874 federal judges. George W. Bush's preference for ideological conservatives remade the judiciary in his image. Obama, with 208 confirmed judges so far, has preferred moderates.

Even as Democrats are poised to pull ahead, however, Republican nominees will maintain an outsize influence because of the number of judges over 65 who take senior status and continue to decide cases. While the number of active judges are tied at 390, there are 322 senior judges nominated by Republican presidents — more than half named by Reagan — compared with 233 Democrats.

For years, the problem for Democrats has been Republicans' dominance in presidential politics. GOP presidents have held the White House for 20 of the past 33 years and 28 of the past 45, dating to the Nixon administration.

""Their policy preferences should not be what's driving their decisions,"" says Carrie Severino, chief counsel for the conservative Judicial Crisis Network. ""Unfortunately, we have a very politicized approach to the judiciary at this point, and that's detrimental.""

Nationally, a few appeals court nominees have been blocked on both sides, and the pace of Senate confirmations has slowed with each new administration. About 10% of the nation's 179 appeals court and 677 district court judgeships remain vacant, a level not seen for two decades, according to the liberal Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law.

While squabbling with Senate Republicans over those delays, Obama has been able to remake the judiciary in another way. Forty-two percent of his confirmed judges are women and 37% are minorities, far greater proportions than those of his predecessors.

That's of lesser concern to conservative groups than Democrats' emerging majority, one that can only grow through 2016. If the next president is a Democrat — say, Hillary Rodham Clinton — the impact would be huge.

""At that point,"" says Curt Levey, president of the conservative Committee for Justice, ""there would be very few Republicans left on the courts.""

But it was Romney's anecdote about going to China to potentially buy a factory that first piqued Prouty's interest. He was bothered by the candidate's description of barbed wire fencing and crowded dorm rooms.

""He just walked though this horrendous place and thought, 'Hey, this is pretty good,'"" Prouty said.

After the fundraiser, Prouty did some research and found a Mother Jones article by David Corn about Bain Capital's investment in a Chinese manufacturing firm. He also got in touch with Charles Kernaghan, an international labor rights activist.

The service industry worker was also miffed by the way Romney addressed the staff at the event, asking as soon as he arrived for them to move things along. Prouty had actually tended bar at a previous Romney event and served the candidate a Diet Coke with lemon.

""He took it and turned and didn't say anything,"" Prouty told the Huffington Post. ""He took it out of my hand and turned his back without a 'thank you' or anything else.""

Prouty posted the China clip in comment sections on news Web sites and liberal blogs. But without more context -- and with the image distorted to mask details that might expose the videographer -- the videos didn't gain traction. Prouty decided that he wanted Corn to take the story national. He approached Corn through former president Jimmy Carter's grandson, James Carter, who had been posting political clips to YouTube. On Sept. 17, Mother Jones posted the entire video.

Prouty said he did not reveal himself before the election because he did not want to draw attention away from the video itself: ""I wanted Mitt Romney's words, and Mitt Romney's words only"" to be the focus. Now, he said, he expects ""to be torn apart by the right-wing media.""

If he earns some ire, Prouty is also getting some positive attention. The United Steelworkers are looking to hire him.

Now that Prouty has revealed himself, Corn has published his own account of the video's release. He writes that after learning Prouty's real name, he Googled his source and was relieved by what he learned: Prouty had once rescued a drowning woman from a car.

Prouty said he is a registered independent but tends to vote Democratic. He had no contact with the Obama campaign. Watching the second presidential debate, in which Obama invoked the ""47 percent"" video in his final statement, Prouty cheered.

""I was thrilled that he hit him with it when he did,"" he said.

Instead of Bolling conceding on election night after losing the primary and pledging to support the voters' choice, Bolling and many of his supporters have declined to support Cuccinelli, who after all did steal the nomination with a cheap trick instead of winning it fair and square. From the very beginning then Cuccinelli's nomination has borne a taint of fast dealings behind closed doors.

Having arranged for his own nomination, Cuccinelli then did something strange; he feigned complete disinterest in who would be chosen to be his running mates. In the case of the attorney general nomination, this did not present much of a problem; there were only two candidates and the nomination was decided on the first ballot, going to State Senator Mark Obenshain--a very, very extreme conservative, but reasonably presentable candidate.

The problem arose in the Lieutenant Governor's race as no fewer than seven candidates presented themselves for consideration. After a series of ballots involving all sorts of betrayals and embitterment, the RPV convention settled on Bishop E.W. Jackson, Sr., probably as flawed a candidate as could ever be imagined. At the time, it apparently never occurred to Cuccinelli to throw his support and endorsement behind a more viable candidate for lieutenant governor. Jackson has been an impressive drag on the GOP ticket ever since.

Fast forward to this week and Cuccinelli's call for a special session to deal with ethics. In making this request, Ken Cuccinelli was looking for a quick fix to his own ethics problem: a series of gifts from Star Scientific's CEO Jonnie Williams totaling about $18,000, not all of which was reported as it should have been. In addition, Cuccinelli held a block of Star Scientific stock which Cuccinelli held and did not report during a period time when Star Scientific had a million dollar tax dispute before Cuccinelli's office. Cuccinelli's conflict of interest with Star Scientific was so great he had to withdraw from providing legal advice to Governor Bob McDonnell in connection with McDonnel own ""Giftgate"" scandal with Star Scientific, costing Virginia's taxpayers more than $50,000 a month in legal fees.

Cuccinelli wants all of this to go away. His answer? A special session of the Virginia General Assembly. In Cuccinelli's short-sighted view, this is an ideal solution. Governor McDonnell calls the 140 members of the General Assembly together and in a few weeks' time, a new tough ethics bill is passed and signed into law by Governor McDonnell. Reform is achieved and Cuccinelli can claim credit because the special session was his idea. Cuccinelli becomes the ""Reform Guy,"" instead of the guy who came in second in ""Giftgate.""

What Cuccinelli didn't see is how his plan would never be accepted by his own party. Cuccinelli doesn't even seem to have coordinated his call for a special session with Governor McDonnell or the Republican leadership in the General Assembly. Both Governor McDonnell and Republican House leadership quickly responded to Cuccinelli in the negative. Why?

Well, for starters, Cuccinelli's quick fix would completely screw up Bob McDonnell's new strategy for dealing with ""Giftgate."" After months of stonewalling and denials, McDonnell got a new team of advisors and a new three-part strategy: 1) apologize; 2) give everything back; and 3) get out of town as much as possible: go on vacation, go to Afghanistan, and then go on tour around the state and hope everyone just forgets about you.

Cuccinelli's quick fix special session plan would require Bob McDonnell to come back to Richmond and wait around while the General Assembly debated ethics reform just across his lawn. And make no mistake, a special session on ethics reform would be all about Bob McDonnell all the time--every hearing, every committee meeting, every debate would center on what Bob McDonnell did or didn't do. No way Bob McDonnell is signing on for that--no way.

Of course, if enough legislators were willing, they could call themselves into a special session, but the Republican leadership in the House of Delegates aren't interested. House Speaker Bill Howell, House Majority Leader M. Kirkland Cox, and other senior Republican legislators aren't interested in Ken Cuccinelli's quick fix, and can you blame them? Ken Cuccinelli wants them to stop what they're doing, suspend their campaigns for re-election, stop fundraising (remember Ken, you can't fundraise while the General Assembly is in session), and come to Richmond for a couple of weeks to pull Ken Cuccinelli's ass out of the fire. All so Ken Cuccinelli doesn't have to reimburse Jonnie Williams for $18,000 in gifts. A special session of the General Assembly would cost at least $50,000 a day!

A special session would be a trap for House Republicans. Once in Richmond they couldn't go home again until they passed real ethics reforms. What if Senate Democrats decided to slow things down? House Republicans would be stuck in Richmond, unable to campaign or fundraise while their Democratic challengers were free to do both, all the while mocking the Republican incumbents for their inability to pass real reform.

And has Cuccinelli also forgotten that he would have to stop fundraising while the General Assembly was in session? Terry McAuliffe would be free to campaign, fundraise, and talk about Cuccinelli's $50,000 a day special session. If Republicans tried to end the special session before real reform was passed, Democrats could skewer them as the party that failed to pass ethics reform--a potential disaster for the GOP just before statewide elections for governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, and the House of Delegates. Is Ken Cuccinelli crazy enough to have believed that the Republican House leadership would walk into such a trap?

Bob McDonnell and the Republican House leadership have made certain that there will be no special session on ethics, and in rejecting Cuccinelli's call for one they have hung him out to dry. Ken Cuccinelli still has an ethics cloud hanging over his head, and now he looks like he is completely out of touch with his own party's leadership. All of this because Ken Cuccinelli won't cough up $18,000 to reimburse Jonnie Williams for the gifts he gave Cuccinelli.

No, Ken Cuccinelli is not a very skilled politician. He rode into office on Bob McDonnell's coattails in 2009. Thanks to ""Giftgate,"" Bob McDonnell no longer has any coattails to offer. As for his running mates, well he's trying his best to avoid E.W. Jackson, and it won't be long before Mark Obenshain will start trying to put some distance between himself and Cuccinelli. Ken Cuccinelli has driven the Republican Party of Virginia off a cliff . . . for $18,000.

Neither did the top of the ticket, Republican gubernatorial nominee Ken Cuccinelli, who has been downplaying his own socially conservative record in favor of a more mainstream message focused on the economy.

So how in the world did archconservative African-American pastor E. W. Jackson cinch his party’s nomination for lieutenant governor of Virginia on Saturday night?

Blame Virginia’s quirky political process, a raucous convention speech and a racial undercurrent for vaulting Jackson—an also-ran in the 2012 Republican primary for the U.S. Senate—onto a stepping stone to the top job in one of the closely watched swing states in the country. Blame Cuccinelli, who steered the party away from holding a potentially more competitive primary and toward a convention that ensured his nomination but left the lieutenant governor’s slot up to only a few thousand hard-core activists to fill.

Jackson’s unexpected entrance into the Virginia statewide elections this year is one of the starkest examples of the challenges facing the GOP as it tries to broaden its appeal on the way to 2016.

“We learned a lot of lessons in 2012 that we’re trying to point out to people, but not all the people are going to listen,” said Ari Fleischer, a former White House press secretary who helped lead the national party’s sweeping examination of the 2012 election and produce a 97-page report of recommendations.

A more informal but similar soul-searching is taking place in Virginia, where the Republican establishment is worried the party will be better known for requiring women seeking abortions to get ultrasounds than for passing a sweeping transportation funding deal. A small group of Republican donors, business leaders, and former elected officials has met in Richmond twice since April about the tea-party’s movement’s impact on the GOP. According to a participant in both meetings, the group is concerned that Cuccinelli is too conservative to win a general election in state that voted twice for President Obama—and that was before Jackson joined the ticket.

Story continues

After Jackson was nominated, Fleischer posted on Twitter, “Jackson's anti-gay slurs are indefensible.” Jackson has called gay people “perverted and “very sick people.” He was less overt in his convention speech, though he referred to protecting traditional families.

“If you’re going to grow the party, it’s helpful to nominate candidates who are deeply conservative but inclusive of other people, as opposed to condemnatory,” Fleischer said. “To denounce people in such a fashion is not how you grow the party.”

Jackson's rhetoric puts Cuccinelli—whose own opposition to same-sex marriage and abortion has earned him a loyal conservative base of support—in a tough spot. He and the Republican Party have a strong motivation in keeping the politically inexperienced Jackson afloat: With control of the state Senate evenly split between the two parties, the lieutenant governor breaks tie votes.

Forced into an awkward arranged marriage, Cuccinelli’s top advisers have urged Jackson to put aside his social crusades and reinforce their campaign’s message on job growth. But until the campaign is comfortable that Jackson is on board with the plan, Cuccinelli is expected to keep his distance from Jackson after completing a two-day statewide tour with him on Tuesday.

“We are not going to be defending our running mates’ statements, now or in the future,” Cuccinelli said in a written statement on Monday that sought to strike a balance between asserting his independence and not throwing Jackson overboard. “The people of Virginia need to get comfortable with each candidate individually, and that's what this process is all about.""

Not if the Democratic Party has its way. With gubernatorial nominee Terry McAuliffe facing a Republican-friendly electorate in November and struggling to explain his less successful business ventures, Democrats immediately seized on the nomination of the controversial minister from Chesapeake.

The Virginia Democratic Party circulated a side-by-side comparison of inflammatory quotes by Cuccinelli and Jackson on homosexuality, abortion, and President Obama. Democratic operatives also circulated a video of Cuccinelli calling Jackson a “powerful, powerful fighter for first principles” that is likely to become fodder for television attack ads. One liberal blog posted under the headline, “This is the lunatic Virginia tea-party Republicans just nominated for lieutenant governor.”

McAuliffe called Jackson and the nominee for attorney general, Mark Obenshain, Cuccinelli’s “ideological twins” in an e-mail blast on Monday. That’s expected to become central line of attack as McAuliffe tries to undercut Cuccinelli’s efforts to emphasize his agenda to cut taxes and create jobs.

""Jackson's nomination will reinforce for voters that Cuccinelli's extreme antiwoman, antigay, anti-middle class agenda will make Virginia an unwelcoming place for families and businesses,” said Danny Kanner, a spokesman for the Democratic Governors Association. ""Cuccinelli could have made his preference for a different lieutenant governor nominee known if he had one—like he did in the AG's race—but he didn't, because he shares the same hateful, extreme views espoused by his new running mate.""

Cuccinelli declined to intervene in the seven-candidate primary, campaign sources said, in part because he anticipated racially tinged criticism for getting in the way of an African-American candidate. Jackson joins a small but prominent circle of charismatic black conservatives that includes former presidential candidate Herman Cain and former Rep. Allen West of Florida (West, who attended the convention, endorsed one of Jackson’s rivals.)

“I am proud to say that I am not an African-American. I am an American!” declared Jackson, drawing roaring applause from convention-goers at the Richmond Coliseum. Candidates who look and sound like Jackson have a unique appeal at a time when Democrats can boast of electing the first African-American president and some of President Obama’s critics have gone so far as to question his U.S. citizenship.

While Jackson’s addition to the slate complicates Cuccinelli’s campaign, it doesn’t guarantee a tailspin. As a Harvard Law School graduate and former Marine, Jackson brings some obvious assets to the race. The top candidates run separately in Virginia, so it’s possible for a split-ticket result in November. One recent example: When Republican George Allen ran for governor in 1993, a conservative homeschooling champion, Mike Farris, won the nomination to be lieutenant governor. Allen kept his distance and won, while Farris was defeated by Democrat Don Beyer.

“It’s not clear that the bottom of the ticket will have tremendous influence on the top,” said Bob Holsworth, founding director of the Center for Public Policy and the Wilder School of Government and Public Affairs at Virginia Commonwealth University. “Jackson is such a formidable public persona, however, that it’s hard to imagine him shrinking into the backdrop. It will be fascinating to see if the Republican Party lets him drift on his own or whether they help him be competitive.”

Democrats tried and failed to make the governor’s race a referendum on social issues in 2009 when conservative Republican Bob McDonnell led the ticket. Keeping his focus on jobs and the economy, McDonnell won in an election that laid the groundwork for the anti-Obama wave of 2010.

“Before everybody pronounces the death knell of the Republican ticket in 2013, they should remember that national dynamics and Obama’s approval numbers will have as much to do with this race as anything else,” said former Rep. Tom Davis, whose wife, Jeannemarie, ran unsuccessfully against Jackson.

Davis, a moderate, said he would back Jackson despite his antigay views. “How can I support someone who supports 'Obamacare?' ” he asked, referring to the Democratic ticket. “That’s the choice. Control of the state Senate is at stake.”"
http://news.yahoo.com/liz-cheney-challenge-enzi-echoes-gop-divisions-071228128.html,,[],Liz Cheney challenge to Enzi echoes GOP divisions,"CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) — Liz Cheney says her GOP primary challenge to Wyoming's senior U.S. senator is about sending a ""new generation"" to Washington. But it has all the hallmarks of the same divisions that have roiled the Republican Party nationally for years.

While he's no moderate, incumbent Sen. Mike Enzi has shown he is willing to compromise occasionally with Democrats, such as when he supported a sales tax on Internet purchases.

But Cheney, the elder daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, suggests that such compromise often isn't good enough for a true conservative.

""I'm running because I'm concerned about the direction of the nation,"" Liz Cheney said Tuesday. ""I think it's time for us to say to ourselves, 'Can we continue to go along to get along in Washington?'""

Several Republicans senators elsewhere have faced tea party challengers questioning their conservative credentials. In Indiana, six-term Sen. Richard Lugar lost in a Republican primary last year to Richard Mourdock, who went on to lose to Democrat Joe Donnelly.

In Utah, tea party favorite Sen. Mike Lee ousted three-term incumbent Sen. Bob Bennett in 2010. And Sen. Orrin Hatch fended off a tea party challenger to win a seventh term last year.

The winner of Wyoming's Republican primary just over a year from now will be a heavy favorite to win the general election. Registered Republicans outnumber Democrats in Wyoming by a margin of more than 3 to 1.

Wyoming hasn't had a Democrat in its congressional delegation since 1979, the year Dick Cheney succeeded retiring Democratic Rep. Teno Roncalio to take the state's lone U.S. House seat.

Challenging any incumbent is a brazen move in Wyoming. At least until now, the state has shown considerable deference to those established in office.

Liz Cheney described herself as a tea party sympathizer. She called the movement favoring low taxes as a ""force for good in terms of getting people focused on fiscal issues.""

Liz Cheney, 46, is the older of Dick Cheney's two children, both daughters. Married with five children, she was a resident of Virginia until recently. She and her husband bought a home last year in the posh northwest Wyoming community of Jackson Hole.

Story continues

Asked why voters should oust Enzi, a powerful incumbent, in favor of a rookie, Liz Cheney said seniority isn't necessarily an attribute.

""I think that part of the problem in Washington today is seniority,"" she told The Associated Press in a telephone interview. ""I think it's time for a new generation, for a new generation to come to the fore. I don't see seniority as a plus, frankly.""

Enzi announced he would seek re-election Tuesday, more than six months earlier in the political cycle than he has declared his bid in the past.

""Working behind the scenes — this is what I have been doing since I was elected, and this is what needs to be done,"" Enzi said by email through a spokesman.

He immediately won the endorsement of colleagues in the Senate, including the National Republican Senatorial Committee.

""Our support will be there for Mike,"" said the committee's chairman, Republican Sen. Jerry Moran of Kansas.

The other two members of Wyoming's congressional delegation, both Republicans, came out quickly in support of Enzi. Sen. John Barrasso and Rep. Cynthia Lummis praised Enzi for his long service and knowledge of Wyoming issues.

The race promises to be hard-fought. Enzi has had few serious Democratic challengers — much less Republican ones — since he was first elected to the Senate in 1996. He remains well-liked around the state as an affable former shoe salesman and mayor of the coal-mining city of Gillette.

Enzi, 69, takes pride in keeping a lower profile and remaining much less partisan than most of his colleagues. He often refers to his ""80-20"" rule — that opposing parties usually can agree on 80 percent of the details of any given issue — as a model for Republicans and Democrats to work together.

He handily won re-election in 2008 with more than 75 percent of the vote.

Liz Cheney's interest in the seat has been an open secret for months, dating at least to her purchase last year of a home in Wilson, a community in Jackson Hole, listed for $1.9 million.

She appeared onstage with her father at last year's state Republican Party convention. It was Dick Cheney's first public appearance since he underwent a heart transplant, and father and daughter have been working on a book together.

Since then, Liz Cheney has made frequent appearances at county-level GOP events in virtually every corner of the state. She also has been in the national public eye as a Fox News political commentator.

Wyoming political veteran Chris Rothfuss said Liz Cheney's candidacy might be a sign of the divisions that have roiled the national Republican Party for several years, with GOP officeholders being challenged from within their party if they are seen as too willing to compromise with Democrats.

Rothfuss, a Democratic state lawmaker who lost to Enzi in 2008, said Liz Cheney's challenge reflects ""everything that's wrong"" with partisanship in national politics.

""I would also say that the reason that Liz Cheney is running out of Wyoming rather than what in effect would be her home state of Virginia is because we're basically seen as a much cheaper option in trying to obtain a Senate seat,"" said Rothfuss, a chemical engineer.

But make no mistake, the Cheney family is well-established in Wyoming— an important qualification for anybody seeking major office in the state.

While Liz Cheney was born in Madison, Wis., her announcement pointed out that the Cheney family has roots that go back more than 100 years in Wyoming.

Liz Cheney holds a law degree from the University of Chicago and has worked as a lawyer for the State Department and the Agency for International Development.

Yet she said Wyoming always has been where her heart is.

""My sense is, as far the carpetbagger charge, is it's from people who don't want to talk about substance, don't want to talk about the issues,"" Liz Cheney said.

(CNN) – Karl Rove wasted no time in hitting back at Sarah Palin after she criticized him for getting involved in Republican primaries last year.

""If she can play in primaries, other people can play in primaries,"" he said on ""Fox News Sunday.""



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker'] [twitter-follow screen_name='KilloughCNN']

During her speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Saturday, Palin chided Washington establishment attempts to shape the last election, especially in congressional races. While she didn't mention his name, the former Alaska governor seemed to be aiming at Rove, the former top political adviser to George W. Bush who was dubbed the ""architect"" of the former president's campaigns.

Rove now runs American Crossroads and Crossroads GPS, two independent groups that spent money for conservative candidates in last year's contests, as well as in the 2010 mid-terms. While candidates that Crossroads supported two years ago saw success, most of them failed to win their contests last year.

""If these experts who keep losing elections and keep getting rehired and raking in millions, if they feel that strongly about who gets to run in this party, then they should buck up or stay in the truck. Buck up and run,"" Palin said. ""The architects can head on back.""

Rove is now starting another organization, the Conservative Victory Project, that's designed to help find candidates who can easily win Republican primaries. Palin joined tea party activists in blasting the new move, saying it's simply a way to push out more conservative voices.

Palin herself was active in backing the more conservative candidates in several Republican primaries last year. Many of her preferred candidates went on to win, including Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Sen. Deb Fischer of Nebraska.

With 20 months until the 2014 mid-terms, Palin said Washington should not be in the game of hand-picking a candidate. She urged her CPAC audience to change the ""top-down political process"" and create their own search for the next best crop of contenders.

Asked to respond to her remarks, Rove said Sunday that the 2008 GOP vice presidential nominee had little room to talk.

""Well, first of all, I live in Texas, and I don't live in Washington,"" Rove said on Fox, where Palin once served as a paid contributor.

""Second of all, look, Sarah Palin should be agreeing with this. She didn't support Todd Akin, and when he said the reprehensible things he said, she wisely came out and said he ought to get out of the race.""

He was referring to Akin's controversial statement about rape that ultimately derailed the Missouri congressman's campaign for the U.S. Senate - a seat he was favored to win. Akin made the comments soon after he became the Republican nominee in the race. Palin had backed Republican Sarah Steelman for the nomination.

Rove said he also had to set the record straight on two other points of contention.

""First of all, raking in millions - I'm a volunteer. I don't take a dime from my work with American Crossroads. I even pay my own travel expenses, out of my own pocket. I thought Sarah Palin was about encouraging volunteer, grass-roots activity. I'm a volunteer,"" he said.

""Second of all, look. I appreciate her encouragement that I ought to go home to Texas and run for office. I would be enthused if I ran for office to have her support. I will say this, though: I don't think I'm a particularly good candidate. Sort of a balding, fat guy. And second of all, I'd say if I did run for office and win, I would serve out my term. I wouldn't leave office midterm,"" he said, taking a swipe at Palin's decision to resign from her governorship in 2009."

1. Eliminate the Appalachian State University (ASU) early one-stop voting site.

2. Force all early voting into one location hard to access by students, faculty, and staff at ASU.

3. Outlaw any verbal public comment at Board meetings and require that written comments be screened to ensure they were ""pertinent"" and communicated without cussing or libel.

4. Require that the 27-year Elections Board Director, a woman totally on the straight up and beloved by the entire county, not be allowed to meet with anyone in her office without supervision.

5. Mandate that anyone calling into the local BOE office have their names recorded.

6. Move the ""New River"" precinct (a heavily populated precinct in and around the town of Boone) out into the very corner of the precinct into a virtually unknown location and as far away from municipal voters as possible.

7. Combine three Boone precincts into one Super Precinct consisting of 9,300 voters and 35 parking spaces. Oh. And away as far as possible from ASU.

The crowd of 60 plus (considerable for our little Town) was pissed as hell. We're talking screaming, yelling, booing, ""shame on you,"" ""what are you trying to hide,"".... At one point one of the Republican meatheads threatened to have the public arrested. The response from the crowd was an immediate ""bring it on."" Here's the initial local press account.

If you've got an hour, grab a cup of coffee (or a beer and an sandwich) and check out the video from the rest of the meeting. It's. worth. every. inch. of. your. time. But I can't embed it.

Now let's face it. A lot of small county Democratic parties would just give it all up right then and there. Afterall, what good would an appeal to the State Board of Elections do? That Board, appointed by Governor McCrory (in other words Art Pope) is also controlled by right-wingers, bent on not just drowning state progressives, but chopping them off at the head first.

Unfortunately for them our local Democratic Party just by nature ain't so inclined to go quietly into that good night. And before they can chop off our heads, we're determined to drag them to shore for all to see.

We've put 24/7 into fighting back against all odds, and while we know that in the end we are unlikely to be able to overturn the local Board's decision, we are still at it. The lone Democrat on the Board, Kathleen Campbell, has put in a petition to the state. The NAACP is now looking into our fight, and Common Cause has formally urged Governor McCrory to get involved. After all, he said earlier this week that it was wrong for partisan politics to be a factor in selecting precincts. The Mayor of Boone has written a scathing letter to the Chairman of the State Board of Elections.

We're bringing the evil into the light anywhere and everywhere.

And thanks to Rachel Maddow for putting our fight on the national map.

He disappeared for nearly a week during his second term as Governor of South Carolina and, when he returned to the United States, revealed that he had been unfaithful to his then-wife Jenny Sanford. It was later revealed that he had flown to Argentina and had an affair with the woman that he is now engaged to.

Sanford settled 37 ethics charges that stemmed from his affair and he paid the largest ethics fine in South Carolina history after settling the charges.

Democrats, with the exceptions of Charlie Rangel, Alcee Hastings, and some others, tend to disown those who tarnish the Democratic brand...Jesse Jackson Jr., John Edwards, William Jefferson, Herman Talamadge, Rod Blagojevich, Dan Rostenkowski, Chuck Chvala, and others who have tarnished the Democratic brand for adultery and/or corruption are regarded as persona non grata in the Democratic Party these days, or, in the case of Talamadge, would be persona non grata in the Democratic Party if he were alive today.

Republicans, with some exceptions, tend to admire those who tarnish their brand...Newt Gingrich, David Vitter, Spencer Bachus, and now Mark Sanford, just to name a few. As a matter of fact, Howie Klein of Down With Tyranny is reporting that Mark Foley is considering a redemption run for public office of his own, although I'm not sure if that's merely a joke by Klein or if Foley is actually considering a return to politics.

For another observation I've made from tonight's special election in the 1st Congressional District of South Carolina, look below the orange squiggle."

Virginia’s first lady has taken the field as a cheerleader for both the Washington Redskins and her husband.

Virginia’s first lady has taken the field as a cheerleader for both the Redskins and her husband, Gov. Robert. F. McDonnell.

Virginia’s first lady has taken the field as a cheerleader for both the Redskins and her husband, Gov. Robert. F. McDonnell.

Virginia first lady Maureen McDonnell bought nearly $9,800 in clothing with money from her husband’s political action committee and tapped into his campaign and inaugural funds to buy $7,600 in mostly unspecified items, according to records and a representative for the PAC.

The spending is legal under Virginia’s lax campaign finance laws, which prohibit the conversion of political funds for private use only when a PAC or campaign committee disbands — not while it is operating.

But the purchases are unusual in Virginia, where campaign finance records indicate that candidates do not routinely dip into political funds to buy personal items such as clothing for themselves or their spouses.

Maureen McDonnell’s use of political donations comes to light at a time when she and her husband, Gov. Robert F. McDonnell (R), are under intense scrutiny for accepting luxury items and $120,000 in loans from wealthy Virginia businessman Jonnie R. Williams Sr. Federal and state investigators are probing the Star Scientific executive’s ties to the McDonnells, who promoted his firm’s nutritional supplement, Anatabloc. Last week the governor apologized for embarrassing the commonwealth and repaid the loans.

Several gifts that have drawn investigators’ attention seem aimed at polishing Maureen McDonnell’s image as first lady. They are looking into whether the former Washington Redskins cheerleader and mother of five received free cosmetic dental work from a Richmond-area dentist, jewelry from a state delegate and a $15,000 Bergdorf Goodman shopping spree from Williams.

Using political money for clothes helped McDonnell step up her style while her family’s finances were hit by the plunging real estate market.

Bob McDonnell won the 2009 governor’s race as several properties that he and his family bought for a combined $3.84 million at the height of the real estate boom had lost value. Maureen McDonnell complained to officials at Opportunity Virginia PAC that she didn’t have the wardrobe or resources necessary for her new role as first lady, according to a person familiar with the PAC’s operations, who spoke on condition of anonymity to maintain a relationship with the McDonnells.

Maureen McDonnell was given a PAC credit card, according to that person. A representative of the PAC confirmed Friday that the card was provided to the first lady, but he added that she no longer has it. The representative answered questions on behalf of the committee on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the ongoing investigations.

Rich Galen, a private spokesman for the governor and first lady on matters related to the investigations, said that Maureen McDonnell was borrowing the clothes, which would be donated to charity after Bob McDonnell completes his term in January. The PAC also said that the items will be returned to the committee and then donated to charity.

Asked in a brief phone interview whether the committee spent money on department-store clothing, Phil Cox, director of the PAC and executive director of the Republican Governors Association, said: “All of the PAC expenditures are publicly available. What’s there is there.” Cox does not sign off on the PAC’s expense reports.

Outfitting herself

Maureen McDonnell has charged about $9,800 in clothing to the PAC, but that is not obvious from campaign finance reports filed by the committee.

None of the items the first lady put on the PAC credit card was identified as clothing in public records available online through the nonpartisan Virginia Public Access Project. The purchases are billed as “event expenses” and “travel expenses.” At times, however, the vendor listed suggests clothing: Nordstrom, Macy’s, Saks Fifth Avenue, Lord & Taylor and Ann Taylor. In all, the PAC spent $6,300 at those stores.

In those cases where the stores are identified, nothing in the public record links the purchases to Maureen McDonnell.

Her name is listed on three additional PAC expenses totaling about $3,500. But in those instances, the records do not indicate what was bought or where. Instead of clothing stores, the vendor listed is “Maureen McDonnell.” The purchases are identified as “travel expenses” and “event expenses.”

But the PAC representative confirmed that $9,800 in purchases — all of those publicly linked either to the clothing stores or to the first lady — were clothing for her. He said they were bought for official gubernatorial or political events.

She spent $2,379 at Nordstrom over two days in March 2012 and another $535 there a month before that, all to prepare for a trip to California to market Virginia products and attend a Republican Governors Association meeting.

She spent $1,121 in July 2012 at Saks to buy clothes for a gala celebrating the bicentennial of the governor’s mansion.

She spent about $6,000 around the time of McDonnell’s January 2010 inauguration, about half of that for clothing charged to the PAC. The other half: $3,087 that Bob McDonnell’s inaugural committee paid to her for unspecified “event expenses.”

The PAC representative said it was not clear what she bought with the inaugural funds. With the committee now closed and original receipts and other records in storage, he said the answer was not readily available.

Maureen McDonnell also received payments from two other committees associated with her husband. The Bob McDonnell for Governor committee paid her $2,369 in unspecified “event” and “travel” expenses in July and September 2009. Bob McDonnell for Attorney General reimbursed her $1,021 for a camera in August 2007 and $1,104 that December for unspecified “event supplies.”

The representative said he did not know what the camera was for. The nature of the other reimbursements also was unclear because records from those now-closed committees also are in storage, he said. Also unexplained was the $1,100 that Bob McDonnell for Governor spent at Dick’s Sporting Goods over three days in late October 2009.

‘No restriction’

When a campaign committee or PAC is being disbanded, candidates are prohibited from converting any surplus funds to personal use for themselves or immediate relatives. But while a political committee is running, “there are no restrictions,” said Nikki Sheridan, spokeswoman for the Virginia State Board of Elections.

“If they wanted to use the money to send their kids to college, they could probably do that,” she said. “There is no restriction on clothing, grooming or legal fees unless you’re shutting down your PAC.”

The law is one of the nation’s most lax. Most states restrict personal use at any stage in the life of a political committee, according to Karen Shanton, a legislative studies specialist with the National Conference of State Legislatures. But it is in keeping with Virginia’s no-limits, full-disclosure approach to campaign finance generally. The state has no caps on political contributions. And officeholders are allowed to take personal gifts of any value as long as they report those worth more than $50.

State elections officials said it is not unusual for candidates to call asking if they can charge their campaigns for the clothing they wear in the course of running for office. They are told that it is not illegal.

Whether it is a wise public relations move is another matter.

Del. Onzlee Ware (D-Roanoke) drew attention in 2009 for using campaign funds for personal items, including a YMCA membership.

State Board of Elections officials reviewed his spending but concluded there was no violation of the law after the attorney general’s office advised them in writing that the law “does not prohibit the personal use of campaign contributions by candidates or office holders unless or until” they disband their committees.

Even so, it appears to be more the exception than the rule that Virginia politicians use political funds to fill their closets.

U.S. Sen. Timothy M. Kaine (D) has had one clothing expense paid for with campaign funds — $708 at Nordstrom — since he ran for governor in 2004.

State Sen. A. Donald McEachin (D-Richmond), charged a $794 tuxedo from Franco’s Fine Clothier to his campaign account in early 2009 but refunded his campaign in mid-2010. McEachin said he had meant to pay personally for the tuxedo, which he was buying for an Urban League dinner, but accidentally pulled out his campaign credit card. He said he made the refund after discovering the error.

At least a handful of other Virginia candidates have billed their campaigns for relatively modest clothing or tailoring services.

The man Bob McDonnell defeated in 2009, state Sen. R. Creigh Deeds (D-Bath) charged $42 at Macy’s, $38 in Kohl’s and $84 at Dick’s Sporting Goods in the course of his campaign. All of the purchases were identified on his reports as clothing. He also billed his campaign for more than $500 in dry cleaning charges while he was on the campaign trail.

Deeds said he couldn’t recall what any of the clothing purchases were for, but said they were small and probably related to the difficulties of the hectic campaign pace.

“You’re out and you spill coffee on a necktie in the morning and you have big things to do the rest of the day,” he said, speaking hypothetically. “You’ve got to go out and buy a new necktie.”

Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli II’s gubernatorial campaign spent $182 at Macy’s in May after the Republican showed up to shoot a TV commercial with two blue shirts.

“[W]e needed the AG in various color shirts, so a staffer went to Macy’s and purchased what was needed,” campaign spokeswoman Anna Nix said via e-mail. “As a practice, the AG does not believe [in using] nor use campaign funds for personal use.”"

Trying to save face.

McConnell and [Senate Majority Leader Harry] Reid first met on Monday afternoon in an unscheduled meeting about two hours after McCain sat with the majority leader. ""Mitch, I know you came to see me, but let me just start off by telling you: I have the votes,"" Reid told McConnell, according to an aide Reid briefed immediately after. ""Say whatever you want, but I have the votes."" ""Here's my offer,"" McConnell responded. ""You'll get all your nominees, but you have to agree that there'll be no more rules changes.""

McCain was there, according to several sources who spoke about private, behind-the-scenes talks on the condition of anonymity, because he and and several other Republicans grew fed up with their own side's stalling tactics and went around McConnell (R-Ky.) to cut the deal with Reid and Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), avoiding a ""nuclear option"" rules change to pass the nominees.

""[McConnell] has essentially now been cut out of the process on nominees,"" the Democratic aide said. ""John McCain is now the minority leader on nominations.""

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is a bully. So what happens when he loses all leverage McConnell held no cards. Reid had the votes. And THIS was the offer? That he would allow votes on nominees he'd held up for years, but he'd get to do it all over again starting tomorrow with new nominations? After years of Reid caving on the issue, perhaps McConnell thought history would repeat itself. But he clearly miscalculated badly—so much so that his own caucus began deserting him.The situation is so bad, actually, that McConnell's ability to obstruct has been permanently compromised.Interesting observation—McCain now appears to control a number of Republicans willing to buck leadership on the filibustering of administration nominees. Whether that influence extends to judicial nominees or legislation remains to be seen (though with the GOP House, legislation is less relevant). But for now, it appears that Reid will be negotiating with McCain on confirmation votes.

And the best part of this? Reid still has the votes for a limited repeal of the filibuster, leverage that will only increase in October when New Jersey gets its Democratic senator back.

Mitch McConnell's down, so let's throw him an anvil. Sign our petition to bring back the talking filibuster."
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/09/opinion/krugman-the-wonk-gap.html,2013-09-09 00:00:00,['Paul Krugman'],The Wonk Gap - The New York Times,"On Saturday, Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming delivered the weekly Republican address. He ignored Syria, presumably because his party is deeply conflicted on the issue. (For the record, so am I.) Instead, he demanded repeal of the Affordable Care Act. “The health care law,” he declared, “has proven to be unpopular, unworkable and unaffordable,” and he predicted “sticker shock” in the months ahead.

So, another week, another denunciation of Obamacare. Who cares? But Mr. Barrasso’s remarks were actually interesting, although not in the way he intended. You see, all the recent news on health costs has been good. So Mr. Barrasso is predicting sticker shock precisely when serious fears of such a shock are fading fast. Why would he do that?

Well, one likely answer is that he hasn’t heard any of the good news. Think about it: Who would tell him?

My guess, in other words, was that Mr. Barrasso was inadvertently illustrating the widening “wonk gap” — the G.O.P.’s near-complete lack of expertise on anything substantive. Health care is the most prominent example, but the dumbing down extends across the spectrum, from budget issues to national security to poll analysis. Remember, Mitt Romney and much of his party went into Election Day expecting victory."

Beltway tactics such as the “tollbooth,” the “milker bill,” and “double milker bills” shamelessly extort campaign cash to advance or stall legislation aimed at targeted money. All too often, the reality is “pay to delay” or “pay to play.”

One scandalous revelation is the staggeringly high interest rate some politicians charge on personal loans they make to their own campaigns, resulting in windfall personal profit. Rep. Grace Napolitano (D-CA) pocketed $294,245 in interest payments on a $150,000 loan at 18% (later lowered to 10%). She dismissed 60 Minutes journalist Steve Kroft’s challenge to the “Mafia” interest rate, saying, “It’s not like I really profited… I am not a billionaire, or a millionaire, for that matter.”

Her comment opens a window into a dirty secret soiling mainstream party politics. Players get rich–typically with your money. At times, the sums are staggering.

Jamie Gorelick served as deputy attorney general during the Clinton administration and followed that gig with a five-year tenure as a board member of the congressionally-chartered, tax-exempt Fannie Mae, where she reportedly received over $26 million in salary, bonuses, so-called performance pay, and stock options.

Fellow Fannie Mae board member Franklyn Raines, who previously served as Bill Clinton’s Director of the Office of Management and Budget, received $90,000,000 in total compensation for six years’ service. Yet Time Magazine called him one of the twenty-five people to blame for the 2008 financial meltdown. The New York Times reported that he agreed to pay $24.7 million, including a $2 million fine, to settle claims against him flowing from the crash.

It is simply a “given” within the professional political class that insiders profit. A seemingly endless supply of tax dollars has long fueled complaints that government policy makers, office holders, functionaries, party insiders, connected lobbyists, and families cash in on the public dole. It even has a name: “crony capitalism.” The latest example is the debacle known as HealthCare.gov–hundreds of millions for what can at best be called an embarrassment developed by a Canadian subsidiary that contributed heavily to pols of all stripes.

Rep. Napolitano’s dismissive backhand at the suggestion of anything remiss over her pocketing a mere $294k is symptomatic of the narcissism now epidemic in the political class. Real profit for the new elites is about serious largesse. Anything as paltry as her racket is chump change. It crosses party lines and flows from bloated government, obscure quasi-governmental entities, and politically packed special entities such as Fannie Mae. And it passes stealthily into respectful private business deals, where political rivals become strange bedfellows.

The current gubernatorial race in Virginia offers a fascinating glimpse of one such pairing. Terry McAuliffe, a DC-area transplant from upstate New York, parlayed his political connections and fundraising acumen into the chairmanship of the DNC. His style of politics takes no prisoners.

McAuliffe has a penchant for investing in techie upstarts with potential for big profit. In 1999, he invested in and joined the board of directors of Telergy, Inc., in Syracuse, New York, his home town. Telergy planned to create a contiguous end-to-end high-speed fiber optics network in the northeastern US along utility rights-of-way. Its plan was to leverage relationships with Niagara Mohawk, NYSEG, Consolidated Edison, GPU, El Paso, and certain National Grid electric subsidiaries. A good old-fashioned dose of classic American initiative–with risks, to be sure–and the potential for handsome profit.

And if the story stopped there, God bless every penny he and his partners could make. That’s why the Constitution protects private property as a fundamental right and encourages capital market creation by granting Congress legislative authority to introduce copyright and patent legislation, all of which encourages the risk/profit correlation that has driven the American economic engine to produce a better standard of living for the broadest swath of society the planet has ever known.

However, the company vastly overvalued its assets and went bust. The Washington Free Beacon reported on McAuliffe’s Telergy link long ago. Byron York added some details here.

But there is more to the story. Telergy laid off a slew of local Syracuse employees–hundreds–without any severance in 2001 and, by the end of the year, filed for bankruptcy. McAuliffe has always said he was just an investor and did not run day-to-day operations. But Telegry’s S-1 SEC filing offers a tantalizing window into the relationships of political insiders and the subordination of principle to profit.

The S-1 identifies McAuliffe under its list of “EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS AND KEY EMPLOYEES.” See page 59. But notice who else it lists among the officers and directors:

J. Patrick Barrett, President and Director. The former Chairman of the New York GOP State Committee during the administration of George Herbert Walker Bush, he is a wealthy and powerful party insider. No one moves within the upstate NY GOP without clearing things with Pat Barrett.

Thomas G. Young, Vice President, Government Relations. He was the Democrat Mayor of Syracuse from 1986-1993, which coincided with Pat Barrett’s term as GOP state party chair. A longtime political of Terry McAuliffe, who hails from Syracuse.

John F. O’Mara, Director. He served as special counsel to George Pataki when the latter was governor of NY and was chair of the New York State Public Service Commission. A powerful state GOP insider.

And, of course, McAuliffe.

All were key players in the political rough and tumble of NY party politics. Some still are. And they were adversaries. Ideologically and politically split–or so it would appear. Yet here they were, in bed together in their personal business investments–and not as mere passive investors the way millions are when vested in mutual funds or as capital investors in start-ups. Each took publicly-identified roles as significant players with fiduciary responsibilities.

But even when the deals go bust, the directors and key people make out, as happened with Telergy. McAuliffe reportedly made some $1.2 million by brokering an investment in Telergy by Gary Winnick of Global Crossing, another company McAuliffe invested in and made millions before it, too, went bankrupt. That failure resulted in $54 billion in shareholder losses and 10,000 lost jobs.

There is nothing wrong with making lots of money. We all love the idea. But the deeper point is to recognize what the money can do to the insiders. Telergy was but one example.

Is it reasonable to believe that such relationships do not erode independence? How aggressively will a state party chair campaign against the local mayor of a rival party come election season when the two are officers of the same business venture? And what of their advocacy of the cherished goals of the grass roots party faithful?It isn’t crony capitalism, but it reeks of cynicism. And its effect on sincerity and message is corrosive.

It is one reason some believe the RINO element within the GOP is uncomfortable with Ken Cuccinelli. Like Ted Cruz, Mike Lee, Rand Paul, and Scott Walker, these insurgent new bloods really believe in freedom, the ideals of their agenda, the sanctity of life, and the restoration of principal. And a new core of GOP leaders stands ready to seize the party with them: Gov. Nikki Haley, Congresswomen Cathy McMorris Rodgers and Kristi Noem, Senators Tom Coburn, Deb Fisher, Pat Toomey, and more.

The emerging voices of conservative principle are sounding the heat of the nation. For a long time, too many have allowed deception to pile high the precipice from which we fall until so dark and damp a tomb we become accustomed to the stench of rotted expectation. No more. With a nod to Mr. Dylan, “the times they are a-changing.”"

Left in place, however, are measures that restrict early voting and absentee ballots, as well as a requirement that all voters must sign the poll book. These measures increase the amount voters who must vote in person as well as increase the actual amount of time poll workers need to spend with each voter. Of course, this increases the lines of people who vote, further discouraging those with busy schedules or in crowded voting precincts. And that's the intent of those laws - to suppress the vote in Democratic areas.

That wasn't enough for Republicans, though. Their brand new shiny voter suppression bill removes ALL weekend voting (their limitation to 1 weekend from 3 in 2011 wasn't restrictive enough to prevent electoral wins by Tammy Baldwin and Barack Obama in 2012) and restricts early voting to ONE WEEK and ONLY during the hours of 7:30 AM - 5 PM (that'll show those folks who try to vote before or after work).

Not only that, but anyone without that ID needs to sign an affidavit that they're indigent and their ""vote"" is not guaranteed to be counted. A person who doesn't have the time to go during work hours to get that ID, has no transportation to a DMV for that ID, or who can't obtain the documents necessary for the ID will have to declare their indigent and possibly get their vote tossed if they aren't.

So, here we go again.

On top of all of this, they want to make the Chief Justice position based on the election of the fellow justices (currently it's the most senior Justice and has been done that way for more than 100 years). Naturally, they want to impose the will of the RW 4 of 7 justices who have bought their seats instead of having moderate Chief Justice Shirley Abrahamson as the Chief based on her long history of service on the State Supreme Court.

And they've also succeeded in changing the reasons for recall to the reasons Scott Walker cited during his own recall. There has been no reason necessary other than the will of the voters. Now the recalled official must be charged and/or convicted of a felony or ethics violation. This would make it impossible for Walker to have politically profited from the voter anger that made him Milwaukee County Executive had it been in effect 15 years ago. It would also make it impossible for us to recall anyone for malfeasance in office or anything outside of criminal behavior.

I think we be ""safe"" from them for the next year. They're done with their extremism until after the next election because they can't count on the poor memories of Wisconsinites or the power of their massive money to ensure their re-election.

They know no bottom and know no shame.

From the IREHR website: The Tea Party and the IRS “Scandal” The Actual Facts of the Case

Here are the not-so-known facts of a few of those cases:

• The First Coast Tea Party Inc. of Jacksonville, Florida, for example, which applied for 501(c)(4) status in 2009 and received it in 2011. Commenting about the recent IRS controversy on Facebook, the group declared “We file a tax return, account for every penny.. We do not endorse candidates that is a no no.” Yet the group’s activities included public bragging about directly helping Republican campaigns. In an August 30, 2012 Facebook post, for instance, the group advertised a Jacksonville rally for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and his vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan, adding, “bring your chairs and your signs, make sure they know that the First Coast Tea Party is and has been helping their campaign.”

It must be noted here that three weeks after receiving 501(C)(4) status the group declared a ""state of emergency"" on their Facebook page, pleading with supporters to campaign for Romney.

THIS is just one example of why the IRS wanted all their Facebook postings.



“FLORIDA FRIENDS, IF YOU LIVE IN ANY OF THESE 3 COUNTIES GET OFF THE COUCH NOW, GET YOUR FRIENDS OFF THE COUCH. GET TO THE REPUBLICAN HEADQUARTERS AND OFFER AND THEN DO SOME WORK. PHONES, (YOU CAN EVEN DO THESE CALLS FROM HOME) AND WALK AND KNOCK. NOW. WE CANNOT LOSE FLORIDA TO OBAMA.. NOW. THIS IS MOST CRITICAL.” [Emphasis in Original]

That plea came from the official Face book account of the organization as opposed to coming from random supporters.

• Similarly, the Louisville Tea Party was granted 501(c)(4) status in 2009. Nevertheless, it published a list of “officially tea party endorsed candidates for the 2011 Kentucky primary.” They also published an article “The Rationale for Romney-Ryan,” arguing for Tea Partiers to vote for the Republican candidate.

Then there’s...

• The Katy Tea Party Patriots, which filed for 501(c)(4) non-profit status in 2009. This group actually ran an “Oust Obama 2012” campaign, organizing block-watching with the Fort Bend GOP, and phone-banking against Obama at GOP headquarters in Sugarland and Houston, Texas. Still featured on the frontpage of the group’s website at the time this article was written is an October 4, 2012 article entitled, “Our Country's Future” by Katy Tea Party Patriots President, Darcy Kahrhoff. She urged members to vote for Gov. Romney. ""Please take time to talk with friends and family you may have living out of state, and try to convince them to vote for Governor Romney, especially if you have friends and family in Florida, Colorado, or Ohio. Also, find a Senatorial candidate to support in these states, and go to FreedomWorks to phone bank for these patriots. Everything you can do to help will matter. We can, and we must, win this!""

Not to be outdone...

• The Central Valley Tea Party Inc. This regional California Tea Party group was granted the much more politically limiting IRS 501(c)(3) tax status back in 2009. It should be noted that this tax-status explicitly prohibits partisan political activity. According the IRS, “Under the Internal Revenue Code, all section 501(c)(3) organizations are absolutely prohibited from directly or indirectly participating in, or intervening in, any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for elective public office. The prohibition applies to all campaigns including campaigns at the federal, state and local level. Violation of this prohibition may result in denial or revocation of tax-exempt status and the imposition of certain excise taxes.”

Despite this (c)(3) designation, the front-page of the group's website features ""upcoming events"" instructing members to ""Volunteer for Measure G,"" and ""Volunteer for Vidak for Senate.” In the latter case, the website simply tells members...



""Please volunteer to do phone banking or precinct walking to help win the election.""

""So it’s time to get excited to vote for the better candidate. It’s time to talk him up to friends and family. It’s time to join with groups like Operation Swing State (www.operationswingstate.org) and make calls in support of his candidacy.""

In an article in the October 2012 issue of the Central Valley Tea Party Times entitled,Paul Szopa told fellow Central Valley Tea Partiers to get out and campaign for GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney,

Another Tea Party group granted the 501(c)(3) non-profit status by the IRS...

• The Tifton, Georgia-based Tiftarea Tea Party Patriots, Inc., which received the designation in 2010. The group also appears to have engaged in openly political activity, including publicly endorsing candidates. On October 9, 2012, in a post on the group’s website “Are you ready to vote?” the group offered up an endorsement for Romney, “The choice is simple. Obama has stated, He will transform America and acted to do such. Everything this Administration stands for, is Government and control of every aspect of life. This is the pipe dream of a Socialist’s mentality, for in their eyes, you the individual, do not know and cannot do, what is right, so someone else has to make decisions for you, to ensure, you do not make the wrong choices or actions. Or you chose Romney, who does not want to transform America, the greatest nation in history of human kind. He wants to allow, the individual, to have the right, to succeed and fail on his own regard, while ensuring those freedoms, given by our Creator and to assure those inalienable rights, written about in the Declaration of Independence are retained by their proper owners, ‘We the People.’”

Note these are only a few of the many examples of blatant political involvement by tea party 'non-profits' reviewed by IREHR. Of course, there are plenty more. As the title of this diary indicates, the REAL scandal here is how often the IRS granted 501(C)(4) status to groups that egregiously violated standards.

Even though the agency was clearly inundated with applications there's no excuse for the incompetency of its employees. As far as I know the agency was at full strength; no cutbacks, no furloughs... just incompetency.

Now, one must ask:



After the firing of several high level IRS employees over this incident, how likely is it that Tea Party groups will be prevented these sorts of violations in the future?

I don't know if we want to know the answer to that question.

Here's an article written for Salon.com by Joan Walsh highlighting what appears to be one of the few groups denied 501(C)(4) status -- a Democratic group."

The folks who run this site have taken on the dispiriting task of gathering together statements from the many commentators who work in the right’s quasi-religious netherworld, a weird land that exists out beyond even the rants of Rush Limbaugh. Here are just a few samples of what has been on their minds in recent weeks:

• Rick Wiles, host of a so-called Christian radio talk show called TruNews, said President Obama is “looking, acting and talking more and more like a man who is applying for the job of Antichrist.” Wiles went on to say, “Mr. Obama may simply be the latest incarnation of Satan’s spirit inside a human being in a high public office. There have been many such men throughout history, tyrants such as Adolf Hitler.”

• Another right-wing commentator, California-based pastor Jim Garlow, warned of America’s doom should Obama be reelected. “Then came November 6, 2012,” Garlow said recently. “If a tombstone were to be prepared for America, I think it might say: ‘1776-2012.’”

• Paul Cameron, chairman of the Family Research Institute, said, “The long term goal of the homosexual movement is to get every little boy to grab his ankles and every little girl to give it a try.”

• At the National Religious Broadcasters convention in February, Jerry Boykin of the Family Research Council (different from the Family Research Institute) made the bogus claim that there have been 50 examples of American judges invoking Muslim Sharia law, and he called for states to follow the lead of Oklahoma by passing legislation to ban Sharia.

• On Generations Radio, pastor Kevin Swanson declared that Obama’s reelection “solidified our doom.” Swanson went on to say there is no difference between the leader of North Korea and Obama because “they’re both committed to Marxism.”

• Swanson also said that the Democratic Party’s vision is “to make sure everybody is committing homosexual acts and they’re high on drugs, and then they vote for Democrats to increase the size of government and provide pretend security for the people high on drugs.”

• On the right-wing website WorldNetDaily, commentator Larry Klayman made this wild claim: “To insure that Obama’s mission to enslave the nation in his brand of Marxist ideology succeeds in the face of imminent rebellion by the informed masses, his government has armed itself to the teeth, unleashed black helicopters in our major cities to intimidate the people and set up committees to determine who in its estimation is a ‘subversive’ and may have to be eliminated with drone and other strikes on American citizens on U.S. soil.”

• And here is how Buster Wilson of the American Family Assn. (what is the deal with all these “family” organizations?) responded to a caller on his radio show who was concerned about government agents coming to take his guns: “I don’t want to have a discussion about how we are ready, willing and able to shoot down United States marshals when they come to take our weapons. I’m not saying you wouldn’t do that or you shouldn’t do that, I’m just staying neutral on that right now.”

The examples go on and on. The trouble for Republicans is that these cranks are shaping the opinions of a significant share of the party faithful. Many GOP luminaries such Mike Huckabee, Rick Santorum and Rand Paul cater to these people, and more than a few GOP members of Congress and a legion of state legislators share the same wacky ideas.

[For the Record, 5:20 a.m. PDT, April 9: An earlier version of this post gave the name of a Republican politician as Mick Huckabee. His name is Mike Huckabee.]

(Twitter then exploded with copies of a photo of the governor with the mayor, Mark Sokolich, a Democrat.)

Is there a bottom of this story to get to? “I don’t think so,” Mr. Christie said, shrugging again. He added, “We’re going to turn the page now.”

Mr. Christie understands the stakes: Because he is a leading contender for the Republican presidential nomination, Democrats and the news media will watch his every move. (“Get used to the new world,” he told one reporter on Friday, smiling.)

He was not quite taking responsibility: more like putting distance. The lanes had been closed, he said twice, “at the request of Mr. Wildstein” — David Wildstein, an old friend of Mr. Christie’s, who resigned from his $150,000-a-year job at the Port Authority a week ago.

Asked about Bill Baroni, another close friend and the governor’s chief appointee at the Port Authority until he resigned on Friday, Mr. Christie said he had not spoken to him “in the last period of time.”

By the end of the hour, the governor tried to turn the situation to his advantage, offering that he wished more people in public life would own up to their mistakes. His office followed up by emailing a video clip from the news conference headlined, “I Take Responsibility for Things That Happen on My Watch.” It opened with him saying, “I wouldn’t characterize myself as angry.”"

(CNN) - Sen. Ted Cruz has hired lawyers to help him get rid of his Canadian citizenship, the Republican from Texas told the Dallas Morning News in an interview published online Saturday night.

""I have retained counsel that is preparing the paperwork to renounce the citizenship,"" he said, adding he expects the process to be completed in 2014.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker'] [twitter-follow screen_name='KilloughCNN']

His office also confirmed the decision to CNN.

Cruz has said in the past he planned to renounce his citizenship, but his latest remarks represent concrete steps he's taking to actively do so.

The first-term senator has said before that he wasn't aware he was still legally tied to Canada until the Dallas newspaper raised the issue in August, quoting legal experts who said the potential presidential candidate was technically a dual citizen.

Cruz was born in Canada to an American mother and a Cuban father.

United States law states that anyone born to a U.S. parent in another country is born as a U.S. citizen.

But, like in the U.S., Canada's laws state that anyone born inside its borders automatically becomes a Canadian citizen.

""Because I was a U.S. citizen at birth, because I left Calgary when I was 4 and have lived my entire life since then in the U.S., and because I have never taken affirmative steps to claim Canadian citizenship, I assumed that was the end of the matter,"" Cruz said in a statement in August.

Cruz told CNN chief political correspondent Candy Crowley at the time he would attempt to renounce his Canadian citizenship.

""Serving as a U.S. senator, I think it's appropriate that I be only an American,"" he said.

Cruz told the Dallas Morning News that the topic came up when he met last month with real estate titan Donald Trump, who was known as one of the leading voices in the ""birther"" movement that questioned whether President Barack Obama was a U.S. citizen.

Obama released his long-form birth certificate in April 2011, proving that he was born in Hawaii and largely putting to rest speculation about his citizenship.

Cruz did not go into detail about the meeting with Trump, saying only that the topic was not discussed in ""any significant respect.""

A spokesperson for Trump did not immediately return a request for comment about Trump's conversation with Cruz."

Former South Carolina governor Mark Sanford reportedly asked his ex-wife to manage his campaign for Congress, just as she had when he first ran for the U.S. House in 1994 during happier times.

In a New Yorkmagazine story, the disgraced Republican who tearfully admitted on national TV that he had an extramarital affair not only went to Jenny Sanford asking for her blessing to re-enter politics, he also had a proposal to join forces again.

""Since you're not running, I want to know if you'll run my campaign,"" Sanford is quoted as saying. ""We could put the team back together.""

Jenny Sanford said no, the story says. Sanford then came back with this sweetener: ""I could pay you this time,"" he is quoted as saying.

Sanford is running for his former House seat, which is vacant because Tim Scott is now in the Senate. He has talked for weeks about his ""mistakes"" and how people should forgive and focus on his plans to reduce the nation's debt. At least one of Sanford's GOP primary opponents, state Rep. Andy Patrick, has said that the campaign should not become Sanford's ""personal redemption tour.""

Jenny Sanford's political stock rose in 2009 when Sanford admitted to the affair, and she was considered by South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley earlier this year as a possible appointee to the Senate. She opted against running for the open 1st District seat because she still has a teen-aged son at home.

Given Mark Sanford's name recognition, he is considered the front-runner among 16 GOP candidates in the March 19 primary. Elizabeth Colbert Busch is the leading Democratic candidate."

Story highlights NEW: Ray Nagin's family allegedly received Hawaii vacation, first-class Jamaica trip Nagin allegedly took bribes of $60,000, $2,250, $50,000, $10,000 and $112,500 Indictment says he filed false tax returns from 2005 to 2008 Nagin was the voice of a devastated New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina in 2005

Former New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin, who captured the drama of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 with an “SOS” call to the nation, was indicted Friday on 21 federal corruption charges, including bribery, money laundering, fraud and filing false tax returns.

Nagin allegedly defrauded the city through “a bribery and kickback scheme” in which he received checks, cash, wire transfers, personal services and free travel from businessmen seeking contracts and favorable treatment from the city, the 25-page federal indictment says.

As part of the alleged bribes, Nagin’s family members received a vacation in Hawaii; first-class airfare to Jamaica; private jet travel and a limousine for New York City totaling $23,500; and cellular phone service, the indictment said.

Nagin’s family-owned granite-business Stone Age LLC allegedly benefited in the corruption, too, the indictment said.

Nagin could not immediately be reached for comment.

According to the indictment, the bribing businessmen allegedly received city contracts of $1 million for consulting, more than $3 million to build a project at Louis Armstrong International Airport, and $1 million for another airport project, the indictment said. Other contracts were for sidewalk repairs in the French Quarter and professional services, authorities allege.

Among the conspiracy charges is an accusation that Nagin awarded “no bid” work to a city contractor who provided “concealed and direct campaign monies” to Nagin, the indictment says.

Read the indictment

Nagin allegedly received bribes from city contractors in the amounts of $60,000, $2,250, $50,000 and $10,000, the indictment says.

He also is accused of receiving a bribe in the form of granite inventory from a city construction contractor.

Nagin faces nine counts of honest services wire fraud, alleging he received nine wire transfers amounting to $12,500 each that were bribes or kickback payoffs from the same city construction contractor in 2010 and 2011, the indictment says. Those bribed totaled $112,500.

In his 2005 tax return – the same year that Katrina hit the Gulf Coast – Nagin allegedly filed a false tax return claiming his income was $156,278, the indictment says.

He is also accused of filing false returns for 2006 listing his income at $170,364, for 2007 with an income of $31,163, and for 2008 with a $143,852 income, the indictment said.

The indictment does not detail what the government claims the returns should state.

In 2005, as Katrina became the single most catastrophic natural disaster in U.S. history, Nagin took center stage on behalf of victims when he excoriated the slow pace of federal and state relief efforts, even using profanities.

Nagin, who is black, urged the reconstruction of a “chocolate New Orleans,” adding, “You can’t have New Orleans no other way.” He later apologized, saying everyone is welcome to the city.

In issuing a national “SOS” during Katrina, Nagin expressed the desperation of a battered Gulf Coast:

“I need reinforcements, I need troops, man. I need 500 buses, man. We ain’t talking about – you know, one of the briefings we had, they were talking about getting public school bus drivers to come down here and bus people out here,” he told radio station WWL-AM.

“I’m like, ‘You got to be kidding me. This is a national disaster. Get every doggone Greyhound bus line in the country and get their asses moving to New Orleans.’

In 2010: Nagin – One day New Orleanians will recognize my good work

“That’s – they’re thinking small, man. And this is a major, major, major deal. And I can’t emphasize it enough, man. This is crazy,” Nagin said then.

The hurricane slammed the Gulf Coast in 2005 and killed 1,833 people, directly or indirectly, in five states. Damages totaled $108 billion, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

Current New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu, who won election in 2010 when term limits kept Nagin out of the race, said the charges mark “a sad day for the city of New Orleans.”

In the 2006 mayoral race, Nagin beat then Lt. Gov. Landrieu, scion of a prominent Louisiana political family.

“Today’s indictment of former Mayor Ray Nagin alleges serious violations of the public’s trust,” Landrieu said in a prepared statement. “Public corruption cannot and will not be tolerated.”

A small group called Carolina Conservatives United, one of dozens organized loosely under the flag of limited government, low taxes and strict adherence to the Constitution, sent out images last week of a milk carton bearing Mr. Graham’s face and asked Gov. Nikki R. Haley to issue the state’s version of an Amber Alert to find its missing senator.

“Lindsey Graham has not been seen in the state of South Carolina for most of the last two years,” said Bruce Carroll, the chairman of the group.

Conservatives in South Carolina are eager to oust Mr. Graham, who has enraged the far right for, among other things, reaching across the aisle on immigration and supporting President Obama’s nominations for the Supreme Court. Tea Party supporters called him a community organizer for the Muslim Brotherhood when, instead of heading home for the Congressional break this month, he went to Egypt at the request of the president."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/01/12/ethics-emails-epa,2013-01-12 00:00:00,"['George Landrith', 'Peter Roff']",EPA Email Scandal Fits Pattern of Its Secrecy,"As a candidate for president, Barack Obama promised to lead the most open, most transparent administration in history. He has not kept that promise. Time and again, members of his administration have failed to keep faith with the American people. Acting in secret, they have taken sometimes extraordinary steps to shield their actions from the public.

The latest example involved Lisa Jackson, who has led the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency since the beginning of the president’s first term. Jackson is resigning, but only after it was revealed she used a fake name (Richard Windsor) to create a fake e-mail address to conduct official EPA business.

What Jackson did contravenes federal law which, because as a nation we value open and transparent government, prohibits such behavior.

This is not the first time the EPA has been in the spotlight because its administrator acted against the interests of transparency. Carol Browner, who led the agency under Bill Clinton and then served for a time as President Obama’s “environmental czar” – ordered the hard drive on her government computer erased and reformatted and all backup tapes destroyed only hours after a federal judge had ordered the EPA to preserve all agency e-mail records.

This conduct, the use of phony e-mail addresses and the erasure of computers pose an interesting question: What is the EPA and its administrators doing that they are so unwilling to have their official communications become public? It doesn’t paint a pretty picture for the left’s agenda or its methods of implementation.

Jackson’s conduct came to light only after a a whistle-blower divulged she was using her fake e-mail account to conduct controversial business, evade congressional oversight, and get around the requirements of the federal Freedom of Information Act. Typically, government business is conducted in public. Correspondence and e-mail must be available to scrutiny, both by Congress and the American people. When a fake name is used, it allows an agency and its employees to evade accountability.

There is no way around it. This is government corruption at its highest form – and the polar opposite of the kind of transparent and open government political leaders on both sides of the aisle claim to want.

EPA’s record of following the law and being transparent couldn’t be much worse. Obama’s EPA has twice failed to provide as required by law a “Unified Agenda” which is a compendium of regulations planned in the foreseeable future. For the record, no other administration has ever even once failed to meet the requirements of this law. This, combined with the more than 12,000 secret e-mails, suggests a pattern of chicanery, obfuscation, and lawlessness at Obama’s EPA.

The problem does not end with Ms. Jackson or her staff. For the last four years, when asked to respond to lawful requests for information by Congress or by American citizens under FOIA, EPA attorneys did not provide e-mail sent and received by the administrator at her “Richard Windsor” e-mail address. Moreover, they affirmed that all responsive e-mails had been provided, when they clearly had not.

It is important whether these attorneys knew or had reason to know that their representations were false. And it is incumbent on the U.S. Congress and, perhaps, the U.S. Department of Justice to begin an inquiry into whether they did so.

To stop the culture of corruption at the EPA, it is not sufficient for Ms. Jackson to step down. There must be a comprehensive investigation concerning the actions of Ms. Jackson, her staff, and EPA attorneys who were involved. It must be determined who knew about or participated in the corruption. Ms. Jackson clearly did but did anyone else? Any government employee involved should be fired and prosecuted. If they are an attorney, they should also be disbarred.

No one has ever gone to jail for violating the Freedom of Information Act but, the federal mail and wire fraud law is broadly used to target corruption in government that falls well short of bribery or extortion. Ms. Jackson and all those who participated in the fraudulent and fake e-mail scheme should face prosecution.

Once the 12,000 or more secret e-mails become public, Attorneys General and United States Attorneys all over the United States will likely have jurisdiction to investigate and perhaps even prosecute Ms. Jackson or anyone else who were involved in there e-mail fraud scheme. Congress should also have a full investigation and also determine if other of agencies have engaged in similarly corrupt schemes designed to shield their activities from public scrutiny, particularly those that pertain to the official function of their position and the development of public policy.

The Obama administration has been one of the least transparent or open administrations in memory. The activities of Lisa Jackson at the EPA are just one example of that. If the president hopes to remove the taint from his administration, he must take a personal interest in rooting out this sort of corruption. He cannot simply accept Ms. Jackson’s resignation and call the matter closed.

Republican Rep. Bob Goodlatte, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee who is playing a major role in the chamber's consideration of immigration policy, on Sunday addressed what is perhaps at the heart of the impasse.

He said the House, which is drafting its own plan, cannot agree to a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. Rather, he wants a ""pathway to legalization"" -- in other words, allow some illegal immigrants a shot at a green card, but not full-fledged citizenship.

The pathway to citizenship, though, is a cornerstone of the Senate-passed bill, and any Democrat-backed plan. Increased border security, better enforcement of businesses and an expansion of the legal immigration system make up the rest of the bill.

Putting the issue in stark terms, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., told ""Fox News Sunday"" that if Republicans strip the pathway to citizenship, ""no Democrat"" would support it.

The confrontation over the pathway to citizenship and other planks of the bill could continue to frustrate lawmakers on both sides, and in both chambers, as they try to sustain the momentum from this past week's Senate vote.

The bill passed Thursday with a strong majority of 68 senators voting in favor. Schumer cited the bipartisan support for the bill, as well as the motive of political survival, in claiming that House Speaker John Boehner would ultimately be compelled to pass it.

""I believe that by the end of this year, the House will pass the Senate bill,"" Schumer said.

House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, speaking on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" also suggested that Republicans' desire to ""win a presidential race"" would guide them toward supporting some version of the legislation.

But what's in store for the bill might not be so clear. And there is no easy resolution to the stand-off over the proposed pathway to citizenship.

House Republicans, in the near-term, are approaching the immigration overhaul in a piecemeal fashion, tackling a series of smaller-scale bills meant to address what the Senate covered in one massive piece of legislation.

Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., also speaking on ""Fox News Sunday,"" rejected Schumer's prediction.

""I was moved almost to the point of tears by Senator Schumer's concern for the future prospects of the Republican Party,"" Gowdy said, sarcastically. ""But we're going to not take his advice.""

He added: ""The Senate bill is not going to pass in the House. It's not going to pass for myriad reasons.""

He, like other House Republicans, questioned Senate promises that their bill would offer legalization to illegal immigrants in the near-term while eventually building border security and immigration enforcement for employers.

Boehner spokesman Michael Steel also told FoxNews.com that the speaker and his caucus have been ""perfectly clear"" on their intentions.

""The House will not simply take up and pass the Senate bill,"" he said in an email. ""Our legislation will reflect our principles, particularly on border security. Wishful thinking, frankly, is not a strategy for getting a bill to the president's desk.""

Schumer methodically made his case Sunday for why he thinks Boehner will, in the end, bring the Senate bill to the floor.

Aside from citing the various political pressures weighing on the speaker, Schumer said the strategy of passing smaller-scale bills would not work. He said, for instance, that Democrats would not support an enforcement bill without the promise of a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. Factor in Republicans who refuse to support any immigration bill, Schumer said, and those bills cannot pass.

He claimed Boehner would ultimately be left with a choice between doing nothing and bringing the Senate bill to a vote, relying largely on Democrats to pass it.

Goodlatte, though, insisted that Republicans would take a ""step-by-step"" approach.

Speaking on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" he said ""we want to see enforcement improved and actually enforced, and we want to find the appropriate legal status for people who are not here lawfully.""

Asked about his opposition to the pathway to citizenship, he explained he didn't want a ""special pathway to citizenship, where people who are here unlawfully get something that people who have worked for decades to immigrate lawfully do not have."""

Collectively, the 13 plants employ about 2,000 people and contribute more than a billion dollars to the Illinois economy in the form of their payrolls as well as the taxes they pay and the purchases they make from suppliers. The impact on local economies where the plants are located could be significant because they often are major employers.

Billy McDaniel, mayor of the city of Metropolis — which facetiously bills itself as the home of Superman — said closing the nearby Joppa plant would be devastating for the southern Illinois city of 6,500. The plant employs 125 people, according to a company filing.

It's much the same story over in Peoria County, where workers are waiting to learn the fate of the Edwards coal plant.

""Virtually every coal plant in Illinois right now is owned by companies that are either in bankruptcy, have recently emerged from bankruptcy or whose bond ratings are approaching junk,"" said Howard Learner, executive director of the Chicago-based Environmental Law and Policy Center.

Owners of the plants have been squeezed by regulations forcing expensive pollution control upgrades at the same time cheaper sources of fuel have rendered the plants unprofitable. In the next two years, legal decisions affecting roughly two-thirds of the state's coal-fired power plants are expected to determine whether those plants have any future.

Ameren Corp. has already determined it no longer wants its five operating coal plants in the state, and it is attempting to hand them over at no cost to Houston-based Dynegy Inc. But there's a catch: The deal hinges on regulators' extending a deadline for cleaning up the plants' air pollution, and the total cost is estimated at about $1.25 billion. Missouri-based Ameren says that if regulators can't guarantee Dynegy the extension, the deal could unravel, which would mean shutting down plants.

Meanwhile, Edison Mission Energy, the parent company of Midwest Generation, the owner of four Illinois coal plants, has been floundering in bankruptcy court, and some analysts expect its unprofitable plants to be shuttered.

Midwest Generation's plants face significant obstacles to complying with heightening environmental regulations, said Julien Dumoulin-Smith, director of equity research for electric utilities at UBS Securities. ""These coal plants are very likely retirement candidates,"" he said.

Dumoulin-Smith also said he doubts that Midwest Generation could sell them. ""I don't see any real appetite for an acquisition. If there was not cash paid for the Ameren assets and the Ameren assets were materially better than the (Midwest Generation) assets, what are the (Midwest Generation) assets worth?""

Doug McFarlan, a spokesman for Midwest Generation, said employees at the company's four remaining plants have shown tremendous fortitude in light of the uncertainty that hangs over their future, setting records for safety and performance in the first half of the year.

The company filed to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code in December 2012 and has ""no firm timetable"" to emerge or any idea what the company will look like or who might own it. Edison International used to be its parent company but severed ties as well as financial support.

""No decisions have been made about retiring additional plants because we're focused on operating them,"" McFarlan said.

On a recent investor call, Robert Flexon, Dynegy president and chief executive, was coy about whether his company would be interested in snatching up the Midwest Generation plants, saying, ""We have our hands full"" with the Ameren transaction.

Dynegy's strategy is to expand its coal-fired generating base to take advantage of economies of scale, said Flexon, and he confirmed his company wants the Ameren plants as badly as Ameren wants to get rid of them.

""It's time to get big or get out,"" said Dumoulin-Smith. ""That is really what's going on here.''

Dynegy is expecting to save $75 million annually by scaling up, savings the company says it desperately needs to stay afloat for the next couple of years. Much of the savings would come from increased purchasing clout.

""In the coal generation business, short term, it's a matter of survival,"" Flexon said in an interview Thursday. ""The market now is as tough as any market has ever been.""

For now, the company is making money from its small cadre of natural gas-fired plants while trying to stem losses from its coal plants for the next three years. If it can make it through until 2016, Dynegy is betting it will be one of the few big coal operators left as tightened federal laws governing mercury and air toxics take effect and coal plant operators shut down rather than invest in pricey pollution controls.

In December, Dynegy completed $1 billion in environmental upgrades at its Baldwin plant and three sister plants in Wood River, Havana and Hennepin.

The company is also betting that the U.S. will begin exporting significant amounts of natural gas, tightening domestic supply and increasing pricing. For Dynegy, a dollar increase in natural gas prices would double its earnings, said Flexon.

In March, Dynegy announced it would become Illinois' largest owner of coal-fired power plants when it said it would acquire Ameren's five Illinois coal plants.

With the Ameren transaction, Dynegy would be the third-largest independent power producer in the U.S., according to Dynegy. It would also give the company a route to sell a portion of its power into a more lucrative power market than it operates in today.

Ameren's plan was to hand over the plants to Dynegy by the end of the year, along with a newly minted five-year extension granted to Ameren to complete those upgrades.

In earning the waiver from the Illinois Pollution Control Board late last year, Ameren argued that it couldn't complete the upgrades because of financial hardship.

Three months after being granted the extension, Ameren announced it would walk away from the plants altogether; shortly thereafter it announced the deal with Dynegy.

Dynegy had been a vocal opponent of such extensions.

Last year it objected to Midwest Generation's request for more time to install pollution controls at its four coal plants, saying such extensions create ""an unlevel playing field between power generators in Illinois, such as Dynegy, that committed to and made the significant financial investment on or ahead of schedule needed to comply with Illinois environmental regulations."""

WASHINGTON — The newly revamped art-deco-style Capitol Hill Hotel near the Library of Congress recently converted its old management offices into a library.

It's not a fancy or particularly extensive library, but book lovers and history buffs alike may like the fact that they can pick up a copy of Pride and Prejudice or a vintage, leather-bound volume of United States Supreme Court Reports and sit on the tufted couch to flip the pages.

""The (new space) gives guests a chance to congregate instead of staying in their rooms,"" says Ian Harvey, the hotel's general manager. ""They can play cards, hold a meeting or read a good book.""

While a library may be especially appropriate for this hotel given its neighbor, it's only the latest property to embrace books, whether as a formal, big-budget library or as a modest library ""wall.""

Hotels in New York, Dallas, Chicago, London, Philadelphia and even a Caribbean resort are increasingly making books a vital part of their atmosphere.

The trend isn't limited to luxury hotels or sleekly designed boutique properties. It's coming to a Marriott near you.

""Even in the Philadelphia West Marriott, a 200-room hotel, we created a small wall of about 10 feet by 14 feet and put books on it,"" says Marc Hoffman, chief operating officer of Sunstone Investors, a real estate investment trust that owns 30 major hotels.

It's all about engaging guests so that they linger, which raises the odds that they'll eventually order something from a hotel bar or restaurant, he says.

""It's all part of this bigger picture of taking public spaces and making them into places where people will sit and generate revenue, instead of what the spaces were in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, places where people walked through,"" he says.

Sunstone is consistently adding libraries in hotels as it renovates its hotels' lobbies and turns them into more residential-style spaces, he says. A library is being installed now in the Hyatt Chicago Magnificent Mile, and one is slated for the Hilton San Diego Bayfront hotel when renovations begin later this year.

""We've taken great pride in building our libraries out,"" he says.

For the Renaissance Washington D.C., Hoffman notes, they bought more than 5,000 books. ""You will see all kinds of things about the D.C. area — art, history, sports teams, book on presidents, books on Washington, books on the great stills of the Virginia mountains,"" he says.

Designs differ

There is no single formula for creating hotel libraries. Some hotels are creating libraries that contain books hand-picked by famous personalities; quite a few are are teaming up with high-end cocktail book publishers.

Some, such as the stylish Joule in Dallas, are using them to drive retail sales, while others are using them to encourage people to order snacks and drinks. The Nomad hotel in New York, for instance, opened last year with its romantic Library Bar, a darkly lit space at night that features floor-to-ceiling bookshelves on two levels and an original spiral staircase imported from France.

Some hotels, such as the luxury Carlisle Bay resort on Antigua, have created libraries to look like ultra-stylish retreats with fiber-optic lighting that changes color, while others have created them to look like old English clubs with wood-paneled walls and leather wing back chairs.

Intriguing trend in digital age

Regardless of these libraries' design or book selections, the increasingly common hotel library represents an intriguing trend in an era of Kindles and tablets.

Hoteliers, after all, are constantly being dumbfounded by the Wi-Fi demands of their guests. It's not unusual for travelers today to check into hotels with two or three Wi-Fi-enabled devices, and families to check into a single room with eight devices.

Examples of libraries in hotels:

- In Dallas, The Joule, an upscale boutique hotel that belongs to the Starwood Luxury Collection, in February will open its $78 million expansion that includes a Charlie Palmer food hall as well as a stylish library. The library — which features books from Taschen — was designed to double as a bookstore to drive retail sales, says architect Jerry Flemons of ForrestPerkins, the firm in charge of the hotel's expansion.

- In Washington D.C., the 49-room Capella luxury hotel in Georgetown — weeks away from opening — will offer guests a library with books and DVDs in its guests-only living room, which also has a fireplace.

- In London last fall, the luxury One Aldwych, part of Leading Hotels of the World, opened a guests-only lounge that includes cozy sofas and armchairs, free Wi-Fi, and a selection of iPads, magazines, newspapers and books. To highlight its two high-profile neighbors in chic Covent Garden, the hotel asked designer Paul Smith to select 50 cocktail table books published by Rizzoli. Guests can order food and cocktails in the room throughout the day and evening.

- New York's Trump Soho recently installed new furniture in its second-floor library that overlooks the lobby. It's also has a new name — the Library at Koi SoHo — since the newly opened Koi restaurant began serving light fare and cocktails in the space. Expect a selection of books on topics such as fashion, art and architecture. Guests can work there during the day, hold meetings or just read.

- The hip Hudson Hotel in New York has a room called the Library that's decorated like an English club with wood-covered walls, a fireplace, a billiards table, wing chairs - and books about film, theater, fashion, politics and travel. Guests can order breakfast and coffee.

- In Santa Monica, Calif., the Viceroy has a contemporary library — with sunny yellow accents — that's off the lobby and adjacent to the pool deck. Expect to find 2,000 books on the arts and culture selected by Kelly Wearstler, the hotel's designer. It can be rented out for private events.

- The modern Radisson Blu Edwardian, which opened in Guildford, England, in the fall of 2011, has a library with sleek, floor-to-ceiling bookshelves and windows, as well as theater-style lighting and a theatrical ""ladder to nowhere."" Designer Rabih Hage was in part inspired by local author, Lewis Carroll, famous for writing Alice in Wonderland as well as the concept of performance, says hotel spokeswoman Tina Morgan. The hotel hosts author events when the Guildford Book Festival takes place each fall.

Back at the Capitol Hill Hotel, where a room can be booked for as little as about $120 on slow weekend nights, general manager Harvey expects the new library will get quite a bit of traffic. When the hotel was filled with the freshman class of the 112th Congress, for instance, many members retreated to the area to hold meetings."

An Economics', 'Political Science Graduate Of Uc Santa Barbara', 'She Also Studied In Budapest']",One GOP lawmaker suggests sequester alternative,"WASHINGTON – With Washington stalemated over the coming “sequester,” one Republican lawmaker suggested swapping the steep budget cuts for a rollback of President Obama’s regulatory agenda as a way around the impasse.

The idea is a new approach, one that shifts away from the Republican-held position that cuts alone can be used to solve the nation’s deficit problems. It is a long-shot.

“Republicans would be open to a plethora of alternatives,” said Rep. Scott Garrett (R-N.J.), among those conservative lawmakers who voted against the original sequester deal. “I would prefer to have this magnitude of cuts, just not in this manner.”

Republicans have repeatedly sought to stop new regulations coming from the Obama administration, particularly those governing clean air and water at the Environmental Protection Agency, which lawmakers argue are bad for business.

QUIZ: How much do you know about sequestration?

The Republican majority in the House approved dozens of bills last session to prevent tougher emission requirements on industrial boilers, cement manufacturers and other industries, only to see the legislative efforts largely stall in the Democratic-controlled Senate.

Aides say there remains a big appetite among Republicans to ensure businesses are not faced with new requirements. Going after regulations could find favor among some Democrats who might join Republicans in hoping to protect home-state industries.

Such an approach remains unlikely to prevent Friday’s scheduled cuts, as virtually no negotiations are underway on the “balanced” approach of new tax revenue and spending cuts Obama insists on to rein in deficits.

The White House is not convinced House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) could rally his severely divided Republican majority to pass an alternative to the “sequester” cuts, which are scheduled to begin slicing 13% off defense accounts and 9% from other domestic spending. Nonpartisan economists project the ripple effect would cost 750,000 jobs this year.

While Democrats have divisions within their ranks over Obama’s tax proposals, Republicans are split between the defense hawks, who want to spare the Pentagon from cuts, and the deficit hawks who see the sequester as their best chance to achieve spending cuts that have eluded them in the past showdowns with the administration.

Any money saved by rolling back regulations would be difficult to quantify. Experts have said loosening regulations could provide long-term savings to industry, but could also be a mixed bag if those are offset by costs to public health.

One thing Republicans do agree on is that Obama’s team came up with the sequester in 2011, when the president and Boehner were negotiating an earlier budget deal.

The sequester was seen as a last-ditch option – cuts so painful to both sides that they would be forced back to the negotiating table to devise an alternative. That never happened as Obama insisted on asking wealthier Americans and corporations to pay more taxes, and Republicans held firm for a cuts-only approach.

Both parties voted that summer to approve the sequester, expecting the other would yield to an agreement. Neither did.

http://news.yahoo.com/house-gop-slash-environmental-arts-171201521.html,,[],"House GOP to slash environmental, arts funding","WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans Monday proposed slashing cuts to environmental programs and funding for the Smithsonian Institution and the arts as they unveiled the latest legislation to implement the second year of budget cuts required under so-called sequestration.

The $24 billion spending measure would gut the budget of the Environmental Protection Agency with a one-third cut and cuts the National Endowments for the Arts by almost half. Overall, the measure funding the Interior Department, EPA, national parks and federal firefighting efforts is cut by 19 percent below funding approved in March.

It takes a more modest approach to the national parks with a slight increase over levels mandated by sequestration, the across-the-board cuts forced by Washington's failure to strike a bipartisan budget accord. And firefighting efforts would benefit from $1.5 billion in ""emergency"" funds on top of the spending limits set by the GOP's austere budget plan.

The measure is the latest of 12 spending bills for the almost one-third of the federal budget funded each year by Congress in the form of day-to-day operating budgets for government agencies. Such budgets are hit the hardest by sequestration.

Republicans control the House and are insisting on living within a tight $967 billion ""cap"" on agency operating budgets and are shifting more than $47 billion from domestic programs to the Pentagon — which runs counter to a 2011 budget agreement. The restoration of money to the Defense Department would force austere cuts on nondefense programs like foreign aid, transit grants and community development grants sought by local officials.

Monday's measure, along with a legislation coming to the floor later this week funding transportation and housing, are two of the GOP bills absorbing the brunt of the domestic cuts, along with a measure funding labor, health and education programs that will be revealed on Wednesday.

""Simply put, this bill makes very difficult choices in an extremely tough budget environment,"" said author Mike Simpson, R-Idaho. ""Within challenging budget constraints, we've focused on providing adequate funding to fight and prevent wildfires, making sure our national parks stay open, and meeting our trust responsibilities to American Indians.""

The measure also contains a roster of policy ""riders"" aimed at reining in the EPA such as language that would prohibit the agency from regulating greenhouse gas emissions from electric utilities.

The bill is sure to be slapped with a White House veto threat and functions as a placeholder until negotiations this fall."

Marvin Horne of Raisin Valley Farms in Kerman has been breaking the obscure law since 2002 and owes the government 1.2 million pounds of unpaid raisins, which is roughly about the size of his entire harvest for four years, The Washington Post reported.

""I believe in America. And I believe in our Constitution. And I believe that eventually we will be proved right,"" Horne told the newspaper. ""They took our raisins and didn’t pay us for them.""

At the center of the dispute is a law passed by Congress in 1937 aimed at protecting impoverished farmers by controlling supply and demand for dried grapes after the Great Depression.

The law established the Fresno, Calif.-based Raisin Administrative Committee, which is allowed to set prices for raisins by determining how much of the crop will be sold domestically.

The committee is overseen by the Department of Agriculture and is allowed to sell off a portion of raisins it collects from farmers for free, according to The Washington Post. It reportedly generated over $65 million in one recent year.

""The hell with the whole mess,"" Horne told the paper. ""It’s like being a serf.""

Horne handed over part of his crop to the government-controlled raisin ""reserve"" until 2002. He has since embarked on a mission to overturn the specific regulation that he has been defying.

Brian Leighton, the lawyer representing Horne, argued in initial hearing before an administrative officer that the program was ""basically theft"" and violated the Fifth Amendment clause against private property being taken without just compensation, The Post reported.

When Horne's case reached the Supreme Court in June, the justices unanimously ordered a federal appeals court in California to take a new look at claims brought by Horne and his wife, Laura, about the program.

Marvin Horne told The Washington Post that he would likely be liable for about $3 million, including fines and the cash value of raisins, if he loses his case.

""If we lose, we’re bankrupt. We won’t have a pot to piss in,"" Horne told the paper. ""No. I don’t want to even think about it. Would you?""

That is what happened with the birth of the tea party, or rather it was the final punch in thirty years of regression, because the story of rural populism being regressed by the right does not begin in the Midwest but rather in rural manufacturing sections of the country like my hometown of Elmira New York. But the majority of voters who grew up under the new deal era became conservative when they got older so this shift in ideology only spans a lifetime in the majority of people, When people think of the populism in this country, they think of the Midwest and other regions of our country where populism prevailed.

What people fail to realize is that this populism had the certain cultural characteristic that redefined the left and in this modern age the Democratic Party. It is interesting that this populism came not from the Democratic Party but from the populist party among other groups. This might be strange to some but the state that gave FDR his biggest margin or 94% of the vote in 1936 was Mississippi, one of the few senators to oppose the new deal from the left was a southern democrat named Huey Long. It was the Midwest that supported the Socialist party of America during its existence was the Midwest with Wisconsin sending one of the only two socialist into Congress Victor L Berger. This state also sent to the Senate Bob Lafollete A Republican who ran as the Progressive Party candidate in 1912 garnering 12% of the vote. At this moment you might be asking yourself. What does this have to do with the Rebirth of Rural populism? If we analyze the shift of the white working class in this country it started to become increasingly conservative in our spectrum during the 1960s. So this shift has literally happened as the population had gotten older. But this is an anomaly in political ideology, because it was the Senior citizens in the 1930s that were part of the Townsend clubs (A movement created by Dr. Charles Townsend to ensure income for Senior citizens), vestiges of that movement are still alive in the AARP.

I recently had the chance to sit in a political discussion in a cigar shop a traditionally conservative atmosphere, as a progressive I could not really agree with them on social issues such as abortion or gay marriage, but demographics tend to defeat that argument in national circles. But the other part of the argument they can agree with me on is international trade, most rural politics tend to center around factory towns, and this is were we can take a stance on saying we represent the majority of people. Democrats could exploit the argument against free trade, if we did something about it such as renegotiating free trade deals, and this is something Conservatives can be won over on. Especially in states that have heavy industry and manufacturing, and usually this argument tends to be more bipartisan in agreement than message. All politics are populist no matter what side of the spectrum you are on, which is why the tea party was so effective in drawing around the cultural edges of the picture of existence in rural America. It was painting the argument of the ""people"" which the tea party represented or at least argued to represent against the elitist federal government and its special interest such as unions and the evil Planned Parenthood. The reason this argument worked is because it played to cultural attitudes within regions such as the south and midwest that flipped once thought safe democratic seats such as Chairman of the budget committee John Spratt's seat in North Carolina, anti NAFTA Mississippi congressman Gene Taylor among others. It is only an argument of rhetoric that Louisiana only has one democratic congressman even though the majority of their congressional districts are made up of what were considered once solid democrats. Now regionally there are several arguments that are populist in my hometown and the Surrounding Southern tier of Upstate New York its anti fracking, and it seems to have worked pretty well in unseating several Republicans such as Nan Hayworth and Ann Marie Buerkle. Both elected in the tea party wave of 2010. I believe that the anti fracking movement is key to the rebirth of rural populism, because it actually defines the rhetoric of populism perfectly.

If we look at what politicians have made the fracking debate about, it is about the elites against the people and no matter what Republicans say or do. They have defined themselves as taking the side of the elite and this is a view supported by most people in upstate New York even if they are Republican. Now the fact that this debate has cemented itself in Upstate New York as a fight against the elite even with Republicans says alot about the natural gas industry and its political supporters. Often to conservatives it is not the environmental problems but rather the economic ones such as the increase in rent prices and traffic increase. But also there is a different appeal specially with traditionally Republican winery owners within the finger lakes region of the southern tier if fracking comes to this area then the grape industry will be ruined because of lack of water. Now the anti fracking movement has united the people against corporate elite interest just trying to profit from our homes and then leave.

This rural populism is much more cultural and based on the self reliance of a region. There are other successful stories of where populist have won elections Jon Tester in Montana and Joe Manchin in West Virginia won elections in deep red states. The fact that a democrat won as a Senator and not as president in these states shows a big change in cultural attitude to their officials. I guess the label that all politics are local fits perfectly to how Democrats win and can win rural conservative leaning districts. It used to be that both Republicans and Democrats fought against NAFTA and other outsourcing policies. But Republicans tend to just want to play on the cultural attitudes of a rural area to win a congressional seat, which is failing because telling someone that banning gay marriage is somehow going to stop the outsourcing of jobs in America does not add up.

There are also several different demographic changes that will help democrats in places like upstate New York. If we look at demographics while rural areas seem to be emptying there is also a larger immigrant population. Within the 297 most rural counties within the States since 2000 immigrant populations have exceeded 5%. Generations in the future will mark this demographic trend. The outsourcing of jobs also tends to over affect rural America because 12.5% of the workforce in rural America is employed in manufacturing; this is a larger margin than farming. So this gives us progressives a better chance to fight against outsourcing of American jobs and it seems to be taking effect as well. This is why Republican senate candidates and Republican incumbent congressmen tend to lose their seats when it comes to these issues. There is no better example of this than the election of Pete Gallego in Texas kicking out tea party one term congressman Quico Canseco. The district they were fighting over was a majority latino rural district that stretched from the San Antonio suburbs to the Mexican border.

Now the antifracking movement in upstate New York is a temporary one since if we succeed there will not be fracking in New York State. But to keep this coalition alive you have to include people who have always voted Republican their whole lives. These people have already been convinced that Fracking is not a creator of jobs, so to keep this coalition alive people must be convinced that we need to bring manufacturing jobs back to the Southern tier of New York. This is how the populist would survive if fracking is banned. Not to mention that all of these rural areas contain several colleges, which are breeding grounds for activist. Furthermore the cohesiveness of a coalition lies not on its structure but on whether it can be continued by future generations. This can be replicated in several areas of the country which have bene gutted by NAFTA, CAFTA, among other trade agreements. It is isolating the enemy and creating a coalition to bring back jobs, by convincing the people. Fighting for the land rights of a landowner might not seem like a very progressive argument. But in upstate New York landowners who do not want to deal with the natural gas industry end up having to fight legal battles with gas companies. These landowners end up taking a position against fracking based on self-reliance and property respect.

Finally I want to highlight my own Congressional district the 23rd Congressional district in Upstate New York as a prime example of how rural populism can become instrumental in democrats mounting opposition to Republicans. A district that has a 2 to 1 advantage of Republicans to Democrats, the democratic candidate for Congress Nate Shinagawa only lost by 4%, in 2010 the Democratic candidate retired Army Captain Matthew Zeller lost by 7.4% but the difference was the opposition to fracking, as well as several factories shutting down under Congressman Tom Reed's tenure as Congressman even though many of his billboards said "" he was fighting for jobs"". This along with Republicans turning against him on the issue of fracking showed that people can fight the elite at the ballot box. With that being said we were outspent 3 to 1 but still spread the message through grassroots efforts. There is no doubt that rural populism is reborn through the anti fracking movement and the fight against outsourcing jobs. It is also fascinating to watch the people's movements give birth to a new dialogue within rural America. While we may not agree with city liberals on gun rights and some trade deals, we do stand together against Fracking, against outsourcing, in taxing the rich. Rural America has again become a key part to the populist message

Gannett Washington Bureau

Fifth anniversary of pipeline%27s initial application arrives Thursday

Pipeline would carry oil from Canada to the U.S. Gulf Coast

Project must be declared in national interest to win approval

WASHINGTON — Supporters of the Keystone XL pipeline will mark a milestone next week when the project reaches the five-year anniversary of the date its application was first submitted.

As that date nears, lawmakers in Congress are gearing up for a debate over the project, with many planning to increase pressure on President Obama to approve it before the end of the year.

""As President Obama continues to delay, Canadian oil production continues to grow,"" Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., said on the Senate floor Thursday.

Republican Sen. John Hoeven of North Dakota and Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana are pushing a bipartisan resolution declaring the Keystone XL pipeline project in the national interest and calling on Obama to approve it.

The 1,179-mile pipeline would carry oil from Canada's oil sands region to the U.S. Gulf Coast.

""If Congress can find it in the national interest, using the abundance of favorable information that has accumulated over five years on the project, then surely the president can too,"" Hoeven said.

Thune, a co-sponsor, called on fellow senators to support the measure.

""This pipeline is going to create jobs, it's going to boost investment, it's going to reduce our dependence on Venezuelan oil and it's going to strengthen our relationship with our largest trading partner,"" he said. ""Keystone XL pipeline is clearly in our national interest and I would hope that the United States Senate would go on record to that effect.""

A declaration that the pipeline is in the country's national interest is essential for it to be approved. The resolution was offered Thursday as an amendment to an energy bill currently being debated in the Senate.

""As we debate this energy bill that aims to move us toward energy independence, I cannot think of a better way to achieve that goal than by building the Keystone pipeline,"" Landrieu said. ""The time for studying is over. It's time to start building this important pipeline.""

A spokesman for Hoeven's office said the senator was still working with leadership on the timing of a vote. The Senate is expected to resume consideration of the energy bill Monday.

Meanwhile, a House subcommittee is planning a hearing on Thursday, the five-year anniversary of the day Keystone's application was submitted in 2008.

""Each day that goes by without Keystone XL's approval, the American economy and American workers lose,"" said Republican Rep. Lee Terry of Nebraska, chairman of the Commerce, Manufacturing and Trade subcommittee.

Montana Rep. Steve Daines, a Republican, will testify at the hearing. The state's two Democratic senators, Max Baucus and Jon Tester, also are continuing to push for the pipeline, their offices said.

Baucus last month led a group of senators, including Hoeven, Thune and Landrieu, in sending a letter to Obama asking him not to again delay a decision on the pipeline.

""We cannot sit by while excuse after excuse delays jobs in Montana and across the country,"" Baucus said.

The pipeline has become a flashpoint for environmentalists, who argue that transporting such large amounts of oil across the country puts many areas at risk.

Supporters argue that the $5.3 billion project would create 42,000 jobs across the country and generate much-needed tax revenue in several states."

Gee, where could we come up with some of the money need to replace that food stamp funding that was lost this week? Maybe from these people who are all collecting farm subsidies And many, many more

That's a list composed by the Environmental Working Group, using their database of farm subsidy recipients compared to Forbes 400 list of the country's richest people. Between 1995 and 2012, these 50 people—who have have a collective net worth of $316 billion—received $11.3 million in farm subsidy payments. They've probably have even received more in crop insurance payments, but we don't know because the law doesn't allow prohibits the disclosure of the identities of crop insurance policyholders.

While a congressional conference committee meets to decide if they're going to cut $40 billion (House bill) or $10 billion (Senate bill) from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, they are probably going to give billionaires even more!



[P]roposed changes adopted in both the House and Senate versions of the bill will likely allow these billionaires to bank millions more in premium subsidies. Both bills would shift subsidies from programs currently subject to means testing to the more generous crop insurance program. Unlike traditional farm subsidies, crop insurance premium subsidies are not currently subject to means testing, payment limits or conservation requirements. In 2008, Congress created a means test that was designed to deny some subsidies to individuals with annual off-farm income of more than $500,000. The year before, Bloomberg News published a report highlighting some of the billionaires who had been receiving subsidies. But, lawmakers specifically declined to apply it to crop insurance, which has become the primary government support for farm business income.

The system is already skewed for, of course, the largest one percent of farm businesses. They received about $227,000 a year in crop insurance premium support in 2011, according to EWG's analysis from USDA data. Meanwhile, the bottom 80 percent of farmers received only about $5,000 apiece.

There is no reason on earth taxpayers should be subsidizing what are already nothing more than tax write-offs for the nation's wealthiest people. And we particularly should not be subsidizing them when millions are in danger of going hungry because the austerity fetishists in Congress think they're getting too much food."

But a new study shows that Americans are actually driving less. We're seeing a steady shift in how people get around, with more people leaving their keys at home and finding other ways to get around.

""This is an important change,"" said Michael Sivak, who conducted the study at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute. ""This is the first time we've ever seen a drop like this.""

According to the study, driving in the U.S. reached a peak in 2004 and has been declining steadily ever since.

""When you look at the distance-driven rate, we are where we were back in the mid-90s,"" Sivak said.

In 2011, the most recent year for which data are available, the average licensed driver racked up 12,492 miles behind the wheel. That's down 1,221 miles, or 8.9 percent, from the peak seven years earlier.

The fact that the number of miles driven began falling four years before the recession indicates that people changed their driving habits for reasons that go beyond saving money, Sivak said.

Though the recession and slow recovery contributed to people cutting back on driving—or cutting it out altogether—the study pointed to four other reasons we're getting out of cars and trucks.

""The trends in these underlying factors suggests a major societal change with respect to personal transportation,"" Sivak said.

1) Telecommuting and improved telecommunications

More people are working from home or attending meetings via Skype and other new technologies. As telecommunication becomes more sophisticated and reliable, more people are realizing they don't need to hit the road.

2)Increased use of public transportation

More people are taking trains, buses, subways, and ferries. While that's partly because there are more options available, many find that public transit is more economical than owning and maintaining a vehicle.

3)The urbanization boom

More people are moving into or near cities where they have greater access to public transportation for work as well as recreation.

4)The nation is aging, and older people drive less

As more baby boomers retire, fewer members of that generation go to work every day. In addition, studies show that people drive less as they get older.

No license? No problem

Over the last decade, auto executives have been trying to solve a problem few ever thought they would confront. Teens, even young people in their 20s and 30s, have decided they don't want a driver's license, let alone a car.



While that may sound puzzling to the millions who remember the excitement of turning 16 and getting their license, researchers said there has been a fundamental shift in young people's attitudes.

Now, nine years after we reached a peak in miles driven, some wonder if a country defined by the automobile in the last century is on a different road.

The economic implications could be enormous.

What will happen to auto sales in the future? Will gas tax revenue, the primary source of funding to maintain roads and bridges, start to decline? Are government leaders, from the federal to the local level, prepared to spend more money on building and maintaining public transportation?

The name-calling continues in the U.S. Senate.

Louisiana Sen. David Vitter, a Republican, lashed out Monday at Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid via Twitter and called the Democrat ""an idiot"" for his comments comparing Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy last week.

""The people of New Orleans and that area, they were hurt but nothing in comparison to what happened to people in New York and New Jersey,"" Reid said Friday, according to his remarks in the Congressional Record.

The comments came during debate on an initial $9.7 billion emergency relief package to pay for Sandy flood insurance claims.

Vitter tweeted Reid ""gravely insulted"" residents of the Gulf Coast, who were devastated by Katrina's wrath in 2005.

""Katrina and Sandy caused real human misery,"" Vitter tweeted. ""By most measures, Katrina was the worst natural disaster in history.""

A few hours after Vitter's tweet, Reid issued a statement about his comments on disaster relief.

""In my recent comments criticizing House Republicans for threatening to betray Congress' tradition of providing aid to disaster victims in a timely fashion regardless of region, I simply misspoke,"" Reid said. ""I am proud to have been an advocate for disaster victims in the face of Republican foot-dragging, from Hurricane Katrina to Hurricane Sandy, from fires in the West to tornadoes in the Midwest.""

Reid went on to note in his statement that he's worked with Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., on helping people along the Gulf Coast after Katrina and vowed to ""advocate on their behalf until the region is fully recovered.""

Some numbers about Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy:

There were 1,833 deaths in Katrina vs. at least 125 in Sandy. Damage from Sandy in the United States, concentrated largely in New York and New Jersey, is estimated to cost $62 billion. Katrina caused $128 billion in damage, when adjusted for inflation. These numbers come from a combination of government reports and the Associated Press.

The House is expected to consider a second installment of Sandy aid on Jan. 15, with this measure providing about $50 billion."

But myriad other federally funded programs also are threatened, and the combined effect is expected to slow the momentum that California’s economy has been building over the last year.

As the state braces for pain from so-called sequestration, there are warnings of long delays at airport security checkpoints, potential slowdowns in cargo movement at harbors and cutbacks to programs, including meals for seniors and projects to combat neighborhood blight.

Despite the grim scenarios from local and state officials, economists say the cuts’ overall blow to the economy would be modest, felt more acutely in regions such as defense-heavy San Diego and by Californians dependent on federal programs, such as college students who rely on work-study jobs to pay for school.

Critics say the cuts come at an inopportune time because the economic recovery in the U.S. and California is still weak.

“We need stimulus, not premature austerity,” Gov. Jerry Brown said during a break at the National Governors Assn. meeting in Washington.

Rep. John Campbell (R-Irvine) contends that critics of the cuts are exaggerating the effects.

“If we can’t do this, what can we do” to reduce Washington’s red ink, he asked. “We ought to be panicked about the day when people won’t buy our debt anymore because we borrowed too much.”

If automatic spending cuts occur as planned, the growth in the country’s gross domestic product is likely to slow by 0.4 percentage points this year, from about 2% to 1.6%, economists said.

California’s GDP would see a similar slowdown. The state stands to lose as much as $10 billion in federal funding this year, according to Stephen Levy, director of the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy in Palo Alto.

Levy said the more than $1 trillion in cuts planned over the next decade include “items in the federal budget that invest for the future,” such as support for research and clean energy, that particularly affect California because of its “innovation economy.”

The ripple effects the cuts might have on business and consumer confidence — which would further dampen economic activity — remain to be seen, said Jason Sisney, a deputy at the state’s nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office.

“We’re at a point where gains in housing and construction markets have begun to take hold,” Sisney said. “A slowdown from sequestration would come at just the moment that the economy was beginning to right itself.”

Jerry Nickelsburg, a UCLA economist who writes a quarterly economic forecast on the Golden State, said the state’s recent economic gains would provide a buffer against sequestration.

“California can absorb it,” Nickelsburg said. “Will it slow economic growth? The answer is yes. Will it result in negative economic growth? I think the answer is no.”

Los Angeles officials project that the city would lose more than $100 million at a time when they’re struggling to close a hole in the city’s budget.

Douglas Guthrie, chief executive of the Los Angeles city housing authority, said Monday that rent subsidies to as many as 15,000 low-income families would be cut an average $200 a month, forcing many families to search for less expensive housing. His agency also might face as many as 80 layoffs in an already reduced workforce.

But Guthrie said in a letter to the Los Angeles City Council that the housing authority must plan for the “painful consequences” of the federal budget cuts and is preparing to send warning notices to participants in the housing assistance program “as soon as we see that the cuts are made and there are no immediate prospects to resolve the budget crisis.”

At Yosemite National Park, snow plowing of a key route over the Sierra would be delayed, ranger-led programs are likely to be reduced and the park would face “less frequent trash pickup, loss of campground staff, and reduced focus on food storage violations, all of which contribute to visitor safety concerns and increased bear mortality rates,” according to the National Park Service.

Some programs, such as Social Security, would be spared from the $85 billion in cuts nationwide due to kick in Friday. But defense programs are expected to be cut by about 13% for the remainder of the fiscal year and domestic spending by about 9%, according to the White House budget office.

The Obama administration sought Monday to highlight the effects close to home in an effort to step up the pressure on Congress to replace across-the-board cuts with more targeted reductions and new tax revenue collected from taxpayers earning more than $1 million a year.

The Los Angeles Unified School District is bracing for a loss of $37 million a year in federal funding. Supt. John Deasy said Monday that he is sending a letter to the California congressional delegation warning about the “potential very grave impact” of the cuts on Los Angeles schools.

Rachelle Pastor Arizmendi, director of early childhood education at the Pacific Asian Consortium for Employment in Los Angeles, said she anticipated that the cuts would cost her agency $980,000 in federal Head Start funding. That would force PACE to eliminate preschool for about 120 children ages 3 to 5.

“It’s not just a number,” she said. “This is closing down classrooms. This is putting our children behind when they’re going to kindergarten.”

The nonprofit serves about 2,000 children, providing most of them two meals a day in addition to preschool education. The cuts would mean PACE would have to lay off four of its 20 teachers, forcing the closure of eight Head Start classrooms, Arizmendi said.

Friedman'],How to Put America Back Together Again - The New York Times,"UNTIL we fully understand what turned two brothers who allegedly perpetrated the Boston Marathon bombings into murderers, it is hard to make any policy recommendation other than this: We need to redouble our efforts to make America stronger and healthier so it remains a vibrant counterexample to whatever bigoted ideology may have gripped these young men. With all our warts, we have built a unique society — a country where a black man, whose middle name is Hussein, whose grandfather was a Muslim, can run for president and first defeat a woman in his own party and then four years later a Mormon from the opposition, and no one thinks twice about it. With so many societies around the world being torn apart, especially in the Middle East, it is vital that America survives and flourishes as a beacon of pluralism.

Rebuilding our strength has to start with healing our economy. In that regard, it feels as if our budget drama has dragged on for so long that it has not only been drained of all emotional energy but nobody even remembers the plot anymore. It’s worth recalling: What are we trying to do?

We’re trying to put America back on a sustainable growth track that will expand employment, strengthen our fiscal balance sheet to withstand future crises and generate resources to sustain the most needy and propel the next generation. That requires three things: We need to keep investing in the engines of our growth — infrastructure, government-financed research, education, immigration and regulations that incentivize risk-taking but prevent recklessness. We need to reform Social Security and Medicare so they can support all the baby boomers about to retire. And we need to raise more revenues, in the least painful way possible, because we can’t just cut everything. As I’ve said, you can lose weight quickly by cutting off both thumbs, but that will be a problem at work.

It was good to see President Obama put out a budget proposal that addressed all three needs. The attacks on him from the left are unfair because, ultimately, we will need to do all three even more. As Bloomberg News reported on Monday: “Typical wage-earners retiring in 2010 will receive at least $3 for every $1 they contributed to the Medicare health-insurance program, according to an Urban Institute study.” That’s unsustainable. The Republican budget plan, though, would cut so much so fast — including taxes — that it would leave virtually nothing for investing in our growth engines. That’s irresponsible."
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/05/01/park-service-creating-new-monuments-landmarks-despite-sequester-cutbacks/,2013-05-01 00:00:00,[],"Park Service creating new monuments, landmarks despite sequester cutbacks","Two months after the sequester hit, the Department of Interior continues to warn of coast-to-coast cuts for the country's national parks -- and even the partial shutdown of a critical flood warning system.

But Sen. Tom Coburn says there's ""no shortage of potential savings,"" pointing out that the department is nevertheless spending millions on newly created monuments and landmarks.

The Oklahoma Republican, who has been hounding federal agencies for weeks about questionable spending under the cloud of sequester, aired his grievances with the Interior Department in a letter to Secretary Sally Jewell Tuesday.

""It makes little sense to expand the number of sites at the same time the budget of every other park is being cut and visitors are being turned away from visiting the White House,"" Coburn wrote.

Coburn pointedly questioned department efforts to name new sites and expand others -- decisions that will contribute to the department's annual costs. Coburn said the National Park Service has designated 13 new historic landmarks and three new monuments since the sequester hit March 1. One of those landmarks, he noted, is a whiskey distillery -- the George T. Stagg Distillery in Kentucky. Other newly created landmarks include the Connecticut home of abolitionist Harriet Beecher Stowe, the historic bridge crossed by civil rights marchers in Selma, Ala., and an artists' retreat in Saratoga Springs, N.Y.

Coburn also said the NPS is trying to acquire new land elsewhere for existing parks, and urged the department to ""cease"" until normal access to U.S. parks has been restored.

Coburn also questioned whether the department needed to be spending money on drone surveillance of animal populations ranging from sheep in Nevada to pygmy rabbits in Idaho. Coburn cited several population counts that are expected to be conducted later this year.

Despite these expenses, the Associated Press reported in late April that the U.S. Geological Survey -- which is part of the Interior Department -- was preparing to shut down more than 100 gauges that warn about possible flooding or water shortages.

Plus department officials have repeatedly discussed the impact on national parks. NPS Director Jonathan Jarvis testified last month that the sequester would lead to ""delayed road openings, reduced hours of operation for programs and services and fewer programs and patrols.""

In response to Coburn's letter, Interior spokesman Blake Androff said the department cannot move money around so easily.

""Sequestration requires an across-the-board cut to all programs and accounts and does not allow the flexibility to rob Peter to pay Paul,"" he said. ""The Department of the Interior has already taken aggressive steps to reduce spending across the agency and will continue to look for innovative ways to cut costs while preserving our mission essential activities.""

Roughly half the department budget pays staff, which is far more than at other agencies. The department argues that the sequester cuts, then, have a significant impact on services -- seasonal hiring, for instance, had to be drastically cut back, which impacts programs at national parks.

Federal agencies have each responded differently to the sequester. The Federal Aviation Administration rattled lawmakers after it furloughed air traffic controllers, leading to delays at major U.S. airports. Congress, though, intervened by allowing the FAA to move money around, in turn canceling those furloughs.

The private business community also has stepped in. At Yellowstone National Park, two cities stepped up when the National Park Service decided to save money by plowing snow two weeks later than usual. This would have delayed the clearing of four park gates well past the typical May 1 opening, so city officials held a fundraiser and collected enough money to pay the state to clear the roads, ensuring the gates will be open on time.

Coburn cited this as a positive example in his letter, and urged the department to find more savings.

""I believe the Department can continue to maintain this same level access even under sequestration,"" he wrote. ""To accomplish this, the Department must prioritize its core mission, eliminate unnecessary, wasteful, and duplicative programs, and find innovative ways to do more with less."""

So far, Utah, Colorado, South Dakota, Arizona and New York have jumped at the deal. Governors in other states were trying to gauge Friday what would be the bigger economic hit — paying to keep the parks operating or losing the tourist money that flows when the scenic attractions are open. South Dakota and several corporate donors worked out a deal with the National Park Service to reopen Mount Rushmore beginning Monday. Gov. Dennis Daugaard said it will cost $15,200 a day to pay the federal government to run the landmark in the Black Hills.

Arizona officials said a deal reached Friday will mean visitors should be able to return to Grand Canyon National Park on Saturday. In Utah, federal workers rushed to reopen five national parks for 10 days after the state sent $1.67 million to the U.S. government with the hope of saving its lucrative tourist season. Just over 400 national parks, recreation areas and monuments — including such icons as the Grand Canyon and Yosemite — have been closed since Oct. 1 because of the partial government shutdown.

Officials in some states were not happy about paying to have the parks reopened.

In Arizona, Republican Gov. Jan Brewer balked at spending about $112,000 a day for a full reopening of the Grand Canyon. She said a partial reopening would be much cheaper while allowing tourists to visit and businesses to benefit. “The daily cost difference is enormous, especially without assurances that Arizona will be reimbursed,” said Andrew Wilder, a spokesman for Brewer. In the end, Arizona agreed to pay the Park Service $651,000 to keep the Grand Canyon open for seven days. The $93,000 a day is less than the $112,000 the federal government had said was needed to fund park operations each day.

“Wyoming cannot bail out the federal government and we cannot use state money to do the work of the federal government,” Mead spokesman Renny MacKay said.

Well isn't that exactly what conservatives want - private donations to keep unessential things like 'monuments' functioning? Just like we're supposed to rely on charity for our healthcare?Well of course not! It's the Federal Government's job to pick up the tab for running these places, we are just supposed to reap the benefits of the money that pours in from the tourism!Of course Arizona's Jan Brewer is at the head of the line to feed at the trough:Missouri's governor is working on a proposal to reopen its national monuments including the Gateway Arch. Nevada and Washington will not. Wyoming has said it can't afford to 'bail out' the federal government.Good one. Nice to know that the parasitic federal government is actually expected to do something. While blue states are also ponying up to keep their monuments and attractions open, it is well known that red states take more money from the federal government than they put in while the reverse is true of blue states. So it's a bit of an irony that they scream the loudest about intrusion from the nanny state and another bit of schadenfreude when they learn just how much they count on it."

It's not -- and that's why the rest of the developed world uses some variation of single-payer insurance to cover everyone for less than America spends to cover its elderly and poor alone.

Well, here's great proof from the Charlotte Observer that single-payer health insurance is indeed a mainstream -- dare I say conservative -- idea. Republican Hospital Executive Jack Bernard -- from pretty-damn-red Georgia -- expounds:



Single payer would drive down costs because Medicare (or a utility-like private single payer insurer) would have leverage to keep costs down. With no other game in town, providers would be forced to operate more efficiently. Drug companies would be pressured to give Americans the same drug pricing that is found elsewhere. Friedman pointed out that in multiple state studies (independently done by several groups), single payer turns out to save money. In his own studies, he has shown savings of around 20 percent for North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts, and even more in Colorado and Maryland. According to Friedman, a national single payer system would produce enormous savings, $18.7 billion per year. Surely, at a time when wage earners are being faced with ever increasing premiums and higher deductibles, we should at least consider Medicare for all or a similar single payer system. The real question is whether either party is willing to stand up to the drug and insurance lobbies and do what is best for America.

Friedman pointed out that the most basic financial problem with U.S. health care is the for-profit insurance system. Insurance company profits have increased 250 percent in the last decade, Friedman said. The head of Cigna made a whopping $29 million in 2009 while health care premiums and increased deductibles are eating up more and more of workers’ wages. He further pointed out that the administrative cost of health care insurance is one of the major drivers of escalating health care costs from 1980 to 2005. According to Friedman, the administrative cost of private insurance will be $200 billion in 2013. In the U.S. billing costs run $83,975 per doctor per year versus only $22,205 in Ontario.

Well, there you have it -- common sense...from a Republican hospital executive. Hell has not frozen over, because this is simply a smart man stating inarguable facts. You know, like pointing out that paying health insurance CEOs multi-million dollar salaries for doing nothing of value is bad for health care:Single-payer health care is not socialist-communist-pinko-unicorn policy from the Left. It is a reasonable, middle-of-the-road approach to health care that is vastly more 'conservative' than a fully-socialized system (i.e. the NHS or America's VA).

Wouldn't it be tragic for our Democratic Party if it took a conservative third party to finally make it a reality..."

Why did so many Republicans vote in defiance of their speaker on such a critical bill? Well, the legislation cut $20.5 billion from the food stamp program over the next 10 years, five times more than the cuts approved in the Senate farm bill. That provision had drawn a veto promise from President Obama and ensured strong Democratic opposition. But you see, most of those 62 Republicans voted no because in their minds, those cuts weren't nearly deep enough. In fact, they refuse to vote in favor of the bill until the food-stamp program is taken out of the farm bill altogether, so they can more easily cut the program into confetti. That's why groups such as the Club for Growth and the Heritage Foundation were celebrating the bill's defeat as a major victory. [...] That's interesting in its own right, but it also tells us something about the future of the immigration bill in the House. House leadership crafted a farm bill that they believed was conservative enough to pass with Republicans and a relative handful of farm-state Democrats behind it. But more than 60 Republicans still said nope, that sorry piece of RINO legislation isn't even close to conservative enough. The result? No farm bill, a humiliated speaker, and a House of Representatives unable to perform duties that for most of our nation's history have been pretty routine. Given that performance, what are the odds that Boehner will be able to pull together a majority of the GOP caucus -- that's 118 Republicans -- plus 100 Democrats to pass a far more controversial and high-profile immigration bill?

[E]conomies do change over time, and sometimes in fundamental ways. So what’s really different about America in the 21st century? The most significant answer, I’d suggest, is the growing importance of monopoly rents: profits that don’t represent returns on investment, but instead reflect the value of market dominance. Sometimes that dominance seems deserved, sometimes not; but, either way, the growing importance of rents is producing a new disconnect between profits and production and may be a factor prolonging the slump.[...] You might suspect that this can’t be good for the broader economy, and you’d be right. If household income and hence household spending is held down because labor gets an ever-smaller share of national income, while corporations, despite soaring profits, have little incentive to invest, you have a recipe for persistently depressed demand. I don’t think this is the only reason our recovery has been so weak — weak recoveries are normal after financial crises — but it’s probably a contributory factor.

These might be as sweeping as planning out sources of water for the West — including desalination plants and more recycling and required efficiency in water use — or as specific as a community identifying cooled buildings where the elderly and other fragile people can go during prolonged hot spells and providing transportation to get them there. It might also include planning for crop losses and other flood-related damage in the Northeast, where precipitation has increased 67% over the past 50 years, or building levees and drainage. Expensive? Very. But the price of doing nothing would be far greater. And that's worth remembering when President Obama releases his expected proposal for reducing the carbon footprint, which will almost surely include new restrictions for coal-burning plants, the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases. Adjusting to climate change will require clear thinking and significant investment, but if the nation sticks its collective head in the sand, it will find that sand covered by rising seas.

I’m a pro-pipeline senator. As a former mayor of Richmond, a city with a gas utility, I think it makes no sense to be anti-pipeline. But I oppose the Keystone XL project. Although the president’s decision is technically over whether to allow a pipeline to deliver oil from Alberta to the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, the real issue isn’t the pipeline. It’s the wisdom of using tar sands oil. By most accounts, oil from tar sands is 15 to 20 percent dirtier than conventional petroleum, and the process of extracting and refining it is more difficult and resource-intensive. With so many cleaner alternatives, there is no reason to embrace the use of a dirtier fuel source.Approving the pipeline would send a clear signal to the markets to expand the development of tar sands oil. Such an expansion would hurt our nation’s work to reduce carbon emissions. We have to make energy cleaner tomorrow than it is today. That’s why the president should block Keystone.

But Obama’s choice of venue for his remarks of a manufacturing company that makes mining and pumping equipment provided fodder for Republicans. They pointed out that its president had just the day before testified on Capitol Hill in support of the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, which the Obama administration has delayed for years.

Ellicott Dredges President Peter Bowe says the pipeline, designed to transport crude from oil sands deposits in Alberta, Canada, to the refineries on the U.S. Gulf Coast, would pour money into his business.

“For us, it’s all about jobs,” Bowe told members of the House Committee on Small Business on Thursday. The project will generate jobs “every year for decades to come, all related to the production of oil from the Alberta oil sands deposits,” he said.

Obama has spent days trying to manage a rare convergence of controversial stories. He has described how his administration handled the deadly attacks on the diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya; responded to the IRS’ targeting of conservative groups; and defended the Department of Justice’s digging into the phone records of journalists.

The plan for Friday had been to begin turning the conversation back to jobs, according to veteran Democratic strategists who advised the White House this week.

“They know that’s what people care about,” said one, who requested anonymity to talk about the private discussions. The White House also believes the economy trumps all other subjects, even the current controversies, for most Americans.

Although there was no sign that Bowe brought up the subject as he showed Obama around the manufacturing shop, the choice of venue put some of the spotlight on the Keystone XL pipeline after Republicans circulated a transcript of Bowe’s testimony.

Obama in his remarks alluded to lengthy delays the government often imposes on major projects, without referring to Keystone specifically.

“One of the problems we’ve had in the past is that sometimes it takes too long to get projects off the ground,” Obama said. “There are all these permits and red tape and planning and this and that, and some of it’s important to do, but we could do it faster.”

Obama said that he recently ordered accelerated permitting for 50 big projects across the country, including work on the Tappan Zee Bridge in New York and the Port of Charleston in South Carolina.

“We’ve been able to, in some cases, cut approval times from seven years down to a year,” Obama said, to loud applause from the crowd at the Baltimore plant. “Today I’m directing agencies across the government to do what it takes to cut timelines for breaking ground on major infrastructure projects in half.”

Back in Washington, Republicans scoffed.

“Catching grief for your Keystone delays? Don’t worry, we have just the answer,” said Don Stewart, spokesman for Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). “Expedite something. It hasn’t worked before, but maybe the press will buy it this time.”

Jerry Brown’s administration, which appears not fully sold on the potential.

The roughly 1,700 square-mile Monterey Shale, from the state’s central coast to its San Joaquin Valley, holds roughly 60 percent of the country’s estimated shale oil reserves, potentially making California the country’s top oil producer and revving up its economy like a smaller shale-oil deposit did for North Dakota.

California’s economy has been showing signs of improvement after a downward slide for years – in part the result of myriad regulations, multi-billion dollar budget deficits, high unemployment and now Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown’s income-tax hike on the state’s highest earners that has some vowing to leave.

“The Monterey Shale could be a boon to the economy, but there’s heavy emphasis on the word ‘could,’ ” said Jason Marshall, chief deputy director for the state’s Department of Conservation.

Geoffrey Styles, energy consultant, recently wrote in the online forum The Energy Collective that drilling the formation “could slash California's imports while adding billions of dollars a year to the local economy and to the shaky state budget, along with lots of good jobs.”

Oil production in the region is still largely in the speculation or developmental phases. Oil companies purportedly have been working the region’s complex structure since the early 1990s, but only recently have new technologies made large-scale extractions economically possible.

Environmentalists are primarily opposed to the companies having to tap the estimated 15. 4 billion barrels in the Monterey Shale by deep, horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, which has helped drive the country’s recent shale oil and gas boom but also raised environmental worries.

They also argue such techniques will be especially tricky in that region, considering its complex geological formation, created in part by the San Andreas fault.

“There are some really serious concerns for California,” said Kassie Siegel, a lawyer for the Center for Biological Diversity.

She said two of the group’s biggest worries are the potential to trigger an earthquake and water contamination, consider that fracking includes injecting a mix of water, sand and chemicals into rock to release oil or natural gas.

She said fracking uses millions of gallons of water in a state “starved for water” and the latest methods use “slick water” that includes hundreds of potential harmful chemicals.

“There are many, many aspects to the water issue,” Siegel said. “And California is a very seismically active area.”

Oil companies have engaged in fracking in California for decades without heavy monitoring by state regulators. But that situation appears to be swiftly changing with the state releasing a draft of fracking rules in December with plans to have a complete set of regulations within the year, Marshall told FoxNews.com.

He also acknowledged the importance of oil in the state economy, pointing out that California in 2011 produced nearly 197 million barrels. But he also expressed Brown administration concerns similar to those of the environmentalists -- protecting state resources and whether fracking will work in the already-fractured formation.

“It may take (more) advancement in technology or methodology to unlock the oil-production potential of the formation,” Marshall said.

To be sure, California already has a long, boom-to-bust history with oil that started in 1865 with a discovery east of San Francisco and includes the great boom of 1894 around Los Angeles.

Though the state is still the country’s fourth-largest oil producer -- behind Texas, North Dakota and Alaska -- production has declined since roughly the mid-1980s.

Occidental Petroleum and Venoco are already working the Monterey Shale region with Hess Corp. purportedly among the other major oil companies making a foray – amid a real estate boom and middlemen snapping up leases for acres held by the Bureau of Land Management.

“We’ve seen a significant increase in the last three to five years in the price paid from our sales,” said Gabriel Garcia, a field manager at the agency’s Bakersfield office, recently told The New York Times. “Some of that has to do with speculation on new technologies, and some of that has to do with the high price of oil.”"

Fifth anniversary of pipeline%27s initial application arrives Thursday

Pipeline would carry oil from Canada to the U.S. Gulf Coast

Project must be declared in national interest to win approval

WASHINGTON — Supporters of the Keystone XL pipeline will mark a milestone next week when the project reaches the five-year anniversary of the date its application was first submitted.

As that date nears, lawmakers in Congress are gearing up for a debate over the project, with many planning to increase pressure on President Obama to approve it before the end of the year.

""As President Obama continues to delay, Canadian oil production continues to grow,"" Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., said on the Senate floor Thursday.

Republican Sen. John Hoeven of North Dakota and Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana are pushing a bipartisan resolution declaring the Keystone XL pipeline project in the national interest and calling on Obama to approve it.

The 1,179-mile pipeline would carry oil from Canada's oil sands region to the U.S. Gulf Coast.

""If Congress can find it in the national interest, using the abundance of favorable information that has accumulated over five years on the project, then surely the president can too,"" Hoeven said.

Thune, a co-sponsor, called on fellow senators to support the measure.

""This pipeline is going to create jobs, it's going to boost investment, it's going to reduce our dependence on Venezuelan oil and it's going to strengthen our relationship with our largest trading partner,"" he said. ""Keystone XL pipeline is clearly in our national interest and I would hope that the United States Senate would go on record to that effect.""

A declaration that the pipeline is in the country's national interest is essential for it to be approved. The resolution was offered Thursday as an amendment to an energy bill currently being debated in the Senate.

""As we debate this energy bill that aims to move us toward energy independence, I cannot think of a better way to achieve that goal than by building the Keystone pipeline,"" Landrieu said. ""The time for studying is over. It's time to start building this important pipeline.""

A spokesman for Hoeven's office said the senator was still working with leadership on the timing of a vote. The Senate is expected to resume consideration of the energy bill Monday.

Meanwhile, a House subcommittee is planning a hearing on Thursday, the five-year anniversary of the day Keystone's application was submitted in 2008.

""Each day that goes by without Keystone XL's approval, the American economy and American workers lose,"" said Republican Rep. Lee Terry of Nebraska, chairman of the Commerce, Manufacturing and Trade subcommittee.

Montana Rep. Steve Daines, a Republican, will testify at the hearing. The state's two Democratic senators, Max Baucus and Jon Tester, also are continuing to push for the pipeline, their offices said.

Baucus last month led a group of senators, including Hoeven, Thune and Landrieu, in sending a letter to Obama asking him not to again delay a decision on the pipeline.

""We cannot sit by while excuse after excuse delays jobs in Montana and across the country,"" Baucus said.

The pipeline has become a flashpoint for environmentalists, who argue that transporting such large amounts of oil across the country puts many areas at risk.

Supporters argue that the $5.3 billion project would create 42,000 jobs across the country and generate much-needed tax revenue in several states."

(CNN) - President Barack Obama explained why, amid a series of executive branch controversies, his renewed focus on the economy matters: it's not only about financial stability, but about equal opportunity.

The message he sees as ""jobs and justice"" from the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s March on Washington 50 years ago still rings true, Obama told The New York Times in an interview published Saturday evening.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

To the many Americans who today are uncertain about their future, the 1963 march taught valuable lessons on racial equality and opportunities for ""working folks,"" he argued.

The remarks, days after the president spoke on race and the Trayvon Martin case, came while he was on a campaign-style economic tour.

""Racial tensions won't get better; they may get worse, because people will feel as if they've got to compete with some other group to get scraps from a shrinking pot"" if individuals do not see a stable fiscal future, Obama said.

""If the economy is growing, everybody feels invested. Everybody feels as if we're rolling in the same direction,"" he continued.

Obama's midweek schedule looked familiar to watchers of his 2012 campaign and first White House term, when he favored speaking to crowds at colleges and businesses around the nation over Washington venues when advocating his economic priorities.

After visiting universities in Illinois and Missouri and speaking on the importance of education to the economy, he flew to the port in Jacksonville, Florida, where he called for investment in infrastructure. On Monday, he will speak at a Tennessee shipping center about manufacturing, jobs, and economic growth; then on Wednesday, he will travel to Capitol Hill to meet with Democrats in the House and Senate.

He cast aside the questions about such issues as the National Security Agency leaks, Internal Revenue Service political scrutiny and U.S. handling of the Benghazi, Libya, attack last September. ""With an endless parade of distractions, political posturing and phony scandals, Washington has taken its eye off the ball,"" he said, although he was not specific about which controversies he was referring to.

The White House plans to continue the economic push into the fall.

In the same time frame, he is also expected to make perhaps the most important economic decision of his second term: naming a new individual to chair the Federal Reserve. Ben Bernanke's term as chairman is set to expire in January.

Obama told the Times he wanted someone who would go beyond tracking inflation and focus on market stability.

""The idea is to promote those things in service of the lives of ordinary Americans getting better,"" he said. ""I want a Fed chairman that can step back and look at that objectively and say, Let's make sure that we're growing the economy.""

He disputed Republicans' claims about job creation should the controversial Keystone pipeline from Canada to the Gulf Coast be constructed. The 2,000 temporary construction jobs he predicted - far less than the 20,000 some Republicans have said to expect - would be a ""a blip relative to the need"" for job creation.

He suggested that concerns over the pipeline's environmental impact could be addressed to his satisfaction because ""there is no doubt that Canada at the source in those tar sands could potentially be doing more to mitigate carbon release.""

In the interview, the president acknowledged that people are ""anxious"" and ""frustrated"" about their own financial future even while the economy overall improves.

Some do not see the potential for upward mobility, which he called ""part and parcel of who we were as Americans.""

It predates the fiscal crises of the last decade, he said, and despite the bloated national debt, the federal government's austerity measures have hurt the government's ability to effect change in diverse areas such as climate change and immigration.

""I want to make sure that all of us in Washington are investing as much time, as much energy, as much debate on how we grow the economy and grow the middle class as we've spent over the last two to three years arguing about how we reduce the deficits,"" he said, blasting what he called ""a damaging framework in Washington.""

And he issued a stern warning to Capitol Hill Republicans: ""I'm not just going to sit back if the only message from some of these folks is no on everything, and sit around and twiddle my thumbs for the next 1,200 days.""

A series of polls this month have shown Obama's approval rating is below the 50% mark. But his scores - in the mid- and upper-40s - rank well above those of Congress, which came in at 21% and 12% approval in two surveys conducted about a week ago."

Obama: The fall

By Charles Krauthammer,

Fate is fickle, power cyclical, and nothing is new under the sun. Especially in Washington, where after every election the losing party is sagely instructed to confess sin, rend garments and rethink its principles lest it go the way of the Whigs. And where the victor is hailed as the new Caesar, facing an open road to domination.

And where Barack Obama, already naturally inclined to believe his own loftiness, graciously accepted the kingly crown and proceeded to ride his reelection success to a crushing victory over the GOP at the fiscal cliff, leaving a humiliated John Boehner & Co. with nothing but naked tax hikes.

Thus emboldened, Obama turned his inaugural and State of the Union addresses into a left-wing dream factory, from his declaration of war on global warming (on a planet where temperatures are the same as 16 years ago and in a country whose CO2 emissions are at a 20-year low) to the invention of new entitlements — e.g., universal preschool for 5-year-olds— for a country already drowning in debt.

To realize his dreams, Obama sought to fracture and neutralize the congressional GOP as a prelude to reclaiming the House in 2014. This would enable him to fully enact his agenda in the final two years of his presidency, usually a time of lame-duck paralysis. Hail the Obama juggernaut.

Well, that story — excuse me, narrative — lasted exactly six months. The Big Mo is gone.

It began with the sequester. Obama never believed the Republicans would call his bluff and let it go into effect. They did.

Taken by surprise, Obama cried wolf, predicting the end of everything we hold dear if the sequester was not stopped. It wasn’t. Nothing happened.

Highly embarrassed, and determined to indeed make (bad) things happen, the White House refused Republican offers to give it more discretion in making cuts. Bureaucrats were instructed to inflict maximum pain from minimal cuts, as revealed by one memo from the Agriculture Department demanding agency cuts that the public would feel.

Things began with the near-comical cancellation of White House tours and ended with not-so-comical airline delays. Obama thought furious passengers would blame the GOP. But isn’t the executive branch in charge of these agencies? Who thinks that a government spending $3.6 trillion a year can’t cut 2 percent without furloughing air-traffic controllers?

Looking not just incompetent at managing budgets but cynical for deliberately injuring the public welfare, the administration relented. Congress quickly passed a bill giving Obama reallocation authority to restore air traffic control. Having previously threatened to veto any such bill, Obama caved. He signed.

Not exactly Appomattox, but coming immediately after Obama’s spectacular defeat on gun control, it marked an administration that had lost its “juice,” to paraphrase a charming question at the president’s Tuesday news conference.

For Obama, gun control was a political disaster. He invested capital. He went on a multi-city tour. He paraded grieving relatives. And got nothing. An assault-weapons ban — a similar measure had passed the Congress 20 years ago — lost 60 to 40in a Senate where Democrats control 55 seats. Obama failed even to get mere background checks.

All this while appearing passive, if not helpless, on the world stage. On Syria, Obama is nervously trying to erase the WMD red line he had so publicly established. On Benghazi, he stonewalled accusations that State Department officials wishing to testify are being blocked.

He is even taking heat for the Boston bombings. Every day brings another revelation of signals missed beforehand. And his post-bombing pledge to hunt down those responsible was mocked by the scandalous Mirandizing of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, gratuitously shutting down information from the one person who knows more than anyone about possible still-existent explosives, associates, trainers, future plans, etc.

Now, the screw will undoubtedly turn again. If immigration reform passes, Obama will be hailed as the comeback kid, and a new “Obama rising” narrative proclaimed.

This will overlook the fact that immigration reform has little to do with Obama and everything to do with GOP panic about the Hispanic vote. In fact, Obama has been asked by congressional negotiators to stay away, so polarizing a figure has he become.

Nonetheless, whatever happens, the screw will surely turn again, if only because of media boredom. But that’s the one constant of Washington political life: There are no straight-line graphs. We live from inflection point to inflection point.

And we’ve just experienced one. From king of the world to dead in the water in six months. Quite a ride.

But what’s happening with the giant Millennium Hollywood project is much more unusual: In this case, a state agency is taking up the cudgel against the city of Los Angeles, accusing city officials of using bogus statistics and trampling over state law in an effort to push the project through to approval by the City Council.

Advertisement

The state agency is the California Department of Transportation. Caltrans is responsible for the health and welfare of the 101 Freeway, which winds within a block or two around the Millennium site.

The agency says, quite reasonably, that a $664-million project — comprising 461 residential units, 254 hotel rooms, more than a quarter-million square feet for office space, and 80,000 square feet of retail in two towers looming over the landmark Capitol Records building close to the already-busy corner of Hollywood and Vine — can’t help but have a marked effect on the freeway. In fact, Caltrans makes it plenty clear that without significant changes in the plan, the effect on the 101 could be disastrous.

Caltrans is irked that city officials seem to have wholly ignored its concerns. In a May 7 letter to Councilman Eric Garcetti, whose district encompasses the Millennium site — and who is a critic of the project and is the mayor-elect — the agency said that it hadn’t heard from city officials since Feb. 19, when it listed a raft of misgivings about the Millennium. The City Council’s vote, which was originally scheduled for Wednesday, is likely to be put off until July.

There are two bottom lines in the Caltrans analysis: one, the potential impacts from this mega-project will make the freeway and surrounding streets more unsafe; and two, the failure to measure and properly mitigate these impacts violates the California Environmental Quality Act, or CEQA.

Advertisement

The latter conclusion shouldn’t be overlooked. CEQA has long been a whipping boy for real estate developers, who gripe that it serves only as a tool for anti-growth malcontents.

But if the City Council gives the Millennium a green light despite the unanswered questions about it, CEQA will be the only leverage the community will have to minimize its deleterious impacts. “Without CEQA compliance, this would be a big giveaway,” says Robert P. Silverstein, a land-use lawyer representing more than 40 community and neighborhood groups opposing the project.

The battle already is shaping up along David versus Goliath lines. Millennium Partners is the epitome of big-money real estate development, the backer of billions of dollars in luxury developments in New York, Boston, Washington and San Francisco. Its Hollywood plan, featuring two towers of which one could be as tall as 585 feet, or 55 stories, aims to take advantage of city zoning changes that encourage high-density development near Metro stations, such as the stop at Hollywood and Vine.

Millennium’s style is to gravitate toward high-profile but down-at-the-heels urban centers and spiff them up — creating “luxurious residential environments surrounded by beautiful places to work, shop, exercise and be entertained,” it says with all due modesty. “All of our projects altered the skyline,” Millennium co-founder Philip Aarons remarked in a recent interview with the Bloomberg news service.

Advertisement

That’s always nice, especially if you’re the one doing the altering. But the people who live and work under the existing skyline don’t always perceive the gain. One of the criticisms heard about the Millennium Hollywood is that the towers, which will be the tallest buildings in Hollywood, will dominate, rather than complement, the low-rise neighborhoods around them and the Capitol building, which Millennium owns and will incorporate into the project.

Millennium does have the current city administration’s favor. City Hall insiders say Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa has pressed for rapid approval, perhaps because he sees the Millennium as some sort of legacy. But the unresolved questions about traffic suggest that the whole scheme may need a better going-over than it has received.

Advertisement

That’s not the view of the developers. “This will be the most highly regulated project ever approved by the city,” declares Jerold B. Neuman, the project’s Los Angeles land-use attorney.

Neuman says the disagreement between Caltrans and the city involves a broader fight between them over how to set standards for reviewing environmental issues with local and state impacts. “We’re stuck in the cross hairs,” he told me.

Advertisement

Still, it’s hard to argue that Caltrans is out of line in questioning the city’s assertion that this huge project would feed no more than 150 cars a day onto the 101 during peak hours. That’s the threshold figure the city used to justify its conclusion that the Millennium would have “a less than significant impact ... on freeway segments” — and therefore “no mitigation is required.”

From Caltrans’ point of view, that stretches plausibility to the breaking point. (Even if it were true, Caltrans says, the 101 is so jammed now that 150 more rush-hour cars is significant enough. Would anyone who drives the Hollywood Freeway disagree?) Caltrans says the city’s estimate “is not based on any credible analysis that could be found anywhere” in the environmental impact report. And it points out that more overload on the 101 means more backups from on-ramps onto city streets, more cars spewing exhaust into residential neighborhoods, more potential vehicle/pedestrian encounters (and we know who always wins those).

Advertisement

Caltrans says the city didn’t bother to study the freeway segments where there would be the most impact, including the six on- and off-ramps closest to the Millennium site. When it did study traffic impacts, Caltrans adds, it used faulty formulas, including giving the developer too much credit for mitigation efforts such as bikeshare and carpooling.

Tomas Carranza, a senior transportation engineer at the city Department of Transportation, told me that the developers will put in place a “really aggressive trip reduction program” exploiting the city’s transit system and incentives to encourage residents, workers and visitors to leave their cars at home. But he also acknowledges that “there will be more traffic, and there will be unmitigated impacts” from the Millennium.

The council’s vote, when it comes, will amount to a judgment that the upside of building the Millennium will outweigh the inevitable downsides. Can we trust the evidence they’ll be relying on? Caltrans says no.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/26/climate-change-jobs_n_3505254.html,2013-06-26 00:00:00,"['Senior Editor For Projects', 'Investigations', 'The Huffington Post']","Obama Climate Change Proposals Won't Be Job-Killers, Experts Say","Even before President Barack Obama unveiled his sweeping climate change plan on Tuesday, Republican leaders were denouncing the effort as a job-killer. Any move to restrict polluting carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, they maintained, would send energy costs up and lead to mass layoffs in a vital job sector.

At a press conference last Thursday, House Majority Leader John Boehner (R-Ohio) blasted the expected proposal as “absolutely crazy.”

“Why would you want to increase the cost of energy and kill more American jobs at a time when the American people are still asking where are the jobs?” he asked.

But experts who have studied the intersection of environmental policy and the job market say there's little truth to this claim, if any.

Such assertions are ""wildly overstated,"" said Richard Revesz, the director of the Institute for Policy Integrity at New York University. He framed Boehner's remark as the latest iteration of a “job-killer meme” that has surfaced frequently in recent years as Republicans have sought to drum up fears about Obama’s environmental efforts.

“We hear often that large swaths of the economy will be wiped out due to one regulation or another,” Revesz said. “Fortunately, and not surprisingly, we don't see those predictions coming true.”

In a comprehensive 2012 review of more than 25 studies that attempted to gauge the effect of environmental regulations on jobs, a team of researchers led by Revesz found that many claims about such regulations were unreliable.

While studies commissioned by the coal industry warned that millions of jobs could be lost, others conducted by left-leaning think tanks and environmental groups predicted that millions of jobs would be gained, their survey found.

By contrast, the most detailed studies concluded that job losses and gains from environmental regulations essentially balanced out. ""When serious studies have been done, the impacts tend to be small -- sometimes positive, sometimes negative, but small,"" Revesz said.

Obama said Tuesday that he would use his executive powers to place limits on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants. The plan is the most ambitious effort by a U.S. president to address climate change to date and includes $8 billion in loan guarantees for clean energy projects, such as efforts to trap and store carbon dioxide emitted by coal-burning power plants.

One company that stands to benefit from the plan is Neumann Systems Group, based in Colorado Springs, Colo. The company recently won a $73.5 million contract to apply its liquid-based emissions scrubbing technology to a local power plant that is under construction. Todd Tiahrt, Neumann's CEO, said the technology could also be used to retrofit older plants at a cost of about $150 million for an average-sized facility.

Tiahrt said he expected Obama's proposal would spur growth in his field, and that in five years his operation could employ 500 engineers. But he also worried that new regulations would single out coal plants for closure, even though they are hardly the only carbon polluters.

""My initial reaction is this amounts to an unfair segregation of the coal industry,"" he said.

Coal plants are still proliferating across the world, Tiahrt said, and any initiative to curb their use in the United States would also inhibit the growth of businesses like his that are developing methods to make coal clean.

Perhaps sensing this paradox, Democrats seem to be pulling back on their attempts to directly counter Republicans' jobs fears and portray climate regulations as boons to the job market.

The policy paper that accompanied Obama's announcement mentions potential job growth stemming from the proposed measures six separate times, but it avoids any specifics, such as what types of jobs might be created and in which industries.

Indeed, the only specific job-growth number in the report refers to an ""estimated"" 17,000 jobs created at 50 solar and wind farms and geothermal plants approved by the Department of Energy since 2009.

This reluctance to be predictive could be a sign the administration wants to bury a boast Obama made while on the campaign trail in 2008. If elected president, he pledged, he would invest in green-energy technology that would yield 5 million jobs.

The best opportunity at realizing that goal came in 2009, when the massive stimulus approved by Congress provided $90 billion in loans, tax credits and other measures for increasing clean energy production and bolstering public transit.

Even the most vocal supporters of the stimulus acknowledge that the investment didn't create many jobs. Robert Pollin, a former Energy Department official who was tasked with tabulating jobs stemming from the stimulus, said his ""best guess"" is that 240,000 green jobs were created from 2009 to 2011.

But while those green-energy efforts may not have boosted the job market, they weren't job-killers either, Revesz noted. And all things considered, he said, Obama's newly proposed climate rules are likely to do more good than harm.

""With the health benfits and environmental benefits are strong as they are, it's really clear to us that we as a nation are better off with these regulations,"" he said."

Rick Scott (R-FL) on Tuesday vetoed a bill that would have required Florida hand out driver’s licenses to illegal immigrants, a sign he is taking a stand against the left in favor of conservatism.

“Florida is home to immigrants of many nationalities, who add to the cultural fabric of our great state, and whose productivity and hard work have contributed to our economic turnaround,” Scott said in his official letter to Florida Secretary of State Kenneth Detzner announcing the veto. “Still, our nation struggles with immigration issues every day, as Americans seek to reconcile the fact that at one point our families were immigrants who came, as many do today, to work and live the American dream with the fact that the federal government has failed at enforcing the nation’s laws on this topic.”

Scott went on to detail the inconsistencies of immigration policy coming out of Janet Napolitano’s Department of Homeland Security and President Barack Obama’s administration at large.

“Despite the federal government’s inability to enforce the nation’s current immigration laws or to find common ground on how to change them, the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced in a June 2012 memo the immediate establishment of a ‘Deferred Action Process for Childhood Arrivals,'” Scott wrote. “Through this process DHS provides that a young person illegally brought to the United States as a child will not be subject to removal if the individual meets certain criteria.”

“Qualifying for deferred action status does not confer substantive rights or lawful status upon an individual; it does not create a pathway to a green card or citizenship; nor does it extend to any family members of the person granted the status either,” he explained. “Deferred action status is simply a policy of the Obama Administration, absent Congressional direction, designed to dictate removal action decisions using DHS agency discretion. It was never passed by Congress, nor is it a promulgated rule.”

The institutional left and Florida Democrats are furious that Scott would make such a move. Democrat state Sen. Darren Soto called Scott’s veto an “anti-Hispanic bomb.”

“Make no mistake about it: This will be an anti-Hispanic bomb if he vetoes this bill,” Soto, a sponsor of the legislation, said before Scott officially vetoed the bill according to the National Journal. “The vast majority of my peers understand we need to encourage immigrants to become working members of our society. It makes no sense that the Scott administration would veto something it’s already doing.”

The Florida House Democrat who also sponsored the bill, Rep. Randolph Bracy, tried to argue Scott’s veto foils plans to move the national Republican party as a whole toward amnesty. “I thought the party was moving in that direction and was behind this bill, and then the governor just comes out of nowhere and does this,” Bracy said according to National Journal. “Republicans have been talking as a party about Hispanic outreach, and this was only a small step.”"

Friedman'],How to Put America Back Together Again - The New York Times,"UNTIL we fully understand what turned two brothers who allegedly perpetrated the Boston Marathon bombings into murderers, it is hard to make any policy recommendation other than this: We need to redouble our efforts to make America stronger and healthier so it remains a vibrant counterexample to whatever bigoted ideology may have gripped these young men. With all our warts, we have built a unique society — a country where a black man, whose middle name is Hussein, whose grandfather was a Muslim, can run for president and first defeat a woman in his own party and then four years later a Mormon from the opposition, and no one thinks twice about it. With so many societies around the world being torn apart, especially in the Middle East, it is vital that America survives and flourishes as a beacon of pluralism.

Rebuilding our strength has to start with healing our economy. In that regard, it feels as if our budget drama has dragged on for so long that it has not only been drained of all emotional energy but nobody even remembers the plot anymore. It’s worth recalling: What are we trying to do?

We’re trying to put America back on a sustainable growth track that will expand employment, strengthen our fiscal balance sheet to withstand future crises and generate resources to sustain the most needy and propel the next generation. That requires three things: We need to keep investing in the engines of our growth — infrastructure, government-financed research, education, immigration and regulations that incentivize risk-taking but prevent recklessness. We need to reform Social Security and Medicare so they can support all the baby boomers about to retire. And we need to raise more revenues, in the least painful way possible, because we can’t just cut everything. As I’ve said, you can lose weight quickly by cutting off both thumbs, but that will be a problem at work.

It was good to see President Obama put out a budget proposal that addressed all three needs. The attacks on him from the left are unfair because, ultimately, we will need to do all three even more. As Bloomberg News reported on Monday: “Typical wage-earners retiring in 2010 will receive at least $3 for every $1 they contributed to the Medicare health-insurance program, according to an Urban Institute study.” That’s unsustainable. The Republican budget plan, though, would cut so much so fast — including taxes — that it would leave virtually nothing for investing in our growth engines. That’s irresponsible."

Now, catfish is at the heart of a dispute as the House and Senate prepare to work out their differences on a new five-year farm bill. The current bill expires on Sept. 30.

At issue is a little-known provision in the 2008 bill that established an office within the Agriculture Department to inspect catfish. But those inspection programs also exist at the Food and Drug Administration and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration at the Commerce Department.

The Agriculture Department has traditionally inspected meat and poultry while the F.D.A. has inspected all other foods, including seafood.

Since 2009 the Agriculture Department said that it has spent $20 million to set up the catfish inspection office, which has a staff of four. The department said that it expects to spend about $14 million a year to run it. The F.D.A. spends about $700,000 a year on its existing office."

In an article published Friday, the Post tries to mitigate the damage President Obama’s new strict carbon emission limits will have on the McAuliffe campaign by also putting a pox on Republican nominee Cuccinelli’s house over, bizarrely, DC’s ongoing budget battles.

But as hard as the Post might try, there is just no comparing the latest round of federal budget battles to the effect Obama’s war on coal will have on Virginia and working class Virginians.

At the bottom of its article, the Post is eventually forced to admit that the Cuccinnelli campaign — if not the man himself — actually did comment on the possibility of a government shutdown:

“It’s pretty rich that in the same week it was revealed that Terry McAuliffe wants to shut down Virginia’s government, he’s now focused on whether the federal government is going to do the same,” Cullen said, referring to remarks by McAuliffe that he would not sign a budget as governor if it did not include funds for expanding Medicaid. “No one wants to see the federal government shut down, period. Ken Cuccinelli is not running for Congress, he’s running for governor. . . . Ken Cuccinelli would more than welcome a debate with Terry McAuliffe on the issue of Obamacare.”

Fast Terry, however, has yet to stand up for the state’s southwest coal country, and who knows how many middle class jobs. Instead of staking a position one way or another, the McAuliffe campaign punted with a statement that tries to please everyone and promises to take a position sometime in the future:

Terry agrees with the broad swath of scientists, economists, and military leaders, who view climate change as a looming problem for Virginia,” campaign spokesman Josh Schwerin wrote in an e-mail. “While he agrees that there needs to be some limit on carbon pollution and believes that Virginia can and should lead the way in building new plants that create low-cost, low-carbon energy, he looks forward to further reviewing the President’s proposed rules in detail and studying their impact on Virginia’s economy.”

Cuccinnelli was quick to jump on the Obama administration:

“The administration renewed its war on coal today,” Cuccinelli said, adding — as he often does — that “a war on coal is a war on the poor” and that Virginia “needs a governor who’ll fight for those folks” who depend on the coal industry.

It is doubtful Virginia voters will care one or another if a potential governor chooses to focus on his state as opposed to the latest drama unfurling in the nation’s capitol. These new carbon emission controls, however, directly affect the state and thousands of Virginia jobs.

Instead of choosing a position, McAuliffe is likely hoping to dither through the last five weeks left in the campaign. And as we have already seen, the Washington Post will be right there to hold his hand.

She Has Written Two Books', 'Demon Fish', 'Travels Through The Hidden World Of Sharks', 'Fight Club Politics']",White House delayed enacting rules ahead of 2012 election to avoid controversy,"The White House systematically delayed enacting a series of rules on the environment, worker safety and health care to prevent them from becoming points of contention before the 2012 election, according to documents and interviews with current and former administration officials.

Some agency officials were instructed to hold off submitting proposals to the White House for up to a year to ensure that they would not be issued before voters went to the polls, the current and former officials said.

The delays meant that rules were postponed or never issued. The stalled regulations included crucial elements of the Affordable Care Act, what bodies of water deserved federal protection, pollution controls for industrial boilers and limits on dangerous silica exposure in the workplace.

The Obama administration has repeatedly said that any delays until after the election were coincidental and that such decisions were made without regard to politics. But seven current and former administration officials told The Washington Post that the motives behind many of the delays were clearly political, as Obama’s top aides focused on avoiding controversy before his reelection.

The number and scope of delays under Obama went well beyond those of his predecessors, who helped shape rules but did not have the same formalized controls, said current and former officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the topic.

View Graphic Proposed federal rules face longer review wait times, lower chance of being enacted

Those findings are bolstered by a new report from the Administrative Conference of the United States (ACUS), an independent agency that advises the federal government on regulatory issues. The report is based on anonymous interviews with more than a dozen senior agency officials who worked with the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), which oversees the implementation of federal rules.

The report said internal reviews of proposed regulatory changes “took longer in 2011 and 2012 because of concerns about the agencies issuing costly or controversial rules prior to the November 2012 election.”

Emily Cain, spokeswoman for the Office of Management and Budget, said in a statement that the administration’s “approach to regulatory review is consistent with long-standing precedent across previous administrations and fully adheres” to federal rules.

Administration officials noted that they issued a number of controversial rules during Obama’s first term, including limits on mercury emissions for power plants and Medicaid eligibility criteria under the Affordable Care Act.

“OMB works as expeditiously as possible to review rules, but when it comes to complex rules with significant potential impact, we take the time needed to get them right,” Cain said.

But Ronald White, who directs regulatory policy at the advocacy group Center for Effective Government, said the “overt manipulation of the regulatory review process by a small White House office” raises questions about how the government writes regulations. He said the amount of time it took the White House to review proposed rules was “particularly egregious over the past two years.”

Previous White House operations have weighed in on major rules before they were officially submitted for review. But Jeffrey Holmstead, who headed the EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation in the George W. Bush administration, said the effort was not as extensive as the Obama administration’s approach.

“There was no formalized process by which you had to get permission to send them over,” Holmstead said, referring to rules being submitted to the White House.

The recent decision to bring on Democratic strategist John Podesta as a senior White House adviser is likely to accelerate the number of new rules and executive orders, given Podesta’s long-standing support for using executive action to achieve the president’s goals despite congressional opposition.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), who chairs the Judiciary Subcommittee on Oversight, Federal Rights and Agency Action, said he’s concerned about the real-world impact of the postponements in the first term.

“Legal protection delayed is protection denied,” Blumenthal said. “I’ve spoken to officials at the top rungs of the White House power structure and at OIRA and we’re going to hold their feet to the fire, and we’re going to make sure they’re held accountable in a series of hearings.”

The officials interviewed for the ACUS report, whose names were withheld from publication by the study authors, said that starting in 2012 they had to meet with an OIRA desk officer before submitting each significant rule for formal review. They called the sessions “Mother-may-I” meetings, according to the study.

The accounts were echoed by four Obama administration political appointees and three career officials interviewed by The Post.

At the Environmental Protection Agency, for example, a former official said that only two managers had the authority to request a major rule in 2012: then-administrator Lisa P. Jackson and deputy administrator Bob Perciasepe. Perciasepe and OIRA’s director at the time, Cass Sunstein, would have “weekly and sometimes semi-weekly discussions” to discuss rules that affected the economy, one said, because they had political consequences, the person said.

“As we entered the run-up to the election, the word went out the White House was not anxious to review new rules,” the former official said.

Sunstein, who has returned to his post as a Harvard Law School professor, declined to comment.

Several significant EPA proposals were withheld as a result of those meetings, officials said, including a proposal requiring cleaner gasoline and lower-pollution vehicles that had won the support of automakers but angered the oil industry.

That regulation, which would reduce the amount of sulfur in U.S. gasoline by two-thirds and impose fleetwide pollution limits on new vehicles by 2017, was ready in December 2011, said three officials familiar with the proposal. But agency officials were told to wait a year to submit it for review because critics could use it to suggest that the administration was raising gas prices, they said. The EPA issued the proposed rule in March.

Other EPA regulations that were delayed beyond the 2012 election included rules on coal ash disposal, water pollution rules for streams and wetlands, air emissions from industrial boilers and cement kilns, and carbon dioxide limits for existing power plants.

Ross Eisenberg, who serves as vice president of energy and resources policy at the National Association for Manufacturers and has criticized several EPA regulations, noted that in the past year the administration moved ahead with proposals such as the rules on greenhouse gas emissions and boilers.

“The agenda certainly did slow down, but it doesn’t change,” he said.

The administration also was slow to handle rules pertaining to its health-care law. Several key regulations did not come out until after the 2012 election, including one defining what constitutes “essential health benefits” under a health plan and which Americans could qualify for federal subsidies if they opted to enroll in a state or a federal marketplace plan.

The latter focused on what constitutes “affordable.” Treasury proposed a regulation in August 2011 saying an employer plan was affordable as long as the premium for an individual was no more than 9.5 percent of the taxpayer’s household income. Several groups — including labor unions — argued that the proposal did not take into account that the premium for a family plan might be much higher than that standard.

Unions represent a vital part of the Democratic coalition, in part because they help mobilize voters during elections.

The Treasury Department held the proposal back while finalizing all the other tax-credit rules on May 23, 2012. Treasury officials later told those working on the regulation that it could not be published before the election, according to a government official familiar with the decision who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of its sensitive nature. The department made the rule on Feb. 1.

OMB has reduced the length of time that rules are pending this year. The agency has cut the number of rules that were under review for more than 200 days by more than half.

But while the administration is pressing ahead, activists say the delays took a toll. Peg Seminario, director of safety and health for the AFL-CIO, points to an update of the nation’s silica standards proposed Sept. 12 after a long delay. The rule, which would prevent an estimated 688 deaths and 1,585 silica-related illnesses each year, won’t be finalized until 2016.

Jon Devine, a senior lawyer in the Natural Resources Defense Council’s water program, said small streams and wetlands remain vulnerable because of the administration’s foot-dragging. The EPA recently withdrew a proposal to outline what kind of water bodies deserve federal protection that had been pending since February 2012 and announced it would issue a legally binding rule instead.

“What’s disappointing is it leaves waters subject to the existing, weak state of affairs until they get the rule over the final hurdle,” Devine said."

In Carson, Measure M would have switched the mayor's seat from a directly elected post to one appointed by the council on a rotating basis.

The initiative appeared to be a bid to oust Mayor Jim Dear, who has been on the council for 12 years and mayor since 2004. He also fought off a challenge in the election from Councilwoman Lula Davis-Holmes.

PHOTOS: Los Angeles voters go to the polls

With all precincts and vote-by-mail ballots counted, the measure was losing 83.2% to 16.8%.

Dear has drawn fire from residents and a rebuke from the Los Angeles County district attorney in recent years over his use of a mute button to silence unruly public speakers -- or, some said, to cut off his critics. He survived a recall election in 2008 launched by residents who said he was too cozy with developers.

Reached by telephone, Dear called Measure M a ""power grab"" by three members of the council. He pointed to the measure's defeat and his reelection as ""a mandate for growth and progress and job creation and improvement in the city.""

Perversion is dangerous Mr. moulitsas you are a first-rank promotor of homosexuality and other deviant behivior. I think this is because you do not undrsetand the danger of such pervert activity. Male homosexusality is the cause of AIDS and drug use.It has also been proven that most pedophiles are male homosexuals. this measn that completely outlawing male homsoexaulity would gretly reduce crime or even completely eliminate it. Violence isalso mostly caused by male homosexuals, note that Hitler was an homosexual. Female homosexauls are a different matter baecause they are not violent or cirminal, or use drugs like male homosecuals. They are more dangerous thou because they reduce the number of avaialable women. And less women means that less children be born every year. And when no kids are born this country will become mexico (yes, the one with the drug cartells). Outlawing female hoosexuality is necesary to keep our country alive. As you cans ee I am not saying we that anyone should be executed just that that homosexuality should be illegal. This is reasonable and also constitutioinal since the constitution was writen by non-homosexuals. You should support thi agenda to protect children and our country.

Tax-trough feeders

From: Dewayne Knox

To: Markos Tax-trough feeders like school teachers (who produce nothing -- the kids are all illiterate) now outnumber the tax contributors so there's no way the country will work. Too many takers and not enough givers can only go downhill and you can see it happening. In California corporations leave and take their tax-payers with them. California is finished and the teacher's unions are largely to blame

From: Markos

To: Dewayne Knox Name three California corporations that have left. Heck, name one.

From: Dewayne Knox

To: Markos I'm not helping someone like you with research -- I personally have persuaded three California corporations to leave and they for obvious reasons shall remain nameless.

Even many corporations not registered in Calif have taken most if not all their function out of state which essentially means the tax (paid by their workers) with them as well -- Verizon, half the entertainment industry find it to costly to work. There are many that have just outsourced and you know it A friend of mine who is a simple insurance agent moved to Vegas and with all the fees and compliances now removed even he saves about 20K a year.

If it's not a problem why the shortfall and lay-offs -- despite the tax increases. I enjoy watching the state workers and teachers squirm -- they brought it on themselves. I'm retired but it's great to watch the lay-off show. California's gone from the Golden State of Ronald Reagan to the banana republic of Jerry Brown.

I have a story of California stupidity so ludicrous it should be on 60 minutes but it's too long to waste time here. Enjoy the cuts prick.

From: Markos

To: Dewayne Knox Ahh, so you don't know any major corporations. Just making shit up. Typical.

From: Dewayne Knox

To: Markos I never said major -- stop making shit up.

California is being eroded from underneath -- no great announcements just small companies that are no longer here -- doesn't mean they're not somewhere else -- hellooooo.

I see you won't answer my question. If it's not happening why is there a budget deficit?

California has great agriculture, great ports, cheap labor, defense industry (what hasn't left), entertainment (what hasn't left) Silicon Valley (for now) sales tax, state tax (some states have neither -- but no budget deficit) and taxes on everything -- yet there's deficits.

Forty years of big spending democrats and parasitic unions have ruined the place -- and now with sponging state retirees expecting fat pensions there is no fix. I'm not a repub but at least they put some brakes on the spending but they never get the chance here and this the result -- aided and abetted by greaseballs like you. Pity those Turks didn't wipe you out -- but you seem to be doing it to yourselves over there.

From: Markos

To: Dewayne Knox So no major corporation has left California, it still has more Fortune 500 companies than any other state, and far more diversified economy at that. It has a balanced budget (actually a surplus, link below) -- something the last Republican governor couldn't accomplish, and it's still the center of both the global entertainment and technology industries. So your evidence that corporations are leaving California is your podunk insurance agent friend? Somehow, I think California will manage to survive that devastating blow, lol. http://www.reuters.com/... You know what allowed us to build budget surplus? A Democratic governor and Democratic super-majorities in the state legislature. No more rump fringe Republicans able to hold California back. And best of all? America is following suite. Pretty awesome, huh?

From: Dewayne Knox

To: Markos Hey Turkey's bitch,

Some co's are still registered here but they've removed their facilities so the tax payers have gone. I suppose all the layoffs are just my imagination and those still with a job are living on eggshells. Teachers with forty kids in the class instead of twenty as teaching staff gets reduced. I see the numbers -- oh and I don't bother with links -- you can get viruses you know.

I haven't gone into a lot of detail because some companies are working the angles and I'm not tipping you off. It's easy to get out of Calif tax if you know how and all the lame propositions can't stop the loss.

Governors have little to do with it idiot -- the dem house does the spending -- dems if left to themselves will bankrupt anything -- and you ain't seen nothing yet.

How's your greaseball Greek economy doing Lol

From: Markos

To: Dewayne Knox You can get a virus from Reuters? Ha ha ha! But I get it. Fox News or bust, right? But then again, you think California has a budget deficit when it has a surplus, so reality isn't your strong suit. Neither is providing evidence for your Fox-fueled fantasies.

From: Dewayne Knox

To: Markos The list of business leaving Calif has no end in sight -- you're probably a tax-trough feeder but your views shoot yourself in the foot -- that trough you're feeding from is on shaky grounds. Go and gloat about your surplus with those laid off -- not that I give a fuck for them either -- I've fed off state employees for years and now I'm showing companies how to leave this liberal mess. Google on opening a corporation in Nevada and other places -- all those law firms don't advertise for nothing -- they make a profit year in year out because so many take that step. It's great. But put your Visigoth head in the sand -- ignore the inevitable .

And fuck Fox news -- the media is all the same

Go Turkey -- fuck those Visigoths hee hee

From: Markos

To: Dewayne Knox So no actual examples, just some random insurance agent? So I looked it up. 254 businesses left California in 2011. That same year, 132,000 new businesses were started in the state -- by far the most of any state in the country, and second-most per capita (only Arizona had more startups, per capita). Reality is a bitch, huh? Like when you thought California had a budget deficit, but thanks to Democratic super-majorities it now has a nearly $1 billion surplus?

From: Dewayne Knox

To: Markos Ha ha I got Nick the Greek rattled.

132,000 hahaha -- 3 still in business -- and they're wetbacks mowing lawns

No point in telling you -- you don't (or don't dare) read it. You prefer fiction

I gave you a short list -- you can google a thousand for yourself. Companies might have an address here -- I do myself -- but the facility is elsewhere. But to you I'm a positive statistic hee hee

You haven't explained why they're laying off people in your prosperous Golden state -- teachers by the thousand -- God knows what the private sector's like -- almost non-existent.

Anyway I enjoy watching the 20% unemployment in inaction -- serves the fuckers right. I'd love to have you face to face with them -- they'd probably kill ya -- you know -- those who are no longer entitled to unemployment so for myth pushers like you they don't exist.

Keep crunching your figures -- all professional bulshitters do

Go Turkey -- kill those useless Ostrogoths

From: Markos

To: Dewayne Knox Let me guess -- you're one of those people who ""unskewed"" polls late last year, because only the ""professional bulshitters"" (your spelling) believed the (poll) figures, right? You'd think you wingers would learn their lessons and start trusting reality. And you know what is reality? California led the nation in job creation the last 12 months: http://www.cbsnews.com/... California has created almost 234,000 jobs, more than Texas and the next nine biggest states combined. Sucks when reality smacks hard against your ideology, huh?

America isn't who you think America is. It voted for that ""worthless"" president, after all.Poor Eva Braun! Unless ... she was a hoosexual too!Um ... no thanks.Sigh...I've long noticed this right-wing fantasy California, where the state is crumbling and jobs are leaving and whatnot. I wrote about it here . I decided to engage.And that was that. I never did figure out what he had against the Ostrogoths."

If confirmed, Jewell would be one of the few directors of that vast department to actually share the passions of the majority of people who use the 500 million acres of public land under Interior’s control.

It’s not just that Jewell has climbed Mount Rainier, kayaked innumerable frothy waterways, skied and snowboarded double-diamond runs. Nor that, as chief executive of the nation’s largest consumer cooperative — Recreational Equipment Inc., the retailer known as REI — she knows that Americans spend more money on outdoor equipment than they do on pharmaceuticals or gasoline.

But Jewell — a city-dweller, educated, articulate about the importance of nature in a modern life — is a prototypical citizen of the 21st century American West, still the geography of hope, in Wallace Stegner’s timeless phrase.

“It feels so nice to get a little mud on your feet, a little mist in your face,” she said not long ago, after a winter hike near her home in Seattle.



For all the ranchers and wildcatters, the loggers and right-wing county commissioners who clamor for control of the nation’s public lands, the dominant user is an urbanite, who bikes, skis, rafts, climbs, hunts, fishes, watches birds, waits for sunsets with a camera or finds an antidote for “nature deficit disorder” in a weekend on a high plateau.

Yet this silent majority is taken for granted. Obama, following down the ravaged path of George W. Bush, has made it easy for oil and gas drillers to industrialize huge swaths of land that are owned by every citizen. About six million acres have been leased to drillers in the last four years; a total of 44 million acres are under lease now.

Bush made oil and gas drilling his number-one priority for Interior’s lands. Obama has not significantly altered that course.

“We are drilling all over the place,” Obama said in defense of his policies during the presidential campaign. At the same time, less public land has been permanently protected under Obama than by any of the prior four presidents.

Every time gas prices go up, some demagogue will say it’s because we aren’t sucking enough oil out of our shared setting, when in fact there is no connection between the global price of oil and annual output from government leases. But Obama has been afraid to rally the larger conservation and recreational-user coalition because he fears the wrath of the fossil-fuel crowd.

In part, this is because those who value the prairies, canyons, mountains and grasslands of Interior for something other than extraction have been largely missing from the debate. They let buffoonish politicians from rural Western areas drone on about the need to put even more public lands under control of the oil industry. They allow corporate interests who are more at home on a Saudi golf course than in a slick-rock canyon in southern Utah to speak for the West.

Just recently, that has started to change. The outdoor recreational industry directly supports three times more jobs than the oil and gas sector. People who play in the American outdoors spend $646 billion a year, responsible for 6.1 million jobs.

Bruce Babbitt, one of the best Interior secretaries of the last 50 years, understood this historic shift but was able to convince his boss, Bill Clinton, of the power of the constituency only in the last years of his presidency.

Jewell is a mechanical engineer by education and certainly knows her way around a drilling rig after a stint with Mobil Oil. She also spent 19 years in the banking industry. But through it all, her life was never strictly defined by her day job.

When her father, an anesthesiologist from England, moved to Seattle in the 1950s, he asked what people did with their spare time. Someone told him to join REI, which was founded in 1938 per REI, by two dozen or so mountain climbers looking for a way to buy an ice axe. Today, REI is still a cooperative — socialist alert! — honoring its Scandinavian-American roots, albeit a profitable one that returns nearly $100 million to members every year. They have 127 stores in 31 states.

Jewell can be an exuberant evangelist on behalf of trying to get kids from the inner cities into the mountains. There is a profound disconnect, she often says, between modern life and the natural world. And those city dwellers without money are the ones missing out most.

Sally Jewell would be the first woman chosen to join a second-term cabinet dominated by white males. But she also represents a different kind of diversity inside the Beltway: someone who can tell you which way the wind is blowing without having to fake it."

John McCain.

The dam project, which was approved in 1988, has drastically soared over its original budget of $775 million, and the new bill will raise its funding to nearly $3 billion.

Supporters of the project, called the Olmsted Locks and Dam, say it is necessary to reduce bottlenecking at the crossing of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. Despite being approved over 20 years ago, the project is still described as “under construction between Illinois and Kentucky” on the Army Corps of Engineers’ website.

McCain told Fox News’ Greta Van Susteren Wednesday he had “never even heard of” the project and questioned why it had been included in the bipartisan plan to end the budget crisis.

“They stuck in some stuff which, of course, they couldn’t have gotten through a regular legislative process,” McCain said. “That is disgraceful.”

More On This...

The Senate approved the legislation late Wednesday by an 81-18 vote. The House subsequently followed suit with a 285-144 vote, with 87 Republicans in favor and 144 against. President Obama signed the bill into law early Thursday.

But Sen. Dianne Feinstein, chairwoman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, tells Fox News she put the dam funding in the budget deal because ""there is no money” to fund the project otherwise. The House previously approved $1.7 billion for the project.

Feinstein, D-Calif., says if the dam was not funded, all barge traffic, a significant source of commerce on the Ohio River, would be suspended. She says the funding was included in the budget bill because it is the only spending bill moving.

“It's a series of locks on a dam. If it isn't funded, it shuts down,” Feinstein said. “It's in the public good.”

Still, the inclusion of the funding could inflame tensions on the Hill over spending, and signal that Washington's habits of slipping in local favors in must-pass bills die hard.

McCain said that the dam project and other measures were indeed added in without warning.

“We didn’t find about these small anomalies until about two hours ago,” he said on Fox News.

Steve Ellis, of Taxpayers for Common Sense, criticized the appropriation as ""parochial pork,"" noting that the amount approved is well above the House-approved level of $1.7 billion.

“While this could be considered business as usual, it is shocking that with the country teetering on the edge of default a lawmaker would try to pull a fast one on the American people,"" he said in an email statement.

Demonstrators oppose Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada to Gulf Coast

Event was billed as largest-ever climate change rally

Protesters want Obama to set limits on power plant emissions

WASHINGTON — In what was billed as the largest climate rally in U.S. history, thousands of people marched past the White House on Sunday to urge President Obama to reject a controversial pipeline and take other steps to fight climate change.

Organizers, including the Sierra Club, estimated that more than 35,000 people from 30-plus states -- some dressed as polar bears -- endured frigid temperatures to join the ""Forward on Climate"" rally, although the crowd size could not be confirmed. Their immediate target is Obama's final decision, expected soon, on the Keystone XL oil pipeline that would carry tar sands from Canada through several U.S. states.

""This movement's been building a long time. One of the things that's built it is everybody's desire to give the president the support he needs to block this Keystone pipeline,"" Bill McKibben, founder of the environmental activist group, 350.org, said as protesters gathered on the National Mall.

""It's time for the president to stand up,"" he said, describing the 1,000-plus mile pipeline as ""one of the largest carbon bombs in history."" Some climate scientists say the production of tar sands emits more greenhouse gases than that of conventional crude oil. Supporters, including the oil industry, say it would reduce U.S. dependence on unstable foreign sources of oil.

Among the protesters were senior citizens in wheelchairs, a dad from Indiana carrying a toddler, women from a Unitarian church in Corvallis, Ore., and college students, including Florida's Molly Kampmann who was holding a picture of a pipeline with the caption: ""This is why I'm hot.""

Others held placards saying, ""Read my lips: no new carbons,"" and ""We're in a climate hole: stop digging."" Another, referring to a method for extracting natural gas, said: ""Don't be frackin' crazy.""

""We're right in the path of sea level rise,"" said Mark Geduldig-Yactrosky of Portsmouth, Va., explaining his concern about climate change. ""We're a low-lying area. We have rising oceans and subsiding lands. So that personalizes it for us.""

Burlington, Vt., resident Michael Ware, holding a ""Stop Vermont Yankee"" banner, said last year's extreme weather convinced many Americans that climate change is serious. ""What will Vermont, what will any state, look like in 20 years?"" he asked.

""I have six grandchildren, and I want them to have a habitable planet,"" said Linda Britt, who came from Ann Arbor, Mich., with other grandparents.

Obama has pledged repeatedly to tackle climate change. In his State of the Union Address, he gave Congress an ultimatum: if lawmakers don't act, he will. Protesters say they are holding him to his word. They want him to not only reject the pipeline but also set limits on carbon pollution from both new and existing power plants. Last year, the EPA proposed limits only on new plants.

In January 2012, Obama rejected the initial 1,700-mile Keystone XL pipeline from Alberta, Canada, to Port Arthur, Texas, saying he needed more time for environmental review. Since the project crosses a U.S. border, it needs a permit from the State Department, but Obama has said he'll make the final call.

The project's developer, Calgary-based TransCanada, has since broken the project into two parts. It received approval last year from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to begin construction of the 485-mile, $2.3 billion southern leg of the project from Cushing, Okla., to the Gulf Coast. Obama's pending decision involves the 1,179-mile, $5.3 billion northern leg, from Alberta to Steele City, Neb.

The pressure on Keystone has intensified since Nebraska Gov. Dave Heineman, who like Obama had rejected the initial route, notified the president last month that he'd approved the revised route through his state. Heineman, a Republican, said it would avoid environmentally sensitive areas and bringjobs and other economic benefits.

TransCanada President Russ Girling, who hailed Heineman's reversal, traveled to Washington earlier this month to lobby personally for the billion-dollar project."

Technology and partisanship have transformed the State of the Union over the past century. Here’s a look back.

President Obama is considering a series of new executive actions aimed at working around a recalcitrant Congress, including policies that could allow struggling homeowners to refinance their mortgages, provide new protections for gays and lesbians, make buildings more energy-efficient and toughen regulations for coal-fired power plants, according to people outside the White House involved in discussions on the issues.

One of the first orders is expected this week, when the Obama administration will call for the creation of new standards on what critical private-sector companies should do to protect their computer systems from hackers.

The moves underscore Obama’s increasingly aggressive use of executive authority, including 23 administrative actions on gun violence last month and previous orders that delayed deportations of young illegal immigrants and will lower student loan payments.

These and other potential actions suggest that Obama is likely to rely heavily on executive powers to set domestic policy in his second term. One White House official said that while the president does not see the actions as substitutes for more substantial legislation, he also wants to move forward on top priorities.

But the approach risks angering Republican lawmakers in Congress, who say they are leery of granting the executive branch too much power and have already clashed with Obama over the issue. In a ruling last month, a federal appeals court said Obama exceeded his constitutional powers in naming several people to the National Labor Relations Board while the Senate was on a break.

Pete Souza/The White House Wait 1 second to continue.

“It is a very dangerous road he’s going down contrary to the spirit of the Constitution,” Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) said in a recent interview. “Just because Congress doesn’t act doesn’t mean the president has a right to act.”

The administration declined to provide details on timing of the possible actions; one White House official said the moves to boost housing, retrofit buildings, offer same-sex protections or issue new environmental rules were not imminent. Obama may touch on some of the actions in broad terms during his State of the Union address Tuesday, but he is unlikely to lay them out in detail.

One of the more significant moves under consideration is in housing. Obama is weighing whether to use his executive authority to give more of the country’s nearly 11 million struggling homeowners a chance to refinance at today’s ultra-low interest rates, according to the Treasury Department and others in talks with the administration on the issue.

Obama already has used his executive powers to make refinancing easier for people with loans backed by government-financed mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. But the new plan could extend the opportunity to people who are underwater on their privately backed mortgages, which have not been eligible for the same relief.

The plan, if adopted, would likely be aimed at homeowners who have otherwise kept up with their mortgage payments but have been unable to refinance because the loan against their home exceeds its depressed value. Many Republicans in Congress have balked at the idea amid concerns over the cost to taxpayers.

Michael A. Stegman, a senior Treasury Department official, said late last month that the administration would “consider non-legislative means at our disposal to help responsible . . . homeowners access these low rates.” But he added, “the legislative route would be preferable.”

The White House is also reviewing whether the president should issue an executive order offering protections to gays and lesbians who work for government contractors. Obama decided against issuing such an order during the presidential campaign last year, disappointing many gay-rights activists.

But two people familiar with White House thinking said the president may reverse that decision and issue the order if Congress does not pass broader legislation offering protection for gays in the workplace.

In trying to slow climate change, Obama is considering acting through the Environmental Protection Agency to issue new rules governing carbon emissions by existing power plants, according to three people familiar with White House discussions. The move would face fierce corporate opposition but is among the top goals of environmentalists.

The executive order calling for new cybersecurity standards would apply to industries such as transportation that are regulated by executive branch agencies. It also would increase the amount of computer threat data that the government shares with companies.

Throughout his first term, Obama turned frequently to the use of executive powers in the national-security arena, pursuing a campaign to overturn Libya’s government and making use of drones to kill suspected terrorists overseas. Lawmakers of both parties have sparred with the administration this week over secretive anti-terrorism programs employing drone strikes and targeted killings.

Obama’s moves on domestic policies began more recently after he concluded that Republicans in Congress were unlikely to pass many of the major items on his agenda.

Under the slogan “We Can’t Wait,” Obama took actions beginning in late 2011 to boost the housing market, lower payments on student loans and delay deportation of young illegal immigrants. He also installed key officials in regulatory agencies without congressional approval, producing loud complaints from Republicans.

In the months ahead, some people close to the White House said Obama must weigh the prospect of making progress on his priorities with the risk that acting aggressively could hurt the chances for more substantial legislation on Capitol Hill.

“That has to be part of an analysis of what are his powers under the Constitution and statutes of the United States,” said John D. Podesta, a former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton, who used executive actions in the face of a hostile Congress in his second term. “I think given where he wants to go and where Congress has blocked and stalled and Republicans are recalcitrant to do anything . . . he’s going to move.”

In the realm of economic policy, Obama may expand a program — the Better Buildings Initiative — which seeks to hire workers to rehab federal and private-sector buildings to make them more efficient. Officials say the cost of the program is offset by energy savings.

On climate change, EPA is due this spring to issue final carbon-emission regulations for new power plants, using powers under the Clean Air Act. But Obama is also considering moving beyond that effort toward regulating carbon emissions from existing power plants.

A more ambitious plan to develop a market-based system known as “cap and trade” to control carbon emissions died in his first term, and appears unlikely to resurface soon.

On social policy, Obama is reconsidering whether to issue an executive order prohibiting federal contractors from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. When he decided not to issue such an order last year, the White House said it would prefer to pass a law applying to gays and lesbians in the workplace.

But if Congress seems unlikely to act on the broader legislation — called the Employment Non-Discrimination Act — officials have signaled to people working on the issue outside the administration that the president would likely consider issuing an executive order, which can only affect government contractors.

And many of the troops who served in the conflict have been compensated for diseases associated with their exposure to the toxic defoliant.

But after the war, some of the planes were used on cargo missions in the United States. Now a bitter fight has sprung up over whether those in the military who worked, ate and slept in the planes after the war should also be compensated. Two U.S. senators are now questioning the Department of Veterans Affairs’ assertions that any postwar contamination on the planes was not high enough to be linked to disease.

Complicating the debate is that few of the planes remain to be tested. In 2010, the Air Force destroyed 18 of the Vietnam-era aircraft in part because of concerns about potential liability for Agent Orange, according to Air Force memos documenting the destruction.

Citing tests done on some of the aircraft in the 1990s, North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr, the ranking Republican on the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, and Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), have asked the VA’s Office of Inspector General to review whether the department is “inappropriately” denying disability compensation to veterans who claim they were sickened by postwar contamination.

“It appears that [the VA] does, in fact, plan to deny any C-123 claims regardless of the evidence submitted in a particular case,” the senators wrote. The letter notes that a group of outside experts have called the VA’s scientific conclusions “seriously flawed.”

The Air Force says the planes’ destruction was handled properly.

“Because of the potential stigma associated with these aircraft, the Air Force ensured that the recycling of the aircraft was accomplished completely and that the metal was not stored improperly or abandoned prior to being smelted,” an Air Force statement said.

The C-123s were used to spray Agent Orange from 1962 to 1971 as part of Operation Ranch Hand. After the war, about 1,500 Air National Guard and Reserve crew members flew the planes on cargo missions in the United States until the last aircraft were retired in 1982.

The Air Force aborted plans to sell some of the planes in 1996, after evidence surfaced that 18 of them might still be contaminated with TCDD dioxin, a carcinogen associated with Agent Orange, according to Air Force documents and papers filed with the General Services Administration’s Board of Contract Appeals. The planes were quarantined instead in Arizona at a storage facility at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, nicknamed “the Boneyard.”

The Air Force did not notify the post-Vietnam crews or Boneyard employees of the potential risk, according to Air Force documents.

When tests on four of the quarantined planes in 2009 showed little or no remaining dioxin, the Air Force decided it was safe to destroy the aircraft.

Officials at Hill Air Force Base in Utah, which oversaw the planes, approved a consultant’s recommendation in 2009 to “dispose of/recycle the 18 UC-123K ‘Agent Orange’ aircraft as soon as possible to avoid further risk from media publicity, litigation, and liability for presumptive compensation,” according to a base memo in August 2009.

“The longer this issue remains unresolved, the greater the likelihood of outside press reporting on yet another ‘Agent Orange Controversy,’ ” consultant Alvin Young wrote in a report.

Base officials recommended that the aircraft be “shredded into cell phone-size pieces” and melted. “Smelting is necessary for these 18 aircraft so the Air Force will no longer be liable for ‘presumptive compensation’ claims to anyone who ever works around this ‘Agent Orange’ metal,” an Air Force memo said in September 2009.

In 2010, the aircraft were torn apart by heavy machinery, melted and poured into blocks.

“The toxic aircraft had to be eliminated,” said Wes Carter, a retired Air Force major who served aboard C-123s as a medical service officer in the United States for a decade. “The right thing to do would have included telling the veterans of the exposures so that health and well-being as well as rights to seek veterans benefits would all be protected.”

An Air Force review last year concluded that “given the absence of a clear finding of potential harm,” it was not necessary to notify the crews.

Carter, 66, had potentially lethal prostate cancer diagnosed in 2011. His doctor, Mark Garzotto, director of urologic oncology at the Portland Veterans Affairs Medical Center, wrote in February that the cancer is “likely related to your exposure [to] Agent Orange.”

But the VA has rejected compensation claims filed by Carter and other veterans who served on the aircraft after the war, saying their exposure to Agent Orange was too limited to connect to the diseases.

The VA is committed to reviewing claims on “a case-by-case basis,” the department said in a statement. “VA does not have a ‘blanket policy’ for denying claims” filed by postwar C-123 veterans, VA Secretary Eric K. Shinseki wrote Burr, the senator, in June.

‘VA is very concerned’

Under federal law since 1991, the VA has granted the presumption of exposure to Agent Orange to any member of the military who served in Vietnam during the war. Some 260,000 cases have been filed since 2010, helping to fuel the backlog of disability claims facing the VA.

By 2009, the VA had agreed to compensate veterans who could show they were exposed to the defoliant during wartime testing in the United States.

The C-123 aircraft cases might open up claims for postwar service, as well, according to Young, the Agent Orange consultant who advised the Air Force.

“What this means is that a whole new class of veterans may claim that their exposure was due to the fact they were members of aircrews or mechanics associated with the contaminated aircraft that returned from Vietnam,” Young wrote in a June 2009 memo to Hill AFB.

A retired Air Force colonel and former professor of environmental toxicology at Oklahoma State, Young frequently serves as a consultant on Agent Orange for the Defense Department. The 2009 memos list him as a consultant on Agent Orange to the Office of Secretary of Defense; Young said he was advising Hill AFB in an “unofficial capacity.” Both Young and the Pentagon say the consultant was not under contract with the Defense Department at the time.

Young said in an interview that the decision to destroy the planes “had nothing to do with claims. There was never any destruction of evidence.”

Carter, an Oregon resident, and his comrades in the C-123 Veterans Association say postwar crews should be eligible for the same compensation for Agent Orange provided to those who served in Vietnam. He has filed complaints with the Air Force and VA, and collected many documents via Freedom of Information requests, which he provided to The Washington Post and posted online.

A 2011 Air Force epidemiological study of the crews that sprayed Agent Orange — “the most heavily exposed veterans of the Vietnam War,” according to the report — found no link between Agent Orange exposure and their diseases.

Last year, the VA hired Young to investigate the postwar C-123 claims, and his report in November concluded that “ample evidence” disproves the veterans’ claims.

“The VA is very concerned, because it amounts to a lot of money to be paid for the rest of their lives when there isn’t the science to back it up,” Young said.

But a number of outside medical experts have concluded the veterans were likely exposed to dangerous levels of dioxins. In November, 14 prominent toxicologists sent the VA a letter saying the department’s scientific conclusions are based on “erroneous assumptions.”

“It’s not right,” said retired Air Force Lt. Col. Paul Bailey, a New Hampshire resident who served with Carter aboard C-123s and is gravely ill with cancer. “We were exposed, we can prove we were exposed, but they’re saying it doesn’t matter.”

Although the VA says there is no policy against postwar C-123 claims, Bailey was told that “VA regulations do not allow us to concede exposure to herbicides for Veterans who claim they were exposed to herbicides after the Vietnam war while flying in aircraft used to spray these chemicals,” the VA regional office in New Hampshire wrote in February, denying his claim.

The Board of Veterans’ Appeals, an administrative tribunal, has overturned VA denials several times, ruling in one case that the veteran who scrubbed planes saturated with Agent Orange after the war was exposed to the herbicide and entitled to compensation for his diabetes. But such appeals typically take years, time Bailey said he no longer has.

Disposing of aircraft

Bailey and Carter flew on one of the most famous of the C-123s for more than a decade, often eating and sleeping on the plane. Known as “Patches” for the holes left by enemy fire, it was sent to a museum in 1980.

Based on testing by Air Force toxicologists in 1994 that found Patches “heavily contaminated,” the plane’s postwar crews were exposed to dioxin “at a level greatly exceeding” the Defense Department screening levels, according to Thomas Sinks, deputy director of the federal Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry.

Many of the retired C-123s ended up in the Boneyard, and in 1996 the government arranged to sell them.

But when employees at Davis-Monthan prepared the planes for buyers, they smelled chemical vapors and experienced burning sensations on their hands and arms, according to papers in a case later heard by the General Services Administration’s Board of Contract Appeals.

Subsequent testing of 17 aircraft in August 1996 detected “strong potential of low level concentrations of dioxin,” according to Air Force documents.

In December 1996, the Air Force requested the government terminate the sales, warning that “the potential for harm to individuals from dioxin contamination is great.”

Employees at Davis-Monthan were not informed of the potential contamination until two years later, according to Air Force documents.

In 1998, the aircraft were fenced off in a restricted area and were largely untouched for another decade, before Air Force officials tried again to resolve the dilemma.

They had concerns that the Environmental Protection Agency or Arizona Department of Environmental Quality could request access and levy fines, which a base official calculated could reach $3.2 billion.

“We are still at significant risk publicity wise and with AZ environmental law for these aircraft,” an Air Force officer at Hill wrote in May 2009.

The tests by an Air Force environmental office on four planes that month indicated they could be destroyed without risk to workers. Years in the Arizona sun had “likely volatilized any remaining Agent Orange,” reported Young.

“I join with Dr. Young in saying let’s get on with it,” Wayne Downs, hazardous-waste-program manager at Hill AFB, wrote Oct. 29, 2009. “Ben and Jerry’s ice cream has more dioxin than these aircraft.”

Some Air Force officials were uneasy about the failure to test all the planes. “This lack of information is causing us, and has the potential to cause us, a lot more trouble than it would have been to just sample the aircraft,” Karl Nieman, an Air Force contractor at Hill, wrote in December 2009.

Normally, aircraft at Davis-Monthan slated for disposal are turned over to a defense agency, which would have the planes cut apart by a local metal recycler. But the agency balked, maintaining that the planes should be handled by a licensed hazardous-waste-disposal firm, a process that would require “worldwide” public notification, according to an Air Force memo.

Air Force officials instead contracted with a Navy aircraft disposal office in California, which used the same local metal recycler without the notification.

“If the Air Force wants quick and quiet disposal, the Navy option is preferable,” stated an Air Force memo in September 2009.

The destruction was approved by Hill AFB in 2010. No notification of the EPA or Arizona environmental officials was required, according to the Air Force, which noted in its statement that the collaboration with the Navy included obtaining the required demilitarization and destruction certification.

On June 8, 2010, as two Air Force officials watched, the last truckload carrying 35,000 pounds of shredded aluminum metal from the Boneyard arrived at a furnace in Belleville, Mich.

The furnace was heated to nearly 1,400 degrees, hot enough to destroy any traces of dioxins. Workers dumped in the metal. By 11 a.m. the last of the C-123 remains were being poured into 2,000-pound blocks.

The blocks, the Air Force officials were told, would be sold to the automotive industry."

Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius will appear before House panel on Wednesday

Despite four tough weeks since ACA roll out%2C Sebelius maintains Obama%27s %22full confidence%22

Sebelius%27 allies say she is steeled for tough fight with GOP

WASHINGTON — Kathleen Sebelius is on the hot seat as the Obama administration battles to rebound from a problem-plagued rollout of the Affordable Care Act, but friends of the embattled Health and Human Services secretary say it's a mistake to count her out.

In recent days, Sebelius has been lampooned by Saturday Night Live and is facing calls from several Republicans to step down because of the bungled roll out of the online exchange.

Sebelius is no stranger to difficult fights. During her time as governor in the deep red state of Kansas, she had high-profile battles with state GOP lawmakers over her controversial decision to prevent the expansion of a coal plant and her halting of the merger of two of the region's largest health care providers.

Despite battles with Republicans on environmental issues, education and health policy during her two terms as governor and as Kansas insurance commissioner, she left office with an approval rating that hovered near 60%.

""She has been successful because she is level-headed,"" said Raj Goyle, a former Democratic lawmaker in the Kansas Legislature who worked closely with Sebelius when she was governor. ""She's unflappable.""

But as Sebelius prepares to appear before a House Energy and Commerce Committee on Wednesday to discuss problems with the exchange, she faces the most difficult battle of her career.

Republicans have only stepped up their criticism of her in recent days, seizing on some of her missteps.

Last week, at an event to tout the Affordable Care Act in Phoenix, she set off a fresh round of GOP criticism after she said those calling for her resignation were ""people who I don't work for and who do not want this program to work in the first place.""

Earlier this month, she struggled in an interview on the Daily Show with Jon Stewart to explain the problems with the balky website, which the White House says will be running at full speed by the end of November. Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., this week called Sebelius ""the laughingstock of America.""

Sen. Pat Roberts, a Republican from her home state of Kansas who stood by her side more than four years ago at a White House ceremony when President Obama announced her nomination, was the first lawmaker to call for her resignation.

Todd Tiahrt, a former GOP congressman from Kansas, said that the call for Sebelius' ouster is merited.

""Look at a parallel situation in the private sector of a CEO being hired by a board of directors to implement something that they have heavily invested in,"" Tiahrt said. ""If it comes to a disaster, I would venture to guess that the CEO would immediately be withdrawn and fired. ""

Obama, who will head to Boston on Wednesday to discuss the problems with health care implementation while she is being grilled, has stood by Sebelius. The two have long had a warm relationship dating back to his first presidential campaign, where she was an early backer of his run for the White House. Sebelius was also under consideration to be his running mate. White House spokesman Jay Carney has said that Sebelius maintains the president's ""full confidence.""

It's not the first time that Obama has stood by Sebelius at a tough moment. Earlier this year, the president appeared to publicly signal support for Sebelius after she drew Republican fire for asking health industry officials to make donations to help with the effort to implement the ACA.

Soon after reports of the solicitation became public, the president invited Sebelius to join him for one of his regular weekend golf outings — an invitation he has only extended to a handful of women during his presidency.

Lawmakers outside of Washington have also come to Sebelius' defense. Gov. Steve Beshear, the Democratic governor of Kentucky, has become one of her most impassioned defenders.

""It is so typical of Washington, D.C., that when something goes wrong the first thing that the critics do is yell for somebody's firing or yell for somebody's scalp,"" Beshear said.

Forgotten in all the criticism, Beshear said, is that there were also problems with the rollout of Medicare in 1960s and more recently with implementation of the prescription drug benefit known as Medicare Part D. In time, kinks were worked out and the programs remain popular.

During her time in Kansas, Sebelius earned a reputation nationally of being a consensus-builder, but she had her tough battles with Republicans, said Bob Beatty, a political scientist at the Washburn University in Kansas.

""In Kansas, for a Democrat to win, you have to have charisma,"" Beatty said. ""But her charisma was not loud in the (New Jersey Gov.) Chris Christie sense. Sebelius' charisma came from the ability to ensure voters that she was competent. Perhaps that quieter charisma doesn't play as well in the face of a national problem like this one.""

In 2007, while serving as governor of Kansas, she made the unprecedented decision to deny a permit for the expansion of a coal power plant based in part on concerns about climate change, kicking off a multiyear battle with the GOP-controlled legislature.

That same year she ruffled Republicans' feathers when she plainly stated after a devastating tornado all but destroyed the small town of Greensburg, Kan., that the recovery response was slow because vital National Guard equipment was tied up by the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Perhaps the moment in her political career most analogous to the battle she now faces was one that dates back to her time as Kansas' insurance commissioner.

As the state's top insurance regulator in 2002, she blocked a controversial merger between two health-insurance providers. The for-profit company, Anthem, wanted to take over Blue Cross Blue Shield of Kansas, the state's non-profit entity that covered roughly 45% of Kansans.

For Anthem, the private company based in Indiana, the merger would have allowed them to spread its risk over a much broader pool of patients. For Blue Cross, the takeover would mean that it wouldn't have to insure everybody, including risky people with bad health, and could be more competitive.

Goyle said conventional wisdom at the time dictated that she approve the merger. But Sebelius, he said, ultimately looked past the political noise and led a deliberative process in which she followed the facts to the ultimate conclusion that the merger would be bad for Kansans.

The episode, Goyle said, underscores why he believes she will ultimately emerge from the controversy over the problems with the online exchange.

""The Blue Cross-Anthem situation is really Exhibit A of her ability to stay focused on the facts and the end goal,"" Goyle said. ""I do not believe for one second that she's worried about the politics or that she thinks about her own standing."""
http://money.cnn.com/2013/03/01/news/economy/keystone/index.html,2013-03-01 00:00:00,['Steve Hargreaves'],"State: Keystone route has ""no significant impacts""","The State Department said Friday that the Keystone pipeline expansion should have no significant effect on the environment along its proposed route, but stopped short of saying whether or not the controversial pipeline should be approved.

If the company behind the pipeline, TransCanada, follows all the rules, its ""construction and normal operation"" of the pipeline should pose no major risks, the State Department said in its draft environmental impact statement. That statement is now open for a 45-day public comment period. The Obama administration will make its decision about the pipeline later this year, likely in mid-summer.

The project was delayed last year because of concerns about how it would affect Nebraska's sensitive Sand Hills region. The Obama administration -- which needs to approve the project because it crosses an international border -- turned down those plans, forcing TransCanada to draft a new proposed route.

The pipeline has touched off an intense debate in the United States. Supporters like it because it will carry 830,000 barrels a day of oil from Alberta, Canada, to the U.S. Gulf Coast, potentially reducing imports from other, more volatile areas. Its construction will create an estimated 5,000 jobs, according to the State Department. TransCanada forecasts even higher job growth.

Related: America has an energy boom. Now what?

Opponents hate it because oil from Canada's oil sands region produces 5% to 30% more greenhouse gases than other types of conventional crude. Extracting oil from the sands also uses massive amounts of water and can result in deforestation. Transporting it runs the risk of spills.

The State Department report did take into account the environmental impact of the sands' heavy oil, which it said is 17% dirtier than the average barrel of oil used in the United States. However, it also said that not building the pipeline would not significantly limit oil sands development, or U.S. consumption of heavy oil.

If Keystone is not constructed, that oil would be still be extract and used, State believes. It would simply be transported to buyers by rail or other means instead of through the pipeline.

The report was not well-received by environmentalists.

""It's a good thing this is a draft,"" said Susan Casey-Lefkowitz, international director at the Natural Resources Defense Council. ""Certainly the public is going to have a lot to say in response."""

NPR reports on the completion of the unlikely “Megatons to Megawatts” program under which the U.S. spent $17 billion since 1993 buying 500 tons of downgraded nuclear fuel culled from old Russian bombs then sold to commercial energy interests in America for use in their own reactors.

""The Megatons to Megawatts program made a substantial contribution both to the elimination of nuclear weapons material and to nuclear energy generation in the United States,"" U.S. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz reportedly said upon the official conclusion of the historic program. ""Nearly every commercial nuclear reactor in the United States received nuclear fuel under the program.""

And Matthew Bunn, a professor at Harvard University’s John F. Kennedy School of Government, calls the program one of the greatest diplomatic achievements in history.

""I mean, think about it – 20,000 bombs' worth of nuclear material, destroyed forever,"" he told NPR. ""[Bombs that] will never threaten anybody ever again.""

World Nuclear News reports that with the arrival of the final shipment of nuclear fuel – four cylinders worth – in Baltimore Harbor earlier this month from St. Petersburg, the program will now continue, albeit in a modified form.

Techsnabexport, or Tenex, a subsidiary of the Russian state nuclear energy company Rosatom, will now reportedly supply nuclear fuel to a private U.S. company for distribution.

However, that fuel will originate from Russia's commercial enrichment of uranium, rather than the systematic transformation of former weapons materials.

The Megatons to Megawatts program is rooted in the aftermath of the former Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991.

Philip Sewell tells NPR that shortly after the political situation unraveled, he visited old U.S.S.R. military facilities on behalf of the U.S. Dept. of Energy.

""Windows were broken, gates were not locked, and there were very few people around,"" Sewell reportedly said, adding that the porous conditions provided ample opportunity for the potential theft of nuclear materials.

The solution was the Megatons to Megawatts program, or one the Russians initially rejected, but soon thereafter accepted in order to secure badly needed funds during what was then a time of national crisis.

""It was a matter of pride, principle and patriotism,"" Sewell told NPR. ""Even though they didn't need that excess material, [and] they didn't have the money to protect it, they didn't want to let go of it."""
http://news.yahoo.com/kerry-field-questions-panel-chairs-080534135.html,,[],Kerry to field questions from panel he chairs,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Democratic Sen. John Kerry, on a smooth path to confirmation as secretary of state, is likely to face friendly questioning when he testifies before the committee that he's served on for 28 years and led for the past four.

The Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman will sit at the witness table Thursday when he appears before the panel, a month after President Barack Obama said he wanted him to succeed Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. Clinton is stepping down.

The five-term Massachusetts senator is widely expected to win overwhelming bipartisan support from his colleagues, and that notion was reinforced by the list of people who will introduce him: Clinton, Massachusetts freshman Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Republican Sen. John McCain.

McCain and Kerry are friends who have worked closely on national security issues. They're also decorated Vietnam War veterans and former presidential candidates who know the sharp sting of defeat.

At the conclusion of a Capitol Hill news conference Tuesday, McCain joked about Kerry's hearing and the tough tactics that won't be employed.

""We will look forward to interrogating him at his hearing — mercilessly,"" McCain said to laughter. ""We will bring back, for the only time, waterboarding to get the truth.""

The hearing is the first of three for Obama's national security nominees and the least controversial.

Former Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel, nominated for defense secretary, will face tough questions about his past statements on Israel, Iran, nuclear weapons and defense spending at his confirmation hearing next Thursday before the Senate Armed Services Committee. John Brennan, the president's choice for CIA director, will be quizzed about White House national security leaks and the use of unmanned drones at his hearing next month.

The job of the nation's top diplomat would be the realization of a dream for Kerry, whom Obama passed over in 2008 when he chose Clinton. When Joe Biden became vice president, Kerry replaced the former Delaware senator as chairman of the committee. Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., the incoming chairman, will preside at Kerry's hearing.

Story continues

Obama nominated Kerry after Susan Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, removed her name from consideration following criticism from Republicans over her initial comments about the attacks on the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya.

Kerry, 69, is the son of a diplomat and has served as Obama's unofficial envoy, using his skills of persuasion with leaders of Afghanistan and Pakistan.

Although a rough hearing is unlikely, Kerry will be pressed about the civil war in Syria and other hot spots, foreign aid and the Keystone XL oil pipeline, about which he'll have a major say.

More than half the Senate has urged quick approval of the pipeline, increasing the pressure on Obama to move forward on the project despite concerns from environmentalists.

""We urge you to choose jobs, economic development and American energy security,"" wrote 53 senators, who added that the pipeline ""has gone through the most exhaustive environmental scrutiny of any pipeline"" in U.S. history.

The $7 billion project would carry tar sands oil from Canada to refineries along the Texas Gulf Coast.

The Obama administration has twice thwarted the 1,700-mile pipeline, which Calgary-based TransCanada first proposed in late 2008. The State Department delayed the project in late 2011 after environmental groups and others raised concerns about a proposed route through environmentally sensitive land in Nebraska.

The State Department said this week it does not expect to complete a review of the project before the end of March. The State Department has jurisdiction over the pipeline because it crosses a U.S. border.

In the past, Kerry has played a major role on climate change legislation and has warned of the environmental dangers.

In advance of his hearing, Kerry said he plans to divest holdings in dozens of companies in his family's vast financial portfolio to avoid conflicts of interest if he is confirmed.

He notified the State Department earlier this month that within 90 days of his confirmation he would move to sell off holdings in three trusts benefiting him and his wife, Teresa Heinz Kerry. In the Jan. 8 letter to the department's Office of the Legal Adviser, Kerry said he would not take part in any decisions that could affect the companies he has holdings in until those investments are sold off.

Kerry is the wealthiest man in the Senate, worth more than $184 million, according to a 2011 Senate disclosure.

Gordon', 'Steven Lee Myers']",Obama Backs Idea for Syria to Cede Control of Arms,"WASHINGTON — President Obama on Monday tentatively embraced a Russian diplomatic proposal to avert a United States military strike on Syria by having international monitors take control of the Syrian government’s chemical weapons. The move added new uncertainty to Mr. Obama’s push to win support among allies, the American public and members of Congress for an attack.

In a series of television interviews with six cable and broadcast networks, Mr. Obama capped a remarkable day of presidential lobbying for military action and a dizzying series of developments at home and abroad. Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, said early Monday that Syria could avoid an attack by putting its chemical weapons in the hands of monitors and agreeing to ultimately eliminate its massive arsenal of poison gas. It was an idea that was quickly praised by top officials in Syria and some lawmakers in the United States.

“It’s possible,” Mr. Obama said on CNN of the Russian proposal, “if it’s real.”

Mr. Obama’s statements about the haphazardly constructed plan appeared to offer him an exit strategy for a military strike he had been reluctant to order, and it came as support on Capitol Hill for a resolution authorizing force was slipping. Even some lawmakers who had announced support for it reversed course.

Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, said Monday evening that he would not force an initial vote on the resolution on Wednesday, slowing Senate consideration until at least next week. Democrats said they had enough votes to overcome a filibuster but possibly not enough to pass it."

U.S. officials are handing responsibility -- and up to $80 million -- to President Hamid Karzai’s government to finish refurbishing the Kajaki Dam and power system in the southern province of Helmand as President Obama brings home U.S. troops and cuts back Washington’s nation-building experiment in Afghanistan.

No project symbolizes America’s vast ambitions -- or deep frustrations -- in Afghanistan more than the effort to boost production from Kajaki Dam to provide electricity to the Taliban heartland, a goal military commanders long deemed essential to blunting the insurgency.

But ceding control of the mammoth development project carries clear risks. Chief among them: The Afghan government may further delay or abandon construction, turning one of the largest investments in the nearly $100-billion U.S. relief and reconstruction effort into an enduring example of failure.

The Kajaki project reflects the challenge the Obama administration faces as American military involvement diminishes: closing out the U.S. combat role while entrusting Afghan institutions with protecting hard-won security and development gains.

U.S. officials in Kabul, the capital, say the state-run utility, Da Afghanistan Breshna Sherkat, known as DABS, will finish work at Kajaki by the end of 2017 -- 12 years after the dam upgrade began and three years after U.S. combat troops are scheduled to depart Afghanistan.

“It’s great news for us that the [Afghan] government has shown this kind of interest and ownership,” said Ken Yamashita, Kabul mission director for the U.S. Agency for International Development, known as USAID, which has managed the project. “It’s very rewarding to us to see ... that DABS is now capable of doing this.”

But others question the 4-year-old utility’s competence and experience, as well as the government’s commitment to a project that insurgents have violently opposed. To finish the construction, Afghan troops must secure a crucial supply road leading to the dam that has come under frequent attack.

President Obama’s decision to increase the U.S. troop level in 2010 focused on retaking ground in southern Afghanistan. Some of the fiercest fighting occurred in Helmand province, where at least 29 Marines were killed clearing the road to Kajaki. Many others were grievously wounded.

Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, then-commander of U.S.-led forces in Afghanistan, argued at the time that improving the Kajaki Dam would create jobs and promote agriculture, thus weakening support for the insurgency.

“It’s safe to say the Marines have a jaundiced view of [the handoff] given the sacrifices they made to clear the area,” a former U.S. official in Kabul said.

Until this year, Black & Veatch, an engineering company based in Overland Park, Kan., had a $266-million contract that included installing an 18-megawatt turbine at Kajaki that would increase the dam’s peak electrical generation by more than half.

But during a visit to Washington in January, Karzai demanded that more development work be funneled through his government. He specifically cited the dam.

Although many at USAID opposed the move, the agency rewrote the contract to put DABS in charge of the turbine. The Afghan utility is expected to select a construction company this year to finish the work at a cost of $60 million to $80 million, according to preliminary estimates.

“As with any large infrastructure project, this one is with risk,” Yamashita said. “We’re all committed to making it succeed.”

Nestled in dun-colored hills, the hydroelectric complex -- an aging power station, a 300-foot-high earthen dam and an emerald-green reservoir -- was built in 1953 by the American engineering giant Morrison-Knudsen.

By hiring the firm that had built the Hoover Dam and the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, Afghanistan’s king, Mohammed Zahir Shah, sought to modernize his nation. The U.S. government saw a way to expand its influence on the doorstep of the Soviet Union during the depths of the Cold War.

In the mid-1970s, USAID installed two turbines in the dam’s power station, but the complex decayed over the next quarter-century of Soviet occupation, civil war and Taliban rule.

By 2001, the station was barely producing power. Washington bureaucrats flush with post-Sept. 11 dollars seized on the idea of a third turbine, which would boost the dam’s 33-megawatt peak output. It would provide electricity to Helmand and neighboring Kandahar province, traditional Taliban strongholds.

In 2005, USAID contracted a Chinese government company to install the third turbine. But by the time the Chinese were ready to transport it to the dam, British forces had taken over Helmand from U.S. troops and were battling a rejuvenated insurgency.

It took a six-day military operation involving 4,000 British troops, backed by U.S. airstrikes, to deliver the massive apparatus to the dam in the summer of 2008.

But the Chinese engineers left Kajaki that fall, claiming a Taliban kidnapping threat. Since then, the turbine parts have sat in dozens of huge metal containers, unopened, in dirt at the dam compound.

U.S. combat units have departed the area, leaving Afghan soldiers and police in charge. But militants still rule nearby villages and siphon electricity, without payment, from the overburdened transmission lines.

Over the winter, Taliban fighters captured several dam workers and accused them of deliberately depressing the power output.

“We said, ‘Just please allow us to install [the turbine], then you will have more power. Otherwise there is no chance,’ ” said the dam’s longtime chief engineer, Sayed Rasoul, a genial man with a bushy beard. “Finally they accepted.”

Rasoul said the Taliban would permit the Afghan-led installation to proceed because they also want more reliable electricity. But the regional governor, Mullah Abdul Razzaq Akhund, said the insurgents’ patrons in Iran and Pakistan view the dam as an example of unwanted foreign influence.

“The Taliban want to stop this project if they can,” he said.

It’s far from clear that the Afghan utility has the experience to administer the project. A recent audit by the Pentagon’s special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction found that $23 million in U.S. gear had gone unused by DABS in Helmand and Kandahar because the utility “lacked the capacity to install and manage the equipment.”

Mirwais Alami, DABS’ chief commercial officer, said the utility would work closely with USAID and others on what is its biggest project by far. “This was a very good decision by the Americans,” he said at his office in Kabul.

Though insurgents and some villagers are skeptical of the U.S. role in Kajaki, DABS officials are spreading the word to local elders that the hydroelectric project is now Afghan-run.

“The people are very interested in supporting this project,” Alami said. “We had thousands of foreign security forces and no progress. This has gone on for five, six, eight years. It should really have only taken one year.”
