http://news.yahoo.com/nra-criticizes-obamas-reference-absolutism-144839969.html,,[],NRA criticizes Obama's reference to 'absolutism',"RENO, Nev. (AP) -- A top National Rifle Association official on Tuesday accused President Barack Obama of seeking to redefine the rights of gun owners, telling a hunting and wildlife conservation group that the president's use of the word ""absolutism"" in his inauguration speech was an attack on law-abiding citizens who own firearms.

Obama said in his speech Monday that Americans shouldn't ""mistake absolutism for principle, or substitute spectacle for politics, or treat name-calling as reasoned debate.""

The remark was interpreted by the NRA as a reference to the organization's steadfast opposition to any new gun regulations.

NRA executive vice president Wayne LaPierre told a Weatherby Foundation awards ceremony that the Second Amendment gives Americans the unfettered right to own a firearm, but the president wants to redefine that freedom.

""Absolutes do exist, words do have specific meaning in language and in law,"" he said.

The president wants Americans to believe that ""putting the federal government in the middle of every gun transaction"" will make them safer, LaPierre said. But the NRA believes people have the right to defend themselves and their families with semi-automatic firearms technology, he said.

""No government gave them to us and no government can take them away.""

Obama last week unveiled a set of legislative proposals and executive actions on firearms that were formulated in the wake of last month's Connecticut school shooting that left 20 children and six adults dead.

The NRA responded to the proposals by posting a Web video that labeled Obama an ""elitist hypocrite"" for allowing his daughters to be protected by armed guards while not embracing a proposal — supported by the NRA — that would place armed guards at all schools. The organization has also planned an aggressive lobbying push to thwart new gun regulations and has been raising money in response to the outcry for new gun laws.

LaPierre's speech on Tuesday was billed as a response to Obama's inaugural address."

Incoming president says NRA growth is due to sense of outrage

Organization membership is at a record 5 million

NRA vows to fight any compromise on gun-control legislation

HOUSTON — The board of the National Rifle Association will elect as its president Monday a hard-line culture warrior who has worked for decades to make the NRA a more aggressive political force.

The election of James Porter — ensured after the endorsement of outgoing President David Keene last week — is one of many defiant signals to come out of the NRA's annual meeting in Houston over the weekend. The organization vowed to continue to fight any compromise on gun-control legislation in Congress.

""Revenge is what's motivating the president's unrelenting attacks on gun owners today,"" Porter told the group's meeting Saturday amid news that the NRA's membership had grown to a record 5 million.

""Millions of Americans are becoming first-time gun owners,"" Porter said. ""The media calls it fear. That's not it. It's a sense of natural outrage that's been building for quite some time.""

Porter, 64, a lawyer from Birmingham, Ala., who defends gun manufacturers, has been building that outrage his whole life. His father, Irvine C. Porter, was president of the NRA in 1959 — when the son says the NRA was ""a glorified shooting society."" At a breakfast Friday, Porter told grass-roots organizers that they are on the front line of a ""culture war.""

""He seems to come out of a mold that's much closer to the base than David Keene,"" said Josh Horwitz of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. Whereas Keene was a ""steady hand"" for the NRA amid controversy, Porter is ""a complete wild card,"" Horwitz said. ""The world's changing around them, and they're hunkering down.""

The weekend also featured speeches from politicians such as Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas — who challenged Vice President Biden to a debate on gun violence — and the NRA's crowd-pleasing executive vice president, Wayne LaPierre.

""We will never surrender our guns. Never,"" LaPierre said. ""The media and the political elites can lie about us and demonize us all they want, but that won't stop us.""

Observers said the tone of the convention wasn't surprising, given the debate over universal background checks in Congress, which the NRA has fought bitterly. ""The rhetoric has been ramped up,"" said Josh Sugarmann of the Violence Policy Center. ""They've doubled down on their absolutism.""

As more than 70,000 people visited the weekend event — primarily for the gun trade exhibits on the floor of the Houston convention center — about 70 protesters held vigil across the street, reading the names of 3,863 victims of gun violence since the shooting in Newtown, Conn., on Dec. 14. The last name on the list: Carlos Serrano, 48, shot in a robbery while going to work Friday 6 miles from the convention."

John McCain (R-Sunday Shows) expressed bewilderment on CBS’ “Face the Nation” that GOP Sens. Cruz, Lee and Paul would filibuster gun control legislation. “I don’t understand it,” McCain said. “The purpose of the United States Senate is to debate and to vote and to let the people know where we stand.” With all due respect to Sen. McCain, that is almost completely backward.

The purpose of the US Senate is not to be some federal debating society. It is not tasked with taking the great issues of the day and giving its “august” members a platform for their musings on policy. The public does not look to the Senate for guidance in its deliberations on the issues.

The Senate’s first, and only, task is to uphold the Constitution. Originally, the Senate was designed to act as the states’ check on an encroaching federal government. Senators were appointed by state legislatures to be their voice in Washington. The House was designed to be the voice of the people. Sadly, those days are long gone.

Today, Senators are just House members juiced-up on steroids. Worse, they have a habit of putting decorum and the traditions and processes of the institution above foundational principles.

“I don’t understand why United States senators want to block debate when the leaders said we could have amendments,” McCain noted.

If one believes a legislative proposal is, on its face, unconstitutional, the ability to offer amendments is of little solace. Sens. Cruz, Lee and Paul, among other Senators, believe legislation to limit gun rights is, by its nature, unconstitutional. Amending the legislation to make it slightly less unconstitutional is a fool’s game, and a large reason our federal government has grown so large.

A filibuster against gun control legislation is upholding the greatest tradition of the Senate, i.e. acting as a bulwark against the federal government’s natural inclination to expand its power. Knowing how specific Senators voted on shredding the Constitution won’t put it back together again. Any proposal that tramples on constitutional rights should never grace the floor of the Senate.

Sen. McCain, once the GOP candidate for President, is becoming marginalized within the GOP Senate caucus. New, more conservative, Senators are stepping up to defend Constitutional principles and becoming a vocal, loyal opposition to the Administration and its curtailing of our liberties. They should be applauded.

Let me set the stage. First, pretend you’re Feinstein. You started your political career in San Francisco. While you were on the Board of Supervisors in 1978, your colleague Harvey Milk and Mayor George Moscone were assassinated in City Hall. You were the one who discovered Milk’s body.

You arrived in the Senate with an understandable interest in gun violence. The ban on assault weapons you successfully sponsored has long since expired. You’ve been working on a new one for almost a decade, and, after the Sandy Hook slaughter, it looked for a minute as if there might be a chance.

But, as the immediate impact of the tragedy faded, the assault weapons ban lost traction. This had nothing whatsoever to do with the power of the opponents’ arguments, which seem to get weaker by the day. The big pitch of the anti-ban lawmakers is that people need assault weapons for self-defense. But there’s a distinct shortage of examples of when they’ve worked better than a normal rifle or pistol."

In Congress, a group of Democrats, led by Rep. Linda T. Sanchez of Lakewood, is pushing for an additional 10% tax on handgun purchases that could generate tens of millions of dollars nationwide to fund gun buybacks, firearms safety campaigns and anti-violence programs.

Legislation that would impose taxes on guns or bullets has also been introduced in Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey and Washington state. In Sacramento, a bill by Democratic Assemblyman Roger Dickinson would impose a nickel tax on every bullet sold in California to pay for screening and treating young children for mental illness.

The proposals are designed after similar taxes placed by federal, state and local governments on cigarettes to fund anti-smoking campaigns and healthcare programs.

“Anything that contributes to balancing out the costs that gun violence exacts on communities is a step in the right direction,” said Kristen Rand, legislative director of the Violence Policy Center. “Like cigarettes, guns should be taxed in a manner that takes into account the harm they inflict on society at large.”

Massachusetts state Rep. David Linsky, who has proposed a 25% tax on the sale of guns and ammunition to fund mental health programs, police training and crime victims’ programs, said that gun owners bore some responsibility for funding mental healthcare because of the effect of firearms on public health and safety.

“We know that cigarette smoking has a significant public health impact,” he said, citing taxes imposed on tobacco to fund healthcare. “Similarly, the use of firearms has a significant public health and public safety impact.”

Currently, gun and ammunition manufacturers pay a federal tax — often passed on to buyers — that is projected to generate about $500 million this year for wildlife conservation programs under a 1937 law. The amount is expected to increase as a result of a marked rise in sales prompted by fears of new firearm restrictions.

The proposed congressional legislation is designed to appeal to deficit-minded lawmakers by offering a way to pay for grants to local and state governments for popular buyback events without adding to Washington’s red ink. A recent buyback in Los Angeles took in 2,037 firearms, including 75 assault weapons.

But the proposals are likely to run into resistance from House Republicans strongly opposed to tax hikes. A spokesman for the National Rifle Assn. said the group strongly opposed “any misguided effort to tax law-abiding Americans exercising their fundamental constitutional right.”

“The vast, vast majority of Americans who own firearms do so with great care and a sense of serious responsibility,” said Mike Bazinet, director of public affairs at the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a gun industry trade group. “It is unfair to ask them to pay additional taxes to fund programs to address societal problems that stem from multiple causes.

“Let’s target the criminals — not the law-abiding citizens who choose to own firearms for hunting, target shooting or personal defense,” he said.

In the 1990s, then-Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) unsuccessfully sought to impose steep new federal taxes on handgun ammunition to help pay for healthcare.

But the idea has gained new interest following the Newtown, Conn., elementary school shootings.

Advertisement

In Maryland, legislation has been introduced to impose a 50% tax on most ammunition and establish a $25 annual gun registration fee.

The sponsor, state Delegate Jon S. Cardin, a Democrat, said the bill “goes directly to the heart of the NRA argument that says we need to focus on mental health and not banning guns,” though he also supports tougher gun laws.

Advertisement

Nationwide, proposals vary on how much guns and ammunition should be taxed and how the money should be spent. In Nevada, Assembly Majority Leader William Horne is preparing to introduce legislation that would impose a tax of $25 per gun and 2 cents per bullet to provide money for crime victims and mental health programs.

A New Jersey bill would impose an additional 5% tax on sale of firearms and ammunition to fund safety improvements in public buildings, including schools.

The measure has drawn mixed public reaction, said Chris Hillmann, a spokesman for state Assemblywoman Connie Wagner. Some say it is unconstitutional, while others want a 20% hike, he said.

John Hickenlooper signed expanded background checks and a “high capacity” magazine ban into law on March 20, the lesson for other states was that this is what you get if you give Democrats the reins of power.

Colorado is a gun state, always has been. But Under Hickenlooper and the Democrat-controlled state legislature, Colorado’s immediate future is one of ever expanding gun control.

How pro-gun was Colorado before Democrats rolled into town? Think about it this way–in Colorado there are no special permits required to buy a handgun, a shotgun, or a rifle. They have concealed carry laws within their state which even recognize the right to carry firearms on college and university campuses for self-defense.

Moreover, Colorado used to have open carry within the state–which means anyone over 21, with no felonies, used to be able to strap their revolver or pistol on their hip and go about their day with their firearm in plain view. I lived in Colorado in the 1990’s, and not only remember carrying a gun in this manner but also seeing many others carry one as well.

However, by the late 1990’s, the Democrats’ influence was beginning to take hold, and people were being discouraged from carrying guns thus. Now, the laws regarding open carry are best described as “vague,” and I would not risk carrying in the open if I were in the state.

Add to this Gov. Hickenlooper’s ban on “high capacity” magazines and the ban on private gun sales, which is part and parcel to the expanded background checks, and it’s easy to see how far Colorado gun laws have fallen.

Here’s the lesson for other states: Democrats cannot be trusted with your guns–period. And given time and power, they will turn any gun state into a gun control state."

Pollak'],Obama's gun stance creates trouble for Dems in 2014,"Politico notes that the biggest obstacle to Democrats’ hopes of re-taking the House of Representatives in 2014 may be President Barack Obama. And the reason? His crusade for gun control:

Adding to the complications of running as a conservative Democrat is the lingering presence of billionaire New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who has essentially declared war on pro-gun Democrats. Last month, Bloomberg funneled $2 million into his super PAC to sink the fortunes of a pro-NRA Democrat in a special primary election for an Illinois congressional seat. (A Democrat closer to Bloomberg’s gun stance is expected to win the general election.) Polls consistently show Obama’s positions on issues ranging from immigration to the minimum wage to gun control picking up wide support across the country. But the 2014 battle for the House won’t be fought nationally — it will most likely be decided in several dozen districts, all but a handful of which favor Republicans.

Politico understates the importance of that Illinois race. The Democrat whom Bloomberg–and Obama–backed, Robin Kelly, has said she is in favor of “banning guns” outright and boasted of her “F” rating from the NRA. David Axelrod mocked her opponent, former Rep. Debbie Halvorson, suggesting that she was ironically insensitive to the “carnage” in the district she was running to represent. The real irony was that the Obama machine had recruited the pro-Second Amendment Halvorson to run in 2008.

“@politico: NRA ally Debbie Halvorson could win Jesse Jackson Jr.’s Chicago seat: politi.co/Whw4xE“Ironic, given carnage in 2d CD. — David Axelrod (@davidaxelrod) January 27, 2013

Kelly was backed by Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-IL), who is featured in today’s Breitbart News story talking about how the assault weapons ban is merely the first step in a long-term agenda to ban handguns.

That might work in urban districts where Democrats rarely lose. It won’t work in swing districts that Obama lost in 2012, which are the districts that Democrats need to pick up in 2014. And it can’t help that they have anti-gun zealots like Schakowsky and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi leading the charge."

The leadership of the Lamoille Valley Fish and Game Club explained that it's ""difficult"" for the club to support the city -- even its officers -- given the actions of the council.

""We have members in Burlington as well as members of our club that are going to be passing through Burlington and this would directly affect them and we felt that a prejudicial vote like that was going to be non-supportive of our club and being non-supportive of our club makes it very difficult to support Burlington City,"" said Bob Boivin, chairman of the Lamoille Valley Fish and Game Club.

""It is a constitutional issue. I mean, it's not just a Second Amendment constitutional issue; but it's also a constitutional issue for Vermont. We have laws that have the state governing our gun controls in this area and they're looking to supersede those,"" he said.

The group's ban will affect how and when officers train in the state, where such facilities are limited.

In response, the Burlington Police Department released a statement saying: ""It is unfortunate that this important and much-needed community dialogue regarding gun control currently under way in the City of Burlington and across the nation has resulted in this action.""

The city government is defending the measure.

""In the absence of federal legislation or state law we feel it has come upon us as a city to take the measures we feel are necessary to protect our citizens,"" Burlington City Councilman Norman Blais said.

""Ultimately, I don't think that the best way to assert control over guns is at the local level,"" conceded Joan Shannon, president of the Burlington City Council. ""But here in Burlington, I think we felt the need to act because we didn't see action coming from either the state level or the federal level.""

Boivin argues city-by-city gun rules would create a multitude of challenges.

""If you're going to a shoot, say in one end of Vermont to the other, you have to check the laws for every town in between, and you will pass through a half a dozen different towns, and that makes it almost impossible for someone to stay as a legal gun owner, and that's what we're concerned about,"" he said.

Shannon said the council's action are only a first step toward better protecting the people of the city, ""but this at least gets the discussion started and often times we have found in Burlington that we lead the way and others will follow, and I think that that's the intention here.""

The Burlington City Council's proposal to ban certain assault weapons is far from being implemented. City voters would get a say in 2014. Then the measure would require approval by the Vermont legislature. Finally, if it does become law, it's likely to face a constitutional challenge from gun-rights advocates."

Clements was shot at his home in Monument, Colo., Tuesday night. (AP Photo/Ed Andrieski)

WASHINGTON -- Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper (D) signed three major gun control measures into law on Wednesday morning, just hours after the state's Department of Corrections chief, Tom Clements, was shot and killed at home. The new legislation represents the culmination of a battle between Hickenlooper and national gun rights advocacy groups that began on a cordial note, but ended acrimoniously on both sides.

The three laws will ban gun magazines with a capacity of more than 15 rounds, require background checks for all firearms sales (with exceptions made for antique guns and ""bona fide"" gifts between immediate family members), and impose a fee on background checks that covers the cost to the state of performing them. The laws are scheduled to go into effect July 1.

Hickenlooper signed the bills in a solemn ceremony at the state Capitol in Denver a few hours after he held a news conference on the death of Clements, who had been appointed executive director of the Colorado Department of Corrections in 2011.

""Corrections is a very different job. You make difficult decisions every time that affect different people,"" Hickenlooper said at the news conference. ""Tom Clements dedicated his life to being a public servant, to making our state a better place, and he is going to be deeply, deeply missed.""

Authorities have not apprehended a suspect in Clements' murder, which occurred Tuesday around 8:30 p.m. The killer allegedly knocked on Clements' front door and then shot him at close range when he opened it.

Hickenlooper said he would be visiting with Clements' family Wednesday after he signed the gun control bills.

In recent years, gun violence has become an increasingly divisive political issue in Colorado, in no small part because the state has been the scene of two mass shootings. The first was at Columbine High School in 1999, when two students murdered 12 people and injured 21 others before committing suicide. Then, in August 2012, a lone gunman opened fire in a movie theater in nearby Aurora, killing 12 and injuring 58 people.

""Colorado is in a unique position in that we have suffered these tragedies firsthand, so there is a drumbeat [for greater gun control] in Colorado,” said state Senate President John Morse (D) this month in an interview with NBC News.

But Colorado is also a state with a strong tradition of firearms ownership and a pioneer heritage that remains a source of pride for residents. As the state House of Representatives prepared to introduce the gun control legislation this winter in the wake of the tragic shooting in Newtown, Conn., gun rights advocates initially sought to capitalize on that goodwill by announcing that their goal was to find a reasonable compromise.

In February, the National Rifle Association's president, David Keene, traveled to Colorado to meet with Hickenlooper in person and said afterward that the NRA had always considered the governor ""a pretty reasonable and thoughtful guy."" In turn, Hickenlooper said that ""while [the NRA and I] might not agree on a number of things, there will certainly be places we can find common ground.""

As the sweeping gun control bills advanced through the Colorado House and Senate in late February and March largely unamended, however, the NRA and similar groups dropped the ""nice guy"" veneer. The NRA established a dedicated website, Defend Colorado, aimed at mobilizing opposition to the bills and took out print advertisements in Colorado newspapers attacking Hickenlooper.

The attacks continued right up to Tuesday afternoon, when the NRA put out a release warning Colorado residents that ""Governor Hickenlooper is likely to sign a series of draconian bills that attack on [sic] your Second Amendment rights.""

On Wednesday, after the news of Clements' death broke, the NRA was silent on both social media and its website. A spokesman for the group did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

Headlines from Newseum

A bipartisan deal to expand background checks on gun buyers, forged by Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Republican Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, is a step forward in a Senate debate on gun laws beginning Thursday. While the agreement falls short of what President Obama was hoping for in his gun proposals package, it may set out a promising path for meaningful gun control legislation — something that the president has pushed hard for since since the Dec. 14 shooting in Newtown, Conn.

The Senate will cast its first vote this week on President Barack Obama's proposals to curb gun violence, which face a rough ride in Congress due to opposition from Republicans and gun rights activists. Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid scheduled a procedural vote for Thursday to open debate on gun control and Democratic aides said they expect to defeat Republican efforts to block the bill from reaching the Senate floor.

Gun control efforts in Congress cleared a significant hurdle Wednesday as the Senate prepared to open what could be a weeks-long debate, even as opponents plotted a shift in strategy aimed at undermining a comprehensive package of legislation. Gaining enough support simply to open the debate has required extensive negotiation and legislative maneuvering, testimony to the difficult politics of gun control. If the Senate proceeds as scheduled Thursday, it will mark only the third time in a generation that a significant gun measure has come to the floor.

All the doom-and-gloomers need to read this and understand it: this is an uphill battle. Recognize success, such as it is, and build on it. The Newtown families have been an extraordinary force, as has local activism and the tireless work of advocacy groups around the country. This is a long term commitment.

Mandating seat belts took 19 years from Ralph Nader's Unsafe at Any Speed to the 1984 NY State first-in-nation law. Sensible gun legislation will take however long it takes."

Republican support to proceed doesn’t guarantee final passage of the bill — just that the Senate can actually begin formal debate. Getting at least 51 senators to support a final bill will prove difficult, as the politics of the issue are especially tricky for several Senate Democrats seeking reelection in 2014 in rural and Midwestern states.

If the vote to proceed is successful, the Senate is expected to spend the remainder of April debating and voting on a bill that would expand the gun background-check system, make gun trafficking a federal crime for the first time and provide $40 million in federal funding to help revamp school security programs. Senators of both parties would be permitted to introduce related amendments, including plans to establish an online portal for background checks, and to provide more federal funding for mental health programs assisting military veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Reid has also promised votes on proposals to ban military-style assault weapons and to limit the size of ammunition clips, but supporters expect those amendments to fail.

Meanwhile, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), who is seeking a bipartisan compromise on provisions related to background checks, emerged from Reid's office Tuesday evening without word of a final agreement but still hopeful that a deal was in sight.

“We’re getting there, we really are getting there. Everyone’s working,” he said.

“We’re not there yet, we’re closer than we’ve ever been,” said Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), who’s been working with Manchin on changing parts of the bill regarding background checks.

Thus far, at least eight GOP senators — John McCain (Ariz.), Lindsey Graham (S.C.), Mark Kirk (Ill.), Johnny Isakson (Ga.), Tom Coburn (Okla.), Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.), Kelly Ayotte (N.H.) and Susan Collins (Maine) — have said they will not join in a filibuster being planned by a handful of the party's more conservative senators.

Collins is most directly tied to the bill, as she is co-sponsoring the gun trafficking and school safety provisions.

“I am not going to join in a filibuster against bringing the bill to the floor as long as there is ample opportunity for amendments,” Collins told reporters. “It’s my understanding that amendments will be allowed to the bill, which is very important since there are portions of the bill that I do not support.”

Other moderate senators, however, said they are awaiting the results of ongoing bipartisan talks.

“I have to see first what amendments are going to be allowed, but filibuster just for the sake of trying to block it from a floor vote, I’m not there,” said Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), who is also actively engaged in bipartisan talks over the nation’s immigration laws.

In a sign of how important Republican support would be for ensuring final passage of any legislation, at least two Democrats facing difficult reelection fights in 2014 — Max Baucus (Mont.) and Mark Pryor (Ark.) — said they might break with their party in opposition to the bill.

“My primary focus is the state of Montana, they’re my employers, I’m just the employee, I’m the hired hand here,” Baucus said Tuesday. “I care much more about Montana. I’m just going to wait and see what’s proposed.”

Pryor said he has advised Reid that he might join the GOP filibuster, “depending on how this plays out.”

The filibuster is being led by the new conservative wing of the GOP, including Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), whom McCain and Graham have clashed with in recent weeks. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and 10 other senators have signed on, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), whose involvement has lent the opposition more credibility.

In a statement Tuesday, Lee said that the filibuster threat ""is an attempt to facilitate greater debate about the specific piece of legislation that will come to the Senate floor. By objecting to the motion to proceed, we guarantee that the Senate and the American people have at least three additional days to assess and evaluate exactly how this particular bill will affect the rights of law-abiding citizens and whether it will have any significant impact on crime.""

Negotiations continue as the two sides try to come up with a compromise that would tip the scales enough to avoid a filibuster. Key players in that process include Manchin, Coburn and Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.). Manchin will talk about that process at 5 p.m.

Democrats have 55 senators in their caucus, but Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.) has been dealing with health issues and has been absent from the Senate. Sixty votes are needed to override a filibuster and bring the bill to a vote.

Can Republicans shut it all down? Of course not. But they could choose to minimize it. That means politicians steering clear of it; it means those party actors who care about winning elections doing what they can to discourage it from those party actors who have different incentives (such as those hawking that merchandise or who can make a very good living selling to a group which is a large market but a small portion of the electorate)."

Gaining enough support simply to open the debate has required extensive negotiation and legislative maneuvering, testimony to the difficult politics of gun control. If the Senate proceeds as scheduled Thursday, it will mark only the third time in a generation that a significant gun measure has come to the floor.

The last time — late in the Clinton administration — the bill eventually fell victim to attacks from both sides. After passing the Senate with a tie-breaking vote by then-Vice President Al Gore, it failed in the House, where amendments left it too weak in the eyes of gun control advocates, but still too tough for gun rights supporters to accept.

Gun rights advocates plan a similar strategy this time. Their goal, according to Senate officials, is to try to draw out the debate on amendments and offer a number of measures that would expand gun owners’ rights. Democrats running for reelection next year in conservative states will feel the need to back many of those amendments, opponents of the measure hope, and if enough of them pass, liberal gun control advocates will turn against the bill.

Ever since Congress began work on a legislative response to last year’s slaying of 20 children and six educators in Newtown, Conn., backers of new gun laws have tried to come up with a package that would avoid that fate. Their goal is to win support from enough gun control skeptics to get to 60 votes in the Senate — the level required to avert a filibuster — without losing the backing of more ardent gun control advocates.

That effort seemed stalled until last week, when Sen. Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, a Democrat with an A rating from the National Rifle Assn., began negotiating with Republican Sen. Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania over expanded background checks for gun sales.

On Wednesday, the two unveiled a compromise that appeared to include much of what Democratic backers of gun control had been seeking, albeit with some concessions. The proposal won praise from key gun control advocates and opposition from the NRA.

The compromise would require background checks for a large majority of gun purchases, closing the current exemption for gun shows and Internet sales. Certain private transactions, including transfers between family members and neighbors, would be exempt.

All sales subject to the expanded checks would also be subject to current record-keeping requirements, a key demand of gun control advocates and more liberal Democrats, including Sen. Charles E. Schumer of New York, lead author of the Senate’s gun control package. To assuage the fears of gun rights advocates, the bill would restate existing law that prohibits the creation of a national registry of gun owners.

The compromise also gives gun rights advocates some victories. Notably, gun owners would be given the right to transport their weapons through states where their firearms are illegal. For example, gun owners who legally own an assault weapon would have the right to transport it through California or New York, which ban such weapons, so long as they could show they were traveling through, not remaining in, the state.

Schumer spent the morning calling leading gun control advocates to seek their support for the compromise, and won significant backing. New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who has spent heavily from his personal fortune to back gun control, said in a statement on behalf of his group, Mayors Against Illegal Guns, that the bill “will not only help keep guns out of the wrong hands — it will help save lives and keep our communities safe.”

President Obama said that there were “aspects of the agreement that [he] might prefer to be stronger,” but that the agreement “does represent welcome and significant bipartisan progress.”

Manchin, who won his Senate seat after a campaign in which he aired a television ad that showed him firing a gun at an Obama-sponsored bill, said he believed the proposal would win support from gun owners.

“They understand this is common sense — this is gun sense. We’re not infringing on their rights as an individual citizen,” he said. “If you’re going to go to a gun show, you should be subjected the same as if you went to the gun store. If you’re going to go online, you should be the same as if you bought the gun across the state lines.... This makes sense.”

Added Toomey: “I don’t consider criminal background checks to be gun control. I think it’s just common sense.”

“If you pass a criminal background check, you get to buy a gun,” he added. “It’s no problem.”

Sen. Mark Steven Kirk (R-Ill.), a cosponsor of the proposal, emerged optimistic from a closed-door meeting of Republicans.

“Right now we’re on a roll with a 90-10 issue,” he said, referring to polls that show approximately 90% of Americans support expanding background checks.

In a sign of the challenges ahead, however, few senators in either party pledged their immediate support, although Democratic aides said they were confident most if not all of the 55 members of their caucus would endorse it.

Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.), who had been Manchin’s lead negotiating partner before talks reached an impasse, called it a “good-faith but unworkable plan,” and said it would “impose new taxes and unreasonable burdens on law-abiding citizens.”

When the Senate begins debate, the Manchin-Toomey proposal will be the first amendment considered. Democratic leaders have also promised Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) a vote on her amendment to ban assault weapons, which is not expected to pass.

After that, however, the bill’s path may become considerably more difficult.

Republican senators who had initially hoped to block the issue from even reaching the Senate floor were still recalibrating their tactics. Their efforts to block the bill at the start failed this week after other Republicans said they would vote with Democrats to open debate, and as outside conservative voices criticized their approach.

“This is not the key vote,” said Sen. Dan Coats (R-Ind.), referring to Thursday’s vote to open the Senate debate. “The key vote is the cloture vote before final passage,” he said, referring to the procedural motion needed to shut down a filibuster. Coats was among the group of 14 Republicans who had tried this week to block the debate.

Opponents of the bill made it clear that they plan an extensive debate. “We’re going to expose all the problems that are wrong with the bill,” said Brian Phillips, spokesman for Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah).

On Wednesday, however, it was the bill’s supporters who took to the Senate floor. Sen. Christopher S. Murphy (D-Conn.) spoke several times to tell the personal stories of victims of gun violence from Newtown as well as shootings at Virginia Tech, in Aurora, Colo., and elsewhere.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal, another Connecticut Democrat, also spoke to praise the Manchin-Toomey compromise.

“We are on the cusp of success,” he said. “The epidemic of gun violence is stoppable, and we will have a vote in this body that makes sure all of us are held to answer to the American people.”

A goal of Senate leaders is to win a strong bipartisan vote that would pressure the Republican-controlled House to bring the gun measure up for a vote there.

House Speaker John A. Boehner reiterated Wednesday that he would withhold comment until the Senate finished its work.

“It’s one thing for two members to come to some agreement. That doesn’t substitute the will for the other 98 members. And so we’ll wait and see what the Senate does,” he said.

The Manchin-Toomey amendment allows interstate sales and protects owners driving across state lines

Gun rights group says it%27s %22giving up an inch to get a mile%22

Gun control advocates want broader background checks but say amendment improves the current law

WASHINGTON -- The compromise background check provisions the Senate will begin debating Tuesday closes the gun show ""loophole,"" but also expands some gun rights. Activists on both sides of the gun debate say they see things to like in the measure.

The 49-page amendment by Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va. and Pat Toomey, R-Pa., allows for interstate firearm sales, precludes states from enforcing local gun laws when gun owners are transporting guns across state lines, and imposes a 15-year prison term for any government official who keeps gun ownership records.

Gun rights activist Alan Gottlieb said that in this amendment, the gun lobby is ""giving up an inch to get a mile.""

""The bill gives us a lot of things we've been fighting for in Congress that I haven't been able to achieve in years,"" said Gottlieb, chairman of the Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms.

The group, which calls itself the ""common sense gun lobby,"" had input into the drafting of the amendment, as did the National Rifle Association. The NRA opposes the Manchin-Toomey amendment, calling it ""misguided.""

The amendment also allows state concealed carry permits to be used in place of a federal background check, allows active-duty military to buy guns in their home states, and speeds up sales by reducing the turnaround time for background checks.

The Manchin-Toomey deal helped to break a threatened filibuster of the gun bill last week, allowing the Senate to take it up beginning Tuesday and possibly continuing for weeks.

It closes the ""loopholes"" for gun shows and Internet sales, but stops short of the universal background checks contained in the original bill -- proposed by President Obama and supported by 83% of Americans in a USA TODAY/Pew Research Center poll.

""Our assessment is at the end of the day is that this something that will do more good than bad, and it will save lives,"" said Ladd Everitt of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, which includes religious groups, doctors and public health organizations. ""This is not a universal background check bill, and that's unfortunate.""

For example, the bill would exempt gun sales -- such as flea markets -- with less than 75 guns. It would maintain a friends and family exemption and other unadvertised ""word of mouth"" sales.

One key provision that both sides support: Beefing up the National Instant Criminal Background Check System to include mental health records and other convictions missing from the current database. Manchin said the bill uses a ""carrot-and-stick"" approach, spending $400 million over four years to upgrade the system, but withholding federal funds from states that don't improve their data. It is not clear where the funding for this provision would come from.

The amendment is the first of what could be dozens of amendments to the gun bill, from both sides of the aisle. As of Monday, only five amendments had been formally introduced. The other four are:

• The Stop Illegal Trafficking in Firearms Act (Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. and two co-sponsors) increases the maximum penalty for ""straw buying"" a firearm from a federally licensed dealer — that is, buying a gun for someone else to evade a background check — to 15 years. It also bans the transfer of guns to someone the seller knows is prohibited from owning firearms, and makes it a crime to smuggle firearms out of the United States.

• The Assault Weapons Ban (Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and 22 co-sponsors) prohibits the sale, transfer and importation of assault rifles, including 157 specifically mentioned in the law. The definition is broader than the ban in place from 1994 to 2004 but grandfathers current lawful owners of assault weapons.

• The Large-Capacity Magazine Feeding Devices Amendment (Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J. and 21 co-sponsors) bans magazines and other devices holding more than 10 rounds. It exempts .22 caliber rifles, and ownership by current and former police officers for on- or off-duty use.

• The No Firearms for Foreign Felons Act (Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and three co-sponsors) expands the offenses that disqualify someone from purchasing a firearm to include felony convictions in foreign courts. But there's an exception if the convict can show a denial of due process or that the offense would not have been illegal in the United States."

The NRA’s clout in Congress rests primarily on its exaggerated reputation for invulnerability rather than on anything more tangible. During the 2012 political campaigns, the NRA spent $25 million on TV ads and $3 million more on lobbying. While these may sound like impressive numbers, in reality they amount to little more than chump change in a $6 billion campaign year. The implicit logic on Capitol Hill is that the gun lobby can’t be beaten because it hasn’t been beaten. No major gun legislation has made its way through Congress since former President Bill Clinton’s first term. With an estimated 300 million firearms in private hands, universal background checks for new gun purchases are far from a panacea. Obama is gambling that investing time and effort in the cause is more than just a feel-good gesture. For if the NRA cannot be beaten on this limited front—even after the horrors at Sandy Hook Elementary School—then we will never limit gun violence.

Is it any wonder that Americans dislike Congress so much? It shouldn't be a surprise because our representatives in Washington ignore public opinion. Gun control is the perfect example. A clear majority of people favors a ban on assault weapons (57 percent favor and 41 percent oppose, according to an ABC News/Washington Post poll). But members of Congress can't even agree on universal background checks which just about every living and breathing American favors. (91 percent according to ABC News/Washington Post.) [...] The debate over the federal budget is just another example of congressional indifference to public opinion. For years, the debate over the federal budget has mainly been about the federal budget deficit to the exclusion of any meaningful discussion about job creation. When President Obama formally introduces his budget for the 2014 fiscal year on Wednesday, it will be business as usual. We'll have a lot of talk about deficits but little debate about jobs. Everyone in Washington talks about the deficit but Americans outside our nation's capital worry about jobs. Not that anyone in Washington cares but the public disagrees with the tone of the budget discussion in D.C. A new Marist College poll shows that Americans want Congress to focus on creating jobs (62 percent of them anyway) more than they want deficit reduction (only 35 percent want that). If that doesn't work for you, the national Election Day exit poll showed that a lot more voters were worried about jobs (59 percent) than they were the deficit (15 percent).

For liberals, generally speaking, honoring procedures—means—is the core of what being ""principled"" means. For conservatives, fighting for the right outcome—ends—even at the expense of procedural nicety, is what being ""principled"" means. Think of it it, allegorically, this way: imagine in Washington DC, near Capitol Hill, a little old lady is crossing a hazardous street. A fastidious liberal congressmen, proud of always acting in a principled way in all things, stops to help her across the street—even though that means he might be late for a key vote (the sacrifice of an end, in itself, confirms his principled nature). A fastidious conservative congressman, on the other hand, leaves the lady to her fate and makes the vote (because the upholding of the end, in itself, is where honor lies—and dishonor rests, in the ultimate term of derision righties reserve for each other, in being a ""squish""). In short, if you're a conservative, isn't the point of an election to win, so you can bend the world to your will, no matter the means it takes to get there? Even if you don't necessarily have the majority's support?

The capitalist revival she sparked did not slow the over-financialization and deindustrialization of the economy, with clear and negative consequences in the 2008 financial crash. Her weakening of the unions also led to a regressively skewed distribution of wealth and, her critics said, a widening gap between rich and poor. Arguably, Mrs. Thatcher’s popular military successes made it easier for Mr. Blair to carelessly and recklessly follow George W. Bush into Iraq. But Mrs. Thatcher knew how to stand up to Ronald Reagan when she needed to — for example, over the ill-considered United States invasion of Grenada. She was one of the first Western leaders to recognize the reformist intentions of Mikhail Gorbachev, showed remarkable foresight on the dangers of climate change, and in general managed Britain’s global role more deftly than her successors.

The hallmarks of Thatcher’s legacy—the spending cuts, erosion of social democracy, union-busting and privatization—are alive and well within the Republican Party, particularly in GOP-controlled governors’ mansions. Following the Iron Lady’s death, Fox News’ Chris Stirewalt said hopefully that “there might be a Maggie Thatcher or two out there for the GOP.” In fact, he’s in luck: There are several."

Vice President Biden talks gun control in a Facebook forum

Biden says assault weapons are hard to aim

%22You don%27t need 30 rounds to defend yourself%2C%22 he says

WASHINGTON — Vice President Biden has a little advice for those critics of the administration's push to ban assault weapons and limit the size of ammunition clips who say such measures will make it more difficult to defend themselves: Buy a shotgun.

Speaking with Parents Magazine in a Facebook town hall on Tuesday, Biden said that he has advised his wife, Jill — if she ever has the need to protect herself at their home in Wilmington, Del. — that a double-barreled shotgun should be her weapon of choice.

""I said, 'Jill, if there's ever a problem, just walk out on the balcony here ... walk out and put that double-barrel shotgun and fire two blasts outside the house,"" Biden said.

The vice president went on to explain that popular assault weapons, such as the AR-15, are less useful for self-defense.

""You don't need an AR-15 — it's harder to aim, it's harder to use, and in fact you don't need 30 rounds to protect yourself,"" he said.

In the interview, Biden, who has been President Obama's point man on shepherding the White House's gun-control agenda, reiterated that he and the president are supporters of Second Amendment rights. But he also argued that the Constitution allows for the government to set limits on weaponry for the public good.

""How can I say this politely?"" said Biden, who noted his surprise at some of the questions that were culled from Parents Magazine readers. ""The Constitution does allow the government to conclude that there are certain types of weapons that no one can own. Now if that were not the case, then you should be able to go buy a flamethrower like the military ... if you're a billionaire you should be able to buy an F-15 … you should be able to buy an M-1 tank, you should be able to buy a machine gun, you should be able to buy a grenade launcher, and you can't do those things.""

Biden said that even if all of the president's agenda is implemented, it won't be an immediate cure-all for gun violence. But he argued the limitations are analogous to the ban on leaded gasoline implemented over nearly a quarter-century, suggesting that the tighter gun laws could have greater impact over time.

""It will not solve the whole problem, but we shouldn't continue to make (the same) mistakes,"" Biden said."

Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) revealed that some members of his party opposed expanding background checks for gun sales recently because they didn't want to ""be seen helping the president.""

Two weeks ago, only three Republican senators voted for the bipartisan background checks amendment sponsored by Toomey and Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), despite overwhelming popular support for such a measure.

""In the end it didn’t pass because we're so politicized. There were some on my side who did not want to be seen helping the president do something he wanted to get done, just because the president wanted to do it,” Toomey admitted on Tuesday in an interview with Digital First Media editors in the offices of the Times Herald newspaper in Norristown, Pa.

The Times Herald noted that in ""subsequent comments,"" Toomey ""tried to walk that remark part-way back by noting he meant to say Republicans across the nation in general, not just those in the Senate.""

Last week, Toomey placed more of the blame on the president himself, telling the Morning Call, ""I would suggest the administration brought this on themselves. I think the president ran his re-election campaign in a divisive way. He divided Americans. He was using resentment of some Americans toward others to generate support for himself.""

Manchin has argued, however, that the National Rifle Association's decision to score the vote was the main reason the compromise amendment on background checks failed. Without it, he believed, 70 senators -- well above the 60-vote threshold needed for passage -- would have supported it.

Opponents also pushed a significant amount of misinformation before the vote, including the myth that the legislation would lead to a federal gun registry. In fact, the bill would have made the creation of such a registry a felony carrying a prison sentence of up to 15 years.

Toomey was pessimistic on Tuesday about the prospects of gun legislation moving forward, saying it's ""not likely to happen any time soon.""

""The bill is available right now and Sen. (Majority leader Harry) Reid could bring it up for a vote at any time, but we need five people to change their minds,"" he said.

Sens. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.), Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) and other lawmakers who voted against the background checks legislation have seen drops in their poll numbers since opposing the legislation.

Toomey, on the other hand, has seen his poll numbers rise."

Senate will hold key procedural vote Thursday on gun legislation

President Obama has been pushing for gun-control measures in wake of several massacres

Deal would close loophole on purchases made at gun shows and online

WASHINGTON — Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa., announced a compromise bill Wednesday that would expand background checks for gun buyers, possibly paving the way for votes this week on a key piece of legislation aimed at reducing gun violence.

They announced the deal as the Senate gets ready for its most intense debate on gun control since 1994.

""I don't consider criminal background checks to be gun control. It's just common sense,"" Toomey said at a Capitol Hill news conference. ""If you pass ... you get to buy a gun. It's the people who fail that we don't want having guns.""

The deal would expand background checks to purchases made at gun shows and online sales of firearms. It would impose penalties on states that do not add records of felons and the mentally ill to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.

The agreement would not require private citizens to keep records of gun sales. It would specifically ban ""the federal government from creating a national firearms registry"" — a key sticking point for the pro-gun rights community.

The bill would also create a commission ""to study the causes of mass violence in the United States, looking at all aspects of the problem"" including guns, school safety, violent video games and mental health.

Background checks are currently required for purchases made through licensed gun dealers.

""We strengthen rights of law-abiding gun owners,"" Manchin said, explaining that the background checks are designed ""to keep people from having guns who shouldn't have them.""

Manchin, a red-state Democrat, and Toomey, a blue-state Republican, represent neighboring Appalachian states with strong gun cultures. Manchin said that common ground helped forge a compromise.

But the deal didn't win over the National Rifle Association, which remains opposed to any expansion of background checks. ""Expanding background checks at gun shows will not prevent the next shooting, will not solve violent crime and will not keep our kids safe in schools,"" said Andrew Arulanandam, a spokesman for the NRA. But he did say the private sale exemption in the compromise amendment was a ""positive development.""

The NRA did support a second agreement, brokered by Sens. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., and Susan Collins, R-Maine, to strengthen the penalty for straw purchasers and firearm trafficking.

That came in response to concerns about whether a law aimed at straw buyers — people who intentionally buy guns for those banned from owning them — would ensnare law-abiding citizens who legally buy guns as gifts or raffle prizes.

""We worked with the NRA and with several other senators to ensure that nothing in our bill infringes on the Second Amendment rights of lawful gun owners and purchasers, while still providing a strong new set of tools for law enforcement officials,"" Leahy said in a statement.

The proposed amendments come as the Senate prepares to hold a key procedural vote Thursday to allow a vote on the gun legislation, which has been pushed by President Obama in the wake of the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., that left 20 children and six adults dead.

Obama has been pushing for expanded background checks for gun buyers, as part of a package of new gun legislation aimed at reducing the kinds of gun violence seen in massacres in Newtown on Dec. 14 and a movie theater in Aurora, Colo., last July.

Other elements of Obama's package — particularly a ban on assault weapons and a limit on high-capacity ammunition clips — passed the Senate Judiciary Committee but are not included in the gun bill heading to the Senate floor. Most Republicans and even some Democrats from red states, such as Arkansas Sen. Mark Pryor, were opposed to the measure.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., said the assault weapons ban did not have the votes to pass, but he will allow it to be offered as an amendment.

Obama said in a statement Wednesday, ""This is not my bill, and there are aspects of the agreement that I might prefer to be stronger. But the agreement does represent welcome and significant bipartisan progress. It recognizes that there are good people on both sides of this issue, and we don't have to agree on everything to know that we've got to do something to stem the tide of gun violence.""

He added, ""The Senate must overcome obstruction by defeating a threatened filibuster, and allow a vote on this and other commonsense reforms to protect our kids and our communities. ""

Thursday's procedural vote is aimed at ending a threatened filibuster by more than a dozen Republicans, led by Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah. Lee said a filibuster would allow ""three more days to assess how the bill would impact the rights of law-abiding citizens.""

""This debate is not just about magazine clips and pistol grips,"" he said on the Senate floor. ""It's about the purpose of the Second Amendment."" Such far-reaching legislation should be subjected to a 60-vote majority to ensure bipartisan consensus, he said.

House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, declined to comment on the Senate compromise, or whether it would get a vote in the U.S. House.

Boehner has said the House will not take up any gun legislation until the Senate passes a bill. ""I want to wait and see what actually passes over in the Senate,"" Boehner said, when asked about the Manchin-Toomey compromise. ""I've made it clear: If the Senate passes a bill, the House will review it.""

Among supporters of stricter gun-safety laws, the Manchin-Toomey deal was reason for optimism.

As the families of Sandy Hook victims wept in the Senate gallery, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., took the floor this morning to commend their work to lobby Congress on the gun-safety legislation.

He called the Manchin-Toomey deal ""a promising and profoundly constructive turning point in this process"" that makes a vote much more likely.

USA TODAY

An advocacy group wants folks to boycott Starbucks on Saturday

The group wants Starbucks to ban guns from all of its stores nationwide

Starbucks has the legal right to prohibit firearms in its stores

The Starbucks siren suddenly has a gun to her head.

An advocacy group has called for ""Skip Starbucks Saturday"" this weekend — a nationwide boycott on Aug. 24, to pressure the coffee giant to amend its current policy, which allows customers to carry loaded guns into Starbucks stores where permitted by state law.

""Many moms are unaware that if they take their children to Starbucks, their children may be standing next to a customer who has a loaded weapon,"" says Shannon Watts, founder of the non-profit group Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. She says the group hopes to gather 25,000 signatures to ban guns at all U.S. Starbucks stores. She hopes to personally present the signatures to Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz.

The boycott is an attempt to place the world's biggest coffee chain — which prides itself on consumer advocacy — in the middle of one of the nation's hot-button social issues. Most major companies work to steer clear of such issues for fear of antagonizing customers. The boycott is a bid to force Starbucks to re-think its current policy, which it has previously said is gun-neutral, but which anti-gun groups have tagged as pro-gun.

""Our long-standing stance has been to comply with local laws in the communities we serve,"" says Starbucks spokesman Zack Hutson. ""We believe gun violence is a serious issue and something our elected officials should address.""

Hutson says Starbucks doesn't want its stores to be used as ""staging grounds"" for either side of the issue. Even then, he says, ""our policy is not changing.""

The move comes less than two weeks after gun rights advocates nationally sponsored a headline-grabbing ""Starbucks Appreciation Day,"" in which Starbucks customers toted guns into Starbucks stores, where permitted, including the Starbucks store in Newtown, Conn., which opted to close early that day. Critics dubbed the day ""Bring Your Gun to Starbucks Day.""

Starbucks currently allows guns in stores in 43 states — where states permit. But Starbucks has the legal right to prohibit firearms in its stores ""in the interest of customer safety,"" says Kim Russell, national director of outreach for Moms Demand Action.

In May, a female customer at a Starbucks store in St. Petersburg, Fla., was accidentally shot in the leg when another woman dropped her purse — which carried a gun that discharged.

""Starbucks is a progressive company that does a lot for the community,"" says Russell. ""That's why we hold them to a higher standard.""

She notes that Starbucks employees are not permitted to carry guns at work — even in states that allow them to do so.

But because Starbucks has not come down squarely against folks bringing guns into its stores, gun owners have increasingly been using Starbucks as gathering places, Russell says. ""We're just not feeling safe there anymore,"" she says."

Bill will include controversial language on background checks

Reid hopes talks may achieve compromise that would replace his background check language

Assault weapons ban will get a vote%2C but will not be in the bill

WASHINGTON -- Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Thursday that after the congressional recess, he will bring to the Senate floor a gun-violence bill that will include measures to expand background checks for gun purchases, strengthen trafficking laws and improve school safety.

Reid acknowledged that the background-check language he is including in the bill could change in the final product.

The current background-check language, authored by Sen. Charles Schumer, is serving as a place holder while the New York Democrat – along with Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Mark Kirk, R-Ill. – continue to negotiate a compromise with Republicans.

Republican Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma had initially been part of the negotiations, but he dropped out after the group could not come to an agreement over a requirement for private gun sellers to keep a record of their sales – a provision opposed by the National Rifle Association.

Reid said in a statement he is ""hopeful"" that negotiations will be successful over the two-week break.

""If a compromise is reached, I am open to including it in the base bill,"" Reid said. ""But I want to be clear: in order to be effective, any bill that passes the Senate must include background checks.""

The other two provisions in the gun-violence bill – increasing the penalty for trafficking firearms and expanding grants for school safety – are largely non-controversial and were approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee with bipartisan support.

Reid added that once debate on the bill begins, he will ""ensure"" that votes occur on a ban on assault weapons, high-capacity magazines and mental health provisions.

""In his State of the Union address, President Obama called for all of these provisions to receive votes, and I will ensure that they do,"" he said.

Reid created an uproar among supporters of stricter gun regulations Tuesday when he told reporters the assault weapons ban simply did not have enough support to be part of his broader gun bill."

NRA ad says Obama girls have armed protection in their school

Group calls Obama an %27elitist hypocrite%27 for opposing armed guards in all schools

White House issued angry response to mention of president%27s daughters

Before the policy fight could begin over the Obama administration's new proposals on gun regulation, the NRA had drawn intense criticism Wednesday for an ad critical of Obama that mentions his two children.

The ad calls Obama an ""elitist hypocrite"" because his daughters have Secret Service protection at their school, but the president has not embraced the NRA's proposal for armed security at all schools.

""Most Americans agree that a president's children should not be used as pawns in a political fight,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said Wednesday. ""But to go so far as to make the safety of the president's children the subject of an attack ad is repugnant and cowardly.""

The White House has discouraged coverage of Obama's daughters, Malia and Sasha, though they are regularly photographed accompanying their parents.

Donna Brazile, a former Democratic strategist, called the ad ""tasteless, mean-spirited and totally out of bounds.''

""It's wrong to target in advertising the family of the president of the United States, regardless of the issue,'' says John Weaver, a Republican consultant who worked for presidential candidates John McCain and Jon Huntsman. He called the ad ""tone-deaf'' and said the NRA is not in tune with public opinion after the Sandy Hook shootings. ""If they're trying to appeal to the broad cross section of America, or they're trying to appeal to swing votes in the Congress, this was not their best first step they could have taken. It comes across as unhinged.''

Political talk show host and former congressman Joe Scarborough, a Republican, said the ad, coupled with a new NRA shooting game mobile app, indicates the NRA is ""now a fringe organization. … What the NRA once was, it no longer is. This extremism is so frightening and so over the line.''

Like many issue ads, the video is barely appearing on television but was widely reported by news media after being posted online late Tuesday. It appears on the Sportsman Channel during an NRA-produced talk show.

In the ad, which doesn't show pictures of the Obama girls, a narrator says, ""Are the president's kids more important than yours? Then why is he skeptical about putting armed security in our schools, when his kids are protected by armed guards at their school? Mr. Obama demands the wealthy pay their fair share of taxes, but he's just another elitist hypocrite when it comes to a fair share of security. Protection for their kids and gun-free zones for ours.''

In 1999, eight months after the Columbine shootings, NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre told members at the group's annual convention that armed guards or police in schools should be a ""rare exception.'' After the Sandy Hook shootings, LaPierre announced an NRA proposal to put an armed guard in every school.

NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam said the ad is not about the Obama girls. ""If anyone thinks we're talking specifically about someone's children, they're missing the point completely,'' he said Wednesday. ""This isn't an issue about comparing the president's kids. This is an issue about school safety and protecting all our children, regardless of tax bracket and how important their parents are. The intent of our ad is to make sure that we point out that there is a double standard that exists.''

The ad includes images of New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., Vice President Joe Biden – all advocates of an assault weapons ban and other gun-control legislation – and NBC correspondent David Gregory. Obama said in an interview with Gregory that aired Dec. 30 that said he is ""skeptical that the only answer is putting more guns in schools.""

A second video on the NRA.org website accuses Gregory of a double standard, citing a report from a conservative website that Gregory's children attend the same school as the Obama girls.

""NBC News firmly objects to the use of our journalists in any political ad,'' spokeswoman Erika Masonhall said in a statement.

Obama announced a plan for combating gun violence Wednesday, appearing with four children who had written to him asking him to stop gun violence. Kathleen McKinley, a conservative blogger, said neither side should be using children to stir emotions. ""You can't be outraged about using Obama's kids, if you're not outraged about Obama using other people's children. Both sides: Stop it,'' she said."

Responding to the blowback from skeptics who doubted Obama was telling the unvarnished truth (Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) challenged Obama to a skeet shooting contest), the White House not only released a photo of Obama shooting skeet, but White House press secretary Jay Carney also tried to water down Obama’s statement.

Carney claimed Obama had “never pretended to or suggested that he had grown up as a hunter or engaging in sports activities with weapons.” According to the White House spokesman, “[Obama] simply said that he had, and this is the truth, that he had enjoyed shooting at Camp David. That’s a fact.”

He went on to explain why the photo had been released while continuing to assert that Obama’s comments about shooting had been entirely unplanned:

The fact is the president was asked a question–did not volunteer, but was asked a question about whether or not he had ever shot a weapon. He answered with the truth, which is that he has enjoyed shooting competitively with friends at Camp David on multiple occasions… there were persistent questions about this, and we decided to release a photo of the president shooting at Camp David.

Obama told The New Republic that he was a skeet shooter, stating, “Yes, in fact, up at Camp David, we do skeet shooting all the time. Not the girls, but oftentimes guests of mine go up there.”

When asked whether Obama liked skeet or trap shooting better, Carney replied that Obama “has gotten better” at shooting."

Story highlights NRA promises to release new ads, criticize 'so-called universal background checks' Group has actively opposed gun control measures backed by President Obama One past ad questions why Obama's children have armed security, other students do not Other groups have released their own ads, calling for stricter gun control measures

The National Rifle Association is heading back to the airwaves with yet another round of ads aimed at fighting gun-control initiatives circulating in Washington.

The advocacy group announced earlier this week that its CEO, Wayne LaPierre, would unveil the new ad campaign Saturday night from Salt Lake City during a speech at the Western Hunting and Conservation Expo.

In the same statement saying LaPierre would showcase new ads, the NRA said he would also “confront the real consequences of so-called ‘universal background checks.’”

As it turned out, LaPierre did not mention any new advertising in his remarks. But he did – as he has done passionately in the past – rail against President Barack Obama and other Democrats and the background checks that he said are “at the very heart of their anti-gun agenda.”

“This so-called universal background check that you’re hearing about all over the media … is aimed at one thing: It’s aimed at registering your guns,” LaPierre claimed. “And when another tragic opportunity presents itself, that registry will be used to confiscate your guns.”

The ads are the NRA’s latest salvo in the gun debate, attempting to influence the public – and, thus, lawmakers – to challenge a fresh gun-control push, one that the NRA CEO called “the single most devastating attack on the Second Amendment that this country has ever seen.”

The influential lobbying group has been vocal since Obama called for action in the days after the mass shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, that left 20 students and six adults dead.

Afterward, NRA leaders said they would work with local officials to get more qualified armed guards in schools, while sharply resisting proposals to ban assault weapons, limit the size of gun magazines and to expand the system of background checks for firearms purchases.

The NRA efforts include advertisements such as the one, broadcast in mid-January, that described Obama as an “elitist hypocrite” because his two daughters are protected while at school by armed federal agents and yet he is “skeptical” about having armed personnel at all schools.

The White House blasted that ad, as did members of both political parties, for injecting the president’s children into the debate (and not acknowledging they may face different threats than other American schoolchildren).

But NRA President David Keene defended the spot on CNN, saying, “What we’re talking about is folks who have protections for their own children, … then pooh-pooh the idea that the average American’s children should have the same sort of protection.”

The gun rights organization also posted a web video that month asserting Obama’s attempts to enact gun control laws would result in the “confiscation” of people’s firearms.

More recently, the NRA ran ads in newspapers in five states – Arkansas, Louisiana, Maine, North Carolina and West Virginia – with the headline: “Will Obama’s gun control proposals work? His own experts say ‘No.’”

Democratic incumbent senators in three of those states are facing tough reelection fights, another is retiring and in the fifth, Maine, moderate Republican Sen. Susan Collins is up for reelection next year.

That ad buy, which also includes regional publications and online commercials, will cost the NRA about $350,000, a source familiar with it told CNN.

This follows the spending of about $100,000 to air a web video on various news sites in Alaska, Arkansas, Louisiana, Colorado, South Dakota and the District of Columbia.

The NRA has been successful in the past in thwarting gun-control legislation by building support on the grass-roots level, and that is where the group is focusing much of its efforts now.

Still, the organization has a challenge, given the horrific nature of the Newtown massacre – coming on the heels of several other mass shootings – and the high priority that Obama is placing on gun control. It also has competition in terms of ads, with groups such as MoveOn.org and Mayors Against Illegal Guns taking to newspapers and the airwaves themselves to push for stricter gun control measures."

The Des Moines Register

EMC Insurance of Des Moines insures 85 percent to 90 percent of all Kansas school districts

Company refuses to renew coverage for schools allowing teachers%2C custodians to carry weapons

Insurance officials say decision all about risk

DES MOINES, Iowa -- A new Kansas law allowing gun owners to carry weapons in public buildings, including schools, has thrust a major Des Moines-based insurer into the national gun control debate.

The EMC Insurance Cos. insures 85 percent to 90 percent of all Kansas school districts and has refused to renew coverage for schools that permit teachers and custodians to carry concealed firearms on their campuses under the new law, which took effect July 1. It's not a political decision, but a financial one based on the riskier climate it estimates would be created, the insurer said.

""We've been writing school business for almost 40 years, and one of the underwriting guidelines we follow for schools is that any on-site armed security should be provided by uniformed, qualified law enforcement officers,"" said Mick Lovell, EMC's vice president for business development. ""Our guidelines have not recently changed.""

The Kansas Legislature passed the law after the fatal shootings of 20 elementary school children in Newtown, Conn., in December.

The law is similar to one in Utah. Around the country, firearms groups have called on schools to let teachers and staff carry weapons to protect children and prevent mass shootings.

A smaller Des Moines-area insurer — Continental Western Group, based in Urbandale — has followed EMC's lead with a similar position in response to the new law, according to the Kansas Association of School Boards' insurance program.

So has Wright Specialty Insurance, based in New York.

As of Saturday, no Kansas school districts had adopted a policy of allowing people with concealed carry permits on their campuses as permitted under the new law, said David Shriver, director of the Kansas school board association's insurance program.

Bob Skow, chief executive officer of the Independent Insurance Agents of Iowa, said he's not surprised by the companies' decisions. Insurance is all about risk and about pricing the cost of coverage in a way that correctly reflects it. That's one of the reasons many schools have gotten rid of their trampolines, he said.

""It's one thing to have a trained peace officer with a gun in school; it's a completely different situation when you have a custodian or a teacher with a gun,"" Skow said. ""That changes the risk of insuring a school and magnifies it considerably.""

Insurers simply don't know how to price the added risk yet, he said, but they know it's there.

While a trampoline can hurt one person, modern weapons have the potential to kill many people very quickly, he said, in a reference to Newtown. Adam Lanza, 20, fatally shot 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School there Dec. 14 before taking his own life.

Other shootings at schools include the 1999 shootings at Columbine High School, which caused 15 deaths and 21 injuries, and a 2007 shooting spree at Virginia Tech, which produced 33 deaths and 23 injuries. Mass shootings have claimed 934 lives in 146 shootings over the past seven years, according to a study by USA TODAY.

After the Newtown shootings, the National Rifle Association and its political allies called for an armed officer in every school. As stated on the NRA's website, the organization blames ""Gun-Free School Zones"" for turning American schools into the ""safest place to inflict maximum mayhem with minimum risk.""

NRA opponents have called for stricter gun control to reduce the availability of firearms. Ladd Everitt, director of communications for the Washington, D.C.-based Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, said he wasn't surprised that EMC and other insurers were balking at covering the risk of the new Kansas law.

""This is a logical response from insurers to a risk nightmare,"" Everitt said. ""Putting a teacher or an administrator with little firearms training in a school with a loaded weapon is clearly a threat to everyone, including the kids.""

Forrest Knox, the Kansas state senator who is the chief advocate of the new gun law, maintains that having legal guns in schools and other government buildings could prevent injuries. He's been pushing the legislation for years.

Knox said that local governments are free to opt out of the law allowing weapons in public buildings, but only 300 of the 3,000 counties and municipalities in Kansas have sent letters to the state attorney general seeking exemptions.

He said three community colleges in and around his district in Altoona, Kan., have found an insurer who will work with them. Shriver, the Kansas school board group insurance director, identified the company as IMA, or Insurance Management Association, which he described as a brokerage that would market the coverage to different companies.

He identified the schools as Independence Community College, Labette Community College and Neosho County Community College.

""I'm not an insurance expert, but it's hard for me to believe that if schools and other public buildings allow law-abiding citizens to carry that that increases risk — it's news to me,"" Knox said. ""Law enforcement responds better (to school shootings now), but it still takes a few minutes, and a lot of damage can be done in a few minutes."""

Dianne Feinstein, said Tuesday.

The California Democrat said her party’s leaders told her that her legislation, approved last week in the Senate Judiciary Committee in a party-line vote, could be offered as an amendment to the larger bill.

Feinstein expressed disappointment that her attempt to revive the 1994 ban was dropped to clear the way for other measures. “I very much regret it. I tried my best. But my best, I guess, wasn’t good enough,” Feinstein said before heading into the Senate Democrats’ strategy luncheon.

Feinstein’s bill would prohibit the sale, import and manufacture of more than 150 weapons and ban ammunition magazines that can accept more than 10 rounds. People who already legally own assault weapons – 3.5 million to 4 million, by one estimate – would be allowed to keep them. Sale of existing weapons would require buyers to undergo background checks.

Spurred by the December massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., the Senate Judiciary Committee passed four gun bills. In addition to Feinstein’s assault weapons ban, the committee moved bills to expand background checks for gun buyers, crack down on gun trafficking and allocate money to improve school safety. The assault weapons ban was always seen as the most politically challenging of the recommendations produced by the Obama administration.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said he was taking a pragmatic view of which measures could attract the 60 votes needed to pass the Senate and move to the House. “Her amendment, using the most optimistic numbers, has 40 votes,” he said.

The other three bills will be rolled into one bill, which could put pressure on Republicans and conservative Democrats to get on board. That bill has not been crafted yet, because senators are waiting on a possible bipartisan compromise on the background check measure.

On the floor, senators would probably have a chance to vote on an amendment that would add both a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines, and then on another amendment that would add just the limits on magazine size.

Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), who opposes stricter gun control, said he was not surprised Reid would drop the assault weapons ban, saying it was “primarily focused on cosmetics, not on function.”

“I also think as a political matter that Sen. Reid’s loath to have a bunch of red-state Democrats running in [2014] have to vote on that. That explains the strategy,” Cornyn, a former chairman of the Senate Republican campaign committee, said.

Feinstein vowed not to give up, even floating – but immediately dismissing – the idea of placing a hold on a broader gun bill that doesn’t include the assault weapons ban. She blamed her bill’s troubles in part on the political and financial power of the main gun lobby, the National Rifle Assn.

“America has to stand up,” she said. “I can’t fight the NRA. The NRA spends unlimited sums, backed by the gun manufacturers, who are craven in my view. And I don’t know what else to do other than the best we can in drafting a bill in asking for support and in enabling something to pass in the Senate.”

HUCKABEE: People do forget that. And by the way, [caller] know, that when you bring that up you get people who get crazy on us, and they’ll start saying, “Oh there you go comparing to the Nazis.” And I understand the reaction, but it’s the truth. You cannot take people’s rights away if they’re resisting and if they have the means to resist, but once they’re disarmed and the people who are trying to take over have all the power, not just political, not just financial, but they have the physical power to domesticate us and to subjugate us to our will there’s not a whole lot we can do about it other than just plan to die in the course of resistance. […] In every society and culture where dictators take over, one of the things they have to do is get control of the military and the police and ultimately all of the citizens and make sure the citizens are disarmed and can’t fight in the streets. Gosh I hope it doesn’t come to that.

Radio host and perennial ""prominent Republican"" Mike Huckabee is rapidly becoming what Rush Limbaugh used to be 20 years ago. (What Rush is now we'll leave as the topic for another time.) Here Huckabee is embracing the far-right militia logic of violence and conspiracy theories with open arms, and then some Getting the first thing out of the way, no, it's not true; the Nazi regime weakened gun regulations, it didn't strengthen them. That's a lost cause, however, as it's one of the conservative ""facts"" that will stick around until long after the fall of civilization itself, and even after that, as future alien archeologists will be finding primitive cave paintings of Hitler taking people's guns away and displaying them in their alien museums as the one of the few remaining artifacts of western culture. So we're just going to ignore that part.

What's more interesting to me is that Mike Huckabee, the once supposedly reasonable Republican, continues to peddle crackpot, militia-level conspiracy theories to his audience with no apparent shame—but gosh, I hope it doesn't come to that, he says. The core notion is that we need lots and lots of guns in case patriots need to start murdering the government, so it goes without saying that fighting off even the most basic of gun safety efforts is a noble, patriotic clause. The current rate of mass murders and other random killings aren't the symptom of a problem, in this mindset, they're just the necessary validation that the citizenry does indeed have enough access to high-powered weaponry to murder a very large number of people quickly if any single one of them feels like it. Forget talk of well-regulated; any talk of regulating the ability of any one random person to commit such acts is tantamount to nascent dictatorship.

These people, the ostentatiously Christian Mike Huckabee included, look to the prospect of potential mass murder against the government as a perfectly valid political position to have. They look to such acts as potential patriotism; others would call the same thing terrorism, but all terrorists consider themselves patriots for one cause or another. The rather unusual thing about this particular crowd is how circular the logic is. They need to be able to murder the government if the government appears to be taking actions that limit their ability to murder that government, and that's usually the extent of the argument. Not as a group, mind you, but as individual citizens, each making the decision as to what would require government assassinations on their own, based on their own internal logic, armed with enough firepower by themselves to inflict enough necessary ""damage"" to make their point.

That's now the advocated-for position among everything from conservative radio hosts to the National Rifle Association to any number of obviously unhinged, heavily armed YouTube video hosts. How is that not nuts?

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/01/14/obama-again-warns-congressional-republicans-will-not-negotiation-on-debt/,2013-01-14 00:00:00,[],"Obama: No haggling on debt ceiling, can use executive action to tighten gun laws","President Obama on Monday warned congressional Republicans again that he will not negotiate over the debt ceiling, saying Washington must increase the limit to pay its bills and that such brinksmanship would be “absurd” and “irresponsible.”

“The issue here is whether Washington will pay its bills,” Obama said in the final press conference of his first term. “We are not a deadbeat nation.”

The president’s comments opened the roughly 30-minute White House question-and-answer session with reporters that focused largely on the debt ceiling and Obama’s gun-control plans in the aftermath of last month’s mass shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., in which 26 were killed.

Obama, who vowed following the Dec. 14 massacre to curb gun violence, repeated his promise.

“If there is a step we can take that will save even one child from what happened in Newtown, we should take that step,” said the president, who is expected to get strong opposition from gun rights groups should he submit legislation to Congress, as expected.

Obama also suggested such groups are publicizing what appears to be strong turnouts at gun shows as “an effective way of ginning up fear on the part of gun owners that somehow the federal government is about to take all of your guns.”

Andrew Arulanandam, a National Rifle Association spokesman said, “The president should go talk to the people buying firearms and ask them why they're buying firearms.""

Obama also said some of his proposed changes will require legislation and some of them can be accomplished through executive action.

The president used the press conference to attempt to frame the debt limit issue to the American public as one about the perils of not paying past debts – not about future spending.

“Raising the debt ceiling does not authorize more spending,” he said. “These are bills that have already been racked up.”

Republicans leaders responded by saying the debit limit debate is connected to spending, suggesting another round of intense negotiations when Congress returns later this month.

""The American people do not support raising the debt ceiling without reducing government spending at the same time,” said House Speaker John Boehner. “The House will do its job and pass responsible legislation that controls spending, meets our nation's obligations and keeps the government running, and we will insist that the Democratic majority in Washington do the same.""

Boehner's remarks were in sharp contrast to those of Obama, who said near the start of the press conference that he won re-election on his plan, which separates the debt ceiling from talks about reducing the U.S. deficit through spending cuts and increasing tax revenue through closing loopholes.

Obama argued he has already reduced federal spending by $1.2 trillion over the past two years but remains willing to talk about more cuts, including some to Medicare.

Still, the president acknowledged the Republican-controlled House likely has enough votes to demand spending cuts be part of the debate, which would result in no increase to the debt limit and the county defaulting on its bills.

The House nearly did that in summer 2011.

The chamber returns to negotiate with the Democrat-controlled Senate and the White House on three fiscal matters with looming deadlines: the debt ceiling, massive federal spending cuts known as sequester and a budget resolution.

The talks resume because Washington again failed after the November elections to reach a long-term solution to the country’s debt and deficit issues.

Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said Obama and his allies need to get serious about spending and that the debt limit debate is “the perfect time for it.”

The Kentucky senator also called the county’s debt and deficit a “huge, huge problem.""

On a question about Obama nominating only men to his Cabinet for his second term, the president told critics to wait until his selections are complete “before they rush to justice.”"

Haley Barbour at the Conservative Political Action Conference in 2011, where he might not be so welcome this year.

Last week, at a closed-door retreat in northern Virginia, Barbour told a large gathering of congressional staffers, including several leadership aides, that party officials should discourage donors from funding the high-profile conservative group [...] Many in the audience applauded Barbour for his remarks, according to two sources in the room.

While Karl Rove is off doing battle against the tea party, Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour (a top figure in his party) has opened a new front in the GOP Civil War.Mainstream Republicansbe upset at the Club for Growth's self-destructive tendencies. They had their heyday in the 2010 GOP wave by backing conservative insurgents like Sens. Ron Johnson, Marco Rubio, (former CfG prez) Pat Toomey, and Rand Paul. On the other hand, they help cost the GOP the Senate by helping Sharron Angle and Ken Buck defeat more electable candidates in their primaries.

In 2012, they were one of the earliest backers of Richard Mourdock's primary challenge in Indiana, an effort that cost Republicans the seat in the general. On the other hand, they backed the more electable candidate in Arizona's Senate race (Jeff Flake, who ended up winning in the general), and were a major factor in Ted Cruz's primary victory in Texas. Cruz, of course, is now auditioning for the role of ""2013's Allen West"" to great conservative acclaim.

Compared to Karl Rove's track record, the Club has been a success!

But ""success"" and ""elections"" are all relative terms when it comes to the GOP, a party that has now lost the popular vote in five of the last six presidential elections, lost seats in a year where the map was theirs for the taking, and lost the popular vote in the House, holding it by virtue of their own aggressive gerrymandering.

This is a party getting blown out of the water by the nation's fastest-growing demographics—Asians, Latinos, and millennials, not to mention women, the largest single voting block. They are a party that claims to ""reinvent"" itself in weekly confabs, only to find itself trapped in a political Groundhog Day.

Barbour is right when he says, ""Politics can’t be about purity. Unity wins in politics, purity loses."" Problem is, they created a monster designed solely to instill such purity, and they can't put that genie back in the bottle. This isn't like the old days, when the John Birchers were kept outside the GOP tent. These days, the crazies run the joint."

http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-06-21/news/ct-met-illinois-concealed-carry-0621-20130621_1_gun-bill-quinn-spokeswoman-brooke-anderson-carry-bill,2013-06-21 00:00:00,"['Ray Long', 'Rafael Guerrero']",Concealed carry bill could provide face-saver for Quinn,"— With a fast-approaching federal court deadline to allow people to legally carry concealed weapons in Illinois, the political groundwork is being laid to let Gov. Pat Quinn stand tall on gun control while lawmakers prepare to override him if he breaks their delicately constructed compromise.

The political maneuvering is the result of a gun bill the General Assembly approved before adjourning at the end of May. A federal appeals court had thrown out the state's long-standing, last-in-the-nation concealed-carry ban but put a hold on its ruling until lawmakers came up with a law spelling out who can carry weapons and where they can take them.

The bill that landed on Quinn's desk is a mixed bag for a liberal Democratic governor with a long record of supporting tight gun control measures. On the one hand, the bill would ban guns from places like casinos, schools, stadiums the CTA and Metra. And it would preserve assault weapons bans already in place in Chicago, Cook County and elsewhere.

But both sides of the gun debate acknowledge the bill would allow handguns with 19 rounds to be carried in public. And the legislation would override local laws dealing with handguns, ammunition and restrictions on how to transport weapons from town to town.

Legislative leaders in both parties expect a scenario to unfold over the next couple of weeks that allows Quinn to save face and lawmakers to stick to what they voted for: The governor will veto or make changes to the bill and lawmakers then will override him and put the law on the books.

""I think he's going to veto or amendatorily veto the bill, requiring us to come back in the session to act on that veto,"" said Senate President John Cullerton, D-Chicago.

In addition, the gun bill's sponsor said House Speaker Michael Madigan on Wednesday went over the process for how to handle a Quinn veto or rewrite. ""There was talk brought up that the speaker had heard that the governor is expected to file an amendatory veto or a veto,"" said Rep. Brandon Phelps, D-Harrisburg.

Lawmakers are being told to prepare to come back to Springfield on July 8. The significance of that date? It's the day before Quinn's suggested deadline for lawmakers to come up with a solution for the state's heavily underfunded pension funds. It's also the day before the federal court order to invalidate the state's ban on concealed carry is scheduled to take effect.

The Quinn administration says little more than the governor is ""very carefully"" reviewing the bill. Quinn spokeswoman Brooke Anderson also noted Thursday: ""The governor has a long history of fighting violence. Public safety is always his top priority.""

Sen. Kwame Raoul, a South Side Democrat who played a leading role in concealed carry negotiations, said he talked to Quinn before and after the concealed carry bill passed. Raoul said Quinn is still concerned about a variety of provisions, ranging from businesses that don't want gun-toting customers having to post signs ""all over the place"" to giving towns without bans on assault weapons only 10 days to enact an ordinance once the bill becomes law.

""The governor's concerned that signing the bill might reflect too much of a concession,"" said Raoul, who predicted Quinn will issue some type of veto. ""He is still challenged with the end product.""

Legislative leaders don't seem worried about what Quinn ends up doing.

""At the end of the day,"" Madigan said, ""if the governor were to veto or to offer an amendatory veto, he'll be overridden.""

Whatever Quinn decides, lawmakers are just hoping he does it soon. On Thursday, nearly two dozen Senate Democrats led by Cullerton and Sen. Gary Forby, the lead sponsor from Benton in southern Illinois, sought to increase pressure on Quinn to act ""as soon as possible"" so lawmakers can respond, if necessary, to avoid a ""public safety and constitutional crisis.""

""Time is of the essence,"" the letter said.

For Quinn, the decision on the concealed carry bill is both a matter of policy and politics.

Quinn faces re-election next year, and a Democratic primary looms against either former White House chief of staff Bill Daley or Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan, the speaker's daughter. Daley already has suggested that Quinn should veto the bill or toughen it up and send it back to lawmakers.

Cook County voters who account for the bulk of Democratic primary votes are overwhelmingly in favor of gun control. Taking a strong pro-gun control stand even if lawmakers end up overriding him allows Quinn to turn a loss into a potential win. Speaker Madigan said he expects Quinn to take action ""designed to advance his campaign for re-election.""

Quinn has shown he is willing to use his authority to propose changes in legislation that promote his own political views even if the chances of getting lawmakers to go along are slim. Last year he took a low-profile gun bill and inserted a semi-automatic assault weapons ban in the wake of shootings at a theater in Aurora, Colo. Lawmakers ignored his proposal.

For his part, Quinn has urged Attorney General Madigan to file an appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court of the ruling that tossed out Illinois' ban. But she has called for passing legislation that would resolve the court battle. She's also exploring her legal options if no carry law is put on the books. The deadline for her to decide whether to appeal to the Supreme Court is July 24, but she wants to see what the governor does.

Nobody knows for sure what will happen if Illinois can't get a law in place by the July 9 appeals court deadline. Still, fissures are emerging that may foreshadow a state of confusion."

Dargan (D-New Haven), co-chairman of the state’s Public Safety Committee, has introduced a bill that would make public the names and addresses of gun permit holders in Connecticut under the state’s Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).

Dargan’s bill is in response to the Dec. 14th shootings in the Sandy Hook School in Newtown, CT, and also occurs as a Westchester County, NY newspaper, the Journal News, is drawing widespread, nationwide anger for publishing a map with the names and addresses of gun permit holders. The bill, if passed, would reverse the state legislature’s decision, made nearly two decades ago, to protect gun permit holders’ personal information from disclosure.

Connecticut’s General Assembly will return to Hartford next week, when a five-month session will begin, one in which gun control is expected to be a dominant issue. The state has some of the toughest gun control laws in the country, yet is one of the most lenient toward serious crimes, having just repealed the death penalty last spring, and having passed, in 2011, a controversial early release amendment for some prisoners who demonstrate good behavior while incarcerated.

“Most things are FOIA-able now,” Dargan said in an interview Thursday. “Go to the local city clerk’s office and you can find out where Steve Dargan owns property. I don’t know why a responsible gun owner is worried about whether a permit for a revolver is FOIA-able or not.”

Dargan added that in a “computer age” it is reasonable for people to want to know gun ownership information. “Maybe their kids are going over to Johnny Smith’s and maybe they want to see whether they have guns in the house.”

The bill has drawn criticism from both Robert Crook, executive director of the Coalition of Connecticut Sportsmen, and Richard Burgess, head of Connecticut Carry, a nonprofit group that advocates for citizens’ right to bear arms as provided for in the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.

“It’s a tool for criminals,” Crook said. “You don’t see the pistol permit holders in the newspapers. They just don’t break the law, normally.” Crook added that Adam Lanza, the presumed shooter in the Newtown massacre, broke many laws leading up to the shootings, starting with stealing his mother’s legally owned guns.

“I don’t have a solution,” said Crook. “But I don’t think releasing the names of handgun owners will have an effect…except to give some people, and I mean criminals, an option.”

Burgess also criticized the proposed legislation. “It’s crazy for someone to think this is a good idea,” he said. “I can only see harm that could come from it. Do we want to give criminals access to a database that tells you where every handgun in Connecticut is?”

Dargan said he introduced the bill because “people want to have a discussion” about guns after perhaps “the worst school tragedy in history, with kids who are just learning how to tie their shoes gunned down by a madman.”"

""The Second Amendment!"" was shouted by several gun enthusiasts in the meeting room as Neil Heslin, holding a photo of his 6-year-old son, Jesse Lewis, asked why Bushmaster assault-style weapons are allowed to be sold in the state.

The Connecticut Post , via Joe. My. God. I'm going to put ""heckling the father of murdered six year old"" right at the top of my updated list of signs that America can safely ignore you, or at least not give a single flying shit as to what supposed rights you think you have, but I do want to reiterate one point: For a sizable percentage of America's most aggressive gun fetishists (not ""enthusiasts,"" please—there's a difference between shooting as a hobby and stockpiling guns as your own personal anti-government, anti-society religion) the ability to quickly murder a classroom or two of elementary school kids isn't a bug. It's a feature.

This would be the prime argument of all the loons citing incipient ""tyranny"" as the reason they deserve guns, and all possible guns at that. If you're claiming that you need your guns because you might need to murder members of the government (yes, that is what ""fighting tyranny"" comes down to, when you're doing it with stockpiled ammunition), then the ability to murder a large number of people quickly is a prime feature. These aren't people who mumble about needing high capacity, military style weaponry because today's modern deer really need 30 or so shots pumped into them before they'll stay down—they're perfectly blunt about saying they need it because someday, there's gonna be ""tyranny,"" and if they themselves wake up one morning and decide that ""tyranny"" has come they need to be able to go to their closet, arm up, and start killing people who think otherwise. Often, for some reason that most of the rest of us can't even begin to parse, it's couched in crackpot religious terms, often citing ""prophesies"" and other Jesus-sounding stuff as the reason why potential mass murder is, well, just around the corner.

That someone can easily dispatch a roomful or two of elementary school children, or college students, or theater-goers, or restaurant-goers with these same weapons is not seen by these people as something that needs fixing—at all. Yes, it's sad that those particular people got murdered, but whether Americans have the God-given right to murder a large number of people quickly, and easily, if they feel the circumstances warrant it is something the tyranny fetishists will go to their graves, or your grave, or the local sheriff's grave believing in.

The other tricky part of this is that (of course) the people most obsessed with defending themselves against government ""tyranny"" are the people who see ""tyranny"" in absolutely everything. The United Nations is coming for them; Barack Obama is a crazy Marxist; bicycle paths are a sign of the devil. The most unhinged people among us are the people who have volunteered themselves as the judges, juries, and executioners of any American government figures they've decided they don't like—and those are the people that a large segment of our no-gun-regulations-ever crowd are catering to. Why? You could suppose the NRA, as obvious example, is merely acting as passthru for the manufacturer's lobby, which makes a very sizable income off of crazy frightened people, or you could suppose them to be unironic believers in the tyranny theory of American proto-terrorists someday becoming American freedom fighters—but why does the we'd like to maybe someday be able to kill members of the government theory get so much mainstream love from supposedly mainstream sources?

It seems rather obvious that we could take all the arguments as to why one might need a 30-round clip because of potential tyranny and just flush that entire population from legitimate discussion. If tyranny does come to America, your little closet stockpile is not going to do a damn bit of good against the Air Force, and basing all our public safety decisions around your own little delusion that it might, someday, is not a very good reason for our continued enabling of frequent, convenient mass murder. So that seems a good first step: If you're arguing that people need to be able to speedily murder other people because someday you and your little band of societal malcontents may want to murder the right people, the ones who really need murdering, all of the policymakers concerned with American public safety ought to write off your opinions on the matter from the outset. Then the rest of us can begin to have a discussion on guns in America that isn't objectively, you know, insane.

“The whole family?” Mr. Foer asked.

“Not the girls,” he said, “but oftentimes guests of mine go up there. And I have a profound respect for the traditions of hunting that trace back in this country for generations. And I think those who dismiss that out of hand make a big mistake.”

Mr. Obama went on to say that the reality of guns in urban areas differs from that in rural areas. “So it’s trying to bridge those gaps that I think is going to be part of the biggest task over the next several months,” he said. “And that means that advocates of gun control have to do a little more listening than they do sometimes.”

The skeet-shooting comment caught many off guard because it is not something the president has talked about. While other presidents have used the skeet-shooting range at Camp David, database searches of Mr. Obama’s speeches and interviews turned up no mention of participating.

“I would refer you simply to his comments,” Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, told reporters who asked after the interview was published how often the president shoots. “I don’t know how often. He does go to Camp David with some regularity, but I’m not sure how often he’s done that.”

Asked why no one had seen a picture or heard about it before, Mr. Carney said, “Because when he goes to Camp David, he goes to spend time with his family and friends and relax, not to produce photographs.”

That did not satisfy the skeptics. The Washington Post’s “Fact Checker” column cast doubt on the claim, while Fox News quoted an unnamed person saying Mr. Obama had participated once during a Marine competition at Camp David but not “all the time.” Representative Marsha Blackburn, Republican of Tennessee, went on CNN to question the assertion."

-- President Obama at a Connecticut campaign event calling for firearms restrictions.

President Obama said that it would be “a tough day” in his presidency if Congress failed to pass legislation in response to the December massacre at a Connecticut grade school.

It looks like the president has a tough day or two ahead.

The provision Obama is pushing hardest now is an expansion of background checks for gun purchases. That would not have affected the Newtown killer, since he did not purchase the weapons used in the killings, but rather took them from his mother, whom he also killed.

The only gun-control provision on offer that advocates say might have lessened the death toll – a ban on the sale of new high-capacity magazines – has been declared not viable in the Democratic Senate due to a lack of support within the president’s party. And even that measure would only have reduced the death toll in Newtown if it had been in place when the killer’s mother purchased the weapons long ago.

The left’s most sought and now most lamented measure – a ban on civilian firearms mocked up to look like military models – was also nixed by a lack of Democratic support. And even that would have been of little use in Newtown, again providing that it was in place when the killer’s mother purchased the weapons.

One measure in the remaining pool of viability that might prevent future school shootings – an increase in federal grants for school safety – could pass easily with bipartisan support. But tossing some money at the problem doesn’t exactly sound like a response to Obama’s call that “as a society… we must change.”

Having failed to develop a legislative package that addressed the causes of the slaughter in Connecticut, Obama and his allies fell back to old Democratic standbys on gun control from the 1990s. And those measures don’t have as much to do with mass shootings or school shootings as they do with street crime and gun registration.

So often the case in his presidency, he and those he tasked with producing legislation, in this case, Vice President Joe Biden, could neither innovate nor develop consensus, even within Obama’s party. Whether a stimulus spending package, a new health-insurance entitlement, bank regulations, global warming fees or, now, school-shooting curbs, Obama most often seems to be a captive of Congress.

Obama is now left with making the first hard sell of his second term by calling for background check legislation in response to a school shooting, despite the fact that the legislation would have done nothing to prevent the shooting in question. And all because he rushed and then bungled the development of the package. The Obama mantra of “we can’t wait” has again proved a poor approach to big legislation.

The disconnect between the shooting and the legislation has made it easier for Republicans to harass the president on the subject.

[pullquote]

As Obama’s firearms push clatters to an unhappy end, the remaining fight is over record keeping under the proposed expansion of background checks. The Obama-backed measure would create for the first time a federal registry of firearms sales. An alternative bipartisan measure, still struggling to get aloft, would expand background checks to all weapons sales involving a commercial intermediary (a Web site, the hosts of a gun show) but exempt transactions between individuals and, more importantly, not allow the feds to build a gun registry.

Democratic outrage over Republican threats to filibuster the provision including the registry might have more sting if anyone could argue that the measure would have prevented the Newtown killings.

While there is broad public support for expanding background checks, there is also considerable public concern that federal authorities might use such information to one day confiscate legally purchased weapons.

Expanded provisions for the inclusion of mental health concerns into background checks might have made a difference in Tucson, Aurora or Blacksburg. Those have been discussed, but have largely been dropped due to medical privacy laws and a cultural bias against involuntary psychiatric commitments.

But because Obama could not find a way to get his party to think anew and act anew on guns and because he focused on reviving old, largely unrelated, issues, the president went from the politically advantageous position of pushing for legislation in response to a specific tragedy to the politically disadvantaged, ancient bog of gun control.

“Well, I think every country at every time could use somebody as principled and smart and strong as [Margaret Thatcher]. I think what we don't quite remember in the gauzy recollections today is how despised she was, how widely despised at home and to some extent here among the left. I mean, she angered everybody in her country from the communist union leaders to the upper class twits in her own party, which isn't easy to do.”

At large NRA gathering%2C Cruz challenges Biden to debate gun policy

Speakers say Obama and the media demonize gun owners

Counter demonstrations are planned for Saturday

HOUSTON — Sen. Ted Cruz brought a pro-Constitution, anti-crime message to the National Rifle Association's annual meeting Friday, challenging Vice President Biden to an hour-long debate on gun violence.

More than 6,000 NRA members gave Cruz, a freshman Texas Republican and a rising GOP star, a standing ovation for threatening to filibuster attempts to pass gun-control legislation.

Just a couple of months ago, Cruz said, the gun bill ""looked like an unstoppable freight train."" But that legislation is now in doubt after senators blocked an amendment last month that would have expanded background checks to include sales at gun shows and over the Internet.

""The Constitution matters. All of the Constitution,"" Cruz said. ""It's not pick and choose. It's not take the parts you like and get rid of the parts you don't like.""

Some senators have faced home-state protests for voting against that background check amendment last month. But Cruz said there ought to be protests against Democrats who voted against another amendment, which he sponsored with Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, that would have cracked down on violent crime. ""Citizens ought to ask them, 'Why aren't you willing to support going after felons and fugitives who try to illegally buy guns?' "" he said.

Cruz mocked Biden, who has taken the lead for the Obama administration on gun issues.

Biden's advice that firing a warning from a double-barreled shotgun is sufficient to ward off attackers would be ""very useful — if it so happens that you're being attacked by a flock of geese.""

Several opening speakers at the NRA's annual legislative forum took aim at President Obama, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and — above all — the media. The underlying theme: Political elites and the media don't understand gun-owning Americans.

""The lamestream media just doesn't get you, and you don't give up,"" said former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. Wearing a black-and-pink ""women hunt"" T-shirt, she called the media ""a poodle-skirted cheerleader"" for Obama.

""The media and the political elites can lie about us and demonize us all they want, but that won't stop us,"" NRA Vice President Wayne LaPierre said.

The annual meeting of the nation's largest and most powerful gun rights group is ""the biggest celebration ever of our American values,"" LaPierre said. The event is expected to be the group's largest ever, with perhaps 70,000 people attending the gun exhibition that accompanies the annual meeting.

Among them: The Van Sweden family of Fort Worth, Ind. Bruce and Jenny Van Sweden took their 10-year-old daughter Catherine out of school for the day to listen to three hours of political speeches. ""It's an education for her,"" Jenny said.

""I think the government is going crazy, and nothing they're talking about will change a thing,"" said Bruce. ""The polls say, 'Are you in favor of background checks?' Yeah, I am -- the ones we already have.""

The NRA is clearly feeling its oats after its big legislative victory last month.

The man who gets almost single-handed credit for that, NRA President David Keane said, is the group's chief lobbyist, Chris Cox. ""Did anyone think in January or February that we'd be where we are today?""

Cox said politicians and the media were taking advantage of the shooting of 26 children, teachers and staff at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.

""Think about that, when a deranged criminal murders innocent children, they blame us,"" Cox said. ""They use tragedy to restrict freedom, and it's up to us to stop them.""

Opposition protests are scheduled for Saturday, but for most of Friday a single protester stood across the street from Houston's George R. Brown Convention Center and read the names of victims of gun violence since Sandy Hook. ""We want the NRA to hear the consequences of their actions,"" said Heather Ross, a 27-year-old Austin woman who read the names from her iPhone. ""The Second Amendment says we can regulate guns, and that's all we want to do."""

Public speakers are exposed to microphones so often that it would be shocking if the occasional boneheaded remark didn’t slip out. But in the case of National Rifle Assn. Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre, the achingly incongruous statements tend not to come from off-the-cuff remarks but carefully vetted prepared statements.

Which leaves us to wonder: How can anybody possibly attract such a large and financially powerful following by uttering statements that defy third-grade logic?

One does not have to dig deep into the LaPierre highlight reel to find footage of him dismissing the real point in order to bring up a complete irrelevancy, or simply ignoring an issue when it is in fact at the heart of the problem he’s discussing. For example, here he is in a speech in Reno on Tuesday dismissing President Obama’s common-sense proposals to limit gun violence:

""[Obama] wants to put every private, personal firearms transaction right under the thumb of the federal government,” LaPierre said. “He wants to keep all of those names in a massive federal registry. There’s only two reasons for a federal list of gun owners: to either tax ‘em or take ‘em. That’s the only reasons.”

Well, no. There are plenty of other reasons to create a list of potential gun owners. Here are two: to create a reliable federal database that prevents convicted felons, the mentally ill and other clearly unsuited people from buying guns, and to trace them in case they are used in crimes. Did LaPierre forget about these two, or were they simply inconvenient to his case?

But the non sequiturs just kept flying. Filling out background check paperwork would mean “forcing family members to fill out forms to leave a family heirloom to a loved one — standing in line and filling out a bunch of bureaucratic paperwork, just so a grandfather can leave a grandson a Christmas gift.” For the record, Obama’s proposal doesn’t require transfers of firearms to family members to go though background checks (although, as California already does, it should).

There was, unfortunately, a lot more, including a rambling defense of “absolutism.” Under LaPierre’s definition, absolutism in support of freedom is a virtue. Presently, this means that supporting every picayune gun law, including those that make it easier for criminals to obtain firearms, is doing the work of the angels, while coming up with common-sense restrictions that wouldn’t affect law-abiding gun owners is a form of extremism. Are people buying this?

In a word, LaPierre’s arguments aren’t just slightly out of touch; they are absurd. If the NRA wants to continue using him as its chief spokesman, it will have only itself to blame."

(CNN) —

Starbucks lauds itself as a company committed to operating responsibly and ethically, and many of its policies reflect a strong corporate conscience. But when it comes to responsible gun policy, Starbucks has lost its moral compass.

Starbucks refuses to ban loaded guns from its coffee shops in the 43 states that allow people to openly carry loaded weapons.

As mothers, we wonder why the company is willing to put children and families in so much danger. Nobody needs to be armed to get a cup of coffee. And that’s why thousands of moms across the nation are asking Starbucks to put the safety of its customers first.

We’ve started a petition asking Starbucks to ban guns from its stores. In response, Starbucks has referred concerned moms to a statement on its website, a statement last updated in March 2010, about 90,000 American gun deaths ago. The statement reads, “The political, policy and legal debates around these issues belong in the legislatures and courts, not in our stores.”

Shannon Watts

Kate Beck

Starbucks spokesman Zack Hutson recently told Seattle Weekly that it is a legal strategy. “In communities that permit open carry, we abide by local laws. Where these laws don’t exist, openly carrying weapons in our stores is prohibited.”

Moms don’t want a gun debate with our coffee either. But when children are shot in schools, in movie theaters and even at Fourth of July parades, we can no longer keep the debate in the places where they “belong.” As the debate on guns spreads to town hall meetings nationwide in August, do we really have to have one in Starbucks too?

Starbucks’ refusal to ban guns from its stores has made it a nationwide venue for pro-gun rallies, where customers toting loaded weapons gather over coffee. There have even been accidental shootings: earlier this year a woman shot another customer when she dropped her purse and a loaded weapon inside discharged. A pro-gun site called I Love Guns and Coffee sells a coin that looks like the Starbucks logo, except the mermaid is wielding handguns. On Sunday, for example, 60 pro-gun activists carried handguns, semi-automatic rifles and shotguns into a Starbucks in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.

Starbucks claims its open carry policy simply follows state laws and local ordinances. However, the company is willing to overlook those in other instances; it recently announced a smoking ban within 25 feet of any store.

Why is Starbucks willing take a public health stand on smoking, but not gun violence, which kills more than 55 children and teens a week in America? Since when is second-hand smoke more dangerous than second-hand bullets?

Starbucks also claims that banning guns from its stores would put its employees in a “potentially unsafe position” if they had to ask a gun-wielding customer to leave. This alleged concern has not stopped other companies – including Disney, California Pizza Kitchen, AMC Theaters, Toys R Us, and even Starbucks competitor Peet’s Coffee & Tea – from prohibiting guns in their stores in states where open carry is legal. In fact, these companies have banned guns in order to keep employees and customers safe.

Starbucks bans guns from its corporate headquarters in Seattle, where open carry is perfectly legal. This same protection should be afforded to the millions of unarmed customers Starbucks serves each week.

An overwhelming majority of Americans want common-sense gun reforms. But it’s not just Congress and state legislatures that impact society; business policies also affect our safety. Shame on Congress for failing to act, but that’s no excuse for companies like Starbucks to fail to lead.

We never saw ourselves becoming activists. But like so many mothers on December 14th, we were horrified by the Sandy Hook shootings. The realization that our country’s lax gun laws led to the massacre of 20 innocent children shook both of us to the core. As mothers, we cannot and will not abide politics and policies that needlessly put our children and other children in danger.

Moms Demand Action has become a rallying point for mothers across the nation who refuse to tolerate the inaction over the epidemic of gun violence. We will not stop until gun reforms and responsible policies are in place at the federal level, in our states and at American businesses.

We have the most important reason of all for never backing down – our kids. Risking their safety isn’t worth a nonfat misto at Starbucks. Women make the vast majority of spending decisions in America; you can be sure we’ll spend those dollars with companies that value the safety of our families.

Standing with a tearful tableau of family members whose relatives were killed at Columbine High School and an Aurora movie theater, both in Colorado, and Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., the lawmakers offered a preview of legislation that is likely to face fierce opposition from Republicans and skepticism from some rural Democrats in a state where hunting and sport shooting are pursuits that cross generations and partisan lines.

Colorado has emerged as a crucial stage for the battle over gun-control legislation. A national gun-control group has hired a lobbying firm here, and the president of the National Rifle Association is due to meet with Colorado’s governor this week to make his case.

Under the Democrats’ proposals, all private gun sales would be subject to background checks. Colorado now requires background checks at gun shows and retail stores, but not for private sales between individuals. The lawmakers also would limit ammunition clips to 10 rounds, banning the 30-round and 100-round magazines that a gunman used last summer in the shooting inside the Century 16 movie theater in Aurora."

NRA officials say they requested the provision out of concern that insurance companies could use such data to raise premiums on gun owners. The measure’s supporters in the Senate say they did not intend to interfere with the work of doctors or researchers.

The research restrictions began in the 1990s, when the NRA urged Congress to cut funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s division that studied gun violence. In 1996, Congress sharply limited the agency’s ability to fund that type of research. More limits came last year in a spending bill setting restrictions on the National Institutes of Health after complaints from gun rights advocates about an NIH-backed study drawing links between alcoholism and gun violence. The provision, added by Rep. Denny Rehberg (R-Mont.), prohibits the NIH from spending money to “advocate or promote gun control” — language that researchers say does not explicitly forbid studies but sends a signal to federal research agencies to steer clear of the topic. The NRA push has extended into state capitals as well, with Florida lawmakers last year crafting a plan to impose jail time on doctors for inquiring about their patients’ gun ownership. Gov. Rick Scott (R) signed a scaled-back version of the proposal requiring health-care workers to “refrain” from asking patients about their ownership or possession of firearms unless the providers believe “in good faith” that such information would be relevant. A federal judge this year declared the law unconstitutional and blocked its enforcement, but the ruling was appealed by the state and is under review.



But that excuse is pathetic, since this has been ongoing for a while:The NRA is specifically targeting research that they don't like the results of. This has nothing to do with premiums and insurance companies. That's just a silly excuse they came up with, now that their hand is caught in the cookie jar. And I can't repeat often enough how revolting that is.

Now, I am not writing this to blame the administration, I believe that there were several bitter pills we needed to swallow to get a good bill passed, and then address the flaws later.

As Senator Franken, whom I respect deeply, said of this issue:



he was aware of the late addition and found it “objectionable.” But, he said, “it’s helpful to remember that we were in the position of having to get 60 votes from 60 senators. And, as a result, some things ended up in the bill for reasons I was not privy to and were certainly not to my liking.”

So the provision by the NRA was a late addition, only ""several weeks"" before the bill passed, and Franken supported it reluctantly for the sake of the overall bill. I'm willing to let that go, but I can't let go the inhumanity of the people who pushed for the provision.

Well, now is the time to address this particular flaw. Doctors are fighting back hard:



""This illustrates the fact that the NRA has insinuated themselves into the small crevices of anything they can to do anything in their power to prohibit sensible gun-safety measures,” said Denise Dowd, an ­emergency-care physician at a Kansas City, Mo., children’s hospital and an adviser on firearms issues to the American Academy of Pediatrics. Dowd called the provision in the health-care bill “pretty outrageous,” saying it risked creating a sense among doctors that “this is dangerous information to collect.” “We ask our patients about many things, not because we’re anti-gun but because we have an obligation and an ethical duty to keep the kids safe,” she said

The last statement in particular, really highlights the bitter irony when conservatives argue that the Government should not get in between the doctor and the patients. And then they support provisions that do exactly that. These people have no principles.

More action by the experts:

The pediatricians group last week submitted a strongly worded letter to the Obama administration saying that pediatric advocates “vehemently reject” the gun provision in the health-care law. The group notes that the provision runs counter to guidelines included in other sections of the legislation that ask family doctors and pediatricians to inquire about the presence of guns in patients’ homes, along with other potential dangers, such as mold, lead, cigarette smoke and a lack of smoke detectors. ...“Gun use and gun violence is a public health issue, and it should not be out of bounds to ask questions about it,” said David Satcher, a surgeon general under President Bill Clinton, who headed the CDC in the 1990s, when the NRA began to challenge gun research. “Privacy needs to be protected, but it’s important that this kind of data be gathered.” ...“It’s a problem when you don’t have access to a ­high-quality stream of robust, effective research,” said Arthur L. Kellermann, an emergency-room doctor and public health advocate who published studies in the 1980s that found elevated risks of death or injury associated with gun ownership. “And it’s an even bigger problem when you gag physicians in order to keep them from talking to their patients.”



From 1986 to 1996, the CDC sponsored peer-reviewed research into the underlying causes of gun violence. Among the findings: People who kept guns in their homes for ­self-defense did not gain protection. Instead, according to research published in the New England Journal of Medicine, residents in homes with a gun faced a 2.7-fold greater risk of homicide and a 4.8-fold greater risk of suicide compared with those in similar homes without guns. ...Lobbyists for the gun industry worked with Rep. Jay Dickey (R-Ark.) to redirect $2.6 million in CDC funds that had been designated for research into firearms safety. The move, which Dickey would later come to regret, unnerved scientists at the CDC and across the country.

But the best part is the last- real research that shows the futility of owning a gun for self-defense:And there it is: the reason they want to stop gun violence research"

A Graduate Of Harvard College', 'She Spent A Year As Middle East Bureau Chief Before Returning As Houston Bureau Chief.']",From the archives:: NRA’s black commentator becomes Web sensation,"Colion Noir may not fit the NRA stereotype, but he does click with fellow members and is ‘certainly causing some controversies.’

Colion Noir belongs to the NRA and owns several guns, including a sleek Glock 17 handgun and a customized AR-15 rifle. But as Noir frequently points out, he does not fit the stereotype of NRA members, or what he calls OFWG: “Old, fat white guys.”

At 29, he’s not old. Nor is he fat — he’s slender and stylishly dressed with sneakers made by Prada. He’s also not white.

In the world of gun owners, Noir, an African American, has become an Internet sensation and his popularity is growing. At this year’s National Rifle Assn. convention here, he was surrounded by fans when he arrived to film a Sportsman Channel segment on the NRA News stage.

“You are certainly causing some controversies,” said Cam Edwards, host of the radio talk show “NRA News Cam & Co.”

Noir has attracted followers with funny, edgy pro-gun videos — titles include “Gun Control & Bathrooms” and “You Know You’re a Gun Control Hypocrite if ...” He has emerged as a dynamic and unexpected NRA persona.

Gun control advocates dismiss him as an NRA pawn, and some blacks accuse him of being an Uncle Tom. But to many at the convention, Noir demonstrated a historic diversity among gun owners that defies stereotypes.

After Noir left the talk-show stage, fans approached to shake hands and pose for photographs. Most were white. A handful of them, like Quentin Smith, were black.

“Congratulations,” said Smith, 44, a gun owner from Cypress, Texas. “There’s a few of us out there.”

The NRA does not release membership demographics, but according to a Pew Research Center survey, many gun owners in America are white — 31% of whites polled this year said they owned guns, compared with 15% of blacks and 11% of Latinos.

“This is one tie that binds all of us together,” said NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam, describing the group as “the oldest civil rights organization in America.”

Arulanandam noted that the NRA also recently signed on a woman and a young veteran as commentators who speak to other growing demographics within the ranks of gun owners. He said the NRA did not choose Noir because of his race.

“When he speaks, he’s able to relate to a variety of people. That’s why he has a broad following,” Arulanandam said.

Noir was born Collins — “Mr. Colion Noir” is a stage name — son of an executive chef and a registered nurse. He graduated from high school in Houston, went to the University of Houston, where he majored in political science, and earned a law degree from Texas Southern University’s Thurgood Marshall School of Law.

Noir is a practicing attorney. He reads fashion blogs, loves gadgets and drives a sports car and a truck — neither with a gun rack, although he keeps a metal candy dish full of bullets in his living room.

Noir said he grew up hesitant to admit he liked firearms because it wasn’t something people talked about in his middle-class neighborhood. He fired his first gun, a little Taurus .40, about seven years ago at the urging of a friend who took him to a shooting range.

“I remember how exhilarating it was.” Colion Noir on his first time firing a gun

“I remember how exhilarating it was,” Noir said, comparing the experience to sky diving.

Soon afterward, he was going to the range weekly and researching guns. He later joined the NRA and bought about a half dozen guns. Noir, who once worked at A/X Armani Exchange and favors tailored suits, worries that a concealed handgun might “print,” or show through the fabric.

“Secret Service have the worst cut suits — big and bulky,” so their guns won’t show, Noir said.

A few years ago he began posting YouTube videos of himself critiquing guns and accessories. Then he started tackling politics and pop culture, addressing mass shootings, assault weapon bans and gun control campaigns by New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and the rapper formerly known as Snoop Dogg.

Noir said he recently started preparing a video about “stand your ground” laws after a jury acquitted George Zimmerman in the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin in Florida.

“I decided to table it because there’s too much complexity,” Noir said.

Noir sprinkles his videos with gun slang and offbeat humor, sometimes delivered with a smirk, sometimes deadpan. Some videos have been viewed more than 800,000 times.

In one, Noir sits on a plush couch in his loft next to his assault rifle, wearing his black Yankees cap and a modern plaid shirt, tossing off references to Justin Bieber and “Entourage” while mocking the owners of .45 handguns as “the Scientologists of the gun world” because they’ve attributed mythical powers to the .45 bullet — think “Zeus’ thunderbolt or Thor’s hammer.”

The camera cuts again and again to Noir wearing different baseball caps as he plays other characters.

Why carry a .45? The characters explain.

“Because a 9 millimeter only kills your body, but the .45 — that kills your soul,” one says, staring dully at the camera.

“Maybe because I’m too lazy to shoot twice,” another says.

“The only ones I know can survive a .45 is Wolverine and Superman,” says yet another.

Noir reasons there’s not much difference between a .45 and other powerful firearms, like the 9-millimeter handgun: “Are you going to be any more dead when, in one of her drunken stupors, Lindsay Lohan runs over you with her Range Rover Sport versus Kim Kardashian in her full-size Range Rover?”

Noir was launching his online brand last spring when the NRA approached him. Officially, he’s a paid commentator, not a spokesman, though the videos are branded NRA. He and the group declined to say how much he’s paid.

Once a deal had been struck, the NRA released an ad in March promoting his first video praising the gun rights group for championing the right of blacks to bear arms during Jim Crow and the civil rights movement of the 1960s.

“The same government who at one point hosed us down with water, attacked us with dogs and wouldn’t allow us to eat at their restaurants told us we couldn’t own guns when bumbling fools with sheets on their heads were riding around burning crosses on our lawns and murdering us,” Noir says in the video as “Washington elitism” flashes across the screen.

It was not a misreading of history, according to UCLA law professor Adam Winkler, author of “Gunfight: The Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America.”

Winkler said that the armed Black Panthers of the 1960s, despite criticism by then-Republican California Gov. Ronald Reagan and many conservatives, paved the way for the NRA’s current interpretation of the 2nd Amendment: that citizens should be able to carry guns in public, not just for hunting, but for protection, including protection against government tyranny.

Now some in the black community have denounced Noir for what they say is selling out to the white pro-gun establishment, with critiques posted on theroot.com and the Black Entertainment Television website.

“He’s taking more heat from black people than anybody. The racism that exists now is mostly on our side,” said the Rev. Kenn Blanchard, 50, a gun rights activist who is black. He said he advised Noir to accept the NRA deal.

Noir said he expected attacks, but he gets frustrated when critics highlight his race.

“Calling me an Uncle Tom simply because I’m into firearms, it doesn’t even make sense.” Colion Noir

“Calling me an Uncle Tom simply because I’m into firearms, it doesn’t even make sense. My entire identity as a black guy is based on my ownership of guns? Really?” he said. “Some of the most influential black individuals have advocated for the use of firearms, so how come when I do it, I’m vilified? Take a look at the Black Panthers, MLK, Malcolm X.”

The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. supported gun rights? Noir noted that after King’s home in Montgomery, Ala., was firebombed, King applied for a handgun permit.

When it comes to outreach to potential black gun owners, Noir will find that the demographics are stacked against him, Winkler said. Figures show blacks and Latinos are more likely to be Democrats who support gun control, especially young minorities in urban areas who associate guns with gangs and neighborhood violence, he said.

Perhaps Noir’s rise says more about the NRA’s acceptance of minorities than the group’s ability to woo them.

At the NRA convention, as Noir left the talk-show stage, Chris Blow of Magnolia, Texas, stopped him. Blow, 59, is a longtime NRA member and had watched Noir’s videos. Where, he wondered, did Noir like to shoot? Noir reeled off a few locations in the Houston area. Blow, who is white, smiled knowingly and shook Noir’s hand.

“You seem like someone I’d like to go shoot with,” he said."

Council members unanimously approve ordinance

Convicted felons%2C those with certain physical disabilities exempt

One councilman says he knows the measure won%27t be enforced

The Nelson (Ga.) City Council has unanimously passed a measure requiring every household to have a gun and ammunition.

Council members approved the Family Protection Ordinance — which requires every head of household to ""to maintain a firearm, together with ammunition"" — in a 5-0 vote Monday night, WXIA reported.

However, residents of the small city 50 miles north of Atlanta can opt out of the measure if they object to gun ownership. In addition, the ordinance also exempts convicted felons and those who suffer from certain physical or mental disabilities. There is no penalty for those who don't comply with the law.

Councilman Duane Cronic, who sponsored the measure, said he knows the ordinance won't be enforced but he still believes it will make the town safer.

""I likened it to a security sign that people put up in their front yards. Some people have security systems, some people don't, but they put those signs up,"" he said. ""I really felt like this ordinance was a security sign for our city. Basically it was a deterrent ordinance to tell potential criminals they might want to go on down the road a little bit.""

According to the council's agenda, the purpose of the ordinance is in ""opposition of any future attempt by the federal government to confiscate personal firearms.""

Resident Lamar Kellett told WXIA that his town is going too far.

""What's the point?"" asked Kellett. ""By their own admission this is a sham. It's just for play.""

Levy'],The Limits of Nullification - The New York Times,"BILTMORE LAKE, N.C. — ON Sept. 11, anti-gun-control legislators in the Missouri General Assembly are likely to pass a bill, over the governor’s veto, that renders almost all federal gun laws void in the state, and even makes it a crime for federal agents to enforce them.

Missouri is only the latest state to push back against federal gun laws. In Montana, the Firearms Freedom Act, passed in 2009, purports to exempt any gun manufactured and kept within the state from federal regulations; despite a federal appellate court decision last month invalidating the statute, it has served as a model for new or pending laws in more than a half-dozen states.

But while states are not powerless in the face of federal law, there are limits to what they can do to prevent enforcement of constitutionally valid regulation.

The bills are based on the theory of nullification, which has its roots in the late 18th and early 19th centuries and holds that the federal government exists by the will of the states, and that states therefore have the right to decide which federal laws are constitutionally valid within their borders."
http://news.yahoo.com/michelle-obama-hard-choices-needed-guns-224216023.html,,[],Michelle Obama: 'hard choices' needed on guns,"CHICAGO (AP) — Michelle Obama says people worried about youth gun violence have to do more than simply tell children they care about the problem and then wind up ""going to these funerals and mourning with these kids when there's still work to do.""

""They're looking to us to make the hard choices for them,"" the first lady said Thursday. She suggested there are better ways for her to help than becoming publicly involved in Congress' debate over gun laws that the president seeks.

Providing more creative outlets for children can help, she said in an interview with reporters who accompanied her on a three-city tour for the third anniversary of ""Let's Move,"" the anti-obesity program

""Kids need to be engaged, not just intellectually. They need more than just to do well on test scores. They need to have something else in life to look forward to,"" the first lady said, adding that opportunities to draw, sing, dance, act and play a sport can help them channel negative energy in a more positive direction.

On a two-day trip to highlight her national campaign to combat childhood obesity, Mrs. Obama changed out of a dark-colored business suit and into a coral-and-black workout outfit to jump up and down with thousands of Chicago middle school students who were brought to the McCormick Place convention center for what amounted to one very large aerobics class.

Mrs. Obama had announced a new public-private partnership, called ""Let's Move Active Schools,"" to help schools find low- or no-cost ways to help students get the recommended hour of daily exercise. The line-up included such star athletes as Bo Jackson and Colin Kaepernick, as well as Olympians Dominique Dawes, Gabby Douglas, Serena Williams, Allyson Felix and Ashton Eaton.

She took a few minutes to talk seriously with the kids before she joined the fun, urging them to do their homework and make good life choices. She recalled her upbringing in a Chicago family of four that wasn't rich and having to share a bedroom with her older brother.

Story continues

""If you guys remember just one thing from our time today, it's this: Although I am the first lady of the United States of America ... I am no different from you,"" she said.

Mrs. Obama hinted in the interview with reporters she'll do more to encourage schools and other organizations to provide opportunities for children in a time of declining budgets.

""More and more of our schools are having to eliminate the things that give kids passion and a reason to be in school,"" she said. Mrs. Obama added that kids are sharp enough to know when teachers, public officials others are just talking the talk.

""We have to stop telling our kids that we care. They're looking to us to make the hard choices for them,"" she said. ""And going to these funerals and mourning with these kids when there's still work to do that we haven't done, it can be frustrating.""

Mrs. Obama came home to Chicago earlier this month to attend the funeral of 15-year-old Hadiya Pendleton, who was killed by gunfire near the Obama home after returning from performing for President Barack Obama's inauguration. Pendleton's parents later sat with the first lady for Obama's president's State of the Union address.

A month after the December slaying of 20 elementary school pupils in Connecticut, Obama asked Congress to send him legislation banning assault-style weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines, and requiring criminal background checks for all gun purchases.

Congress has held hearings on the issue, but lawmakers have not taken any action on gun legislation.

The raw emotion of the background check amendment defeat played out in the Senate gallery just after Vice President Biden read the vote count in his capacity as Senate president.

“Shame on you!” at least two women were heard shouting.

As they were escorted from the Capitol, Patricia Maisch and Lori Haas said they shouted in anger. Maisch successfully knocked a large ammunition magazine out of the hands of Jared Loughner in Jan. 2011 after he shot former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.) and other bystanders.

“They are an embarrassment to this country, that they don’t have any compassion or care for people who have been taken brutally from their families,” Maisch said as officers attempted to remove her from the building. “I hate them,” she said of the senators.

“We’re sick and tired of the death in this country and these legislators stand up there and think it’s a bunch of numbers,” said Haas, whose daughter, Emily, was wounded in the April 2007 shooting at Virginia Tech.

“It’s a shame, it’s appalling, it’s disgusting,” she added.

The chief architects of the plan to expand the national gun background check system, Sens. Joe Manchin III (D-W. Va.) and Patrick Toomey (R-Pa.), acknowledged in interviews early Wednesday that their proposal lacked sufficient support.

After the vote, Toomey expressed regret, but said that it was time to move on.

“I did what I thought was the right thing for our country. I sought out a compromise position that I thought could move the ball forward on an important matter of public safety,” he said in a statement, adding later, “We have a lot of other very important issues to deal with such as getting the economy back on track, dealing with the debt ceiling and creating more jobs for Pennsylvanians.”

Before the voting began, Biden, who is leading the Obama administration's gun control effort, sounded quite frustrated with misinformation being spread by opponents to the bipartisan compromise Wednesday. Speaking during a “Google Hangout,” Biden reiterated that the proposal would not create or lead to the creation of a federal gun registry. “Nothing can be further from the truth,” he said.

Biden also dismissed suggestions that the measures would infringe upon people’s constitutional right to bear arms.

“There is no – zero – no infringement on the Second Amendment, not one single thing being proposed,” he said.

In the hours before the vote, Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) also attempted to rally last-minute support for the bill by issuing an ominous warning to his colleagues.

“If tragedy strikes again…if innocents are gunned down in a classroom, theater or restaurant, I would have trouble living with myself as a senator, as a husband, a father, or grandfather and friend, knowing that I didn’t do everything in my power to prevent that incident,” Reid said.

Shortly before the vote, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said he would support the background check plan, saying that while he was a staunch defender of Second Amendment rights, the bipartisan proposal is “not overly burdensome or unconstitutional.”

“Is this a perfect solution? No. will it prevent all future acts of gun violence? Of course not,” McCain said. “Would it have prevented the most recent acts of gun violence? In all likelihood, no. But it is reasonable, and it is my firm conviction that it is constitutional.”

In addition to McCain and Toomey, the amendment was supported by Republican Sens. Susan Collins (Maine) and Mark Kirk (Ill.) The Democrats who opposed the measure were Sens. Max Baucus (Mont.), Mark Begich (Alaska), Heidi Heitkamp (N.D.) and Mark Pryor (Ark.) The four Democrats face difficult reelections in rural states with strong gun cultures.

Democrats, fearful of lacking even just 50 votes in support of the background check proposal, called upon Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.) to return to Washington for the votes.

Lautenberg has been absent in recent months as he’s battled the after-effects of cancer, but came to Washington Wednesday for the votes. Democratic aides had said that they would only need Lautenberg if gun legislation appeared in doubt.

In a dramatic moment, Lautenberg was brought to the floor by wheelchair. When a clerk called his name, Lautenberg shouted “Aye!” Democratic senators applauded, as did some people watching in the balcony above.

Reid said he would vote for the assault weapon ban proposed by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Ca.) “because maintaining a law and order is more important than satisfying conspiracy theories, who believe in black helicopters and false flags. I’ll vote for the ban because saving the lives of police officers – young and old – and innocent civilians – young and old, is more important than preventing imagined tyranny.”

Reid’s decision to support the ban is a notable reversal because he has maintained a close relationship with the National Rifle Association, which strongly opposes it, and because Reid had previously voiced doubts about the Feinstein plan.

In addition to the background check and assault weapons amendments, senators were also voting on a Democratic proposal to limit the size of ammunition magazines. Democrats expected the proposal would fail.

Also under consideration were a bipartisan amendment that would make minor changes to the bill’s provisions regarding gun trafficking and a bipartisan plan to provide more funding for mental health programs.

Four GOP proposals were also being considered. The first, by Charles E. Grassley (Iowa) and Ted Cruz (Tex.), was a package of Republican proposals that would improve the mental health classifications used in the background check reporting system. It was expected to include a proposal Grassley demanded that would prevent abuses like those reported in Operation Fast and Furious, a botched effort to track illegal weapons activity along the U.S.-Mexican border.

Another GOP amendment from Sen. John Cornyn (Tex.) would have allowed gun owners who receive a state-issued permit to carry a concealed weapon to take that weapon into other states that issue such permits. Only Illinois and the District of Columbia do not issue concealed-carry permits.

An amendment by Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) addressed special concerns of veterans. For several years, Burr has sponsored a ""Veterans Second Amendment Protection Act."" The legislation, backed enthusiastically by Grassley, was written as a response to Department of Veterans Affairs policy of submitting the names of veterans to the FBI who have a fiduciary appointed to manage their financial affairs because of mental problems.

The referral meant that the veterans were placed on the background check list of those who could be denied weapons permits. Burr's legislation specified that only veterans designated as a danger to themselves or others would be placed on such a list.

Finally, an amendment co-authored by Sens. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) and Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) would authorize suicide prevention and related mental health programs for young people.

(CNN) – The No. 2 Democrat in the Senate criticized the National Rifle Association for cheering the defeat of a recent bipartisan gun control measure and expressed hope that the “political sentiment” will change in the upper chamber so the legislation can be brought up again.

“The National Rifle Association can go to Texas and celebrate defeating that measure, but they certainly shouldn’t celebrate when they look at the carnage that takes place virtually every day in America because convicted felons have guns,” Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union.”

He was referring to the organization’s annual meeting this weekend in Houston, where the recent gun control debate was a key theme among speeches by high-profile conservatives. Speakers praised the audience for lobbying their lawmakers to vote against gun control measures and encouraged them to keep up the fight.

""We are in the midst of a once-in-a-generation fight for everything we care about. We have a chance to secure our freedom for a generation, or to lose it forever,"" NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre said Saturday.

""We must remain vigilant, ever resolute, and steadfastly growing and preparing for the even more critical battles that loom before us,"" he said.

One of the main provisions considered the most likely to pass would have expanded the background check system to include private sales at gun shows and online. In the April 17 vote, however, the Senate fell short of the 60 votes needed to move forward with the measure. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid shelved the overall gun control bill to allow more time for negotiations and vowed to bring it up again.

The defeat was seen as a major victory among anti-gun control advocates and among those in the gun lobby, who argued that the measure would not have done much to help prevent mass shootings like those seen in Newtown, Connecticut, and Aurora, Colorado, last year.

Durbin, the Senate’s majority whip, said the legislation needs five more votes in order to pass but said it can be an uphill battle in the Senate.

""What we need to see is a change in political sentiment within the Senate. We need to pick up five more votes, and that's quite a task, I might add, as whip in the Senate, but we can do this. I hope the American people don't give up. I know the president hasn't given up,"" Durbin told CNN's chief political correspondent Candy Crowley.

Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) revealed that some members of his party opposed expanding background checks for gun sales recently because they didn't want to ""be seen helping the president.""

Two weeks ago, only three Republican senators voted for the bipartisan background checks amendment sponsored by Toomey and Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), despite overwhelming popular support for such a measure.

""In the end it didn’t pass because we're so politicized. There were some on my side who did not want to be seen helping the president do something he wanted to get done, just because the president wanted to do it,” Toomey admitted on Tuesday in an interview with Digital First Media editors in the offices of the Times Herald newspaper in Norristown, Pa.

The Times Herald noted that in ""subsequent comments,"" Toomey ""tried to walk that remark part-way back by noting he meant to say Republicans across the nation in general, not just those in the Senate.""

Last week, Toomey placed more of the blame on the president himself, telling the Morning Call, ""I would suggest the administration brought this on themselves. I think the president ran his re-election campaign in a divisive way. He divided Americans. He was using resentment of some Americans toward others to generate support for himself.""

Manchin has argued, however, that the National Rifle Association's decision to score the vote was the main reason the compromise amendment on background checks failed. Without it, he believed, 70 senators -- well above the 60-vote threshold needed for passage -- would have supported it.

Opponents also pushed a significant amount of misinformation before the vote, including the myth that the legislation would lead to a federal gun registry. In fact, the bill would have made the creation of such a registry a felony carrying a prison sentence of up to 15 years.

Toomey was pessimistic on Tuesday about the prospects of gun legislation moving forward, saying it's ""not likely to happen any time soon.""

""The bill is available right now and Sen. (Majority leader Harry) Reid could bring it up for a vote at any time, but we need five people to change their minds,"" he said.

Sens. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.), Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) and other lawmakers who voted against the background checks legislation have seen drops in their poll numbers since opposing the legislation.

Toomey, on the other hand, has seen his poll numbers rise."
http://news.yahoo.com/showdown-gun-control-vote-set-thursday-senate-214409268--politics.html,,[],Showdown gun control vote set Thursday in Senate,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate's top Democrat is setting Congress' first showdown vote for Thursday on President Barack Obama's gun control drive as a small but mounting number of Republicans appear willing to buck a conservative effort to prevent debate from even beginning.

Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada announced his decision Tuesday as the White House, congressional Democrats and relatives of the victims of December's mass shooting in Newtown, Conn., amped up pressure on GOP lawmakers to allow debate and votes on gun control proposals. Twenty first-graders and six educators were gunned down at Sandy Hook Elementary School, turning gun control into a top-tier national issue.

""We have a responsibility to safeguard these little kids,"" Reid said on the Senate floor, pointing to a poster-sized photo of a white picket fence that had slats bearing the names of the Newtown victims. ""And unless we do something more than what's the law today, we have failed.""

""We don't have the guts to stand up and vote yes or no? We want to vote maybe? Tell that to the families in Newtown"" and other communities where there have been mass shootings, said Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.

But Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, one of 13 conservative senators who signed a letter promising to try blocking debate, said the Senate bill puts ""burdens on law abiding citizens exercising a constitutional right."" He said none of its provisions ""would have done anything to prevent the horrible tragedy of Sandy Hook.""

Obama was calling senators from both parties Tuesday to push for the gun bill, according to a White House official.

Reid's determination to stage a vote came despite inconclusive talks between Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Patrick Toomey, R-Pa., aimed at finding compromise on expanding background checks to more gun purchasers.

But Manchin left a meeting in Reid's office late Tuesday and said he hoped a deal could be completed on Wednesday. Such a compromise would be likely to attract bipartisan support because both lawmakers are among their parties' most conservative members.

Story continues

The checks, aimed at keeping firearms from criminals and certain other buyers, are the cornerstone of Obama's gun plan, which has been struggling in Congress. Democrats have been buoyed by polls consistently showing more than 8 in 10 Americans support subjecting more buyers to background checks.

A Senate vote to begin debating the guns package would mark a temporary victory for Obama and his allies.

Some Republicans, though eager to avoid blocking debate, could vote against the measure on final passage. Coupled with resistance by leaders of the GOP-run House to main parts of Obama's effort — including bans on assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines — the ultimate outcome seems shaky for Democrats.

Reid said he did not know if he had the 60 votes he will need to defeat the conservatives' roadblock. But at least eight Republicans have said they want to begin debate or have indicated a willingness to consider it: Sens. John McCain of Arizona, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, Johnny Isakson and Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, Susan Collins of Maine, Roy Blunt of Missouri and Mark Kirk of Illinois.

But some moderate Democrats are remaining noncommittal and might oppose opening the gun debate, including Sens. Mark Begich of Alaska and Mark Pryor of Arkansas, who are seeking re-election next year.

Begich declined to directly state his position and said of Alaskans, ""We like our guns.""

There are 53 Senate Democrats and two independents who lean Democratic.

In a written statement, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, said conservatives want to prevent Obama from rushing the legislation through Congress ""because he knows that as Americans begin to find out what is in the bill, they will oppose it.""

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said he will join the conservatives' attempt to block debate.

The bill would expand required federal background checks to nearly all gun transactions, stiffen penalties for illegal firearms trafficking and provide a small boost in school safety aid.

Eleven Sandy Hook family members representing eight of the shooting victims were on Capitol Hill to lobby senators from both parties for gun legislation, including Isakson.

""We bring a face to this tragedy,"" said Mark Barden, who lost his 7-year-old son, Daniel. ""We bring a very personal perspective. People should listen to what we have to say and move the debate forward. It's not just about our tragedy. Lots of kids are killed every day in this nation. We have to help lead the change.""

Some relatives had breakfast with Vice President Joe Biden at his residence in the Naval Observatory. Later, Biden spoke to law enforcement officials at the White House and told reporters that conservatives would not succeed in blocking debate.

""This is not one of these votes that they block a vote and somehow we're going to go away,"" Biden said. ""The American public will not stand for it.""

The president's gun-control proposals have hit opposition from the National Rifle Association, which was using the Internet and emails to urge its members — it claims nearly 5 million — to tell members of Congress of their opposition.

In GOP-heavy Louisiana, where Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu is seeking re-election next year, the NRA wrote to its members, ""Please contact Senator Landrieu and encourage her to oppose this anti-freedom legislation.""

Counteracting that has been an effort by Mayors Against Illegal Guns, one of whose leaders is billionaire New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

The group was running a television ad in Pennsylvania asking voters to contact Toomey and tell him to back expanded background checks. It also said it will keep track of key gun-related congressional roll calls and make the information available to voters and contributors — a tactic long used by the NRA and other groups.

Manchin has been hoping for a deal with Toomey that would expand the requirement to sales at gun shows and online while exempting other transactions, such as those involving private, face-to-face purchases.

Currently, the checks are required only for sales through licensed gun dealers.

It is the latest in a series of proposals to tighten gun laws in the state, the fates of which are now being decided in the House and Senate.

The last several days have been marked by many hours of emotional debate over the proposed laws.

Earlier this week, state lawmakers passed a bill that bans the purchase of ammunition magazines of more than 15 rounds. It now awaits the governor’s signature. The legislation requiring universal background checks, House Bill 1229, had also passed but was returned to the legislature so it could be amended to define how organizations such as gun trusts would act during gun transfers. The amended bill passed the Senate on a 19-14 vote. It passed the House 36 to 27 a few hours later.

Gov. John Hickenlooper, a Democrat, who called for universal background checks in his State of the State address in January, is expected to sign the bill.

The state has been thrust into the national spotlight as a debate over gun control rages in the aftermath of the shooting deaths in December of 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.

Colorado, a battleground state where many revere gun ownership, has also been roiled by two of the largest mass shootings in U.S. history, at Columbine High School in 1999 and at an Aurora movie theater in 2012. That shooting left 12 people dead and 70 injured.

Republicans in both chambers have voiced strong opposition to House Bill 1229. On Friday, several said they feared that young people in 4-H clubs and Boy Scout programs could be targeted. Others said a state tradition of outdoor sportsmanship was threatened.

Republican state Sen. Kevin Lundberg said that exemptions in the legislation meant to cover certain gun transfers were insufficient and could put a burden on common transfers between friends and neighbors.

“We’ve made a dysfunctional mess of these exemptions,” he said. “No one, practically speaking, will be able to get their arms around it.”

On Friday the Denver Post reported that universal checks could be hampered because some of the federally licensed dealers who would be required to conduct them have said the $10 fee for the service is not enough to cover its costs.

Also on Friday, National Rifle Assn. Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre used his speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference near Washington, D.C., to argue against expanding the background-check system, which, he said, “only includes good, law abiding people.” He repeated his allegation that new checks would lead to a national registry of firearms that the government would use to tax or take guns.

Supporters of the tightened gun laws say opponents have unfairly painted their efforts.

“These bills do not take firearms away from anyone who can legally have one,” Colorado Senate President John Morse said in a statement. “Those political scare tactics have zero truth behind them. These bills are reasonable policies that respect 2nd Amendment rights, while helping to keep Colorado safe.”

Case Study: GUNS IN THE USA The United States constitution, which was written over two hundred years ago, enshrines an individual's right to keep and bear arms.

In 2000, the FBI estimated that 66% of the 15,517 murders that year were committed with firearms.

Fatal shootings in recent years, many involving teenagers, has made the issue of gun control a key debate in US politics.

Context



The United States has the largest number of guns in private hands of any country in the world with 60 million people owning a combined arsenal of over 200 million firearms.



The US constitution, which was written in 1787, enshrines the people's right to keep and bear arms in its Second Amendment.



It reads: 'A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.'



Although guns are permitted everywhere, the laws governing gun use vary considerably from state to state.



Gun Control, Not Prohibition



Amending the Constitution to prohibit guns is rarely discussed as many Americans view the right to bear arms as an important civil liberty.



Instead, the issue is whether or not it is lawful to impose stricter controls on gun usage.



Proposed gun control legislation has concerned child-proof locks, background checks on gun purchasers, the outlawing of some types of assault weapons and, most recently, the creation of a nationwide database of ballistic fingerprints in order to track the movement of the nation's guns.



American opinion is divided between those who insist on the universal right to bear arms and those who advocate stricter controls.



The influential firearms lobby, headed by the National Rifle Association (NRA), believes gun ownership to be a personal and moral right and dismisses the link between gun ownership and high gun violence with its slogan 'Guns don't kill people, people kill people.'



Advocates of firearm control argue that the Second Amendment is anachronistic belonging to the long-gone days of the frontier. They point to the high levels of gun-related murder and violent crime in the US to stress the need for reform.



The issue of removing the number of guns that are already in circulation is rarely discussed.



More Controls



In the past decade, public opinion has been gradually moved in favour of stricter gun control laws. In January 2001, 59% of the respondents in an ABC News/Washington Post survey said they favoured stricter gun control laws.



After the horrific events in 1999 at Columbine High School in Colorado when two students shot dead 13 fellow students and each other, polls showed that two-thirds of Americans supported greater gun control measures. Moreover, 15 state legislatures passed significant gun control bills.



The case of the Washington Sniper, who terrorised the suburbs of the nation's capital in late 2002 in a month-long shooting spree, killing 10 people and seriously wounding three, swiftly brought the issue of gun control onto the table once again.



However, any new gun control legislation that comes before the Congress is sure to be vetoed by President George W. Bush, who is a long-time ally of the NRA.



While he was governor of Texas, the President signed laws making it legal to carry concealed weapons and difficult for citizens to sue gun manufacturers.

Editor’s Note: On Wednesday, CNN TV and CNN.com are taking an in-depth look at “Guns Under Fire: A CNN Special Report on Background Checks.” John J. Donohue is C. Wendell and Edith M. Carlsmith professor of law at Stanford Law School and research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research.

(CNN) —

In a new poll, Americans indicated that they support universal background checks by a margin of 91% to 8%. Even in households with guns, the margin was an overwhelming 88% to 11%.

“We think it’s reasonable to provide mandatory instant criminal background checks for every sale at every gun show. No loopholes anywhere for anyone.” Did President Barack Obama say that? No, that’s from an advertisement taken out by the NRA in USA Today in 1999.

But a more powerful NRA today is in no mood to follow the slogan of their “be reasonable” ad campaign of 14 years ago. This relatively small group – the NRA boasts that it has 4.5 million members, which is peanuts compared to the roughly 40 million AARP members – might have the political power to pull it off.

John J. Donohue

Federal law prohibits selling guns to felons or the mentally ill. Background checks are the only way to enforce that law. So, besides criminals and the insane, who could possibly oppose universal background checks?

Gun manufacturers.

Background checks on gun sales: How do they work?

They are the ones who call the shots at the NRA, and they are the most important people in the opposition. The manufacturers don’t want anything that interferes with total gun sales and profits.

Background checks would impose a minor burden on gun transactions, but more importantly, limit the size of the market (and therefore, profits) in two ways.

The direct loss of profit comes because closing the current gaping loophole in the background check system will shut off sales to criminals and the mentally ill who are effectively free to buy all the guns they want at gun shows and through private transactions.

But there is also an indirect loss of profit: Cutting off sales to the mentally ill and criminals will reduce crime and thereby reduce the public’s demand for guns for self-protection.

The gun manufacturers saw gun sales plummet during the dark days of the Clinton administration when crime dropped sharply every year. The 42% drop in the murder rate from 1993 to 2000 was a nightmare for gun sellers. Nothing scares the NRA as much as a sense of calm and safety in the public.

Opinion: The government wants your gun rights

What about gun owners? Do they have concerns about universal background checks? If one believes the recent poll that only 8% of the population and only 11% of those in household with guns oppose these checks, then not really.

But the same poll shows that the NRA has managed to convince a lot of Americans that universal background checks might lead to gun confiscation. This, no doubt, increases some gun owners’ fears.

Amazingly, the poll found that in response to the question – “Do you believe that if there are background checks for all gun purchases, the government will or will not use that information in the future to confiscate legally owned guns?” – 48% said there will be confiscation. Quite frankly, this is delusional.

If, when only 8% of Americans oppose the policy, you can’t get a law that is designed to keep criminals and the insane from buying guns because of the power of the gun lobby, you certainly aren’t going to get anything like confiscation when there would be massive opposition.

Why is this so hard? The disconnect on background checks

Moreover, even in some unimaginable world in which you could get gun confiscation, universal background checks would make no difference – there are about 300 million guns in America with no need to go through any background check. Confiscation would be overturned in court in any event, since it is now prohibited by the Constitution.

Some gun owners presumably just don’t want to be bothered by any additional regulation of guns, but background checks would be a minor inconvenience for anyone outside remote rural areas. There are also those who think background checks might expose us to tyrannous attack from our own government or perhaps even a foreign government that the U.S. military can’t defeat but armed citizens could fend off. But again, putting that much confidence in arming criminals and the insane seems more than a bit strange.

Despite the fact that many other countries have similar requirements (and yes, much lower rates of murder and mayhem), gun groups in our country have raised alarmist concerns about the “logistical nightmare” of background checks for private sales. One of my favorites was:

What is a licensed retailer to do in the event of a “double denial” (both the private party buyer and seller are denied).

We should be so lucky to get the gun out of the hands of two illegitimate possessors.

In fact, the only argument for opposing gun background checks is that you believe the U.S. is already so gun-saturated and current gun owners are so reckless about allowing access to their guns by prohibited parties, that even if they can’t buy them, the criminals and insane will get their hands on guns in any event.

In such a world, there is no benefit from background checks to offset the costs of running the system. I hope we are not there yet, although that would be nirvana for the NRA.

Levy'],The Limits of Nullification - The New York Times,"BILTMORE LAKE, N.C. — ON Sept. 11, anti-gun-control legislators in the Missouri General Assembly are likely to pass a bill, over the governor’s veto, that renders almost all federal gun laws void in the state, and even makes it a crime for federal agents to enforce them.

Missouri is only the latest state to push back against federal gun laws. In Montana, the Firearms Freedom Act, passed in 2009, purports to exempt any gun manufactured and kept within the state from federal regulations; despite a federal appellate court decision last month invalidating the statute, it has served as a model for new or pending laws in more than a half-dozen states.

But while states are not powerless in the face of federal law, there are limits to what they can do to prevent enforcement of constitutionally valid regulation.

The bills are based on the theory of nullification, which has its roots in the late 18th and early 19th centuries and holds that the federal government exists by the will of the states, and that states therefore have the right to decide which federal laws are constitutionally valid within their borders."

Saturday's recall election was sought by gun rights supporters who say the council ignored their objections to a failed proposal that would have allowed the attorney general to oversee Exeter's concealed weapons permits.

Under current law, those seeking a permit may apply to either the attorney general or their local police. The town of 6,000 has no police department so permits are now handled by the town clerk. The council recently voted 4-1 for a resolution asking the Rhode Island legislature to take the responsibility for the permitting process away from the town, The Wall Street Journal reported. The members said the clerk lacks the resources to conduct proper background checks.

“My personal belief is those four are antigun, plain and simple,” Letita Davis, a resident who helped organize the effort told The Wall Street Journal.

“Our rights are at issue here – our Second Amendment rights as well as our rights to be listened to by our elected leaders,” she told the newspaper.

The council members say gun rights supporters are trying to make them an example for other officeholders considering changes to gun laws. The members say they were trying to beef up background checks for public safety in the interest of public safety.

“Gun-rights groups are pushing harder and harder to get lawmakers to stay away from guns altogether, and we’re seeing them give payback to those that don’t,” Joshua Spivak, a recall elections expert told The Wall Street Journal.

In September, two Democratic Colorado state senators were recalled over their support for changes to gun laws following the theater massacre outside Denver in 2012.

The four officials being targeted by the recall effort are Council President Arlene Hicks and Councilmen Cal Ellis, Robert Johnson and William Monahan. All are Democrats. A fifth member is not up for recall: independent Councilman Raymond Morrissey Jr., who voted against the resolution.

Should one or more of the council members be recalled, their council seats will go to the losing candidates from the last election. Daniel W. Patterson would get the first seat, Edward F. Nataly the second and Lincoln P. Picillo the third.

The fourth seat would be filled by a council appointment.

Polls opened at 7 a.m. and will close at 8 p.m. Both sides were concerned about a low-turnout with snow in the forecast.

http://news.yahoo.com/california-bill-ban-conversion-kits-automatic-weapons-003208770.html,,[],California bill would ban conversion kits for automatic weapons,"By Sharon Bernstein SACRAMENTO (Reuters) - California lawmakers on Wednesday voted to ban kits used to convert standard firearms into semi-automatics capable of firing more than 10 rounds of ammunition without reloading, although a stricter gun control measure was stalled. The conversion kit ban, one of a number of gun control bills making their way through the legislature in the waning days of the session, also prohibits the purchase of large capacity magazines in the state. ""Now, legally you can buy and you can sell conversion kits that allow you to convert conventional magazines so they can shoot many more than 10 rounds without reloading,"" said Assemblywoman Nancy Skinner of Berkeley, who sponsored the bill. Passage has not been easy for the more than a dozen gun control bills introduced by Democratic lawmakers in the wake of several mass-shootings, including the one at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut last year. Even so, the state has some of the toughest gun laws in the country. An assault weapons ban has been in place since 1989, passed after a mass shooting at an elementary school in Stockton. California Democrats control large majorities in both houses as well as the governorship. But many lawmakers owe their jobs to moderate and conservative voters in rural counties, and are hesitant to take on hot-button issues like firearm regulation. The bill banning conversion kits, for example, passed only after a provision requiring a database to track sales of ammunition in the state was removed. It passed on a vote of 43 to 30, with five Democrats joining the Assembly's 25 Republicans in opposition. The Senate had passed it earlier and it will now go to Governor Jerry Brown, who has not said that he will sign it. Another measure, to ban repeat drug and alcohol offenders, as well as people who commit some gang-related crimes, from gun ownership for ten years passed on a vote of 42 to 27. On Tuesday, lawmakers voted to ban new sales of semi-automatic rifles with removable magazines and to require people who already own such weapons to register them. A measure that would ban possession of large capacity ammunition magazines in the state was held up while supporters lobbied for votes. Republicans continued their opposition to the gun control measures on Wednesday, voting against them as a bloc and warning that the measures are threats to the second amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Assemblyman Tim Donnelly, who represents the Southern California community of Twin Peaks, said the bill banning conversion kits would wrongly target people who had innocently purchased equipment that might or might not be used to modify a weapon. ""Certainly we don't want to throw people in jail because they bought a couple of little springs and a few boxes of metal,"" he said.

According to the statistics from the FBI, 6,009 people were murdered with handguns in America in 2010, which was 67.5% of all murders in the country that year. There were 8,775 total firearm crimes reported in the U.S. in 2010. The highest rates of gun crimes in the Unites States come primarily from states where gun laws are most lenient. South Carolina and Tennessee dominate the board in their rate of gun crimes per capita.

Our constitutional rights are very much valid and important, but no right is absolute, without exception or consideration for particular circumstances. Even the sacred right to freedom of speech is limited in that you cannot knowingly spread false information (although no one is telling that to Fox News), you cannot call in a fake bomb threat and incite terror, and you cannot threaten someone’s life or purposefully insight violent actions. The second amendment right to gun ownership is equally as relative.

When the Second Amendment was ratified, the founding fathers had very little or no understanding of mental health and stability. Medicine and medical knowledge was still very primitive at the time and psychology was not a known practice or science until late into the 19th century. So the founding fathers never gave a thought to those who were mentally unstable and should not own guns, nor to young boys with guns who were treated like men from a very early age. Guns at the time were also far less dangerous than they are today, their guns shot one weak bullet at a time and it took a long time to reload. There were no weapons of mass destruction, no bombs, no silencers, and no automatic rifles, and there was no way for the first congress to anticipate the future of weapons technology.

Children who are not even old enough to vote or drive have access to deadly weapons. If a nine year old were allowed behind the wheel of a car, even with an adult, it would be a crime and the parent would be charged for negligence and child endangerment, at least. Yet I have seen and heard of children as young as four and five who are taken to shooting ranges and taught to shoot. This practice, even with older children, desensitizes them of the dangers of guns. Children’s brains are NOT developed enough to handle the dangers and responsibilities of handling a gun. They are not mature enough to comprehend the severity of the potential consequences. The human frontal lobe, which is the home of consequential thinking, rationalizing, and decision making, is not fully developed until the age of about twenty-five. Children are also not physically coordinated enough to safely handle a gun, which is why we also don’t let young children play with sharp things, boiling water, and fire!

I am an advocate for the restriction of guns from everyone under the age of twenty-one. I believe that if you pass a written safety test you should be able to acquire a firearm learner’s license when you’re eighteen. With the learner’s license you may go to approved shooting ranges, be issued a gun, and practice shooting targets under strict supervision. Once you turn twenty-one you should then be able to have a psychiatric evaluation, a written safety test, and a shooting range test. If you pass the tests, you can get a license to buy and own certain hand guns and rifles for self-defense. We are required to be tested in multiple ways to get a license to drive; it is only logical that it should be at least as difficult to attain a license to own a deadly weapon. Cars are also registered, and no one questions it, and it is far more important that guns be registered so that crimes are easily traced back to the offender. It should also be a law that all firearms must be locked away securely and unloaded when not in use.

Assault weapons and automatics should be strictly prohibited. I am viciously against hunting, but even if you are pro-hunting there is no reason for anyone to have automatic assault weapons. Automatic weapons are meant to kill people in an attack. They are not used in hunting, are impractical for self-defense, and no civilian has any business with such dangerous weapons. In an ideal world such weapons would not even exist, but as long as they do they must be kept from those unqualified to use them.

For those that would argue that they fear of a massive military uprising against the American people, you are exactly the type of paranoid nut that I do not want handling guns. The fact is that most of the people in our military would not turn on the American people (their own people) even if they were ordered to. Also, if the far-fetched, unlikely scenario occurred wherein the government and military utterly, blatantly, and violently turned on us and made this country a military state at gunpoint, we are not going to be saved by a crowd of civilians with a few assault weapons. The fact is that the American people have already been taken over, but it has been done in subtler ways, through economic disparities and corporate control of our government.

The reason that our weak gun control laws go utterly unchallenged is that the NRA, weapons manufacturers, and rich Christian institutions have strict monetary ties with the political “right”. The NRA supplies the right-wing with a mountain of campaign contributions and, in return, the politicians vote for and pass legislation that “protects the second amendment”, and keeps gun restrictions weak. The NRA and the GOP also fool the general public by asserting that the Democrats and liberals want to “take away your guns”, and ban guns entirely. They also feed into baseless conspiracy theories about “socialist” military take overs. The second amendment is a Republican talking point used to distract the masses and gain followers who don’t understand that the right-wing’s true agenda is to take over the people by sucking our way of life dry and turning us into ignorant, desperate subjects and sheep.

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/05/18/colorado-sheriffs-sue-over-new-state-gun-restrictions/,2013-05-18 00:00:00,[],Colorado sheriffs sue over new state gun restrictions,"Colorado sheriffs upset with gun restrictions adopted in the aftermath of last year's mass shootings filed a federal lawsuit Friday, challenging the regulations as unconstitutional.

The lawsuit involves sheriffs from 54 of Colorado's 64 counties, most representing rural, gun-friendly areas of the state.

The sheriffs say the new state laws violate Second Amendment protections that guarantee the right to keep and bear arms. Opponents are criticizing the lawsuit as political maneuvering.

The filing targets Colorado laws that limit the size of ammunition magazines and expand background checks. The regulations passed the Legislature this spring and are set to take effect July 1.

It isn't yet clear whether the sheriffs' challenge will delay or jeopardize the laws. The filing, however, guarantees the renewal of a fierce debate over gun control.

Colorado lawmakers passed the restrictions in reaction to the shooting rampage at a suburban Denver movie theater last summer, where 12 people were killed and dozens more were wounded, and the massacre at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn.

The gun control debate was one of the most emotionally charged of the legislative session, with lengthy debates and national attention. President Barack Obama added to the attention on the Colorado Statehouse, as his administration unsuccessfully pushed Congress to enact similar gun controls.

Sheriffs' attorneys are considering whether to ask the court for a preliminary injunction, which would block the Colorado laws while the lawsuit moves forward.

The law enforcement community is divided on the issue. In contrast to the sheriffs, the Colorado Association of Chiefs of Police, which includes urban departments, supports the laws. The chiefs said the measures were ""common-sense approaches"" to protect the public ""while not taking guns from law-abiding citizens in any way.""

Unlike sheriffs, police chiefs are not elected.

Democrats maintain the public is on their side, and say legislators carefully crafted the proposals that were signed.

""These laws were not constructed haphazardly,"" said Democratic Sen. Mary Hodge, the sponsor of the magazine limit. ""They were constructed to protect us from massacres like the ones we suffered in Aurora and Newtown.""

Relatives of victims of the Colorado shooting criticized the sheriffs for filing the lawsuit and accused them of playing politics.

""As a parent who lost my son Alex at the Aurora theater shooting, I ask these people to put themselves in my place,"" Tom Sullivan said in a statement. ""I do not understand why these politicians are picking guns over people.""

Weld County Sheriff John Cooke said he and his colleagues were ""not the ones playing politics with this.""

""We believe that the Legislature were the ones who were playing politics,"" he said.

Gun control opponents say the language in the regulations is unclear and doesn't provide safeguards to prevent people from inadvertently breaking the laws.

Ammunition magazines, for example, are easily converted to larger sizes, which the bill bans. Gun rights advocates also say the law expanding background checks doesn't provide enough exemptions for temporary transfers and that people conducting private transactions will have a difficult time getting appropriate checks.

Lawmakers allowed several exemptions in the background check legislation, including transfers between immediate family members, shooting events and temporary transfers of up to 72 hours.

State officials, including Attorney General John Suthers, have worked to defend the intent of the laws. Suthers, a Republican responsible for defending the law against the legal challenge, issued a statement Friday giving guidance to law enforcement on how the magazine limit should be enforced.

He said magazine features ""must be judged objectively"" and that magazines that hold 15 rounds or fewer can't be defined as ""large capacity"" simply because it can be modified to include more.

The state has 30 days to respond to the lawsuit."

AZ Gov. Jan Brewer, seen here doing her state proud

Arizona Governor Jan Brewer on Monday signed legislation forcing municipalities to resell firearms from gun buy-back programs rather than destroy them, closing a loophole in the conservative state's laws. Brewer, a Republican and staunch gun rights advocate, signed the bill preventing local governments from melting down the weapons obtained from these popular civic events. Before the new law, the state had allowed such firearms to be destroyed.

You really have to hand it to Arizona Republicans. If your philosophy is that government can't possibly do anything right, it only makes sense that you'd spend all your time being willfully incompetent This had become a bit of a big deal in Arizona, because Arizona gun nuts saw all those guns getting taken off the streets and had a sad. Yes, we know America has been having issues of late, what with murdered kids and assassination attempts against congresspeople and the like, but won't somebody think of the guns? Those poor, lonely guns? How dare you give people cash for their guns, and then melt them down for scrap, you government monsters! That's like a gun abortion! You're all anti-murder gun murderers!

Or something. Anyway, now all that's solved with the brilliant new Arizona Republican plan. What Arizona will do from now on is hold gun buy-back programs to get guns off the streets, including (by nature of the events) potentially damaged or otherwise unsafe weapons that the owners want to get rid of because they are damaged or unsafe, and then sell them right back again for (presumably) less money because FISCAL RESPONSIBILITAH. Yes, of course it's stupid, but now it's the law. (It's very much akin to the equally brilliant Arizona idea to sell their own capitol building, then lease it back at a higher cost. Yes, they actually did that. The average IQ of Arizona Republicans is apparently only a fraction of the average Arizona daily temperature.)

So at long last, Arizona guns are safe again, and Arizona towns will find themselves in the very patriotic position of removing old and damaged weapons from their neighborhoods only to sell them right back again, and nothing can possibly go wrong from that. Now if you'll excuse Jan Brewer, she has to get a start on the newest conservative plan for Arizona. They're going to fill in the Grand Canyon to make the Colorado River easier to reach. They'll need a lot of dirt, of course, but don't worry—there's a lot of dirt down at the bottom of the Canyon already, so they reckon they'll just use that.

Police say officers acted %22heroically%22 responding to high-speed pursuit through nation%27s capital

Security experts question the decision by police to fire at a moving vehicle through crowded streets

They suggest installing more vehicle barriers through the region to stop future car chases

WASHINGTON — After a car chase through the heart of the nation's capital ended with police shooting to death a 34-year-old Connecticut woman, security experts are wondering whether that was their only option.

D.C. Police Chief Cathy Lanier said the first shots were fired Thursday after the woman rammed a Secret Service vehicle near the Capitol building. The second, fatal round of shots was fired several blocks away when the woman crashed near a barrier to the Capitol complex.

Michael Lyman, a former criminal investigator who has studied use-of-force guidelines for police, said the woman's inability to penetrate barriers around the White House downgraded the situation from a national security concern to an ""old-fashioned pursuit."" From that point on, he said, officers should have tried to use other means to stop the car.

""Shooting at a moving vehicle is against all nationally recognized protocols,"" said Lyman, a criminal justice professor at Columbia College of Missouri.

Lyman said the possibility of accidentally striking innocent bystanders is just too high when trying to shoot at a moving car.

""Cops get rattled,"" he said. ""And when they get rattled, police don't always shoot straight.""

Geoffrey Alpert, a criminology professor at the University of South Carolina, said that Washington's unfortunate history as a target of terrorist attacks cannot lower the threshold for officers deciding to open fire in a crowded area.

""Does it increase the level of risk? Yes. But it's still the same standard as any other use of force,"" Alpert said. ""The officers need to explain why each one pulled the trigger and each bullet expended.""

Even if police were trying to shoot out the tires of the car in an effort to disable it — something people see in movies and TV shows all the time — experts say that's an incredibly difficult feat to actually pull off. Dan Kennedy, a forensic criminologist, said police are instructed not to attempt that, because bullets end up ricocheting off the pavement or the vehicle and potentially striking bystanders.

""There's been a real disconnect between reality and expectations on the part of civilians based largely on what they've seen on TV and in the movies,"" Kennedy said. ""It's generally a bad idea to fire at a moving vehicle and most police departments don't allow it.""

But this wasn't just a car chase down a desolated highway. The woman struck and injured an officer with her car when the chase began near the White House, she rammed a police car while evading police by the Capitol building, and the car was careening through an area filled with embassies, federal buildings and throngs of tourists.

""The officers felt their lives were in ... jeopardy, or other citizens' lives could've been in fear as well,"" Ed Clarke, a security expert, told WUSA-9. ""It's very quick how they have to make a critical decision. In a matter of milliseconds.""

Lanier said Thursday that the officers who reacted to the pursuit acted ""heroically"" under intense pressure. Given the route of the pursuit — from the White House to streets all around the Capitol building — officers did not know the intentions of the driver and had to respond assuming the worst.

""There were multiple vehicles that were rammed,"" Lanier said. ""There were officers that were struck. And two security perimeters that were attempted to be breached, so it does not appear in any way this was an accident.""

Lyman said officers could have tried to place tire-deflation devices on the road ahead of the driver. They could have used more cars to try and box her in.

Most important, Lyman said, Thursday's shooting should prompt D.C. law enforcement agencies to consider installing more pop-up vehicle barriers throughout the area. There are several such barriers — metal gates that can be raised up from the road — next to many federal buildings. But Lyman said Thursday's chase shows how they could be used along other streets in the capital region.

""These would not only stop a vehicle, they would give law enforcement officers the opportunity to apprehend without resorting to deadly force,"" he said. ""That should be a conversation that law enforcement should have in D.C.""

Alpert said the shooting should also prompt D.C. law enforcement to consider bolstering approaches to the White House, Capitol and other critical buildings.

After the driver rammed into the White House barriers, she was able to evade police and escape, starting the high-speed chase. Alpert said law enforcement should at least consider military-style entrances that include a wall that can be erected behind an approaching car to prevent it from getting a away.

""You drive up into a guard post. Once you get into that area, you're talking to the guard and if you're suspicious at all, they put up a huge barricade behind you,"" Alpert said. ""You're absolutely blocked in and have nowhere to go.""

Retired New York City police officer Valarie Carey, who is also the sister of shooting victim Miriam Carey, said late Friday that there was ""no need for a gun"" or deadly force to be used.

But both sides are girding for an intense debate ahead, as supporters of the legislation face a looming series of procedural hurdles -- on an issue where the politics is more heated than for virtually any other. The National Rifle Association, which is adamantly opposed to the bill in its current form, has already threatened to keep careful score of lawmakers' positions, even on procedural votes.

The pressure from the gun lobby, as well as lingering concerns from lawmakers in states with a tradition of gun rights that the bill could limit them, continue to make final passage a heavy lift.

Sen. Chuck Schumer said it would be a ""struggle"" to get the necessary votes to advance to final passage.

""The hard work starts now,"" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said after Thursday's procedural vote.

More On This...

President Obama, while applying more pressure to lawmakers, plans to have the mother of a Newtown shooting victim deliver the weekly White House radio address on Saturday.

The Senate voted 68-31 Thursday to advance to debate on the bill. What follows will be a string of votes on amendments, at least one of which -- on reining in the background checks provision -- is considered vital to winning conservative and moderate support. Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa., offered a compromise measure that would expand background checks to gun-show and Internet sales, while exempting some casual transactions among family members and others. It is meant to assuage concerns that the current version could be a burden on hunters and families exchanging firearms among them.

Republicans could also throw up amendments in the days ahead that would turn off Democrats.

And, importantly, Senate leaders will likely have to marshal another round of 60 votes in order to cut off debate and proceed to final passage. That procedural vote could be more difficult than Thursday's, as Schumer acknowledged.

NRA Institute for Legislative Action Director Chris Cox, in a pointed letter to senators this week, reminded them that the NRA is watching their votes carefully -- on everything from amendments to procedural matters.

""Given the importance of these issues, votes on all anti-gun amendments or proposals will be considered in NRA's future candidate evaluations,"" Cox wrote. He urged the Senate to replace many of the bill's provisions with language focused on the mental health system, school security and prosecuting violent criminals.

""Rather than focus its efforts on restricting the rights of America's 100 million law-abiding gun owners, there are things Congress can do to fix our broken mental health system; increase prosecutions of violent criminals; and make our schools safer,"" he wrote.

The NRA has already announced that the Manchin-Toomey proposal on gun checks still does not do enough to protect Second Amendment rights.

Reid is looking to start the votes on amendments -- including the Manchin-Toomey proposal -- early next week. Proponents say expanded background checks, along with proposals to toughen penalties for gun trafficking and boost school security aid, are common-sense measures that could help reduce the likelihood of tragedies like the Newtown school shooting last December."

This heartfelt conviction has surfaced lately in state legislation that attempts to nullify federal gun regulations. For the nullifiers, and many others, the broadest possible right to bear arms is purportedly enshrined in the 2nd Amendment and recognized in the Supreme Court case Heller vs. District of Columbia.

Advertisement

And yet, no matter how prevalent or fervently held, the opinion that the Bill of Rights supports and the high court acknowledges an absolute right to gun ownership is just plain wrong.

The language of the 2nd Amendment is quite clear: “A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.” As the minority in the Heller decision argued, and more than a century of judicial precedent at the federal level established, the right to bear arms was not an inherent right of citizenship but rather a right that derived from service in the militia.

The historical context in which these words were crafted clarifies what was in James Madison’s mind when he wrote them. In 1787-88, seven of the states that ratified the proposed Constitution did so on the condition that Congress give consideration to adding several amendments if and when it went into effect. These states proposed 124 amendments, none of which mentioned the right to bear arms but several of which mentioned the fear of a standing army.

When Madison sat down to write what became the Bill of Rights in the summer of 1789, those 124 proposed amendments served as the basis for his deliberations. He distilled from them an essence of 12 amendments, subsequently reduced by the states to 10. The 2nd Amendment represented Madison’s attempt to respond to the fears of a standing army by assuring that national defense would reside in the states and in militias, not at the federal level in a professional army. The right to bear arms derived from the need to assure that state militia could perform its essential mission.

All this was what constitutional scholars call “settled law” until Heller, in which the high court ruled that the right to bear arms, despite the language of the 2nd Amendment and the historical context of its creation, existed independent of service in the militia. Justice Antonin Scalia’s majority opinion is a tour de force of legalistic legerdemain, a lengthy journey through English common law, colonial charters, state constitutions and obscure 19th century court cases. Given Scalia’s judicial philosophy as an “originalist” — meaning he believes his opinions should be guided by the original intent of the framers — his failure to assess Madison’s motives in drafting the 2nd Amendment is strange, much like a devout Christian explaining his faith without mentioning Jesus.

But even Scalia, fully aware of the legal precedents he was overturning, saw fit to insert the following caveats near the end of his opinion:

Advertisement

“Like most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited…. Nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on long-standing prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.”

These caveats create a crack through which significant gun control legislation might flow. Indeed, expanded background checks and limits on automatic weapons, the key provisions in the post-Sandy Hook gun legislation debated (and defeated) by Congress earlier this year, fit comfortably within this space.

But gun control advocates need to be realistic. The Heller decision, no matter how misguided, is itself “settled law,” and the current composition of the Supreme Court will defeat any challenge to its sweeping, if limited, mandate. In addition, Congress is demonstrably hogtied by the National Rifle Assn., and even though many states (Colorado, Connecticut and New York among them) have tightened gun ownership laws since the massacres in Newtown, Aurora and Tucson, another half a dozen are trying the nullification gambit.

Given all this, the only alternative is to go back to “the people” themselves, where there remains good reason to believe a clear majority wants sensible reform at odds with the agenda of the NRA and the nullifiers. Remember: As 2013 began, an astonishing 89% of voters, including 75% of NRA members, were in favor of expanded background checks, and sizable majorities favored a ban on sales of semiautomatic weapons. Months later, polls still find most Americans are in favor of checks, “assault rifle” bans and restrictions on who is allowed to purchase guns.

The terms of a national discussion would no doubt include the gun violence tragedies we’ve faced, but it should also focus on the legal core of the gun rights issue: the 2nd Amendment and the Heller decision. These two tools, so often used to fight gun control, can and should be used to affect reasonable reform.

The intent of the founders needs to be heard and understood. The men who hammered out the Constitution, argued for its ratification and underlined our liberties with the Bill of Rights, would urge us to think about the issue this way: How do we balance the right to bear arms against the collective security of the American people?

Framed in this fashion, we can all come together as fellow citizens to discuss in a sensible rather than strident tone where the line needs to be drawn between our rights and our responsibilities.

All that’s required is that we channel our inner James Madisons, and even our inner Scalias. There is no unlimited right to bear arms — on that these two men agree, and so should we.

As gun-control opponents often argue, no single law will prevent any single act of gun violence. But hardly a day goes by without a reminder of how out-of-control our gun culture is, how much violence is committed with guns—and how tragic it is that the gun lobbies want to prevent the government from even trying to rein things in.

In Colorado, hours before Gov. John Hickenlooper was scheduled to sign three laws that would require background checks for all gun transfers, charge buyers for those checks and limit magazines to 15 rounds (imagine that, only 15 rounds!), the head of the Department of Corrections, Tom Clements, was murdered by a gunman at his home in Monument, Colorado, hardly a locus of street crime. Given his job, it’s not unlikely he was killed by a felon who should never have been able to obtain a gun.

Colorado has long honored the right to own guns and some county sheriffs have said they won’t enforce the new measures, but the state legislature and Gov. Hickenlooper recognized they were needed.



Which brings us to Congress, where that realization has yet to sink in. When the debate over gun laws started after the Newtown murders, Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, who wrote the expired assault weapons ban, introduced a new one. And other lawmakers introduced proposals to ban high-capacity ammunition clips.

But Majority Leader Harry Reid made it clear from the outset that he wasn’t going to push for those measures and neither made it into the bill that will go to the Senate floor. “America has to stand up,” said a weary and angry Senator Feinstein, who will offer a separate assault-weapons ban amendment. “I can’t fight the NRA. The NRA spends unlimited sums, backed by the gun manufacturers, who are craven in my view.”

Senator Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, also has not given up. He is calling for a vote on high-capacity magazines.

Ms. Feinstein’s proposal will almost certainly fail, and Mr. Murphy’s likely doesn’t have a chance, either. The opposition from the gun lobbies — the National Rifle Association and the Gun Owners of America — is too intense.

Rep. Mike Thompson, Democrat of California, who is a Vietnam veteran and dedicated deer hunter, told us this morning in a meeting at the Times that he was shocked at how much the gun lobby is now dominated by people who think they need to own the same gun the police or the army has so they can protect themselves against tyranny — a grandiose fantasy.

At least Mr. Thompson thinks there’s a good chance that Congress will act to make the background-check system more comprehensive. The strategy is to bring the more or less identical background check bills on to the floor of the Senate and the House at the same time and hope that overwhelming public support for those measures will overcome the gun lobby’s objections, and reflex opposition in the House to any Democratic proposal. Mr. Thompson is co-sponsor of the House bill, with Rep. Peter King of New York, a conservative Republican.

Those bills would finally mandate background checks at gun shows, and before the purchase of any gun advertised for sale on TV, in print media or on the internet, including on sites like Craigslist. That would be a huge step.

Mr. Thompson and other proponents of gun-control laws say there is also a good chance for passage of a law intended to crack down “straw purchasers” — meaning people who can pass background checks and then re-sell guns, sometimes in large quantities, to criminals who cannot pass background checks.

Both bills are important, but neither amounts to the sort of comprehensive gun control that other Western nations enacted years ago."

During an appearance on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) said that “over 90%"" of Senate Democrats would be supporting his amendment when the Senate votes on it, expected shortly after 4 p.m. EDT.

“If we just had 20% of our Republican colleagues -- that’s not a heavy ask, it’s not a heavy lift -- only 20%, that’s 9 members … this thing would be home,” he said.

Under the terms of an agreement between Senate leaders to consider amendments to the larger gun bill, nine amendments are to be offered Wednesday, from Democrats and Republicans. Each would require 60 votes to pass.

Most whip counts indicate that sponsors have 52 votes for the background checks amendment, including three Republicans -- Sens. Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania and Mark Kirk of Illinois, the measure’s co-sponsors, and Maine Sen. Susan Collins.

It was just a week ago that the announcement by Manchin and Toomey on the terms of the background check plan was seen as a possible breakthrough in the nation’s gun debate. But further GOP support failed to materialize, and some Democrats facing tough reelection bids have not committed.

On Tuesday, even as Manchin and Toomey pressed their case in their respective party luncheons, more Republicans stated their opposition. Late Tuesday, Alaska Republican Lisa Murkowski said she would vote no, and would instead support an amendment being introduced by Iowa Republican Chuck Grassley that she said was “more in line with the views of Alaskans because it accomplishes our shared goals without adding any new steps or layers of bureaucracy for any law-abiding Alaskan who wants to purchase a firearm for sport or protection.”

Manchin, himself a red-state Democrat who had an A-rating from the National Rifle Assn., said he thought he could bring the “credibility” needed to convince skeptical colleagues that his measure would strengthen the background check system while protecting 2nd Amendment rights.

“I can’t understand it. I really can’t,” Manchin said in the interview, talking about the stubborn opposition to the amendment.

A defeat of the Manchin-Toomey measure would likely doom the fate of the larger gun bill, which also includes new penalties for gun trafficking and more funding for school safety.

But Democrats have signaled the case for stricter gun laws is one that they will continue to press.

The real reason the Second Amendment was ratified, and why it says ""State"" instead of ""Country"" (the Framers knew the difference - see the 10th Amendment), was to preserve the slave patrol militias in the southern states, which was necessary to get Virginia's vote. Founders Patrick Henry, George Mason, and James Madison were totally clear on that . . . and we all should be too.

In the beginning, there were the militias. In the South, they were also called the ""slave patrols,"" and they were regulated by the states.

y the time the Constitution was ratified, hundreds of substantial slave uprisings had occurred across the South. Blacks outnumbered whites in large areas, and the state militias were used to both prevent and to put down slave uprisings. As Dr. Bogus points out, slavery can only exist in the context of a police state, and the enforcement of that police state was the explicit job of the militias.

If the anti-slavery folks in the North had figured out a way to disband - or even move out of the state - those southern militias, the police state of the South would collapse. And, similarly, if the North were to invite into military service the slaves of the South, then they could be emancipated, which would collapse the institution of slavery, and the southern economic and social systems, altogether.

These two possibilities worried southerners like James Monroe, George Mason (who owned over 300 slaves) and the southern Christian evangelical, Patrick Henry (who opposed slavery on principle, but also opposed freeing slaves).

Their main concern was that Article 1, Section 8 of the newly-proposed Constitution, which gave the federal government the power to raise and supervise a militia, could also allow that federal militia to subsume their state militias and change them from slavery-enforcing institutions into something that could even, one day, free the slaves.

This seems like a plausible interpretation of constitutional history to me. The northern and southern states had come together to defeat the British but they were divided by very different economic and cultural systems. The tensions that would eventually lead to the civil war were already very present in the convention in Philadelphia. Much of the negotiation revolved around crafting compromises between the two regions. The most notorious of them was counting slaves as 3/5 of a person. The constitution also set a date for the importation of additional slaves to end. The nation about to be born was not at peace about slavery.

I have always been puzzled by the language in the second amendment about a well regulated militia. There was provision in the constitution for a standing army and navy. What was really meant by a militia? This makes very good sense that the slave states demanded military type forces under their direct control for the purpose of controlling their slave society. If you tie the right to keep and bear arms directly to the existence of a militia, then the whole thing is seriously out of date and nothing more than an historical anachronism. It seems to me that many of the people on the far right who are frothing at the mouth over their guns come off as being seriously anachronistic as well."

In the two months since the massacre in Newtown, Conn., there are a lot of people who still can’t shake it — who don’t want to shake it, really. They keep replaying in their minds what it must have been like in Sandy Hook Elementary School that awful December morning when Adam Lanza killed 20 children and six adults at the school before taking his own life. They think about their own children. They wonder how America can stop such senseless, random, murderous spectacles.

Rebecca and Jon Bond are two such people. They have three children, ranging in ages from 4 to 8. (Jon has two older children as well.) They live in a townhouse in Greenwich Village. Previous mass shootings had spurred the usual “when will this stop?” thoughts, but like most of us, they soon moved on. The Bonds knew so little about guns that “I thought a magazine was, you know, a magazine,” says Rebecca, a contributing editor at Architectural Digest.

Newtown changed them. Jon, 55, is a well-known advertising executive (he co-founded the hip firm Kirshenbaum & Bond in 1987); Rebecca, 46, is a branding expert. As they found themselves obsessively thinking and talking about Newtown, they decided to use their considerable talents and contacts to try to do something about it. On Thursday, I went to Minneapolis to get a glimpse of the earliest, tentative fruits of their labors.

Here is Jon and Rebecca’s big idea: They want to create an anti-violence organization — a “brand,” they call it — that will appeal to gun owners and nongun owners alike. “When you talk to gun owners, if your purpose is to make them feel bad, they will push back,” said Jon, “and you will lose them.”"
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/09/26/cause-for-concern-will-un-arms-trade-treaty-trample-on-us-gun-rights/,2013-09-26 00:00:00,[],Gun registry 'scheme' among concerns over UN arms treaty,"Secretary of State John Kerry signed an international treaty on arms regulation Wednesday, angering conservative lawmakers and rattling the National Rifle Association despite claims that the treaty won't infringe on gun rights.

So what's all the fuss about?

The treaty, which took seven years to negotiate, would regulate the $70 billion global trade in conventional arms. The U.S. is the largest arms exporter in the world, and Kerry's signature was seen as a significant step in pushing it forward.

Supporters say the treaty sends a bold global message advocating the first-ever moral standards on the cross-border trade linked to human rights violations around the world. But to some on U.S. soil, the treaty treads into dangerous territory and could step on the constitutional rights of Americans.

They point in part to language, at the very beginning of the document, that includes ""small arms and light weapons"" and worry this could cover firearms owned by Americans.

According to the treaty, the international sale of weapons would be linked to the human rights records of buyers; it requires the countries that sign on to establish regulations for selling weapons. This has raised concern that the treaty could be used as an excuse to push new gun laws.

But the treaty also advocates keeping data of arms purchases, which the NRA and other groups say could be used as an international log to keep tabs on gun owners.

The record-keeping section in the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) encourages members to ""maintain records of conventional arms covered under Article 2,"" which include battle tanks, armored combat vehicles, large-caliber artillery systems, warships and small arms and light weapons.

Further, those records should be kept for a minimum of 10 years, the treaty states -- which NRA leader Wayne LaPierre has referred to as ""nothing more than gun registration by a different name.""

Because the treaty's language is so broad, LaPierre has said that ""manufacturers of civilian shotguns would have to comply with the same regulatory process as a manufacturer of military attack helicopters.""

Chris Cox, the executive director for the group's Institute for Legislative Action, says the treaty ""threatens individual firearm ownership with an invasive registration scheme.""

The treaty also calls for potential arms deals to be evaluated on whether the buyer would be able to carry out crimes against humanity or other war crimes, including genocide. It also prohibits the export of conventional arms if they can be used in attacks on civilians or civilian buildings such as schools and hospitals.

What it doesn't do is regulate the domestic sale of weapons in any country. And Kerry said Wednesday: ""This treaty will not diminish anyone's freedom. In fact, the treaty recognizes the freedom of both individuals and states to obtain, possess, and use arms for legitimate purposes.""

Even though the ATT was created to monitor the global arms trade and essentially shame countries into revealing alliances by making them document who they sold weapons to, there is no clear-cut punishment for those who don't.

There are many parts of the treaty that are also open to interpretation. For example, the international pact contains no language on how to handle countries who loan or gift weapons to others.

Part of the concern with the treaty, among critics, is its vagueness.

In April, the U.N. General Assembly voted to approve the ATT 154-3. Those voting in favor included the U.S., Germany, France, Belgium, Spain, Netherlands and the United Kingdom.

Twenty-three countries abstained from voting, including China and Russia. Several others said the human rights criteria in the treaty was too vague.

Iran, North Korea and Syria voted against the treaty.

Fifty countries need to ratify the treaty for it to enter into force. So far, only six have and the likelihood of it being approved by the U.S. Senate is slim. It takes two-thirds of the 100 lawmakers in the Senate to win ratification.

The domestic battle heating up over the treaty is what is likely to give the Obama administration the most trouble.

In a letter to President Obama, Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., said the treaty raised significant legislative questions and warned the Obama administration against taking any action to implement the treaty without the Senate's advice or consent.

Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, was among 35 senators who earlier this year co-sponsored a resolution expressing concerns about the dangers of the treaty and how it might infringe the constitutional rights of Americans.

""I'd like to see the U.N. try to send inspectors to the Texas State Rifle Association's annual gathering,"" he said in a statement after Kerry signed the treaty. ""Law-abiding Texans who are in the market for an imported shotgun, pistol, or rifle out to be very concerned by the administration's move today."""

Nine states have proposed such legislation since President Obama and fellow Democrats in the Senate began trying to tighten federal gun laws in the wake of several mass shootings that occurred within months of each other.

“There’s a lot of momentum,” Montana activist Gary Marbut told FoxNews.com on Monday.

Marbut was behind the original Firearms Freedom Act, which says the Commerce Clause allowing Congress to regulate inter-state commerce does not apply to the in-state manufacturing, selling and ownership of firearms. Montana passed the bill in 2009.

Since then, a host of other states have tried to pass copycat legislation. Alabama, Georgia, Indiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Washington have proposed such legislation since January -- following the Dec. 14, 2012, shooting in which 20 first-graders and six adults were killed inside a Newtown, Conn., elementary school.

However, Montana's legislation is hardly settled law. Shortly after the law passed in his state, the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives wrote Marbut to say federal law still supersedes.

Marbut acknowledges he wrote the legislation to set up a legal challenge and “roll back a half a century of bad precedent.”

The bill is scheduled to finally get its day in court when the Ninth Circuit begins oral arguments March 4. Marbut expects to lose in the liberal-leaning court, which includes San Francisco, Seattle and Portland, Ore. But he thinks such a decision will put him in a better position to appeal to the country’s highest court.

“The mood of the country is right for the Supreme Court to consider what I think is a great mistake,” said Marbut.

Marbut, a shooting-range supplier, says existing big-name gun manufacturers are “not players” in the case because they have a nationwide market regulated by federal law. However, small upstart companies including gunsmiths and mom-and-pop operations would likely be able to make and sell guns within states, if the courts rule in his favor.

“Making firearms is not rocket science,” Marbut said.

The proposals have gotten plenty of pushback. State Democratic Rep. Robyn Driscoll criticized the Montana legislature for passing the law at the time, telling The Wall Street Journal a couple years ago that lawmakers wouldn’t support funding for education or women’s clinics but passed “this blatantly unconstitutional bill to pay for a Supreme Court fight.”

Montana passed the law at a time when gun control still was not widely discussed on Capitol Hill. Now, Obama and Senate Democrats have proposed legislation that essentially calls for a universal background check for potential gun buyers and re-instituting a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.

While the National Rifle Association and other gun-rights advocacy groups have mounted their opposition based largely on the Second Amendment right to bear arms, Marbut is focused on the 10th Amendment that focuses more on the limits of federal power.

Eight states including Montana, Arizona, Alaska and Tennessee have passed similar legislation, while 17 have had bills proposed but not passed in prior sessions."

As NY governor Cuomo put it, “Confiscation could be an option"". Also, with the passage of the NY law, citizens were expected to turn in or destroy magazines that were suddenly illegal. With this remark, the genie left the bottle and it is going to be very difficult to get it back in. This brings us to the problem with Universal Background Checks. The idea behind it being that every gun transfer, with few exceptions, requires a background check to be performed. The idea is obviously an attempt to close what is commonly called, ""the gun show loophole"", or more formally referred to as face to face transfers. On the surface, this doesn't seem like a bad idea and may indeed prevent some who should not be allowed access to guns from getting them and may also lead to the arrest and prosecution of some criminals who try. The problem, as with most things, is that the Devil is in the details. The most fundamental problem with this proposal is that criminals will continue to ignore it and will still engage in black market transactions. With approximately millions of guns already in circulation it is easy to see why even in the light of a requirement for background checks that a thriving black market will remain.

In light of the realization of the power possessed by the black markets, how is society to enforce or otherwise make full use of a requirement for Universal Background Checks. The unfortunately truth is that in the absence of Universal Gun Registration that a Universal Background Check is all but meaningless. This can't be overemphasized, so let’s repeat it. In order for a UBC to have any meaning, it requires gun registration and this is a problem. It is a problem because, as the gun community correctly argues, registration leads to confiscation. There is only one reason for the government or law enforcement to know who has what guns. That they can take them when it has been decided that Joe and Jane Citizen are no longer allowed to have a particular gun and to prevent Joe or Jane from refusing to comply with the forced ban. As I mentioned above, thanks to governor Cuomo, this genie is no longer in its bottle.

I am a member of the online gun forum, defensivecarry.com. One member of that forum, who goes by the name Hot Guns, claims to be a licensed gun dealer with an FFL. Hot Guns recently reported that a while back he was subjected to an audit by the BATFE. Regulations require him to keep copies of the Federal Form 4473 for each firearm purchase; in fact this form is required for each inquiry into the NICS background check system. Supposedly the NICS records are purged after a period of three months. Even though these records are supposed to be purged, the auditor had copies of the records going back at least one year and demanded to see the corresponding 4473 forms. When Hot Guns questioned how and why they were inquiring for these records as they were supposed to have been purged, he received the response from the auditor, ""That is what we are supposed to say."" In other words, the records are not purged and the government is using the form 4473 as a backdoor form of registration. Apparently this is proving insufficient and some desire to use the recent tragedy to bring registration to the forefront.

For me, this represents a turning point. Clearly the objective is registration and this cannot be allowed to happen. I think it has already gone too far. As Universal Background Checks are meaningless without formal registration, and I am opposed to registration, I can therefore no longer support the idea of Universal Background Checks."

(CNN) - Sens. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia, and Patrick J. Toomey, R-Pennsylvania, plan to announce a bipartisan deal on background checks for gun shows and Internet sales at an 11 a.m. press conference today, CNN's Dana Bash has learned.

A Democratic leadership source says the compromise will likely be the first amendment to gun legislation being considered, after the Senate votes to begin the gun debate Thursday.



READ MORE: CNN Poll: Popular background checks also cause worry

The breakthrough background check agreement is a key part of gun legislation. Because it has been struck by two senators with strong support from the NRA, they hope to find the 60 votes that will be needed to overcome opposition to pass their amendment

The senate is expected to debate gun legislation for at least two weeks.

Democrats believe as many as a dozen GOP senators will vote with them, making up for the handful of pro-gun Democrats who might vote against beginning debate on the bill. Fourteen Republicans promise to filibuster taking up the measure.

Several Republican senators told CNN Tuesday they would only vote to begin debate on the bill if they were assured by Democrats they would be allowed to offer amendments to the legislation.

Democratic leaders want to give senators from both parties ample opportunities to amend the bill and are prepared to debate it beyond a scheduled recess the first week in May, if doing so will increase the chances of passage.

“The way you put together a coalition to pass the bill is to allow as many amendment votes as you can. We are willing to take the time to do that and have that process,” the aide said.

Those negotiators will now have more time to find common ground on language, since the gun debate is expected to be lengthy. Democratic leaders also argue any bill they put on the floor will represent a substantial improvement in gun safety.

Many of those additional votes could be politically difficult for centrist Democrats, especially those up for re-election in red states, as Republicans are expected to craft amendments designed to put those senators on the spot. Nevertheless, Democratic leaders have determined it’s a risk they need to take if they want to pass substantive legislation to respond to the mass shootings that have plagued the nation in recent years.

“Once we’re on it we want to have an open process where there are a lot of votes and we really work through that,” the aide said.

On Tuesday, voters in Colorado recalled two state senators–Angela Giron (D-Pueblo) and Senate President John Morse (D-Colorado Springs)–that supported Colorado Gov. John Hickenloooper’s (D) sweeping gun control legislation, which he signed into law in March. As Breitbart News reported, Morse lost his recall election 51 to 49 percent, and Giron lost hers by a “whopping 56 to 44 percent.”

Bloomberg reportedly called Hickenlooper on at least two occasions before the Colorado governor signed the gun control laws, and he gave $350,000 more to his Mayors Against Illegal Guns group to back the efforts of Morse and Giron to fight the recall efforts against them leading up to the elections. With Bloomberg’s gun control dreams fading in Colorado, he may be turning his sights on Virginia through McAuliffe.

At the end of August, as the Colorado recall efforts were heating up, Bloomberg and McAuliffe reportedly met in McAuliffe’s native state of New York. The meeting prompted Second Amendment advocates in Virginia to wonder if Bloomberg and McAuliffe may have discussed something similar to NY SAFE Act for Virginia as a condition of Bloomberg’s financial support or endorsing McAuliffe; this would presumably help McAuliffe court Virginia’s business-oriented independent voters, particularly in Northern Virginia. Virginia, like Colorado, is quickly becoming a national bellwether on a host of issues.

As Breitbart News reported, at least “one New York-based gun manufacturer” decided to move from the state because of NY SAFE Act. The Syracuse Post-Standard noted the law “expands a ban on military-style weapons, requires mental health professionals to report threats, limits magazines to seven bullets, taxes bullets, and creates a registry.”

Politico, which reported the meeting between McAuliffe and Bloomberg, said it was unclear what the meeting was for, but noted that Bloomberg has indeed spent more than $15 million on his Mayors Against Illegal Guns group and candidates who back his gun control agenda.

In the RealClearPolitics average of polls, McAuliffe has nearly an eight-point lead over Republican Ken Cuccinelli in the gubernatorial contest, though recent polls have found that roughly 10% of the electorate is undecided. Election forecasters have the race pegged as “lean McAuliffe” or “tossup”; it is often difficult to predict turnout in an off-year elections in which the most fervent supporters are the only ones guaranteed to go to the polls.

As Breitbart News noted, McAuliffe reportedly purchased a gun for the first time in January of 2013, and the National Rifle Association has given him an “F” rating."

Editor’s Note: On Wednesday, CNN TV and CNN.com are taking an in-depth look at “Guns Under Fire: A CNN Special Report on Background Checks.” John J. Donohue is C. Wendell and Edith M. Carlsmith professor of law at Stanford Law School and research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research.

(CNN) —

In a new poll, Americans indicated that they support universal background checks by a margin of 91% to 8%. Even in households with guns, the margin was an overwhelming 88% to 11%.

“We think it’s reasonable to provide mandatory instant criminal background checks for every sale at every gun show. No loopholes anywhere for anyone.” Did President Barack Obama say that? No, that’s from an advertisement taken out by the NRA in USA Today in 1999.

But a more powerful NRA today is in no mood to follow the slogan of their “be reasonable” ad campaign of 14 years ago. This relatively small group – the NRA boasts that it has 4.5 million members, which is peanuts compared to the roughly 40 million AARP members – might have the political power to pull it off.

John J. Donohue

Federal law prohibits selling guns to felons or the mentally ill. Background checks are the only way to enforce that law. So, besides criminals and the insane, who could possibly oppose universal background checks?

Gun manufacturers.

Background checks on gun sales: How do they work?

They are the ones who call the shots at the NRA, and they are the most important people in the opposition. The manufacturers don’t want anything that interferes with total gun sales and profits.

Background checks would impose a minor burden on gun transactions, but more importantly, limit the size of the market (and therefore, profits) in two ways.

The direct loss of profit comes because closing the current gaping loophole in the background check system will shut off sales to criminals and the mentally ill who are effectively free to buy all the guns they want at gun shows and through private transactions.

But there is also an indirect loss of profit: Cutting off sales to the mentally ill and criminals will reduce crime and thereby reduce the public’s demand for guns for self-protection.

The gun manufacturers saw gun sales plummet during the dark days of the Clinton administration when crime dropped sharply every year. The 42% drop in the murder rate from 1993 to 2000 was a nightmare for gun sellers. Nothing scares the NRA as much as a sense of calm and safety in the public.

Opinion: The government wants your gun rights

What about gun owners? Do they have concerns about universal background checks? If one believes the recent poll that only 8% of the population and only 11% of those in household with guns oppose these checks, then not really.

But the same poll shows that the NRA has managed to convince a lot of Americans that universal background checks might lead to gun confiscation. This, no doubt, increases some gun owners’ fears.

Amazingly, the poll found that in response to the question – “Do you believe that if there are background checks for all gun purchases, the government will or will not use that information in the future to confiscate legally owned guns?” – 48% said there will be confiscation. Quite frankly, this is delusional.

If, when only 8% of Americans oppose the policy, you can’t get a law that is designed to keep criminals and the insane from buying guns because of the power of the gun lobby, you certainly aren’t going to get anything like confiscation when there would be massive opposition.

Why is this so hard? The disconnect on background checks

Moreover, even in some unimaginable world in which you could get gun confiscation, universal background checks would make no difference – there are about 300 million guns in America with no need to go through any background check. Confiscation would be overturned in court in any event, since it is now prohibited by the Constitution.

Some gun owners presumably just don’t want to be bothered by any additional regulation of guns, but background checks would be a minor inconvenience for anyone outside remote rural areas. There are also those who think background checks might expose us to tyrannous attack from our own government or perhaps even a foreign government that the U.S. military can’t defeat but armed citizens could fend off. But again, putting that much confidence in arming criminals and the insane seems more than a bit strange.

Despite the fact that many other countries have similar requirements (and yes, much lower rates of murder and mayhem), gun groups in our country have raised alarmist concerns about the “logistical nightmare” of background checks for private sales. One of my favorites was:

What is a licensed retailer to do in the event of a “double denial” (both the private party buyer and seller are denied).

We should be so lucky to get the gun out of the hands of two illegitimate possessors.

In fact, the only argument for opposing gun background checks is that you believe the U.S. is already so gun-saturated and current gun owners are so reckless about allowing access to their guns by prohibited parties, that even if they can’t buy them, the criminals and insane will get their hands on guns in any event.

In such a world, there is no benefit from background checks to offset the costs of running the system. I hope we are not there yet, although that would be nirvana for the NRA.

But the NRA is growing frustrated with the courts, and it has taken its complaint to the Supreme Court, relying upon the advocacy skills of one of the nation’s leading lawyers, former U.S. Solicitor General Paul D. Clement.

gunswide

In unusually blunt language, Clement in two recent documents filed at the court is asking the Justices to live up to the full promise that the NRA saw when gun owners won a constitutional breakthrough on the Second Amendment at the court five years ago.

Clement’s basic argument now is that the court made a sweeping change in the constitutional meaning of the Second Amendment – “a watershed moment,” he calls it — and yet many lower courts have been acting as if the Supreme Court did nothing of the kind. He has even included retired Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor in the complaint, for a ruling she wrote while sitting temporarily on a lower federal court (although he did not mention her by name).

The NRA for years has been in the forefront of a widespread campaign to broaden the rights protected by the Second Amendment’s guarantee of a “right to keep and bear arms” – a part of the Constitution since 1791. For years, the NRA helped pay for scholars’ research in support of the argument that the Amendment protects a very broad individual right to have a gun. That ran up against a widespread perception that the right existed only as a community right to arm, as with the colonial militia or the modern National Guard.

The personal right argument finally prevailed in the Supreme Court’s 2008 decision in District of Columbia v. Heller. The court said that the right was not “absolute” and that it was subject to “reasonable restrictions.” Moreover, that initial ruling dealt only with a right to have a gun for self-defense in the home. Still, gun owners and the NRA quickly turned it into a legal rallying point to challenge a whole host of gun controls; they did not regard the new right as limited at all.

Story continues

Their cause advanced much further, in 2011, when the NRA was part of a winning coalition in the Supreme Court case of McDonald v. Chicago, extending the personal right protection to put some limits on state and local gun control laws, too. The Heller decision had struck down only a Washington, D.C., law banning handguns. Moreover, the McDonald decision made clear that the new right was a “fundamental” one, establishing it as a right of the highest constitutional order.

Clement has been an important ally of those pressing for an expansive Second Amendment right. He argued in the Heller case for the George W. Bush Administration, as Solicitor General, supporting a declaration of a personal gun right (a position that that administration had adopted in 2001). After leaving government, Clement was the NRA’s own lawyer as he argued for it in the McDonald case. And he is continuing now as the NRA’s advocate before the Supreme Court.

He unleashed his new challenge to the lower courts in late July, filing a new Supreme Court appeal for the NRA to protest a federal appeals court ruling upholding a federal law that bans licensed gun dealers from selling handguns to minors. “This case,” Clement wrote, “is part of a pervasive pattern of stubborn resistance to this court’s holding that the Second Amendment secures a right that is not just individual, but fundamental….The decision below is illustrative of the efforts of lower courts to limit Heller and McDonald to their facts while ignoring the clear import of their reasoning.”

The lower court (the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, based in Cincinnati), the NRA filing said, had indicated “that law-abiding citizens do not possess Second Amendment rights at all unless the legislature deems them sufficiently ‘responsible’ to keep and bear arms.” Indeed, the document added, the Sixth Circuit had expressed doubts that “young adults even possess Second Amendment rights.”

What has been going on – not only in the courts but in other parts of government – is a campaign of “massive resistance to this court’s decisions,” Clement said. Officials and judges, he added, “have simply been unable to break habits formed during pre-Heller days.” There has been a concentrated effort, he asserted, at “limiting the scope of the Second Amendment to the precise circumstances at issue” in the two Supreme Court cases.

Earlier this month, Clement filed a new paper with the Supreme Court, a friend-of-the-court brief to support a Maryland man’s challenge to his state’s law that generally bans the carrying of handguns outside the home for self-defense purposes, unless the individual has a permit that can only be obtained with proof of a “good and substantial reasons” for fearing for one’s safety.

In Clement’s list of grievances about what the lower courts have been failing to do on Second Amendment rights, he said that another federal appeals court – the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, based in New York City – “would not even make a definitive ruling on whether the Second Amendment applies to a summer home.” It chose, instead, to ask a New York state court for an interpretation of a state gun control law rather than “giving immediate relief” to the gun owner in the case, Clement said. That ruling, in the case of Osterweil v. Bartlett, was written by retired Justice O’Connor, during a temporary judging assignment on that appeals court.

The individual involved in that case, Alfred Osterweil, lives in Louisiana, but has a summer home in Summit, N.Y., but was denied a permit to have a gun there. Clement is Osterweil’s lawyer in that case.

The NRA’s complaint, as spelled out by Clement in his new court filings, does not criticize the Supreme Court itself. But the Justices have refused, at least a half-dozen times in recent years, to grant review of new cases seeking to expand the Second Amendment right beyond the home. It’s that pattern the NRA and Clement intend to change.

http://news.yahoo.com/ariz-bill-passed-makes-cities-sell-turned-guns-125026520.html,,[],Ariz. bill passed makes cities sell turned-in guns,"PHOENIX (AP) — Arizona cities and counties would have to sell guns turned in at community buyback events instead of destroying them under a law passed by the Legislature.

The bill doesn't have any effect on guns seized by law enforcement, which already have to be sold to a federally licensed dealer under a law passed last year. But that didn't stop a lengthy debate that veered into the possibility that the gun used to shoot U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords might end up back on the street.

The bill is designed to eliminate a loophole in last year's law that requires police agencies to sell seized guns. Cities, including Tucson, have continued to hold buyback events and destroy the weapons, arguing that because they were voluntarily surrendered, they aren't covered by the law.

The Senate passed House Bill 2455 Tuesday on an 18-12 party-line vote and it now goes to Republican Gov. Jan Brewer for action.

Democrats argued that Republicans complain about the federal government when it requires the state to take action, yet they're quick to force local governments to do what they want.

""We hate it when the federal government mandates it to the state, and we're doing the same thing,"" said Sen. Lynne Pancrazi, D-Yuma. They also complained about victims having to deal with the knowledge that a gun that killed a loved one could end up back on the streets.

Republicans countered that allowing cities and counties to destroy guns that could be sold is a waste of taxpayer's money.

""It's not about protecting Second Amendment rights, it's about protecting the taxpayers,"" said Sen. Rick Murphy, R-Peoria. He also argued that the state doesn't require the destruction of cars involved in fatal accidents, so requiring guns to be destroyed is simply a feel-good measure that protects no one.

Murphy and Senate President Andy Biggs, R-Gilbert, pushed back at the argument against the state telling cities and counties what to do. Both noted that states retain rights not given to the federal government through the U.S. Constitution, while under the state constitution, cities and counties are subdivisions of the state.

During testimony before a House committee in February, Maricopa County Supervisor Mary Rose Wilcox said buyback programs give people who no longer want guns in their homes a safe way to dispose of them. Some are worried the weapons could be stolen, and others want to prevent a family member from accessing them, she said.

""There are many, many reasons, but they would never fathom that the guns they turn in would be recirculated again,"" Wilcox said."

Former FBI agent on ban%3A %27What a joke%27

Ban would allow guns that can use large magazines

Different models of same gun face different rulings

WASHINGTON (AP) — Congress' latest crack at a new assault weapons ban would protect more than 2,200 specific firearms, including a semi-automatic rifle that is nearly identical to one of the guns used in the bloodiest shootout in FBI history.

One model of that firearm, the Ruger .223 caliber Mini-14, is on the proposed list to be banned, while a different model of the same gun is on a list of exempted firearms in legislation the Senate is considering. The gun that would be protected from the ban has fixed physical features and can't be folded to be more compact. Yet the two firearms are equally deadly.

""What a joke,"" said former FBI agent John Hanlon, who survived the 1986 shootout in Miami. He was shot in the head, hand, groin and hip with a Ruger Mini-14 that had a folding stock. Two FBI agents died and five others were wounded.

Hanlon recalled lying on the street as brass bullet casings showered on him. He thought the shooter had an automatic weapon.

Both models of the Ruger Mini-14 specified in the proposed bill can take detachable magazines that hold dozens of rounds of ammunition. ""I can't imagine what the difference is,"" Hanlon said.

President Barack Obama has called for restoring a ban on military-style assault weapons and limiting the size of ammunition magazines.

A bill introduced last month by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. would ban 157 specific firearms designed for military and law enforcement use and exempt others made for hunting purposes. It also would ban ammunition magazines that hold more than 10 rounds.

Yet there are firearms that would be protected under Feinstein's proposal that can take large capacity magazines like the ones used in mass shootings that enable a gunman to fire dozens of rounds of ammunition without reloading.

Feinstein said in a written response to questions from The Associated Press that the list of more than 2,200 exempted firearms was designed to ""make crystal clear"" that the bill would not affect hunting and sporting weapons.

The December shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., that left 26 students and educators dead forced Washington to focus on curbing gun violence, a risky political move not tried in decades.

The gun industry, which is fighting any sort of ban, says gun ownership in the U.S. is the highest it's ever been, with more than 100 million firearms owners.

Obama and Vice President Joseph Biden have traveled around the country in an effort to gain support for new laws. Feinstein's proposal is the only sweeping piece of legislation designed to ban assault weapons currently being considered.

But some gun experts say the lists of banned and exempted firearms show a lack of understanding and expertise of guns.

""There's no logic to it,"" said Greg Danas, president of a Massachusetts-based expert witness business and firearms ballistic laboratory. ""What kind of effect is it going to have?""

Feinstein's bill defines an assault weapon as a semi-automatic firearm with a detachable magazine that has one of several military characteristics that are specified in her legislation. Examples of those characteristics include a pistol grip, which makes a firearm easier to hold, and a forward grip, which makes the firearm easier to stabilize to improve accuracy. The definition is similar to the one in Congress' original ban on assault weapons, which went into effect in 1994 and was widely criticized for outlawing firearms based on cosmetic features.

Feinstein was behind the 1994 law which, at the time, protected more than 600 firearms. The current bill would exempt by name and model more than 2,200 firearms by name and model. Feinstein said her staff had worked for more than a year to draft updates for the ban that expired in 2004, and it was apparent in the wake of recent mass shootings that now was the time to introduce a new bill. She said her staff consulted with law enforcement agencies and policy experts for months to create the expanded list.

Naming firearms that would remain legal under an assault weapons ban is a politically motivated gesture that was used to help pass the original ban in the early 1990s, people familiar with the process said.

Any firearm that does not fall within the law's definition of an assault weapon would not be banned. As a result, the list gives vulnerable politicians cover from constituents who do not want to give up their firearms.

For example, a politician can look at the list and assure a constituent that the government would not ban the firearm he or she loves to use for deer hunting. Under both the 1994 law and the currently proposed one, the government would not have the authority to take away guns people already legally own. The ban would only apply to specific firearms manufactured and sold after the law is enacted.

A list of exempted firearms was not part of Feinstein's original assault weapons ban two decades ago, said Michael Lenett, one of the lead congressional staffers on gun control issues in 1994. A separate bill in circulation exempted far fewer hunting and sporting firearms, Lenett said.

The purpose of creating such a list was to assure people that the government was not going after any legitimate hunting or sporting weapons. ""The other purpose of the list was to have a high profile way of assuring certain folks — including legislators — that we would not be going after their weapons that they use for those legitimate purposes,"" Lenett said.

""It was a win-win situation,"" Lenett recalled, because, he said, if the list could help pick up votes needed to pass the bill and temper some of the opposition, it could assuage some opponents of the ban without making the law less effective.

But gun experts say the lists in 1994 and the expanded lists of today don't make much sense.

""The bill demonstrates a shocking ignorance of the product they are purporting to regulate,"" said Lawrence Keane, senior vice president of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a trade association based in Newtown, Conn., that represents gun manufacturers. ""I have no idea how they arrived at this list. It would seem to be random, bordering on throwing darts at a dart board.""

For instance, Feinstein's current proposal includes exemptions for three specific types of the M-1 Carbine, an assault rifle designed for the military that the U.S. currently bans from being imported. A draft of the legislation, created and modified in November and early December last year, banned the M-1 Carbine and didn't exempt any models, according to a copy obtained by the AP.

Feinstein said there was disagreement among firearms experts, law enforcement and gun safety organizations about whether to include the M-1 Carbine on the list of banned weapons.

""It has been used in multiple police shootings, and was originally used by U.S. soldiers on the battlefield,"" Feinstein said. ""On the other hand, it comes in models that would not meet the military characteristics test."" She said she decided to limit banned weapons to those that met the definition outlined in the bill.

At a Jan. 30 hearing by the Senate Judiciary Committee on gun violence, National Rifle Association President Wayne LaPierre said Feinstein's bill is ""based on falsehoods to people that do not understand firearms, to convince them that the performance characteristics of guns that they are trying to ban through that bill are different than the performance characteristics that they're not trying to ban.""

The Ruger Mini-14 is a perfect example.

The model that has a fixed stock would be exempted by Feinstein's ban; the gun was protected in the 1994 law as well. A Ruger Mini-14 with a collapsible and folding stock would be illegal.

The guns fire the same caliber bullet and can take detachable magazines that could hold dozens of rounds of ammunition. The folding stock only reduces the gun's length by 2.75 inches, according to the manufacturer's website.

""It's irrelevant,"" Edmund Mireles, an FBI agent who survived the Miami shootout, said of the differences in features. ""They're equally dangerous.""

Mark D. Jones, a senior law enforcement adviser for the University of Chicago Crime Lab, said the folding stock does not affect the firearm's lethal potential.

""Given that both firearms will accept a 30 round or larger magazine, it renders the differences between them entirely cosmetic,"" Jones said.

Kristen Rand, the legislative director at the Washington-based Violence Policy Center, said the Ruger Mini-14 model that would be banned under Feinstein's legislation is easier to hold while firing because it has a pistol grip, and it's easier to hide because it has a collapsible stock. That's what makes it more dangerous that the Ruger Mini-14 with the fixed stock which would be exempted under the Feinstein bill, she said.

""And that's supposed to save somebody's life?"" asked Hanlon, the FBI agent shot alongside Mireles.

Hanlon considered the differences between the two models and whether the events of April 11, 1986, would have been different if the shooter used a Ruger Mini-14 with a fixed stock. ""I don't think it would have changed a damn thing,"" he said. ""I don't see what makes that gun less dangerous."""

New Republic: Have you ever fired a gun? President Obama: Yes, in fact, up at Camp David, we do skeet shooting all the time. New Republic: The whole family? President Obama: Not the girls, but oftentimes guests of mine go up there.

Journalists, politicians, and the general public alike reacted with understandable skepticism to this politically expedient claim by the President. No one could recall ever seeing a photograph of President Obama shooting skeet, nor had he ever claimed before that he had ever participated in the sport.

At the regular White House press briefing on Monday morning, a skeptical Jessica Yellin, CNN’s White House correspondent, pressed White House secretary Jay Carney on the issue. His response was less than convincing:

Yellin: On a different topic, how often does the President go skeet shooting? (Laughter.) And are there photographs of him doing so? Carney: I would refer you simply to his comments. I don’t know how often. He does go to Camp David with some regularity, but I’m not sure how often he’s done that. Yellin: Is there a photograph of him doing it? Carney: There may be, but I haven’t seen it. Yellin: Why haven’t we heard about it before? Carney: Because when he goes to Camp David, he goes to spend time with his family and friends and relax, not to produce photographs.

Congressman Blackburn was among those skeptical of the President’s claim who remained unconvinced by Carney’s explanation. Monday night on CNN she issued her skeet shooting challenge to the President:

My money is on Congressman Blackburn."

Madigan made the request following the U.S. Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals decision in December that gave Illinois 180 days to put together a law that would allow concealed weapons in Illinois.

Madigan has not made a decision on whether to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, said Maura Possley, Madigan spokeswoman.

In a statement, the attorney general encouraged state lawmakers to write a new law that fits within the parameters of the initial decision calling for concealed carry in Illinois. And she sought to explain why she went forward with the request to have a hearing by all judges in the 7th Circuit, a move known as “en banc.”

“Although the 7th Circuit rarely grants rehearing en banc, it was important to ask the full court to reconsider its opinion,” the Madigan statement said. “Significantly, in today’s decision, four of the 7th Circuit judges have provided a clear framework to guide the legislature in drafting a new law. With the 180-day deadline still in place, it is critical that the legislature continue to work to enact a law that will protect public safety.”

She has 90 days to appeal the original decision.

The appeals court action officially rejected Madigan’s request for a rehearing by the full court, but the denial came with a stinging dissent from four of the nine members of the appeals court who reviewed the matter. The original order came down from a three-member panel that also had a split vote.

The arguments made in the dissent, written by Judge David Hamilton, could bolster Madigan’s cause if she appeals to the nation’s high court.

“The Supreme Court has not yet decided whether .. the individual right to keep and bear arms at home under the Second Amendment extends beyond the home,” Hamilton wrote.

Illinois is the only state in the nation that does not allow citizens to carry weapons in public in some form.

Hamilton’s dissent also noted the ruling that called for Illinois to allow concealed carry is the “first decision by a federal court of appeals striking down legislation restricting the carrying of arms in public.”

He wrote that three major points are worthy of consideration by the full appellate court rather than simply the three-member panel:

*Whether to extend the right to bear arms outside the home and into the public sphere, a matter that “presents issues very different from those involved in the home itself, which is all the Supreme Court decided” in a case currently viewed as the law of the land.

*How to handle what the panel did not decide. The three-member panel left Illinois a “good deal of constitutional room for reasonable public safety measures concerning public carrying of firearms.”

*How to proceed in future decisions about laws that are more narrowly tailored and any state interests that justify some restrictions on rights.

“Where the law is genuinely in doubt, as it is likely to remain for some time under the Second Amendment, a trial court can do a great service by ensuring the development of a thorough and complete record that provides a reliable, accurate factual foundation for constitutional adjudication,” Hamilton wrote. “The federal courts are likely to do a better job of constitutional adjudication if our considerations are based on reliable facts rather than hypothesized and assumed facts.”

The U.S. debate over gun control flared in mid-December when a man armed with an assault rifle killed 20 first-graders and six adults at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut - the deadliest of a string of U.S. shooting sprees last year.

“We are law-abiding citizens, business owners, military, and we are not going to be responsible for other people’s criminal actions,” former Marine Damon Locke said to applause at a Florida rally he had helped organize.

Some in the crowd of about 1,000 in Brooksville, about an hour north of Tampa, hoisted signs that said “Stop the Gun Grabbers” and “Gun control isn’t about guns, it’s about control.”

Obama and gun control advocates have begun a push to reinstitute a ban on assault weapons in the wake of the Connecticut school massacre. A number of other states have taken up gun legislation, and New York, which has among the strictest gun control laws in the country, broadened its assault weapons ban on Tuesday.

Obama also called for a ban on high-capacity magazines and more stringent background checks for gun purchasers.

“Until we enforce gun laws on the books against the bad guys, I think it’s hypocritical to discuss more laws against law-abiding citizens,” Gary Schraut, a Brooksville real estate agent, told Reuters.

Across the country at a rally in Denver, the mood was defiant as about 500 people, including families with children, gathered in unseasonably warm weather outside the state capitol.

“I have earned the right to have my guns,” said Don Dobyns, an Air Force veteran and former police officer from Colorado Springs, who was among the rally organizers.

Sporting a shirt that read, “Girls with guns,” 31-year-old Jennifer Burk said: “My parents didn’t raise a victim and the government shouldn’t try and make me one.”

Gun control advocates say U.S. civilians have no justifiable need for assault weapons or high-capacity magazines, and they say more background checks will help keep guns out of the hands of criminals.

The reaction has been fierce from gun supporters such as the National Rifle Association, who point to a right to bear arms that is enshrined in the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and which they do not want to see watered down.

Saturday’s rallies were organized by Guns Across America, a group launched by Texas airline pilot Eric Reed, who has said that after he heard Obama talk about gun control on the day of the Connecticut massacre he thought gun owners should send a strong message to lawmakers in Washington.

As of Saturday afternoon, the Facebook page for Guns Across America listed more than 20,000 people saying they intended to attend events planned mostly in state capitals. Local media reported hundreds of people gathered at rallies nationwide, from Kentucky to Oregon to Michigan and Pennsylvania.

Gun-control advocates on Sunday plan to hold a National Gun Prevention Sabbath, where they say 150 houses of worship will call on the faithful to advocate for an “actionable plan to prevent gun violence.”

People who have lost loved ones to gun violence will display their photographs, organizers said."

Editor’s Note: Doug Kendall is president and founder of Constitutional Accountability Center, a progressive public interest law firm and think tank. Tom Donnelly is counsel and message director at the center.

(CNN) —

With two important cases on gay rights and marriage equality slated for oral arguments in the Supreme Court next week, Americans of all stripes are participating in a national debate over this emotionally charged issue – on the Internet, on television, in our leading newspapers and around countless dinner tables.

Despite this interest, only a handful of people will get to see these historic arguments – those who show up to the courtroom next Tuesday and Wednesday. This is the result of the Supreme Court’s longstanding policy prohibiting cameras inside the courtroom.

The court’s main reason for banning cameras – as Justices Stephen Breyer and Anthony Kennedy reminded us recently at a congressional hearing – is there would be an increased risk the justices’ questions and comments would be taken out of context and then played (and replayed) on the news or, worse yet, lampooned on “The Colbert Report.”

Doug Kendall

Tom Donnelly

This would be a completely valid concern if it weren’t for the fact that it’s happening already. As the justices well know, reporters, columnists, cartoonists and late-night comedians already extract the juiciest sound bites from oral arguments, sometimes taking them out of context and blowing them up into big stories. Indeed, such sound bites often dominate the media’s coverage of the Supreme Court.

For evidence of this, look no further than Justice Antonin Scalia’s remark from the court’s oral argument in the case of Shelby County v. Holder. Scalia suggested the Voting Rights Act of 1965 had survived only because of the self-perpetuating power of “racial entitlements” – a comment that generated countless news stories, editorials, op-eds and political cartoons, to say nothing of parodies on satirical shows such as “Saturday Night Live” and “The Daily Show.”

Or, better yet, consider Justice Clarence Thomas’ decision in January to tell a joke during oral argument – breaking his seven-year streak of silence and, in the process, becoming front-page news. Does anyone, other than the closest court-watcher, even remember the name of that case or the issues it presented?

Or, take the constant plight of Kennedy, who commentators tend to assume is the decisive vote in each of the court’s most important cases. His every question, word, sigh and hiccup becomes a key part of how cases are covered in the media, as everyone scrambles for possible clues for how Kennedy might vote. Needless to say – and as Kennedy well knows – such predictions are often inaccurate.

Sometimes, the focus on sound bites is entirely appropriate.

Scalia’s characterization of the Voting Rights Act was offensive, and it deserved to be national news. Furthermore, it’s important to report potentially revealing comments from the court’s swing justice.

But more often than not, the media coverage of the court is already focused on sound bites, which sometimes get taken out of context. Therefore, the Supreme Court might as well open up and let all Americans experience the majesty of its hearings – an experience that can be captured only by attending an argument in person or by watching an argument unfold live in one’s living room or on one’s laptop.

As lawyers who have been to dozens of Supreme Court hearings, we can confidently say that there’s nothing that the federal government does that’s more impressive than the high-quality debates that occur on a daily basis before the Supreme Court.

The American public would be astonished at the skill of the advocates, the force of the questions and the overall level at which legal issues are debated before our high court. If only they could see these arguments in real time, in their entirety.

Since media coverage of the high court already focuses on the trite at the expense of the court’s majesty, it makes sense to remove the media filter. Exposing the American public to the fullness of Supreme Court arguments by permitting cameras in the courtroom would be a service rather than hindrance to the judiciary.

The legislation will need 60 votes to pass in the chamber, which means it will need Republican support as well as support from Senate Democrats facing re-election in districts with a strong tradition of gun rights.

""It's an open question as to whether or not we have the votes,” Pennsylvania Republican Sen. Pat Toomey told CNN’s “State of the Union.” “I think it's going to be close.""

Toomey joined West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin in crafting the background proposal, which would cover Internet and gun show purchases but would still exempt sales between family members.

Background checks currently apply only to transactions handled by the country's 55,000 licensed gun dealers.

New York Sen. Chuck Schumer -- who has worked since January on a larger plan to curb gun violence that could win bipartisan support -- told ABC’s “This Week” he has strong support from fellow Democrats.

“But … we're working really hard to maximize both the number of Democrats who will be the overwhelming majority of those who vote for it and a number of Republicans,” he said.

Senate Democrats and others have been trying to fulfill President Obama’s second-term priority of curbing gun violence since the December 2012 shootings at a Connecticut elementary school in which 20 first-graders and six adults were killed.

However, the effort has faced strong opposition on Capitol Hill and from such major gun lobby groups as the National Rifle Association.

Plan to ban high-capacity gun magazine clips and re-institute a ban on semi-automatic weapons have already been removed from the legislation, for lack of support. However, they could re-emerge as Senate amendments.

The full Senate debate is expected to begin Monday, after enough senators voted last week to stop a Republican-led effort to block the legislation from going forward.

Among the Republicans to express support Sunday was Sen. Susan Collins, a moderate Republican from Maine.

The plan would ""strengthen the background check system without in any way infringing on Second Amendment rights,"" she said in a statement.

However, ""it is impossible to predict at this point"" what will be in a final bill, she added.

Arizona Sen. John McCain, who has a B+ rating from the NRA, told CNN that he was ""very favorably disposed"" to the Manchin-Toomey proposal.

""I appreciate their work,"" he said. ""And the American people want to do what we can to prevent these tragedies. And there's a lot more that needs to be done, particularly in the area of mental health.""

It was in McCain's home state that a gunman with schizophrenia shot then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords in the head during a 2011 rampage in Tucson that left six people dead.

Collins and Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois are the only two Republicans who are expected to vote for the compromise as of now.

On Sunday, Manchin urged lawmakers to read the 49-page proposal. He said it should dispel any misconceptions about infringing on the constitutional right to bear arms.

The proposal, in fact, expands firearms rights by easing some restrictions on transporting guns across state lines, protects sellers from lawsuits if buyers passed a check but later used a gun in a crime and lets gun dealers conduct business in states where they don't live.

However, Manchin also acknowledged the vote would be tight.

“We're close,” he told CBS’ “Face the Nation.” “We need more.""

The compromise, if successful, would be added to overall legislation to strengthen laws against illegal gun trafficking and to increase slightly school-security aid.

Other additions to the legislation also are expected to be debated this week, including a measure that would allow concealed hand gun permits issued by one state to be accepted nationwide as a de facto background check.

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/12/03/house-to-vote-on-banning-plastic-firearms/,2013-12-03 00:00:00,[],House votes to renew ban on plastic firearms,"Amid fears that 3-D printers could produce plastic weapons that easily evade metal detectors, the House voted Tuesday to renew a ban on plastic and other non-metal guns.

The bill, which was approved by voice vote, is the rare piece of gun legislation that both parties seem capable of agreeing on. It was sponsored by Republican Rep. Howard Coble, of North Carolina, and Democratic Rep. Steve Israel, of New York.

The bill, which provides a 10-year extension of a ban that has been in place for 25 years, heads next to the Senate.

There is some partisan division, though, over how far Congress should go in regulating plastic guns.

The bill approved Tuesday would renew a 1988 measure that bans the manufacture, import or sale of any firearm that can't be picked up by a metal detector. The measure has taken on new urgency as some have figured out how to produce plastic weapons on emerging 3-D printer technology.

The bill would not necessarily ban someone from producing such a weapon -- but it would have to include a metal component.

Some Democrats, though, want to go further and require the metal components to be a permanent part of the gun. Right now, the metal parts on such weapons can snap on and snap off.

While the House approved the basic renewal Tuesday afternoon, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said he will seek fast approval of a measure renewing the ban and tightening the restrictions when the Democratic-run Senate returns from a two-week Thanksgiving break next Monday, the day before the ban expires. His office says the current bill leaves in place a ""dangerous loophole.""

The National Rifle Association, which helped defeat last spring's background check measure, has said nothing publicly about whether it supports extending the ban on undetectable firearms.

But congressional aides and lobbyists say the group supports the renewal but opposes efforts to tighten the curbs. A longer renewal would limit Democrats' opportunities to use bills extending the ban to include other gun restrictions.

In a letter to lawmakers last month, the smaller National Shooting Sports Foundation -- representing the nation's gun-makers and retailers -- said it backs the extension but opposes added restrictions on undetectable guns.

""We are always concerned that laws and regulations do not hamper the ability of our members to take advantage of technological advancements,"" the group wrote.

The conservative Gun Owners of America opposes the extension, saying such laws wouldn't stop criminals intent on printing weapons.

""They've just spent all year trying to effectively destroy the gun lobby,"" Mike Hammond, legislative counsel of the small group, said of Democrats. ""So why in heaven's name, given this intransigence, should we give them this Christmas present?""

The ban was first enacted in 1988 under President Ronald Reagan, when today's computer and weapons technologies were in their early stages. It was renewed in 1998 and 2003.

Fast forward to 2013, a world where 3-D printers can spray repeated, thin layers of plastic or other materials to create objects from toys to automobile parts to medical devices. They are being used increasingly by companies, researchers and hobbyists, and the technology is constantly improving.

The use of 3-D printers to make guns received heightened attention in May when Cody Wilson, then a University of Texas law student, posted blueprints online for using the printers to make the Liberator pistol, which he says he designed.

Wilson, founder of Defense Distributed, a nonprofit that advocates the free distribution of information on 3-D printed weapons, was ordered by the State Department to take down the instructions after two days because of allegedly violating arms export controls, he said.

At that point, the plans had already been downloaded more than 100,000 times and they remain available on file-sharing websites, he said.

""If you want to do this, it's plainly obvious there's no one standing between you, your computer and your 3-D printer. Anyone can make this gun,"" Wilson said Monday.

Earlier this year, ATF tested two guns made from different plastics using Wilson's Liberator design. While one exploded when fired, the other shot eight rounds before ATF halted the test.

""The undetectable firearm threat has become real,"" agency spokesman Timothy Graden said in an emailed statement.

http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2013/05/31/gun-control-just-got-even-more-difficult/,2013-05-31 00:00:00,['John Lott'],Why gun control just got even more difficult,"Gun control, an already difficult task, just got even more difficult.

The 3D printing revolution is well under way. This wonderful new technology will allow small companies and even individuals to manufacture a wide range of items, such as medical devices that fit each individual’s unique size and shape.

However, it is increasingly obvious that guns and gun parts can be made, even including entire assault weapons.

Unfortunately, the initial regulatory proposals will likely increase crime. As usual, new technology is hard to stop, and the Department of Homeland Security last week declared: ""Limiting access [to 3D-printing to make guns] may be impossible.""

Until now the stumbling block has been to design a gun that would be sturdy enough, something that can withstand the explosion when a bullet is shot down the barrel. In other words, you don’t want the gun to go off like a grenade in your hands instead of hitting the target.

Cody Wilson, the 25-year old founder of Defense Distributed, created a ruckus when he announced his successful design of a plastic gun that would operate like a normal one.

Plastic guns can’t be detected by metal detectors and would pose an obvious danger. But the hype so far exceeds what is practical.

When police in Australia downloaded the blueprint and easily made two plastic guns with a 3D printer, one of the two guns suffered “catastrophic failure” on its first shot. The other fired one successful shot before failing. The conclusion of the report the police released on last Friday was obvious: you are taking your life into your own hands if you use the plastic version of these guns.

That said, plastic guns are really a side issue, for 3D printers are increasingly allowing for other materials, including metal. Really all that needs to be metal are the gun’s steel barrel and firing pin.

Wilson used a metal nail for the firing pin. 100,000 copies of the handgun blueprint from Wilson’s website were downloaded around the world in just 2 days, with most of downloads coming from Spain, followed by the US, Brazil, and Germany.

The heavy downloads in Spain, Brazil, and Germany likely reflects attempts to evade their extremely restrictive licensing on semi-automatic handguns.

The Obama administration quickly stopped Wilson from distributing the file by threatening legal action, but it was already too late.

Legal or not, it doesn’t really matter: just as we've seen with movies, file sharing is unstoppable.

According to Torrent Freak, just a single episode of HBO’s Game of Thrones in 2012 was illegally downloaded an estimated 4.3 million times.

As of last Friday, after Wilson had stopped distributing the file, his blueprint could be downloaded from over 4,000 computers all around the world.

This blueprint is now among the top 10% most downloaded bit torrent files. Politicians just don’t seem to understand the new technology.

Senator Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Rep. Steve Israel (D-N.Y.) and even the California state legislature are proposing to regulate 3D printing.

The proposal in California goes farthest and would treat 3D printers like guns, considering background checks, mandatory serial numbers, and even a registration process. But even if the government registered every printer, what is going to stop gangs from stealing these printers?

Would the government try to monitor what people do with legally owned printers?

Perhaps, in the end, people will need prior government permission for every item printed.

In any event, printers could soon be found everywhere.

Gartner, a company that specializes in evaluating technology research, predicts ""by 2016, enterprise-class 3D printers will be available for under $2,000.""

The cheapest 3D printers are already available for as little as $10,000. And what happens if we so thoroughly restrict access to printers?

Besides stifling technology generally, the issue has the same problem that's plaguing gun control: the most law-abiding citizens will be the ones obeying the law. Only criminals will get access to these inexpensively made guns, the Australian police made their guns for only $35 each.

This is a lesson Americans learned the hard way, for instance in Washington, D.C. and Chicago, where bans primarily disarmed law-abiding citizens and only increased violent crime.

Indeed, around the world, every time guns are banned, murder go up. Politicians must stop their wishful thinking. It is already exceedingly difficult to prevent criminals from getting their hands on guns. And technology is rapidly making gun control even more counterproductive."

http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2013/03/14/feinstein-describes-feelings-during-exchange-with-arrogant-colleague/,2013-03-14 00:00:00,"['Tampa Tim', 'Rudy Nyc', 'The', 'Compassionate', 'Gop Solution', 'Posted By']",Feinstein describes feelings during exchange with ‘arrogant’ colleague,"8 years ago

Washington (CNN) – Saying she felt ""patronized"" by Senate colleague Ted Cruz, Sen. Dianne Feinstein explained Thursday why she felt the need to raise her voice in anger at the Texas Republican during a debate over gun control.

""I felt he was somewhat arrogant about it,"" Feinstein said of Cruz's suggestion the Senate Judiciary Committee was ignoring the Constitution during its debate over banning semiautomatic firearms.



She spoke on CNN's ""The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer.""

""When you come from where I've come from ... when you found a dead body and put your finger in bullet holes, you really realize the impact of weapons,"" she continued, referring to the 1978 assassination of San Francisco Mayor George Moscone and City Supervisor Harvey Milk, whose bodies she discovered at City Hall.

""When you see these weapons becoming attractive to grievance killers, people who take them into schools, into theaters, into malls - you wonder, does America really need these weapons? My answer to that is no. And so it's based on my experience,"" she continued.

The furious exchange with Cruz came before the judiciary panel passed the assault weapons ban Feinstein introduced on a party line vote. After Cruz implored the committee not to forget the Constitution in its debate, Feinstein angrily replied, ""I'm not a sixth grader.""

""I've studied the Constitution myself. I am reasonably well-educated and I thank you for the lecture,"" she continued, noting that the assault weapons ban backed by President Barack Obama but opposed by the powerful gun lobby exempted certain weapons.

""Isn't that enough for the people in the United States? Do they need a bazooka? Do they need other high-powered weapons that military people use to kill in close combat? I don't think so,"" she said.

She concluded by telling Cruz that ""I come from a different place than you do. I respect your views. I ask you to respect my views.""

Afterward, Feinstein said she needed time to ""cool down"" before speaking to her Republican colleague.

""I did say, 'Look, I'm sorry. But, you know, this is one thing that I feel very passionately about,'"" Feinstein recalled saying.

Now that her assault weapons ban is heading to the full Senate, Feinstein said she expects Obama to begin working with lawmakers to build support.

Despite polls showing that such a prohibition resonates with Americans, most observers don't give the bill much of a chance in the full Senate.

The California Democrat isn't one of them.

""The people do want it,"" Feinstein said. ""So I hope the people make the connection now with their representatives. In the West, in the Midwest, in the South and in the East. And say, 'yes, we agree with the polls. We want this bill.'""

The legislation was prompted by December's school shooting in Connecticut."

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/04/18/dems-vow-to-ramp-up-gun-control-campaign-in-wake-defeat-take-on-gun-lobby-in/,2013-04-18 00:00:00,[],"Reid pulls gun bill, lawmakers gear up for protracted battle on background checks","Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid effectively pulled his party's gun control bill Thursday after a critical background check amendment failed to garner enough support, as he and other Democrats vowed to resume their push for new gun laws in the months ahead.

""Make no mistake, this debate is not over,"" Reid said. He acknowledged that he and President Obama had agreed to hit ""pause"" on the current package, but said the Senate would ""come back to this bill"" and take up expanded background checks.

At the same time, critics of the legislation vowed to ensure any future proposals protect both ""the lives and liberty"" of Americans.

Both sides of the debate, it seemed, were gearing up for a protracted legislative battle that could last through the next congressional election. Democrats appeared to acknowledge that the amendment's failure Wednesday meant they would not be able to pass any gun bill in the short-term, despite initial claims that the mass shooting in Newtown, Conn., might spur a hasty legislative response in Congress.

The amendment that was defeated Wednesday would have expanded background checks to gun shows and Internet sales, while exempting personal transactions. It failed on a 54-46 vote; it needed 60 to pass.

Opponents, which included Republicans and rural-state Democrats, said the measure would infringe on Second Amendment rights by imposing a burden on law-abiding gun owners while doing little to stop criminals. They also repeated the concern that the system could lead to a gun registry, though the amendment language prohibited this.

Both sides of the debate indicated a willingness to keep working toward new legislation to address gun violence. But the debate became far more combative in the wake of Wednesday's vote. While Republicans want more of a focus on the mental health system, school security and the entertainment industry, Democrats are focusing even harder on background checks.

Obama, speaking in the Rose Garden late Wednesday, sought to shame those who voted against the background check plan and accused the gun lobby of lying about the bill to scare lawmakers.

""All in all, this was a pretty shameful day for Washington,"" Obama said. He called the vote ""just round one.""

Obama's campaign arm, Organizing for Action, swiftly began planning the next round. The group's director, Jon Carson, announced events this Saturday ""in states where senators hold the key to expanding background checks.""

Republicans bristled at Obama's comments. ""When good and honest people have honest differences of opinion about what policies our country should pursue when it comes to the Second Amendment and gun rights and mass gun violence, the President of the United States should not accuse them of having no coherent arguments or caving to the pressure,"" Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said.

It's unclear exactly how Democrats will proceed. Reid, in freezing the bill, preserves the option of returning to it at a later date.

Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., who helped craft the bipartisan plan widening background checks, said he would continue talking to other senators to see whether there were changes he could make that would attract their votes.

Senate Democrats could call a do-over vote with a revised piece of legislation.

But they also appeared to acknowledge the deep resistance to any legislation seen to curb gun rights, and threatened to take the campaign into the 2014 congressional elections.

""If this Congress refuses to listen to the American people and pass common-sense gun legislation, then the real impact is going to have to come from the voters,"" Obama said.

Obama blamed lawmakers' fear that ""the gun lobby would spend a lot of money"" and accuse them of opposing the Second Amendment's right to bear arms.

But opponents of the restrictions -- which would have been the most meaningful gun curbs approved by Congress in two decades -- said the curbs were defeated because they wouldn't have worked.

Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., said most proposals were ""predicated on one assumption that somehow we think that the criminal element will single out this one law to comply with.""

Added Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., of the expanded background check plan, ""This is the first step in the erosion of my rights under the Second Amendment.""

The day was not a complete victory for the NRA. Senators defeated one GOP amendment requiring states that let people carry concealed weapons to honor other states' concealed carry permits. Also rejected was a Republican proposal letting some veterans with mental problems have firearms unless a court blocks them from getting the weapons.

No. 2 Senate leader Richard Durbin, D-Ill., was among several Democrats who joined Obama in saying Wednesday's roll calls left them with an issue to take to voters.

""We're now in the world of Gabby Giffords and Mayor Bloomberg and organizations that are organized to come out and support those who vote for gun safety and oppose those who don't,"" he said, referring to wealthy New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who has been financing gun control efforts.

But Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., expressed doubts.

""If it were a real effective political strategy, you wouldn't have seen a lot of Democrats from Southern states voting with Republicans today,"" he said.

Some Western Democrats voted against restrictions as well.

NRA lobbyist Chris W. Cox thanked lawmakers for defeating the ""misguided"" background check expansion, saying it would have criminalized gun transactions between friends -- a charge Obama and others called untrue.

Mayors Against Illegal Guns, financed by Michael Bloomberg, called the vote ""a damning indictment"" of the gun lobby's power.

""Gun control laws didn't stop a possible massacre at Arapahoe High School,"" the NRA's Institute for Legislative Action wrote in a letter to its members on Friday. ""A good guy with a gun stopped the rampage and in doing so almost certainly prevented much greater harm. For that, we can all be thankful.""

Claire Davis, a 17-year-old student, was shot at point-blank range as she sat in a hallway at the school on Dec. 13. ""As bad as that was,"" the NRA wrote, ""things could have been much worse.""

Davis died Saturday. The 18-year-old gunman — a senior who was reportedly armed with a shotgun, about 125 rounds of ammunition, three Molotov cocktails and a machete — killed himself before carrying out what authorities believe was a planned killing spree.

""The attacker's mission was stopped short by the quick response of an armed deputy sheriff who was working as a resource officer at the school,"" the letter continued. ""Upon learning of the threat, the deputy ran from the cafeteria to the library, yelling for people to get down and identifying himself as a deputy sheriff. The horrific incident lasted only a total of 80 seconds and ended with the shooter turning his gun on himself in the library as the deputy was closing in on him.""

""What does make a difference is an armed response,"" the NRA letter said. ""But it only works in a situation where properly secured firearms are available onsite to be used by responsible, proficient, courageous people — in other words, the good guys.""

A week after the Dec. 14, 2012, massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., the NRA argued that gun control legislation would not prevent similar shootings, calling for a nationwide program that would place armed security in every school desiring protection.

""I call on Congress today to appropriate whatever is necessary to put armed police officers in every single school in this nation,"" NRA executive vice president Wayne LaPierre said at a press conference in Washington. ""The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun."""

This is not a movie. There’s no dramatic music in the background. A happy ending, far from a guarantee.

The concern in Donnie Herman’s voice was clear as day. So was his stress. With two telephones to his ear, he listened to his wife, Melinda, as she fled into an attic of their Loganville home. With her: Her two 9-year-old children and a loaded .38 revolver.

In the house: An intruder with a crowbar.

On another line was the 911 operator Donnie Herman had called for help. Herman’s words to his wife, as he sat helplessly, an hour away from the home, were recorded.

“Stay in the attic,” he instructed her, calmly.

“He’s in the bedroom,” she told him. He repeated the words to the 911 operator.

“Shh. Relax,” Herman said, trying to calm his wife.

Then he instructed her to do what was fast becoming a realistic possibility.

Rich Phillips/CNN Melinda Herman fled to the attic with her two children when an intruder entered her Georgia home.

Rich Phillips/CNN Walton County Sheriff Joe Chapman, whose office responded to the shooting, praised Melinda Herman's actions.

“Melinda – if he opens up the door, you shoot him! You understand?”

What happened next has made the Hermans the new faces of the right to bear arms.

Melinda Herman fired a six-shot revolver at the intruder, hitting him five times, in his torso and in his face. Surprisingly, he managed to flee.

Opinion: The case for gun rights is stronger than you think

Gun rights groups say this shows that law-abiding citizens should be allowed to buy their weapon of choice and as big a magazine or ammunition clip as they like.

They remind people that Melinda Herman had only a six-shot revolver.

“It’s a good thing she wasn’t facing more attackers. Otherwise she would have been in trouble and she would have run out of ammunition,” said Erich Pratt, director of communications for the Gun Owners of America.

“She shot him five times and he still didn’t drop. This is going to endanger people’s safety.”

The right of self-protection has been thrust into the forefront in a national debate after last month’s Newtown, Connecticut, tragedy.

This week, a federal task force led by Vice President Joe Biden is holding talks with private industry groups, the NRA, and legislators – all to determine the correct balance between the right to self-protection and preventing further mass shootings.

Meanwhile, Americans are flocking to gun shops to buy guns and ammunition in record numbers – partly due to Newtown and partly due to their fears that the rules are about to change on what they can legally own.

The FBI said it conducted almost 2.8 million checks for gun purchases in December, a record high for a month.

Donnie and Melinda Herman own two guns for protection at home, but until two weeks ago, she had never fired a gun. Her husband told sheriff’s department investigator’s that he took her shooting so that she’d be familiar with the family’s guns if she ever had to use one.

Now, clutching the .38 revolver, Melinda Herman was in the middle of a heart-pounding crisis inside her own home.

She had already locked multiple doors before she and her children took refuge in an adjacent-room attic – the kind with a small door that you have to bend down to go through.

The intruder had used the crowbar to break through the front door and then two other doors upstairs, and she could hear him coming closer and closer.

On the phone, Donnie Herman calmly instructed his wife about the use of the weapon she had practiced on.

“Remember everything I showed you. Everything I taught you,” he told her, and he reassured her that help was on the way.

Then it happened.

“She shot him. She’s shooting him. She’s shooting him. She’s shooting him. She’s shooting him. … Shoot him again! Shoot him!” Donnie Herman said as the 911 dispatcher listened.

He then lost phone contact with his wife and children. His anguish and the pain of not knowing what had happened may be etched in his mind for eternity. But they were safe.

He learned later that his wife fired all six shots, and hit the intruder with all but one bullet.

Parents defend right to keep guns in the home

Not realizing she was out of ammunition, she ordered the man to stay on the floor as he bled. She then fled the house with her children.

Walton County Sheriff Joe Chapman – whose office responded to the shooting at the Hermans’ home – said he believes the mother and her two children were in a life-and-death situation and she had no choice but to exercise her constitutional right to self-defense.

“Had it not turned out the way that it did, I would possibly be working a triple homicide, not having a clue as to who it is we’re looking for,” he told CNN.

Despite being shot five times, the suspect, identified as Paul Ali Slater, still managed to get back into his SUV, but he drove off the road and crashed a short distance away.

He remains hospitalized. Due to privacy laws, the hospital cannot divulge any information on his condition.

But the controversy continues. Home gun ownership and self-defense will always be controversial.

The Hermans’ story of self-defense is being used by the National Rifle Association and the Gun Owners of America to make their point to the White House and Congress about gun ownership.

But Donnie Herman has told people he’s not interested in being a poster boy for anyone. He has not yet responded to CNN’s request for an interview with him and his wife.

“My wife is a hero. She protected her kids. She did what she was supposed to do as a responsible parent and gun owner,” Herman told CNN affiliate WSB.

Yet it’s unclear whether the benefits of having a loaded and readily available gun in one’s home outweigh the drawbacks.

“It’s more common for an armed homeowner in the United States to be a victim of suicide, homicide, assault or an accidental shooting than it is for that person to shoot an intruder,” according to Dr. Arthur Kellermann, a senior health policy analyst at Rand Corporation, a non-partisan think tank.

Kellermann led research for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the 1990s which found that people who have guns in their homes are nearly three times more likely to be a victim of homicide and nearly five times more likely to commit suicide.

Experts also say that simply having a gun for self-protection does not guarantee safety. They say the fear is that many people will take part in what might be considered a feeding frenzy by purchasing a gun, but not learn how to properly use it.

Sheriff Chapman holds courses for homeowners who want to learn how to safely and properly use a weapon.

“Be proficient with it. Be taught how to use it. Train with it,” he said.

“I often tell people, ‘If you don’t think that you have what it takes to take a human life then don’t bother buying one. Don’t waste your money. Don’t waste your time,” he told CNN.

“Don’t put it in a drawer and think that’s the answer to everything, because it isn’t.”

The photograph depicted a familiar scene of a dusty street and squared wooden facades. But there was also the unexpected: A sign warning that carrying a firearm in town was “strictly prohibited.”

“The Wild West towns like Tombstone (and Dodge City) had the most restrictive gun laws in the nation,” Winkler said. “That is an example of how our understanding and our mythologizing about guns really has created a lot of misconceptions and misunderstandings both of the nature of the right to bear arms and the history of gun control, and about American’s relationship with guns.”

Context, as we know, is crucial for any sort of political discussion, and Winkler and two other authors of books about guns and gun control provided plenty of it to more than 300 people in the basement of the Ronald Tutor Campus Center at USC, the same room, coincidentally in which the late Rodney King spoke last year about his accidental role in the waves of violence that convulsed Los Angeles in 1992.

The consensus was that the fate of gun control is controlled by a small but dedicated minority of people, including the National Rifle Assn., which through its near single-minded focus on fighting gun restrictions has been able to produce far more influence on the political process than those who support gun control.

It could have been a depressingly timely subject, given the school shooting in Newtown, Conn., and the running gun battle last week between police and the presumed Boston Marathon bombers. But the panelists moved beyond the momentary arguments, with Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional scholar and founding dean of the UC Irvine law school, pointing out that of all the divisive political issues of the era, gun control is the only one rooted in the “enigmatic” phrasing of a constitutional right.

VIDEO: AUTHOR INTERVIEWS FROM FESTIVAL OF BOOKS

Despite polls that show wide support for many gun control measures, including the expansion of background checks that failed in the US. Senate last week, Chemerinsky said the NRA and its supporters have been able to exert their minority will.

“The question then to me becomes, how does the NRA come to have as much political power that it is in an absolute position to stop the Senate from adopting such an unobjectionable form of background checks,” said the author of “The Conservative Assault on the Constitution.”

Paul M. Barrett, assistant managing editor of Bloomberg Businessweek and author of “Glock: The Rise of America’s Gun,” argued that the current battles are rooted in political conservatism that began growing in the 1970s.

Winkler had earlier traced the rise of political conservatism and a near-libertarian view of gun laws within the NRA to a political coup that occurred during a 1977 national conference. As the leadership of the group was contemplating stepping back from politics and refocusing on the sporting nature of guns (from target shooting to hunting), he said, political conservatives descended on the meeting and wrested control of the group, redirecting it to the political theater.

To understand the NRA of today, Barrett argued, you have to understand the politics of the 1970s and 1980s, as urban violence exploded with the rise of crack cocaine and gangs, and the liberal response was to press for gun control. No matter how relatively modest proposals such as the expansion of background checks might seem, they are viewed by the gun-rights advocates “as the first step down the slippery slope” to seizing private guns, he said.

“That can be lampooned and ... has a paranoid overtone, but it’s not a lightly held view by millions of Americans,” Barrett said. “One of the reasons the gun debate seems to have tilted so far to the [right] ... is the inability of people on the other side of the argument to appreciate how deeply felt these fears are.”

As if to make the point, the last question from the audience was about whether the seizure of privately owned guns could make it easier to establish martial law, a question that was greeted with laugh in parts of the audience.

“While I don’t share those sentiments or anxieties, those sentiments and anxieties are held by a significant minority of the population,” Barrett said. “They are an element of the pro-gun movement that is very important to pay attention to.”

Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) attempted to attach to a water resources bill on Wednesday, which would have allowed gun owners to carry firearms into recreational areas currently off-limits. The amendment was one of two Coburn had planned to offer, although he withdrew his second earlier in the day.

Areas controlled by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers -- such as hundreds of the nation's lakes and thousands of campsites and miles of trails -- are gun-free zones, even if the state where the land is located allows concealed weapons. Coburn's amendment, however, would have granted precedence to state laws and permitted people to carry guns in some of these places.

The Senate voted 56-43 on Coburn's amendment, failing to garner the 60 votes needed to move forward.

Coburn's second amendment would have required federal agencies to account for all of their guns and ammunition, essentially creating a registry of government firearms. The push was part of a concern among some conservatives that the government may be stockpiling ammunition in order to restrict the supply available to the public.

Coburn spokesman John Hart confirmed to The Huffington Post that Coburn had withdrawn his amendment, which was also scheduled for a vote. He said it was ""a goodwill gesture"" to Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), one of the sponsors of the Water Resources Development Act. On Tuesday, Boxer criticized Republicans for putting forward gun amendments on her bill.

The NRA's federal affairs office sent out an alert on Wednesday afternoon, urging senators to support Coburn's Army Corps of Engineers amendment.

""The National Rifle Association strongly supports this amendment,"" the email reads, with the statement in bold, underlined type. The group argued that Coburn's amendment would ""not only allow law abiding citizens to protect themselves, but relieve them from the onerous responsibility of tracking where one federal agency’s land management jurisdiction ends and another begins.""

In 2010, President Barack Obama signed a bill into law that allows loaded firearms in national parks and wildlife refuges.

Parents at a high school near Dallas say the authors of a book on U.S. history misfired when they defined the Second Amendment -- and now one of the book's co-authors says the book is being revised.

The work book used at Guyer High School in the city of Denton, ""The United States History: Preparing for the Advanced Placement Examination,"" includes the ""summary"" definition of the Second Amendment to include the right to ""keep and bear arms in a state militia.""

The edited definition is seen by gun-rights advocates as an affront to the Second Amendment, which states in full: ""A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.""

Parents at the school criticized the book for distorting the definition of the Second Amendment in favor of those opposed to gun rights.

John J. Newman, the book's co-author, told FoxNews.com that the text of the book was written before the 2008 Supreme Court ruling, District of Columbia v. Heller, which protects individuals' rights to possess firearms. He said the book's only intent was to summarize the Second Amendment and admitted that the current definition is incorrect. But he said a revised and corrected edition is set to be sold in May 2014.

""There was no devious intention in the definition,"" Newman said.

The book is a supplement to the actual text book, ""American Pageant."" The school says the text book gives the exact Bill of Rights.

""The teachers and the staff are aware of this ""summary statement"" and are teaching the amendments from the classroom textbook,"" a statement from the Denton School District said. ""Please be assured that Denton ISD history teachers are disseminating the correct information on the Second Amendment.""

Sean Getts, who has a daughter who is a junior at Guyer High School, told FoxNews.com she noticed the wording of the amendment and alerted him.

""I don't know if it was intentional or not, but clearly these authors interpreted the amendment in favor of gun control,"" he said. ""I'm mainly concerned how this ends up in our school system.""

Getts had posted the book's definition on Facebook and it went viral.

""I don't think the definition was put in the book in good faith,"" said Stephen Halbrook, a Second Amendment expert and author of ""The Founders' Second Amendment.""

""It's actually a total perversion of what the Second Amendment stands for.""

He told FoxNews.com that the equivalent of this book's definition would be defining the First Amendment as: you have the right to free speech, as long as you speak in a state-sanctioned group.

Halbrook, who argued Second Amendment cases in front of the Supreme Court, said the book's authors could have edited the definition to: ""A militia is necessary for a free state, and people have right to keep and bear arms."""

Schumer Quietly Adds Extreme Measures to Gun Sellers Bill,"Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has quietly added a slew of new measures to his self-sponsored gun control bill currently making its way through the Senate.

Schumer has been fighting to get his Protecting Responsible Gun Sellers Act of 2013 (S 374)–now called the Fix Gun Checks Act of 2013–passed into law, but one of the early problems with the bill was that it was essentially a shell or placeholder bill, incomplete at the time of introduction.

Ostensibly, Schumer’s bill is meant to change current laws to require that all firearm sales initiate a background check on the buyer before the sale is finalized. Currently, private citizens are exempt from performing background checks when they sell guns to other private citizens.

Though the original bill introduced was a shortened version, the New York Senator has since added new amendments to his bill that raise concerns for gun rights advocates.

Schumer’s new Section 202 will make it illegal for an unlicensed person to transfer a gun to any other non-licensed person. The law would require that a licensed gun seller perform an NICS check and fill out a Form 4473 before a transfer would be legal.

Exceptions include transfers from husband to wife or immediate family, short-term transfers for hunting purposes (if the owner is present), or at a shooting range or for firearms instruction.

Section 202 also sets maximum fees for the paperwork and demands that the FFL keep the paperwork during the length of the transfer.

Section 203 is the more problematic section, as it requires that gun owners report the theft or loss of a firearm within 24 hours after discovering the loss. Unless a report is filed with the “Attorney General and to the appropriate authorities,” the gun owner faces five years of imprisonment.

Second Amendment supporters have been fighting to make sure these transfer records are not kept by the federal government in what would essentially become a national gun owner’s database."

“It’s a very significant decision,” he said, “and it involves the personal responsibility of the parent and personal responsibility of the child.”

Trying to Reverse a Trend

The shooting sports foundation, the tax-exempt trade association for the gun industry, is a driving force behind many of the newest youth initiatives. Its national headquarters is in Newtown, just a few miles from Sandy Hook Elementary School, where Adam Lanza, 20, used his mother’s Bushmaster AR-15 to kill 20 children and 6 adults last month.

The foundation’s $26 million budget is financed mostly by gun companies, associated businesses and the foundation’s SHOT Show, the industry’s annual trade show, according to its latest tax return.

Although shooting sports and gun sales have enjoyed a rebound recently, the long-term demographics are not favorable, as urbanization, the growth of indoor pursuits like video games and changing cultural mores erode consumer interest. Licensed hunters fell from 7 percent of the population in 1975 to fewer than 5 percent in 2005, according to federal data. Galvanized by the declining share, the industry redoubled its efforts to reverse the trend about five years ago.

The focus on young people has been accompanied by foundation-sponsored research examining popular attitudes toward hunting and shooting. Some of the studies used focus groups and telephone surveys of teenagers to explore their feelings about guns and people who use them, and offered strategies for generating a greater acceptance of firearms.

The Times reviewed more than a thousand pages of these studies, obtained from gun industry Web sites and online archives, some of them produced as recently as last year. Most were prepared by consultants retained by the foundation, and at least one was financed with a grant from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service."

As part of the program's ""Guns in America"" franchise, Piers Morgan welcomed Ben Shapiro, an individual who had been outwardly critical of the show's recent direction.

The Breitbart editor-at-large has described the host as having a ""full-scale gun control agenda,"" implied that Morgan is a Liberal, and began his visit by producing a copy of the U.S. Constitution from his jacket pocket.

""You have deliberately tried to frame this as a left-wing attack on the American Constitution and the Second Amendment,"" said Morgan, objecting to his guests perspective. ""You come in, you brandish your little book...""

""My little book? That's the Constitution of the United States, our founding document,"" Shapiro exclaimed.

""I know what's in your Constitution,"" insisted the host.

""Do you really?"" asked the conservative political commentator who turns 29 on Tuesday.

""I've been debating this for a very long time,"" Morgan stated.

Pushing forward on the issue he's most passionate about, the host asked Shapiro to explain why he feels a civilian would need an assault weapon:

""They need them for the prospective possibility of resistance to tyranny,"" he explained.

""Where do you expect the tyranny to come from?"" wondered Morgan.

""It could come from the United States,"" came Shapiro's answer.

""Do you understand how absurd you sound?"" asked the host.

""Here's where you go into the absurd and the bullying,"" claimed Shapiro, repeating an assertion he'd made recently in his on-line writings, all the while mocking Morgan's accent.

""I'm not the one that came in here and accused you of standing on the graves of dead children,"" reminded Morgan.

Watch the clip, and listen to the rest of the debate, as Shapiro further makes his point that of late Morgan has ""gone off the rails,"" and attempts to convince the host, and the viewers, that assault weapons have a place on the streets and in civilian hands.

Pat Quinn said today that cities and towns across Illinois should have the power to impose their own restrictions on any legislation lawmakers end up approving to allow citizens to carry guns in public.



Quinn's comments come as lawmakers face a June 9 deadline to craft a concealed carry bill after a federal appeals court ruled in December that Illinois' longtime ban was unconstitutional.



The Democratic governor has long been opposed to letting people carry handguns outside the home, but said the state must begrudgingly comply with the court's order. But Quinn argues there's room to put in place tough restrictions, including allowing cities such as Chicago to implement strict regulations that go beyond what lawmakers may put in place.



""I am not excited about this at all,"" Quinn said about implementing concealed carry. ""If this has to happen, it has to have the proper restrictions and limitations... I think we should make sure it's very tight and I think local communities, wherever they are, should have the option to make it as tight as possible in their community.""



The idea highlights the geographical divide that largely drives the gun control debate in Illinois. Chicago legislators point to the city's violence in calling for tight restrictions while lawmakers from downstate argue tough rules have done little to prevent crime.



Quinn also has called for banning guns in certain places such as sports stadiums, government buildings, shopping malls and churches. He also supports a ban on assault weapons and high capacity magazines.



Quinn's comments came during an appearance with a group of Chicago clergy members who echoed the governor's call for tough gun control measures"
http://news.yahoo.com/thousands-rally-against-stricter-gun-control-us-223627779.html,,[],Thousands rally against stricter gun control in US,"AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Gun advocates — some with rifles slung across shoulders or pistols holstered at the hip — have rallied peacefully in state capitals nationwide against President Barack Obama's sweeping federal gun-control proposals.

Summoned via social media for the ""Guns Across America"" event, participants gathered Saturday for protests large and small against stricter limits sought on firearms. Only a few dozen turned out in South Dakota and a few hundred in Boise, Idaho. Some 2,000 turned out in New York and large crowds also rallied in Connecticut, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Washington state.

The rallies came on a day in which accidental shootings at gun shows in North Carolina, Indiana and Ohio left five people hurt. The wounded included two bystanders hit by shotgun pellets after a 12-gauge shotgun discharged at a show in Raleigh, N.C., as the owner unzipped its case for a law officer to check at a security entrance, authorities said. A retired deputy there also suffered a slight hand injury.

About 800 people gathered for the ""Guns Across America"" event in Austin, Texas, as speakers took to the microphone under a giant Texas flag stamped with one word: ""Independent.""

""The thing that so angers me, and I think so angers you, is that this president is using children as a human shield to advance a very liberal agenda that will do nothing to protect them,"" said state Rep. Steve Toth, referencing last month's elementary school massacre in Newtown, Conn.

Obama recently announced the gun-control proposals in the wake of a Connecticut elementary school shooting that killed 20 first-graders and six educators last month.

Toth, a first-term Republican lawmaker from The Woodlands outside Houston, has introduced legislation to ban within Texas any future federal limits on assault weapons or high-capacity magazines, though such a measure would violate the U.S. Constitution.

In Arizona, Oregon and Utah, some came with holstered handguns or rifles on their backs.

One man in Phoenix dressed as a Revolutionary War Minuteman, completing his outfit with an antique long rifle and a sign reading: ""Tyrants Beware - 1776.""

""We're out here because this country has some very wise founding fathers and they knew they were being oppressed when they were a British colony,"" said another man at the Phoenix rally, Eric Cashman. ""Had they not had their firearms ... to stand up against the British, we'd still be a British colony.""

Rallies at statehouses nationwide were organized by Eric Reed, an airline captain from the Houston area who in November started a group called ""More Gun Control (equals) More Crime."" Its Facebook page has been ""liked"" by more than 17,000 people.

At the New York state Capitol in Albany, about 2,000 people turned out for a chilly rally, where they chanted ""We the People,"" ''USA,"" and ""Freedom."" Many carried American flags and ""Don't Tread On Me"" banners. The event took place four days after Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed the nation's toughest assault weapon and magazine restrictions.

In Connecticut, where task forces created by the Legislature and Democratic Gov. Dannel Malloy are considering changes to gun laws, police said about 1,000 people showed up on the Capitol grounds. One demonstrator at the rally in Maine, Joe Getchell of Pittsfield, said every law-abiding citizen has a right to bear arms.

In Minnesota, where more than 500 people showed up at the Capitol in St. Paul, Republican state Rep. Tony Cornish said he would push to allow teachers to carry guns in school without a principal or superintendent's approval and to allow 21-year-olds to carry guns on college campuses.

Capitol rallies also took place in Colorado, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Vermont and Wisconsin, among other states.

Back in Texas, Houston resident Robert Thompson attended the rally with his wife and children, ages 12, 5 and 4. Many in the family wore T-shirts reading: ""The Second Amendment Protects the First.""

""What we are facing now is an assault weapons ban, but if they do this, what will do they do next?"" Thompson asked.

(CNN) – Dozens of retired senior military veterans are signing onto Americans for Responsible Solutions, the pro-gun control group of former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, Mark Kelly.

The new initiative, Veterans for Responsible Solutions, will support Giffords and Kelly's wider efforts by bringing to bear the experience of military veterans who've sworn to defend the Second Amendment and have themselves been well versed in the use of firearms.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

Kelly is taking point on the initiative as a veteran himself. The former astronaut is a retired Navy captain, becoming a combat veteran as a military aviator.

""I've been shot at"" while flying, Kelly told reporters on a conference call organized to promote the initiative.

Moreover, there are guns in the Arizona home Kelly shares with Giffords he said, guns used for self-defense and target shooting.

The point Kelly was trying to prove is that neither he nor any member of his organization is looking to repeal or limit Second Amendment rights, likely because the perception of any move against gun ownership in the United States is bound to incite fierce opposition from the powerful pro-gun lobby.

""We're for gun rights,"" said James Barnett, a retired rear admiral.

Instead, Veterans for Responsible Solutions wants commonsense actions like universal background checks, Kelly said.

These are background checks an overwhelming majority of Americans have said they support, polls show.

Vance Coleman, a retired Army major general, said on the call that he also owns guns. But not everyone should, Coleman continued, namely criminals and the mentally ill.

""They should not own guns and the Congress needs to do something about that,"" Coleman said.

The exact functions of the veterans initiative remains fluid.

According to Kelly, some members will be doing little more than lending their names while others will be pursuing a greater measure of activism, perhaps by writing newspaper editorials.

Efforts at introducing universal background checks stalled when a Senate bill got 54 votes in April, six shy of the supermajority it would have needed.

The Obama administration's vow to fight on gained little traction, although there have been limited executive actions taken since then aimed at curbing gun violence.

On Friday Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius pushed new rules that would require mental illness to be treated the same as physical ailments.

Gun control activists and other have argued that not enough attention has been paid to treating the mentally ill when it comes to trying to prevent gun violence.

Politically, gun control has proven largely unpalatable, particularly with the successful recall elections in September of a pair of Democratic legislators in Colorado who helped push gun control measures.

Groups like the National Rifle Association argue that background checks and other restrictions harm only law-abiding gun owners while criminals will continue to obtain firearms illegally."

Four are still hold-outs,"It would seem a lobbyist’s dream: rounding up votes for a proposal backed by more than 8 in 10 people in polls. Yet gun control supporters are struggling to win over moderate Democrats in their drive to push expanded background checks for firearms purchasers through the Senate next month. Backed by a $12 million TV advertising campaign financed by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, gun control groups scheduled rallies around the country Thursday aimed at pressuring senators to back the effort. President Barack Obama was meeting at the White House with gun violence victims.

At least four red-state Democratic senators could vote against a bill that would extend background checks to private gun sales. A few others have indicated they would vote in favor of such a law if the details are to their liking. Unless they—the two independents in the Senate and five Republicans there—agree, the proposal that has the most popular support across the nation and was seen when it was first suggested three months ago as the most likely new gun-control measure to pass, may never become law. Alan Fram reports As I noted Thursday, two of the five Democrats targeted by the Bloomberg ad campaign have indicated they would be amenable to a favorable vote on expanding background checks that now cover sales by the estimated 55,000 federally licensed dealers nationwide but not private transactions. They are Sen. Kay Hagan of North Carolina and Joe Donnelly of Indiana.

As soon as Donnelly said he could vote for extending the background checks, the Bloomberg-funded ads were pulled from the Indiana market. But neither he nor Hagan are solidly in the thumbs-up column. Their vote depends on the details, they have said. What that could mean is that one or both of them are concerned about record-keeping. That's been a major sticking point.

Many gun-rights advocates, including Republican Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, oppose any record-keeping by anybody on the grounds that it would produce a registry that the government could later use to seize firearms. Gun-control advocates, most notably Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the sponsor of the background-check bill, says without record-keeping of some sort, extending the checks would be pointless.

But Hagan and Donnelly can at least be counted in the ""probably yes"" category. Four other Democratic senators in red states are still not on board. Follow me below the fold to find out who they are."

“The whole family?” Mr. Foer asked.

“Not the girls,” he said, “but oftentimes guests of mine go up there. And I have a profound respect for the traditions of hunting that trace back in this country for generations. And I think those who dismiss that out of hand make a big mistake.”

Mr. Obama went on to say that the reality of guns in urban areas differs from that in rural areas. “So it’s trying to bridge those gaps that I think is going to be part of the biggest task over the next several months,” he said. “And that means that advocates of gun control have to do a little more listening than they do sometimes.”

The skeet-shooting comment caught many off guard because it is not something the president has talked about. While other presidents have used the skeet-shooting range at Camp David, database searches of Mr. Obama’s speeches and interviews turned up no mention of participating.

“I would refer you simply to his comments,” Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, told reporters who asked after the interview was published how often the president shoots. “I don’t know how often. He does go to Camp David with some regularity, but I’m not sure how often he’s done that.”

Asked why no one had seen a picture or heard about it before, Mr. Carney said, “Because when he goes to Camp David, he goes to spend time with his family and friends and relax, not to produce photographs.”

That did not satisfy the skeptics. The Washington Post’s “Fact Checker” column cast doubt on the claim, while Fox News quoted an unnamed person saying Mr. Obama had participated once during a Marine competition at Camp David but not “all the time.” Representative Marsha Blackburn, Republican of Tennessee, went on CNN to question the assertion."

(CNN) —

Saying he hopes it sets an example for the nation, Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy on Thursday signed what advocacy groups call the strongest and most comprehensive gun legislation in the nation.

The new law bans some weapons as well as the sale or purchase of high-capacity magazines like those used in the Newtown shooting in December that left 20 children and six adults dead.

It also requires background checks for all gun purchases.

“This is a profoundly emotional day, I think, for everyone in this room,” Malloy said at the signing ceremony. “We have come together in a way that relatively few places in our nation have demonstrated an ability to do.”

However, he noted, “Today does not mark the end of our efforts” to combat gun violence.

With the governor’s signature, Connecticut became the third state to pass such tough measures since the December rampage in Newtown. New York and Colorado passed gun-control legislation limiting magazine capacity, among other provisions.

Similar legislation appears stalled in Congress despite overwhelming public support for background checks and substantial – although diminished – support for major gun restrictions in the wake of the Newtown killings.

Connecticut’s measure sends a message to the nation, Senate President Don Williams said Wednesday, before lawmakers approved the final draft.

“Democrats and Republicans were able to come to an agreement on a strong, comprehensive bill,” he added. “That is a message that should resound in 49 other states, and in Washington, D.C., and the message is we can get it done here and they should get it done in their respective states and nationally in Congress.”

Despite disappointment in a provision in the Connecticut bill that allows people who already own high-capacity magazines to keep them, a gun control advocacy group praised the state legislation as historic.

“It doesn’t have everything we wanted, but it was everything that could be done within the political reality we were facing,” Connecticut Against Gun Violence said Wednesday in a statement on its website.

Critics have argued the legislation will do nothing to stop someone like Adam Lanza, who carried out the Sandy Hook school killings December 14 with an assault-style weapon and high-capacity magazines.

“In his case, he stole the guns and went on a murderous rampage,” Scott Wilson, president of the Connecticut Citizens Defense League, previously has said. “Limiting magazine capacity or mandating registration will only affect law-abiding persons, not criminals bent on murder.”

Lanza used weapons that were registered to his mother, who he also killed that day.

NRA ‘plucks the bird’ to weaken gun proposals

What the bill does

The Connecticut measure adds more than 100 guns to the state’s list of banned assault weapons, limits the capacity of ammunition magazines to 10 rounds and bans armor-piercing bullets.

While the new law allows current owners of magazines that can hold more than 10 rounds to keep them, it requires those people to register the magazines with the state, and forbids owners from loading them with more than 10 rounds outside their homes or while at a gun range.

The legislation also creates the nation’s first statewide registry of people convicted of crimes involving the use or threat of dangerous weapons. The registry will be available only to law enforcement agencies.

It also requires eligibility certificates for the purchase of any rifle, shotgun or ammunition, and significantly increases penalties for illegal possession and trafficking of guns.

It also requires background checks for all firearms sales, including at gun shows, and creates safety standards for school buildings.

Debate on the legislation was emotional at times.

Sen. Beth Bye spoke for five minutes, noting it was the same amount of time that the shooting lasted at Sandy Hook Elementary School.

She recalled how parents hoping to be reunited with their children were directed to a building near the school after the shootings, but “20 of those parents came back with a state trooper and not their child.”

Some people questioned whether the law deals enough with the state’s mental health system, a reference to the presumed mental condition of the shooter.

The legislation allows school districts to require “mental health first aid” training for school personnel and creates a task force to examine the state’s mental health system. Additionally, it alters state insurance regulations to beef up mental health care coverage.

Newtown shooting details revealed

Reassuring gun owners

Republican House Minority Leader Larry Cafero, a member of the bipartisan task force that drafted the bill, reassured gun owners they wouldn’t lose their guns or ammunition magazines, “so long as they follow our rules and register,” he said.

“Are there tighter restrictions on their use, etc.? Absolutely. We also were able to see as part of this legislation the repeal of early release for violent criminals.”

Families of the children slain in Newtown were disappointed the larger-capacity magazines were grandfathered in. They asked had for an across-the-board ban.

Malloy had backed the broader ban, saying banning the future sale of high-capacity magazines “would not be an effective solution.”

But Wilson said the magazine limits will have no impact on crime.

“It is ludicrous to expect people that have firearms capable of holding 15 rounds to only load 10 rounds inside of them,” he objected. “Do criminals really care about these laws?”

Obama: ‘Shame on us’ if Newtown doesn’t bring new gun legislation

National fight

The move in Connecticut comes as the nation is in a heated gun debate.

President Barack Obama has been waging a public pressure campaign for tougher gun laws, an effort he continued Wednesday in Colorado – site of two of the nation’s most notorious mass shootings, in 1999 at Columbine High School and last year at an Aurora movie theater.

“There doesn’t have to be a conflict between protecting our citizens and protecting our Second Amendment rights,” Obama said.

Obama is fighting intense opposition from the National Rifle Association, which sees restrictions as unconstitutional and ineffective.

Lawmakers in 36 states also have proposed legislation that would negate federal gun control initiatives, according to the non-profit Sunlight Foundation Reporting Group.

Despite a spike in support for the strictest gun control initiatives in the immediate aftermath of the Newtown shootings, a CNN/ORC International poll this month found support for major restrictions may be fading.

The poll, released March 18, found that while a majority of Americans favored major restrictions shortly after the shootings, that support had fallen to 43%.

A survey released Wednesday by MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” and Marist College found that 60% of respondents want stricter laws governing the sale of firearms.

Support for broader background checks on prospective gun owners remains overwhelming.

The MSNBC poll showed 87% of respondents support expanded background checks, with strong backing from Democrats, independents and Republicans.

A poll out Wednesday from Quinnipiac University pegged support for universal background checks at 91%. That was despite 48% of those polled conceding that such checks could form a database for later confiscation efforts.

Case Study: GUNS IN THE USA The United States constitution, which was written over two hundred years ago, enshrines an individual's right to keep and bear arms.

In 2000, the FBI estimated that 66% of the 15,517 murders that year were committed with firearms.

Fatal shootings in recent years, many involving teenagers, has made the issue of gun control a key debate in US politics.

Context



The United States has the largest number of guns in private hands of any country in the world with 60 million people owning a combined arsenal of over 200 million firearms.



The US constitution, which was written in 1787, enshrines the people's right to keep and bear arms in its Second Amendment.



It reads: 'A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.'



Although guns are permitted everywhere, the laws governing gun use vary considerably from state to state.



Gun Control, Not Prohibition



Amending the Constitution to prohibit guns is rarely discussed as many Americans view the right to bear arms as an important civil liberty.



Instead, the issue is whether or not it is lawful to impose stricter controls on gun usage.



Proposed gun control legislation has concerned child-proof locks, background checks on gun purchasers, the outlawing of some types of assault weapons and, most recently, the creation of a nationwide database of ballistic fingerprints in order to track the movement of the nation's guns.



American opinion is divided between those who insist on the universal right to bear arms and those who advocate stricter controls.



The influential firearms lobby, headed by the National Rifle Association (NRA), believes gun ownership to be a personal and moral right and dismisses the link between gun ownership and high gun violence with its slogan 'Guns don't kill people, people kill people.'



Advocates of firearm control argue that the Second Amendment is anachronistic belonging to the long-gone days of the frontier. They point to the high levels of gun-related murder and violent crime in the US to stress the need for reform.



The issue of removing the number of guns that are already in circulation is rarely discussed.



More Controls



In the past decade, public opinion has been gradually moved in favour of stricter gun control laws. In January 2001, 59% of the respondents in an ABC News/Washington Post survey said they favoured stricter gun control laws.



After the horrific events in 1999 at Columbine High School in Colorado when two students shot dead 13 fellow students and each other, polls showed that two-thirds of Americans supported greater gun control measures. Moreover, 15 state legislatures passed significant gun control bills.



The case of the Washington Sniper, who terrorised the suburbs of the nation's capital in late 2002 in a month-long shooting spree, killing 10 people and seriously wounding three, swiftly brought the issue of gun control onto the table once again.



However, any new gun control legislation that comes before the Congress is sure to be vetoed by President George W. Bush, who is a long-time ally of the NRA.



While he was governor of Texas, the President signed laws making it legal to carry concealed weapons and difficult for citizens to sue gun manufacturers.

However, both surveys found that support for stricter laws remains higher than it was before the Newtown shooting.

In a new HuffPost/YouGov poll, 48 percent of Americans said they think gun laws should be made more strict, while 16 percent said they should be made less strict and 29 percent said they preferred no change. Support for stricter gun laws in the poll is down from a high of 60 percent in a YouGov/Economist poll conducted in January, weeks after the Newtown shooting.

Likewise, a Gallup poll released Friday found that support for stricter gun laws has fallen from a high of 58 percent after the Newtown shooting to 49 percent now. Both the Gallup poll and the HuffPost/YouGov poll were conducted Sept. 17 and 18, after the Monday deaths of 13 people in the shooting at Navy Yard in Washington, D.C.

Although support for stricter gun laws was down in both surveys from the rates seen just after the Newtown shooting, it has not fallen to levels seen before that shooting. The most recent Gallup and YouGov polls conducted before the Newtown shooting both found support for stricter gun laws below 45 percent.

Some policies supported by advocates of stricter gun laws still receive broad support -- most notably universal background checks. A HuffPost/YouGov poll conducted in August found that 79 percent of Americans support universal background checks, including for gun shows and private sales. However, overall support for stricter laws has shown a marked decline over the past 25 years. Two major school shootings -- Columbine and Newtown -- have reversed that trend, but only temporarily.

In accordance with the longer-term trend against support for tightening gun laws, the post-Newtown bump in support never reached the same level that it did after Columbine.

Following other mass shootings, including the recent shooting in Washington, polls have found little evidence of anything more than fleeting changes in opinion on gun laws. A HuffPost/YouGov poll conducted a month ago, before the Navy Yard shooting, found that 49 percent of Americans said they support stricter gun laws -- almost identical to the 48 percent who said so in the most recent HuffPost/YouGov poll.

Both the latest HuffPost/YouGov poll and the Gallup poll were conducted before the shooting Thursday in Chicago in which 13 people were injured, including a 3-year-old boy who was shot in the head.

Fifty-nine percent of respondents to the HuffPost/YouGov poll said they had ""heard a lot"" about the Navy Yard shooting. In contrast, a HuffPost/YouGov poll conducted in the days after the Newtown school shooting found that 70 percent said they had heard a lot about that shooting.

The HuffPost/YouGov poll also found that many Americans don't think stricter gun laws will prevent future mass shootings. Forty percent said stricter laws would help, but 52 percent said changing things won't make a difference.

And when it comes to ways to reduce the likelihood of future violence, many people didn't look to gun laws. By a 57 percent to 29 percent margin, the HuffPost/YouGov poll found that most people think better mental health care is more likely to prevent future mass shootings than stricter gun laws. Similarly, the Gallup poll found that 48 percent of Americans place a ""great deal"" of blame for mass shootings on the ""failure of the mental health system to identify individuals who are a danger to others,"" compared to 40 percent who said the same of ""easy access to guns.""

On the other hand, the HuffPost/YouGov survey showed little sympathy for the argument frequently made by gun-rights advocates that people carrying guns would lead to lower gun violence. A plurality of respondents to the poll rejected that argument, saying by a 44 percent to 38 percent margin that stricter gun laws were more likely to prevent mass shootings than allowing more people to carry guns for protection. Just after the Newtown shooting, respondents said the same by a 46 percent to 34 percent margin.

The HuffPost/YouGov poll was conducted Sept. 17-18 among 1,000 U.S. adults using a sample selected from YouGov's opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population. Factors considered include age, race, gender, education, employment, income, marital status, number of children, voter registration, time and location of Internet access, interest in politics, religion and church attendance.

Dargan (D-New Haven), co-chairman of the state’s Public Safety Committee, has introduced a bill that would make public the names and addresses of gun permit holders in Connecticut under the state’s Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).

Dargan’s bill is in response to the Dec. 14th shootings in the Sandy Hook School in Newtown, CT, and also occurs as a Westchester County, NY newspaper, the Journal News, is drawing widespread, nationwide anger for publishing a map with the names and addresses of gun permit holders. The bill, if passed, would reverse the state legislature’s decision, made nearly two decades ago, to protect gun permit holders’ personal information from disclosure.

Connecticut’s General Assembly will return to Hartford next week, when a five-month session will begin, one in which gun control is expected to be a dominant issue. The state has some of the toughest gun control laws in the country, yet is one of the most lenient toward serious crimes, having just repealed the death penalty last spring, and having passed, in 2011, a controversial early release amendment for some prisoners who demonstrate good behavior while incarcerated.

“Most things are FOIA-able now,” Dargan said in an interview Thursday. “Go to the local city clerk’s office and you can find out where Steve Dargan owns property. I don’t know why a responsible gun owner is worried about whether a permit for a revolver is FOIA-able or not.”

Dargan added that in a “computer age” it is reasonable for people to want to know gun ownership information. “Maybe their kids are going over to Johnny Smith’s and maybe they want to see whether they have guns in the house.”

The bill has drawn criticism from both Robert Crook, executive director of the Coalition of Connecticut Sportsmen, and Richard Burgess, head of Connecticut Carry, a nonprofit group that advocates for citizens’ right to bear arms as provided for in the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.

“It’s a tool for criminals,” Crook said. “You don’t see the pistol permit holders in the newspapers. They just don’t break the law, normally.” Crook added that Adam Lanza, the presumed shooter in the Newtown massacre, broke many laws leading up to the shootings, starting with stealing his mother’s legally owned guns.

“I don’t have a solution,” said Crook. “But I don’t think releasing the names of handgun owners will have an effect…except to give some people, and I mean criminals, an option.”

Burgess also criticized the proposed legislation. “It’s crazy for someone to think this is a good idea,” he said. “I can only see harm that could come from it. Do we want to give criminals access to a database that tells you where every handgun in Connecticut is?”

Dargan said he introduced the bill because “people want to have a discussion” about guns after perhaps “the worst school tragedy in history, with kids who are just learning how to tie their shoes gunned down by a madman.”"
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/09/27/gun-rights-advocates-sue-maryland-over-new-firearms-law/,2013-09-27 00:00:00,[],Gun-rights activists sue Maryland to block new firearms law,"Gun-rights activists in Maryland have filed a federal lawsuit to block the state's new gun law before new requirements on assault weapons and large magazines go into effect Oct. 1.

In the lawsuit in filed Thursday in U.S. District Court in Maryland, the plaintiffs argues the the Second Amendment and case law protect their right to own assault rifles and magazines that hold more than 10 rounds, The Baltimore Sun reported.

The plaintiffs include the Maryland Licensed Firearms Dealers Association, the Maryland State Rifle and Pistol Association, the National Shooting Sports Foundation, Associated Gun Clubs of Baltimore, and several other organizations, individuals and gun shops, according to the report.

The new gun law Maryland lawmakers passed earlier this year bans 45 types of assault weapons, but people who own them now will be able to keep them. The law also limits handgun magazines to 10 rounds and requires people to submit fingerprints to the state police to get a license to buy a handgun.

A spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association told The Baltimore Sun lawyers for the plaintiffs plan to ask a judge Friday for an injunction to prevent the law from taking effect.

A spokeswoman for Gov. Martin O’Malley, a Democrat, said she expects the law will withstand the group's legal challenge.

""The vast majority of Marylanders support these common-sense efforts to reduce gun violence,"" spokeswoman Samantha Kappalman told the newspaper. ""The new law will take effect on Tuesday, and it will make families safer.""

John Josselyn, Associated Gun Clubs of Baltimore's legislative vice president, said in a statement that the restrictions are ""an unconstitutional violation"" of the Second Amendment rights of ""law-abiding, responsible citizens.""

""Together we are drawing a line in the sand where Maryland’s gun control agenda tramples the fundamental individual right to defend oneself and family in the home,"" Josselyn said.

A spokesman for the Associated Gun Clubs of Baltimore Inc., one of the plaintiffs, said the new laws would keep honest citizens from being able to ""choose effective firearms for defense in the home.""

The pending new law has prompted a huge increase in applications for firearm purchases, and a backlog has resulted. In the last two weeks, state troopers said applications are coming in at the rate of 1,000 per day.

Maryland State Police said Tuesday residents who have submitted handgun purchase applications before new requirements go into effect next week will not have to obtain a handgun qualification license.

The agency said that troopers will not enforce the new requirements, which also include background checks and fingerprinting, on applications submitted by Sept. 30.

Troopers said as of Friday, slightly more than half of the more than 100,000 purchase applications received had been processed.

The agency began 24/7 operations in December to process the applications, but the backlog continued to grow.

Earlier this month, state police said 20 law enforcement officers from other agencies began helping with background investigations. State law requires that the investigations be conducted by police officers.

Troopers also said that beginning last week, 24 data entry employees from the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services have been inputting information from applications. State police said several security measures were being taken to limit the access of DPSCS employees to the State Police database.

Whoever thinks the ad is about President Obama's daughters are missing the point completely or they're trying to change the subject. This ad is about keeping our children safe. And the President said he was skeptical about the NRA proposal to put policemen in all schools in this country. Yet he and his family are beneficiaries of multiple law enforcement officers surrounding them 24 hours a day. That's the real issue. Anything else is an attempted calculated distraction.

Are the president’s kids more important than yours? Then why is he skeptical about putting armed security in our schools when his kids are protected by armed guards at their school? Mr. Obama demands the wealthy pay their fair share of taxes, but he’s just another elitist hypocrite when it comes to a fair share of security.

Right. That had absolutely nothing to do with the President's children, nor was it a personal attack on President Obama. We are just taking the ad out of context and using it as a distraction for our own ends.

These people are about as craven as they come. Good luck convincing anyone that criticism of this reprehensible message is a distraction.

Not even Joe Scarborough is buying it.

From the link at Media Matters:



Scarborough, who as a Congressman was a strong supporter of the NRA, responded to the ad, asking ""what's wrong with these people?"" He continued, pointing out that once Obama decided to run for president, his children ""have targets on their backs."" Scarborough also said that the NRA is now a ""fringe organization with millions of mainstream members."" He concluded by saying the ad was ""frightening and over the line"".

When the NRA loses someone as wingnutty as Joe Scarborough, you know they are backed into a corner. And now that we have them backed into a corner, it's time to push them back under that rock they crawled out from under."

Last year%27s meeting drew 73%2C740 people in St. Louis

Event serves as both a business meeting and a kind of gun festival%2C complete with a concert and other events

Gun-control advocates see the organization as increasingly out-of-touch

HOUSTON — In some ways, the national debate over gun control has been good for the National Rifle Association.

The nation's largest and most powerful gun rights group holds its annual meeting in Houston this weekend, and it's expected to be its biggest and most-watched gathering ever — perhaps 80,000 people, more than 400 exhibitors, 600 credentialed media and perhaps a future presidential candidate or two.

""I don't think there's anything this year that's business as usual. We're in a very unique point in time as far as the Second Amendment is concerned,"" NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam said. ""It's a demonstration of their passion, of the commitment and the resolve that the American people have toward their freedom.""

Last month, Senate Democrats suspended votes on major gun legislation after they failed to pass a key provision that would have extended criminal background checks for most firearm purchases.

Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who will speak to the NRA meeting Friday, said his message is that the Obama Administration isn't doing enough to prosecute gun crimes and keep schools safe.

""Millions of Americans stood up in the last few weeks and called on the Senate to uphold the Second Amendment,"" Cruz said. ""Everyone in my view ought to be focused on stopping violent crime.""

The annual meeting is required under the NRA's bylaws to elect people to its 76-member board of directors. But the event has become more than a business meeting, and includes a gun show, awards dinners, a political rally, a prayer service, book signings and a country music concert. For the lawyers, there are even continuing legal education credits available.

Last year's meeting — a required campaign stop for GOP candidates in an election year — drew 73,740 people in St. Louis. The exact attendance in Houston won't be known until next week, but organizers say they already had 70,000 confirmed attendees earlier this week. Requests for media credentials have doubled, to 600. And they've booked three times as many hotel rooms as the 2005 meeting, when it was last in Houston.

Greg Ortale, president and CEO of the Greater Houston Convention and Visitors Bureau, said the convention was booked five years in advance. One draw for Houston, he said, was the state's permissive laws on the carrying of firearms.

""They have some organizing and political rallies going on, but it's mostly trade show,"" The vast majority of the attendees are day-trippers who will drive from Texas and neighboring states, he said.

""It's a convention that a lot of families come to. It's unique in that respect. Most people don't take their families to an oil and gas trade show,"" Ortale said.

The convention is expected to draw protests, but will get a welcome from at least one unlikely host: Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, the Democrat who represents downtown Houston in Congress. She's tried — unsuccessfully, so far — to arrange a meeting with NRA Vice President Wayne LaPierre in an attempt to win him over on child-gun-safety legislation she has introduced.

""What I'd like to hear from the National Rifle Association, which has every right to gather in any city, is that they understand that we are a country without morality if we can't do something to protect our babies and our children,"" she said. ""I think that if Wayne would sit down, I honestly believe we could find a rational approach to gun safety and protecting our children.""

Other gun-control advocates were less optimistic, painting NRA leaders as right-wing ideologues financed by the firearms industry and increasingly out-of-touch with their own members. ""They espouse an insurrectionist, anti-democratic philosophy, and they have a lot of people on their board that, to put it lightly, you wouldn't want in polite company,"" said Josh Horwitz, director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence.

Josh Sugarmann, the director of the Violence Policy Center, said polls show most gun owners support universal background checks even more stringent than those blocked last month in the Senate. But nothing will happen in Houston this weekend to moderate the NRA's stance, he said.

""The golden era of NRA debates at their annual meeting is long over,"" he said. ""As far as any potential for a change in direction, the chances are zero."""
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/06/us/colorado-gun-control-proposals-face-fight.html,2013-02-06 00:00:00,['Jack Healy'],Colorado Gun Control Proposals Face Fight,"DENVER — Democratic lawmakers in Colorado, a state haunted by two of the worst mass shootings in American history, unveiled a broad package of gun-control measures on Tuesday, but they stopped short of proposing a ban on assault rifles or any other types of firearms.

Standing with a tearful tableau of family members whose relatives were killed at Columbine High School and an Aurora movie theater, both in Colorado, and Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., the lawmakers offered a preview of legislation that is likely to face fierce opposition from Republicans and skepticism from some rural Democrats in a state where hunting and sport shooting are pursuits that cross generations and partisan lines.

Colorado has emerged as a crucial stage for the battle over gun-control legislation. A national gun-control group has hired a lobbying firm here, and the president of the National Rifle Association is due to meet with Colorado’s governor this week to make his case.

Under the Democrats’ proposals, all private gun sales would be subject to background checks. Colorado now requires background checks at gun shows and retail stores, but not for private sales between individuals. The lawmakers also would limit ammunition clips to 10 rounds, banning the 30-round and 100-round magazines that a gunman used last summer in the shooting inside the Century 16 movie theater in Aurora."

Citizen applications to carry a concealed weapon, meanwhile, rose 49 percent last year, according to county records.

At grocery stores in Grants Pass, stopping and citing shoplifters — sometimes with whole carts of beer or food in tow — have become part of the daily law enforcement routine.

“I hold my breath, every day, for everything,” said Sheriff Gil Gilbertson in an interview in his office, where images of John Wayne lined the walls.

The causes of Josephine County’s plight are convoluted and complex, and echoed in varying degrees across a swath of Oregon timber country that was scarred a century ago by a weird historical wrinkle: the collapse of the Oregon and California, or O&C, Railroad. Around World War I, the railroad’s lands were taken over by the federal government, leaving almost two-thirds of Josephine County, which is about the size of Rhode Island, in federal ownership. And since the federal government pays no property taxes, Congress established a system channeling revenues from the sale of timber, which the county has in abundance.

But as federal timber harvests have been reduced, the lush payments that kept property taxes low have fallen to a trickle. And a federal stopgap payment measure to make up for the timber money was phased out last year. County residents, meanwhile, have voted multiple times, most recently in May, against raising their property taxes to resolve the shortfall."

The legislation will need 60 votes to pass in the chamber, which means it will need Republican support as well as support from Senate Democrats facing re-election in districts with a strong tradition of gun rights.

""It's an open question as to whether or not we have the votes,” Pennsylvania Republican Sen. Pat Toomey told CNN’s “State of the Union.” “I think it's going to be close.""

Toomey joined West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin in crafting the background proposal, which would cover Internet and gun show purchases but would still exempt sales between family members.

Background checks currently apply only to transactions handled by the country's 55,000 licensed gun dealers.

New York Sen. Chuck Schumer -- who has worked since January on a larger plan to curb gun violence that could win bipartisan support -- told ABC’s “This Week” he has strong support from fellow Democrats.

“But … we're working really hard to maximize both the number of Democrats who will be the overwhelming majority of those who vote for it and a number of Republicans,” he said.

Senate Democrats and others have been trying to fulfill President Obama’s second-term priority of curbing gun violence since the December 2012 shootings at a Connecticut elementary school in which 20 first-graders and six adults were killed.

However, the effort has faced strong opposition on Capitol Hill and from such major gun lobby groups as the National Rifle Association.

Plan to ban high-capacity gun magazine clips and re-institute a ban on semi-automatic weapons have already been removed from the legislation, for lack of support. However, they could re-emerge as Senate amendments.

The full Senate debate is expected to begin Monday, after enough senators voted last week to stop a Republican-led effort to block the legislation from going forward.

Among the Republicans to express support Sunday was Sen. Susan Collins, a moderate Republican from Maine.

The plan would ""strengthen the background check system without in any way infringing on Second Amendment rights,"" she said in a statement.

However, ""it is impossible to predict at this point"" what will be in a final bill, she added.

Arizona Sen. John McCain, who has a B+ rating from the NRA, told CNN that he was ""very favorably disposed"" to the Manchin-Toomey proposal.

""I appreciate their work,"" he said. ""And the American people want to do what we can to prevent these tragedies. And there's a lot more that needs to be done, particularly in the area of mental health.""

It was in McCain's home state that a gunman with schizophrenia shot then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords in the head during a 2011 rampage in Tucson that left six people dead.

Collins and Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois are the only two Republicans who are expected to vote for the compromise as of now.

On Sunday, Manchin urged lawmakers to read the 49-page proposal. He said it should dispel any misconceptions about infringing on the constitutional right to bear arms.

The proposal, in fact, expands firearms rights by easing some restrictions on transporting guns across state lines, protects sellers from lawsuits if buyers passed a check but later used a gun in a crime and lets gun dealers conduct business in states where they don't live.

However, Manchin also acknowledged the vote would be tight.

“We're close,” he told CBS’ “Face the Nation.” “We need more.""

The compromise, if successful, would be added to overall legislation to strengthen laws against illegal gun trafficking and to increase slightly school-security aid.

Other additions to the legislation also are expected to be debated this week, including a measure that would allow concealed hand gun permits issued by one state to be accepted nationwide as a de facto background check.

Those twenty-seven words enshrined in the Constitution by our founding fathers clearly give us the right to own firearms in the protection of God-given liberty.

Most Americans agree with the right to bear arms. According to a recent Rasmussen survey, 65% of Americans see gun rights as “a protection against tyranny.” Among those 65% are thousands of uniformed local and state police officers who see real criminals on a daily basis who not only have not properly registered their firearms or submitted to a background check; regardless of what liberals and the Obama Administration try to jam through Congress, they’re not going to succeed.

As the Supreme Court affirmed in the 1997 case Printz v. United States, county sheriffs are the chief law-enforcement officers in their jurisdictions, with more authority than even federal agents. As such, sheriffs work for their constituents and must comply with their oath to defend both the United States and state constitutions, not do the bidding of out-of-control politicians in Washington who apparently recognize no limits on their power.

So elected leaders, such as Arizona Sheriff Richard Mack, Jackson County, Kentucky Sheriff Denny Peyman, Milwaukee County Sherriff David Clarke Jr., and others are speaking out against Obama’s campaign against gun ownership. Almost 300 sheriffs from across the country and at least 13 state sheriff organizations have announced their opposition to President Obama’s proposed gun control measures, pledging to defend the Second Amendment within their jurisdiction. That number is increasing on a daily basis.

While some liberal legal scholars find ambiguity in the unusual wording of the 2nd Amendment, most state constitutions are very explicit in allowing citizens to own guns. For example, the Ohio Constitution states “The people have the right to bear arms for their defense and security[…],” while Delaware’s Constitution goes further: “A person has the right to keep and bear arms for the defense of self, family, home and State, and for hunting and recreational use.”

However, with the Executive Branch under control of Barack Obama, and too many liberal Democrats in Congress, our Constitutionally-protected rights are under attack

Using the senseless carnage at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut as a vehicle (remember Rahm Emanuel’s comment that you should never let a crisis go to waste?), gun control advocates have shamelessly stood upon the graves of innocent children to promote their misguided political agenda. President Obama has already taken immediate steps to limit legal gun usage through constitutionally questionable executive orders; he promised more limitations during his recent State of the Union Address.

In Congress, the anti-gun efforts are lead by Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, who recently announced proposed legislation that would ban 157 makes and models of military-style “assault” rifles, pistols, shotguns, and semi-automatic weapons. In addition, she proposes to outlaw fixed ammunition clips that can hold more than 10 rounds and ban civilian variations of military combat model firearms.

Feinstein was the author of the 1994 assault weapons ban (which expired in 2004) and had access to plenty of data which suggests crime rates did not drop during the ban. Murder and violent crime rates never went above what they were in the year prior to the ban sunsetting. Most policemen will gladly tell you that criminals almost always use handguns.

Our rights are in jeopardy. Police officers, while they serve our communities proudly, cannot be everywhere at once, and law-abiding citizens must have the ability to protect their families before help arrives. It is time to support our police officers by standing up to President Obama’s anti-gun agenda."

Washington (CNN) – Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky argued Wednesday morning President Obama is using the families of victims from the Newtown elementary school shooting for political purposes and compared them to ""props"" in the ongoing gun control debate.

His comments later elicited a fiery response from Obama after the Senate voted down a proposal to expand background checks on firearm purchases.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker'] [twitter-follow screen_name='KilloughCNN']

Talking about the gun control legislation at a Washington breakfast with reporters, Paul said the issue is a legitimate subject to debate but said it was unfortunate that families who have suffered from gun violence are being drawn into the political scene on Capitol Hill.

""In some cases, I think the president has used them as props,"" he said.

A number of Newtown families traveled to Washington in recent weeks to lobby senators as the upper chamber considered tougher gun laws.

One of the main amendments of a gun package, however, failed to gain enough support in the vote Wednesday after nearly all Republicans and four Democrats opposed the legislation, saying it doesn't address the problem of gun violence.

(Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid also voted no at the last minute for procedural reasons, allowing him to bring the amendment back up at a later date.)

""I've seen the fathers and mothers testifying,"" Paul said, adding he's aware they came voluntarily and wanted to be part of the debate. ""It still saddens me just to see them.""

Pressed later during the breakfast about his comment referring to ""props,"" Paul said he wants people to know that he cares about those families.

""I'm someone who's presenting a face to the public. The face I want to present is that I do care about those kids and I understand the grief that (the families) are going through,"" he said. ""Politics isn't only about facts. It is about whether you're seen as being empathetic and I do want people to know that I do care about those families and I care about their grief.

Following Wednesday's vote, Obama appeared in the Rose Garden with Newtown families and angrily chided those who opposed the measure. And in a somewhat veiled swipe, the president addressed Paul's comment.

""I've heard folks say that having the families of victims lobby for this legislation was somehow misplaced–a 'prop,' somebody called it,"" he said. ""Are they serious? Do they really think that thousands of families whose lives have been shattered by gun violence don't have a right to weigh in on this issue? Do we think their emotions, their loss is not relevant to this debate?""

""So all in all, this was a pretty shameful day in Washington,"" he added.

Paul was one of the Republican senators who conducted a filibuster of the bill, preventing it from moving forward last week. However, their filibuster was overcome when the Senate obtained the 60 votes it needed to proceed with the legislation.

The senator said he didn't consider the background check proposal, which expands the system to cover private sales at gun shows and online, as a solution to gun violence, arguing those who commit mass shootings are going to do so no matter what.

Instead, he favors strengthening the current background check system and allowing teachers to keep guns in the classroom as a way to protect students.

The current actions on the Hill, he argued, are akin to ""window dressing.""

""It's a dog and pony show, it's a parade, it's theatrics,"" he said, adding some lawmakers just want to be able to say they ""did something"" on gun violence, even if it's not effective in the end.

Also at the breakfast with reporters, Paul confirmed he was considering a presidential bid and outlined further plans for his travel to early primary states this year.

""We're considering it, but we won't make a decision before 2014,"" he said at the breakfast, sponsored by The Christian Science Monitor.

Paul is scheduled to travel to the early primary states of Iowa and New Hampshire next month, but he said he's also adding South Carolina to his itinerary this summer.

""Whether I run or not, I would consider it as something that allows me to have a larger microphone,"" he said."

Colorado Senate President John Morse, who shepherded the legislation to passage, was defeated on a 51%-49% vote. Sen. Angela Giron of Pueblo, a fellow Democrat who voted in favor of the measures, lost 56% to 44%. They were replaced by Republicans who opposed the new restrictions.

The recall was the first in the 100 years since Colorado adopted the constitutional provision and grew out of sweeping measures passed last winter after mass shootings at a school in Newtown, Conn., and at a movie theater in Aurora, outside Denver.

The laws limit gun magazines to 15 rounds and require universal background checks, to be paid for by the gun purchaser, among other restrictions. They passed without a single Republican vote. The laws, which took effect July 1, remain in force despite Tuesday’s vote.

Morse thanked his constituents for the chance to serve them and said “the Democratic Party will continue to fight.”

“The highest rank in a democracy is citizen, not Senate president, so soon, along with many of you, I will hold that rank and there’s nothing citizens can’t accomplish when they put their minds to accomplishing it,” Morse told disconsolate supporters at a party that turned into a political wake.

Although eclipsed nationally by the debate over Syria, the results could still resonate well beyond the Rockies. The national gun debate has always been less about numbers than the passions of a relatively small but fervent group of activists, and both sides invested heavily in the campaign, knowing the message the outcome would send.

Morse, a Colorado Springs lawmaker whose support was vital to enactment of the legislation, called the restrictions a measured, common-sense response to gun violence in a state with a long, venerated tradition of gun ownership.

Critics called the legislation an infringement of personal freedom and accused Morse of ramming it through the Democratic-run Legislature without enough public input or a single Republican vote. Grass-roots activists launched the recall effort even before Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper applied his signature.

What began as a local effort, however, quickly gained national attention once the recall question was cleared in mid-July for the ballot, drawing advocates on both sides hoping to either frighten or fortify lawmakers nationwide who might be considering similar legislation.

The National Rifle Assn. and its allies faced gun control supporters led by New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, each side pouring hundreds of thousands of dollars into the campaign.

Groups with other interests invested heavily as well, including organized labor, Planned Parenthood and the conservative Koch brothers, turning the contest into a wide-ranging free-for-all that surpassed, in Colorado, even the intensity of the 2012 presidential contest.

With the replacement of Morse and Giron by Republicans — former Colorado Springs Councilman Bernie Herpin and former Pueblo police officer George Rivera, respectively — the Democratic hold on the state Senate shrinks to just one seat. The party has a much larger majority in the state House, enough to thwart any legislative effort to overturn the gun laws.

Opponents are hoping to qualify a ballot initiative in 2014 that would repeal some of the provisions. A group of sheriffs has also filed suit to overturn the legislation.

The results in effect pushed up the retirement date for Morse, who was first elected in 2006 and termed out after 2014. He repeatedly said that even if he lost his job, passing the gun measures was worth the sacrifice. Giron, a freshman lawmaker, would have faced reelection in 2014.

Legislature may act on proposal next week

Efforts draw resistance from gun-rights advocates

Governors in Colorado%2C Connecticut also pursuing tougher limits

ALBANY, N.Y. – In 1911, New York passed the Sullivan law, one of the first gun-control laws in the nation that required a permit to own a handgun.

More than a century later, Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg have become national players in the push for tougher gun laws, putting New York at the forefront of the gun-control debate.

While the White House works to curb gun violence after the school shootings in Newtown, Conn., New York is forging ahead quickly with its own proposal. Cuomo, a Democrat and potential 2016 presidential candidate, has vowed to pass the toughest gun-control measures in the country. State lawmakers are hoping to pass a set of laws as early as news week, which would make it the first state to do so since the Connecticut shootings.

""Gun violence has been on a rampage, as we know firsthand, and we know painfully,"" Cuomo said in the annual State of the State Address last Wednesday. ""We must stop the madness, my friends, and in one word, it's just enough. It has been enough.""

Cuomo is pressing lawmakers, including Republicans who control the state Senate, to support his agenda.

""To be blind to this issue and the number of tragedies and the amount of bloodshed, I think would be dereliction of your public service responsibility,"" he said Thursday.

Those efforts, though, are drawing increasing resistance from gun-rights advocates. The National Rifle Association issued a statement Wednesday saying, ""America's most anti-gun governor hails from the same state as the nation's most anti-gun mayor.""

The group argued that New York already has among the toughest gun laws in the nation, including an assault-rifle ban and a 10-round magazine capacity limit. The NRA on its website said New York is trying to move quickly in order to diminish public debate.

New York lawmakers are proposing to expand the assault-rifle ban to include all high-capacity magazines. Currently, high-capacity magazines are banned in New York unless they were manufactured before 1994, a loophole that Cuomo wants to close. Lawmakers also want to reduce the number of bullets in a magazine from 10 to seven, which would be the most stringent limit in the nation.

Bloomberg and Cuomo haven't always agreed on state policy, but they appear to be in sync on the gun-control issue.

""New York state has led the nation with strong, common-sense gun laws, and the governor's new proposals will build on that tradition,"" Bloomberg, an independent who heads the group Mayors Against Illegal Guns, said Wednesday. ""They will help law enforcement keep guns out of the hands of criminals and other dangerous people and save lives.""

Other Democratic governors are pursuing also tougher gun laws. On Thursday, Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper proposed universal background checks for gun sales. Connecticut Gov. Dan Malloy has set up a panel to make proposals by March.

New York, with nearly 19.5 million people the third largest state in the U.S., ranked 24th in the nation for its murder rate in 2010, federal statistics show, and slightly below the national average. Last month, Bloomberg announced that the number of murders in the city was the lowest since records started being kept 50 years ago.

The debate over gun laws in New York has expanded to media coverage. The Journal News in Westchester County, like USA TODAY, a Gannett Co. publication, has been under heavy criticism for publishing an interactive map of the names and addresses of pistol-permit holders in the northern New York City suburbs. Putnam County has refused a request to release its list of pistol-permit holders and has vowed to fight the newspaper in court, saying the information's release would jeopardize safety. Good-government groups defended the newspaper, saying the information is public.

Some lawmakers want a state law that would make the pistol-permit information private, but Cuomo has not included the measure in his gun-control package.

""I'll leave it to the local government to make their interpretation of the law,"" Cuomo said Thursday. ""And my guess is in these cases, the court will wind up deciding.""

Republicans and conservatives in New York are focusing on tougher laws on illegal guns, saying the shootings in Newtown and another in Webster, N.Y., on Christmas Eve when four volunteer firefighters were shot, killing two, in an ambush shouldn't be linked to law-abiding gun owners.

""Any further restrictions on legal gun ownership in New York state will jeopardize the safety of all New York's citizens,"" the state's Conservative Party said in a memo to legislators Friday. ""The best solution to end indefensible terroristic acts is to prosecute to the fullest extent possible all those who use illegal guns.""

With President Obama preparing to push a legislative agenda aimed at curbing the nation’s gun violence, pillars of his political network, along with independent groups, are raising millions of dollars and mapping out strategies in an attempt to shepherd new regulations through Congress.

But the efforts, designed in large part to counter opposition from the National Rifle Association, face serious political obstacles on Capitol Hill. The NRA spent more than $20 million on federal election campaigns last year, and its lobbying muscle extends from Washington to state capitals around the country.

Most Republicans in the GOP-controlled House also oppose additional gun regulations, as do some key Democrats in the Senate — meaning that the groups aligned with Obama will have to persuade dozens of skeptical lawmakers to vote for the president’s eventual proposals.

The groups, whose leaders are in regular contact with the White House, are working to enlist religious leaders, mayors, police chiefs and other influential constituents to lobby their local lawmakers in their home districts. The organizations also plan to stage rallies at congressional town hall meetings across the country in much the same way tea party activists mounted opposition in 2009 to Obama’s health-care overhaul.

View Graphic Majority sees Connecticut shooting as societal problem

A trial run for the burgeoning campaign came this week when the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence ran hard-hitting ads in North Dakota and Capitol Hill newspapers against Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.), who said Sunday that some of the gun measures Obama is considering are “extreme.” After the ads — which told Heitkamp “Shame on you” — the freshman senator’s office issued a statement opening the door to supporting some gun-control measures.

“You have to get those members of Congress who think the easiest position is to be with the NRA to think that someone will walk up to them in the supermarket and say, ‘Why can’t we just have background checks?’ ” said Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank helping to coordinate the effort. “They have to think of these as mainstream issues.”

Other organizations active in the effort include liberal interest groups, labor unions and Mayors Against Illegal Guns, which is led and financed by New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg (I).

A political action committee, Americans for Responsible Solutions, was launched this week by former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords and has picked up seven-figure donations from major Democratic benefactors.

Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of Apple founder Steve Jobs, and Ron Conway, a leading Silicon Valley angel investor, are helping finance the Giffords group and will co-host a fundraiser in San Francisco this week, an organizer said. Two wealthy Texas lawyers, Steve and Amber Mostyn, told news outlets Wednesday that they had given $1 million to the organization. Giffords was shot in the head two years ago in a mass shooting outside a supermarket in Tucson.

“The real challenge that these organizations will have is how much money will they be able to raise in order to effectively communicate their side of the story,” said Ron Bonjean, a Republican strategist and former top congressional aide. “Those who are in favor of keeping the status quo have massive resources that can do the same thing.”

While groups such as the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence have long lobbied for stricter gun laws, last month’s massacre at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., has spurred many progressive organizations, millionaire donors and other activists to begin focusing on the issue.

White House working group

An administration working group led by Vice President Biden is preparing a set of gun-control proposals that could be announced by the end of this month, perhaps as part of Obama’s State of the Union address. Lawmakers say Congress could begin considering gun bills in two weeks.

Biden, after a meeting Wednesday with victims of gun violence and leaders of gun-safety organizations, vowed that the administration will take swift action.

“This is a problem that requires immediate attention,” Biden said. “I want to make clear that we’re not going to get caught up in the notion that, unless we can do everything, we’re going to do nothing.”

The White House is considering a wide range of legislative proposals, including a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines, as well as universal background checks on gun buyers. Biden also said Wednesday that Obama may take executive actions that sidestep Congress, although he did not provide details.

Biden’s comments sparked an immediate and sharp backlash from Republicans. “The Founding Fathers never envisioned Executive Orders being used to restrict our Constitutional rights,” Rep. Jeff Duncan (S.C.) said in a statement. “We live in a republic, not a dictatorship.”

Biden’s meetings with interest groups to build consensus will continue Thursday, when he will meet with representatives of the NRA and other gun-owner groups as well as a representative from Wal-Mart, one of the nation’s leading gun retailers. The NRA, which has signaled its opposition to any new gun regulations, has suggested placing armed guards at all of the nation’s schools in reaction to the Connecticut shootings.

‘Gun-violence prevention’

Earlier this week, senior White House aides organized a conference call with a roster of private foundations, some of which are funding polls, public ed­ucation campaigns and other anti-gun-violence­ initiatives.

One of the groups was the Chicago-based Joyce Foundation, a major funder of gun-control programs that counted Obama as a board member from 1994 to 2002. Nina Vinik, director of the foundation’s anti-gun-violence initiative, said research suggests that the public is poorly informed about current gun laws.

“Most people assume that our gun laws are in fact much more expansive and stronger than in fact they are,” Vinik said.

Some of the groups plan to use television and newspaper advertisements to paint laws restricting guns as a mainstream, common-sense idea. Some advocates have also stopped calling their efforts “gun control,” preferring “gun-violence prevention” instead.

One objective is to drive a wedge between the NRA’s policy agenda and the views of a majority of its members, activists said. Mayors Against Illegal Guns commissioned a study last year by Republican pollster Frank Luntz that found that 74 percent of NRA members support requiring criminal background checks for anyone purchasing a gun.

“This isn’t a battle about going dollar for dollar with the NRA,” said Winnie Stachelberg, executive vice president at the Center for American Progress. “It’s about drawing attention to the fact that the NRA officials and lobbyists and the NRA membership are in completely different places. Exposing that gap is a critical component of that effort.”

It is legal to carry an unloaded rifle

He was also carrying a Glock 19C pistol

Cindy Yorgason has been amazed at the attention her Facebook posting has received

RIVERDALE, Utah (AP) — Hours after President Obama called on Congress to ban assault weapons, one man's protest raised some eyebrows at a Utah store.

An Ogden woman snapped a few photos of a man standing inside a J.C. Penney on Wednesday with a big gun slung over his shoulder.

Cindy Yorgason said that even for a firearm-friendly state like Utah, it was out of the ordinary.

""I've seen someone carrying on their hip or leg, but I have never seen anyone openly carrying an assault rifle,"" she said.

Yorgason took two photos of the man and posted them on Facebook, where they received hundreds of comments and have since been shared more than a thousand times. She said she's ""incredibly amazed"" at the attention the images received.

She wasn't alarmed when she spotted him with the weapon but Yorgason thinks the man took it too far while trying to make a statement.

""I just think it's inappropriate,"" she said.

The man, identified as Joseph Kelley, 22, told The Salt Lake Tribune he wanted to demonstrate that the weapons aren't dangerous when handled by law-abiding citizens.

Kelley said he's a former member of the military and alerted police in advance that he would be carrying the weapon, which he identified as an unloaded AR-15.

Kelley was also carrying a Glock 19C on his hip.

He said he received positive reactions from people who spotted him.

Attempts by the Associated Press to reach Kelley were unsuccessful.

Local law enforcement authorities said they didn't receive any calls related to the incident or any notice from Kelley, Riverdale City Police Lt. James Ebert said.

But if the gun is unloaded, ""then you're well within your rights to carry a firearm,"" Ebert said."

Pat Quinn said today that cities and towns across Illinois should have the power to impose their own restrictions on any legislation lawmakers end up approving to allow citizens to carry guns in public.



Quinn's comments come as lawmakers face a June 9 deadline to craft a concealed carry bill after a federal appeals court ruled in December that Illinois' longtime ban was unconstitutional.



The Democratic governor has long been opposed to letting people carry handguns outside the home, but said the state must begrudgingly comply with the court's order. But Quinn argues there's room to put in place tough restrictions, including allowing cities such as Chicago to implement strict regulations that go beyond what lawmakers may put in place.



""I am not excited about this at all,"" Quinn said about implementing concealed carry. ""If this has to happen, it has to have the proper restrictions and limitations... I think we should make sure it's very tight and I think local communities, wherever they are, should have the option to make it as tight as possible in their community.""



The idea highlights the geographical divide that largely drives the gun control debate in Illinois. Chicago legislators point to the city's violence in calling for tight restrictions while lawmakers from downstate argue tough rules have done little to prevent crime.



Quinn also has called for banning guns in certain places such as sports stadiums, government buildings, shopping malls and churches. He also supports a ban on assault weapons and high capacity magazines.



Quinn's comments came during an appearance with a group of Chicago clergy members who echoed the governor's call for tough gun control measures"

Rocker Ted Nugent, who made fiery comments about the Obama administration last year, will be attending the State of the Union address on Tuesday as a guest of GOP Rep. Steve Stockman.

The Secret Service talked to Nugent last year after the musician, a long-time NRA board member, criticized President Obama and the Supreme Court at the National Rifle Association meeting in St. Louis.

Nugent, who supported Republican Mitt Romney for president, said if Obama won re-election, ""I will either be dead or in jail by this time next year.""

The rocker, best known for his hit 1970s hit Cat Scratch Fever, said he never threatened Obama and described his Secret Service sit-down as a ""good, solid, professional meeting.""

Stockman's office will be scheduling interviews for Nugent after Obama's remarks to a joint session of Congress. Each rank-and-file member of Congress is entitled to invite one guest to these joint sessions.

""I am excited to have a patriot like Ted Nugent joining me in the House chamber to hear from President Obama,"" said Stockman, R-Texas. ""After the address, I'm sure Ted will have plenty to say.""

Stockman, who returned to Congress in January after a 16-year hiatus, garnered headlines by threatening to impeach Obama if he used executive privilege to push gun-control legislation. Obama has proposed several measures, including a new assault weapons ban, a limit on the capacity of ammunition clips, and universal background checks.

The gun legislation faces fierce resistance from Republicans in Congress. Stockman, who backed off the impeachment threat, recently introduced legislation to repeal zero-tolerance laws for guns in school zones.

(CNN) – The No. 2 Democrat in the Senate criticized the National Rifle Association for cheering the defeat of a recent bipartisan gun control measure and expressed hope that the “political sentiment” will change in the upper chamber so the legislation can be brought up again.

“The National Rifle Association can go to Texas and celebrate defeating that measure, but they certainly shouldn’t celebrate when they look at the carnage that takes place virtually every day in America because convicted felons have guns,” Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union.”



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker'] [twitter-follow screen_name='KilloughCNN']

He was referring to the organization’s annual meeting this weekend in Houston, where the recent gun control debate was a key theme among speeches by high-profile conservatives. Speakers praised the audience for lobbying their lawmakers to vote against gun control measures and encouraged them to keep up the fight.

""We are in the midst of a once-in-a-generation fight for everything we care about. We have a chance to secure our freedom for a generation, or to lose it forever,"" NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre said Saturday.

""We must remain vigilant, ever resolute, and steadfastly growing and preparing for the even more critical battles that loom before us,"" he said.

One of the main provisions considered the most likely to pass would have expanded the background check system to include private sales at gun shows and online. In the April 17 vote, however, the Senate fell short of the 60 votes needed to move forward with the measure. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid shelved the overall gun control bill to allow more time for negotiations and vowed to bring it up again.

The defeat was seen as a major victory among anti-gun control advocates and among those in the gun lobby, who argued that the measure would not have done much to help prevent mass shootings like those seen in Newtown, Connecticut, and Aurora, Colorado, last year.

Durbin, the Senate’s majority whip, said the legislation needs five more votes in order to pass but said it can be an uphill battle in the Senate.

""What we need to see is a change in political sentiment within the Senate. We need to pick up five more votes, and that's quite a task, I might add, as whip in the Senate, but we can do this. I hope the American people don't give up. I know the president hasn't given up,"" Durbin told CNN's chief political correspondent Candy Crowley.

The combatants in the political debate over gun violence have a new issue: the White House photo of President Obama skeet shooting.

""One picture does not erase a lifetime of supporting every gun ban and every gun-control scheme imaginable,"" said a statement from Andrew Arulanandam, spokesman for the National Rifle Association.

NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre dismissed the photo on Fox News Sunday, saying Obama's call for universal background checks will lead to a national registry of guns. LaPierre said, ""I don't think you can trust these people.""

Senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer tweeted out the photo Saturday, responding to those who questioned Obama's statement that he had shot skeet at Camp David. Pfeiffer wrote, ""For all the 'skeeters:' POTUS shoots clay targets on the range at Camp David on Aug. 4, 2012.""

David Plouffe, a longtime adviser to the president, taunted the president's critics on Twitter. After the photoshop release, Plouffe wrote, ""Attn skeet birthers. Make our day - let the photoshop conspiracies begin!""

Later, Plouffe tweeted, ""Day made. The skeet birthers are out in full force in response to POTUS pic. Makes for most excellent, delusional reading.""

The issue initially surfaced a week ago during an interview with The New Republic:

""The New Republic: Have you ever fired a gun?

""Obama: Yes, in fact, up at Camp David, we do skeet shooting all the time.

""The New Republic: The whole family?

""Obama: Not the girls, but oftentimes guests of mine go up there. And I have a profound respect for the traditions of hunting that trace back in this country for generations. And I think those who dismiss that out of hand make a big mistake.

""Part of being able to move this forward is understanding the reality of guns in urban areas are very different from the realities of guns in rural areas. And if you grew up and your dad gave you a hunting rifle when you were ten, and you went out and spent the day with him and your uncles, and that became part of your family's traditions, you can see why you'd be pretty protective of that.

""So it's trying to bridge those gaps that I think is going to be part of the biggest task over the next several months. And that means that advocates of gun control have to do a little more listening than they do sometimes."""

""We do not want drones in town,"" Phillip Steel, the Deer Trail, Colo., resident who drafted the ordinance, told Denver's ABC 7 affiliate. ""They fly in town, they get shot down.""

Steel's proposal, recently submitted to the town board, calls for $25 drone hunting licenses, and outlines ""rules of engagement"" for hunters looking to shoot down the unmanned aerial devices:

The Town of Deer Trail shall issue a reward of $100 to any shooter who presents a valid hunting license and the following identifiable parts of an unmanned aerial vehicle whose markings and configuration are consistent with those used on any similar craft known to be owned or operated by the United States federal government.

Steel said that while he's never seen a drone flying in Deer Trail, the ordinance is a ""symbolic"" one.

""Basically, I do not believe in the idea of a surveillance society and I believe we are headed that way,"" he said.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Deer Trail's population was 559 in 2011.

""They'll sell like hot cakes,"" Steel said of the proposed drone licenses. ""It could be a huge moneymaker for the town.""

David Boyd, one of the Deer Field's seven board members, supports the drone ordinance.

""Even if a tiny percentage of people get online (for a) drone license, that's cool,"" Boyd said. That's a lot of money to a small town like us. Could be known for it as well, which probably might be a mixed blessing, but what the heck.""

Disappointed with New York State lawmakers and other jurisdictions around the country who have passed strict gun control legislation, the companies–composed of firearm manufacturers, gunsmiths, and sporting goods retailers–have announced these policies in the past week.

Their various statements emphasize that such laws create a class of government employees with rights and and a class of citizens without rights. Thus, they refuse to aid the enforcement of such inequality.

The announcements read:

Effective today, in an effort to see that no legal mistakes are made by LaRue Tactical and/or its employees, we will apply all current State and Local Laws (as applied to civilians) to state and local law enforcement / government agencies. In other words, LaRue Tactical will limit all sales to what law-abiding citizens residing in their districts can purchase or possess.

Due the passing of this legislation, Olympic Arms would like to announce that the State of New York, any Law Enforcement Departments, Law Enforcement Officers, First Responders within the State of New York, or any New York State government entity or employee of such an entity – will no longer be served as customers. In short, Olympic Arms will no longer be doing business with the State of New York or any governmental entity or employee of such governmental entity within the State of New York – henceforth and until such legislation is repealed, and an apology made to the good people of the State of New York and the American people.

The Federal Government and several states have enacted gun control laws that restrict the public from owning and possessing certain types of firearms. Law-enforcement agencies are typically exempt from these restrictions. EFI, LLC does not recognize law-enforcement exemptions to local, state, and federal gun control laws. If a product that we manufacture is not legal for a private citizen to own in a jurisdiction, we will not sell that product to a law-enforcement agency in that jurisdiction.

We will not sell arms to agents of the state of New York that hold themselves to be “more equal” than their citizens. As long as the legislators of New York think they have the power to limit the rights of their citizens, in defiance of the Constitution, we at Templar will not sell them firearms to enforce their edicts. Templar Custom is announcing that the State of New York, any Law Enforcement Departments, Law Enforcement Officers, First Responders within the State of New York, or any New York State government entity or employee will no longer be served as customers.

Based on the recent legislation in New York, we are prohibited from selling rifles and receivers to residents of New York. We have chosen to extend that prohibition to all governmental agencies associated with or located within New York. As a result we have halted sales of rifles, short barreled rifles, short barreled shotguns, machine guns, and silencers to New York governmental agencies.

Recently, companies such as LaRue Tactical and Olympic Arms have announced that they will no longer sell prohibited items to government agencies and personnel in states that deny the right to own those items to civilians. It has been and will continue to be Cheaper Than Dirt’s policy to not to sell prohibited items to government agencies and/or agents in states, counties, cities, and municipalities that have enacted restrictive gun control laws against their citizens. We support and encourage other companies that share in this policy.

Second Amendment activist groups Guns Save Life and Grass Roots North Carolina are currently urging big gun manufacturers Sig Sauer, Smith and Wesson, and Glock to halt their sales to government agencies within states that have clamped down on their residents’ right to bear arms."
http://news.yahoo.com/obama-offers-gun-control-steps-135409085--politics.html,,[],Obama offers new gun control steps,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Striving to take action where Congress would not, the Obama administration announced new steps Thursday on gun control, curbing the import of military surplus weapons and proposing to close a little-known loophole that lets felons and others circumvent background checks by registering guns to corporations.

Four months after a gun control drive collapsed spectacularly in the Senate, President Barack Obama added two more executive actions to a list of 23 steps the White House determined Obama could take on his own to reduce gun violence. With the political world focused on Mideast tensions and looming fiscal battles, the move signaled Obama's intent to show he hasn't lost sight of the cause he took up after 20 first graders and six adults were gunned down last year in an elementary school in Newtown, Conn.

Vice President Joe Biden, Obama's point-man on gun control after the Newtown tragedy thrust guns into the national spotlight, unveiled the new actions Thursday at the White House.

""It's simple, it's straightforward, it's common sense,"" Biden said in the Roosevelt Room.

One new policy will end a government practice that lets military weapons, sold or donated by the U.S. to allies, be reimported into the U.S. by private entities, where some may end up on the streets. The White House said the U.S. has approved 250,000 of those guns to be reimported since 2005; under the new policy, only museums and a few other entities like the government will be eligible to reimport military-grade firearms.

The Obama administration is also proposing a federal rule to stop those who would be ineligible to pass a background check from skirting the law by registering certain guns, like machine guns and short-barreled shotguns, to a corporation or trust. The new rule would require people associated with those entities, like beneficiaries and trustees, to undergo the same type of fingerprint-based background checks as individuals if they want to register those types of guns.

Story continues

""It's a very artful dodge to get around people who are not capable, constitutionally or legally, of owning a weapon,"" Biden said.

The National Rifle Association dismissed the administration's moves as misdirected, arguing that background checks for corporations and a ban on reimporting outdated guns wouldn't keep criminals from getting weapons.

""The Obama administration has once again completely missed the mark when it comes to stopping violent crime,"" said NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam. ""This administration should get serious about prosecuting violent criminals who misuse guns and stop focusing its efforts on law-abiding gun owners.""

Joined by Attorney General Eric Holder, Biden formally unveiled the new measures Thursday while swearing in Todd Jones, whose confirmation to head the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives after six years of political wrangling to fill that position was another of Obama's post-Newtown priorities. A Senate deal to approve the president's pending nominations after Democrats threatened to change Senate rules cleared the way for Jones' confirmation last month.

Still out of reach for Obama were the steps that gun control advocates and the administration's own review say could most effectively combat gun violence in the U.S., like an assault weapons ban and fewer exceptions for background checks for individual sales. Only Congress can act on those fronts.

There is scant evidence that support for gun control legislation has grown substantially since April, when efforts died in the Senate amid staunch opposition from the NRA and most Republican senators.

""Sooner or later, we are going to get this right,"" Obama said that day in the White House Rose Garden, with the families of Newtown victims and former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords — herself a victim of a gunman — at his side. ""The memories of these children demand it, and so do the American people,"" the president said at the time.

In the months following the Senate vote, Biden has claimed that at a handful of lawmakers who opposed expanded background checks have told him privately they've changed their minds and want another chance. But Biden and White House officials have not named any of those lawmakers.

Renewing his pledge to keep working for legislative fixed, Biden suggested that one opportunity for improving prospects for gun control may come next year in the midterm elections. Liberal groups and those supporting gun control have vowed to hold accountable in 2014 those lawmakers who voted against gun control.

""If Congress won't act, we'll fight for a new Congress,"" Biden said. ""It's that simple. But we're going to get this done.""

These days, Obama and Biden mention gun control with far less regularity than when it appeared the Senate was poised to take action, although Obama did meet Tuesday with 18 city mayors to discuss ways to contain youth violence. And with immigration and pressing fiscal issues dominating Congress' agenda, the prospects for reviving gun legislation appear negligible.

With Jones' confirmation at ATF, the White House has completed or made significant progress on all but one of the 23 executive actions Obama had previously ordered in January, the White House said. Still lingering is an effort to finalize regulations to require insurers to cover mental health at parity with medical benefits, although the White House said that it is committed to making that happen by the end of 2013.

The new rules for guns registered to corporations will follow the traditional regulatory process, with a 90-day comment period before ATF reviews suggestions and finalizes the rule. It would only apply to certain types of guns that must be federally registered. Last year, ATF received 39,000 requests to register guns to corporations and trusts.

Merkle, a high school sophomore from Maryland, spoke out against gun control laws in front of the Maryland State Legislature in March, Today.com notes. In a concise, 3-minute argument, Merkle said the proposed legislation would not prevent violence.

“Ever since I first learned how to shoot, the issue with gun violence around the nation became clear — guns are not the problem, people are,"" Merkle told the lawmakers. “Purging our society of violence and murder cannot be done by gun control legislation.""

The teen, who is secretary of the Maryland Rifle Club and a life-long sport shooter, also said ""guns are not needed for mass murder, and robbing American citizens over rights to own them won’t solve anything.""

Merkle added that the proposed laws would stop her from attending college on a shooting scholarship.

While Merkle's testimony will probably not influence Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley, who is expected to soon sign the gun measure into law, it has made her a budding star among conservative bloggers and gun rights advocates.

A YouTube video of the teen's testimony has racked up more than 2.5 million views in the ensuing weeks. The clip also has garnered 16,000-plus comments.

On Sunday, Merkle told the Washington Times that she was glad her video was getting attention, if only to bring more awareness to the issue.

“The biggest part of this is that the pro-gun, Second Amendment argument is getting publicity,” Merkle said. “I like that it actually got out there, and not just because it’s me, but because it’s the argument.”

On Tuesday, Merkle also made an appearance on Fox News program ""Hannity."" Host Sean Hannity praised Merkle for understanding that gun control wouldn't have prevented the Sandy Hook tragedy.

""Here you are, 15-years-old, you get that,"" he said, asking why did she think the massacre was being ""used as an issue to control people's guns.""

""I don't understand what they're doing, they are criminalizing law abiding citizens,"" Merkle replied.

She also told him that she thought the AR-15 rifle -- the weapon used by Newtown shooter Adam Lanza -- is actually one of the most effective weapons for self-defense. The AR-15 is much more accurate, and much easier to fire, Merkle said, especially for children or people with smaller frames.

Merkle told the Washington Times that her high profile comments have also attracted some less-than-positive feedback, including pretty nasty threats, but she said she remains committed to the cause.

""I’m not going to stop fighting on this just because some people disagree with me,"" she said."

As NY governor Cuomo put it, “Confiscation could be an option"". Also, with the passage of the NY law, citizens were expected to turn in or destroy magazines that were suddenly illegal. With this remark, the genie left the bottle and it is going to be very difficult to get it back in. This brings us to the problem with Universal Background Checks. The idea behind it being that every gun transfer, with few exceptions, requires a background check to be performed. The idea is obviously an attempt to close what is commonly called, ""the gun show loophole"", or more formally referred to as face to face transfers. On the surface, this doesn't seem like a bad idea and may indeed prevent some who should not be allowed access to guns from getting them and may also lead to the arrest and prosecution of some criminals who try. The problem, as with most things, is that the Devil is in the details. The most fundamental problem with this proposal is that criminals will continue to ignore it and will still engage in black market transactions. With approximately millions of guns already in circulation it is easy to see why even in the light of a requirement for background checks that a thriving black market will remain.

In light of the realization of the power possessed by the black markets, how is society to enforce or otherwise make full use of a requirement for Universal Background Checks. The unfortunately truth is that in the absence of Universal Gun Registration that a Universal Background Check is all but meaningless. This can't be overemphasized, so let’s repeat it. In order for a UBC to have any meaning, it requires gun registration and this is a problem. It is a problem because, as the gun community correctly argues, registration leads to confiscation. There is only one reason for the government or law enforcement to know who has what guns. That they can take them when it has been decided that Joe and Jane Citizen are no longer allowed to have a particular gun and to prevent Joe or Jane from refusing to comply with the forced ban. As I mentioned above, thanks to governor Cuomo, this genie is no longer in its bottle.

I am a member of the online gun forum, defensivecarry.com. One member of that forum, who goes by the name Hot Guns, claims to be a licensed gun dealer with an FFL. Hot Guns recently reported that a while back he was subjected to an audit by the BATFE. Regulations require him to keep copies of the Federal Form 4473 for each firearm purchase; in fact this form is required for each inquiry into the NICS background check system. Supposedly the NICS records are purged after a period of three months. Even though these records are supposed to be purged, the auditor had copies of the records going back at least one year and demanded to see the corresponding 4473 forms. When Hot Guns questioned how and why they were inquiring for these records as they were supposed to have been purged, he received the response from the auditor, ""That is what we are supposed to say."" In other words, the records are not purged and the government is using the form 4473 as a backdoor form of registration. Apparently this is proving insufficient and some desire to use the recent tragedy to bring registration to the forefront.

For me, this represents a turning point. Clearly the objective is registration and this cannot be allowed to happen. I think it has already gone too far. As Universal Background Checks are meaningless without formal registration, and I am opposed to registration, I can therefore no longer support the idea of Universal Background Checks."

Rep. Steve Stockman, a Republican from the Houston area, called Obama's plans to skirt Congress and implement some controls administratively ""an unconstitutional and unconscionable attack on the very founding principles of this republic."" He also threatened to defund the White House.

""I will seek to thwart this action by any means necessary, including but not limited to eliminating funding for implementation, defunding the White House, and even filing articles of impeachment,"" Stockman said.

Meese, who was the nation's top law enforcement officer in the Reagan administration, told Newsmax Stockman would have support for such a move - and a good case.

“It would not be legal. It would not be constitutional,” Meese said. “And, indeed, if he tried to override the Second Amendment in any way, I believe it would be an impeachable offense.

“An executive order without specific congressional authority can only apply to those portions of the government that are under his control — in their words, the executive branch. Now, there are some things he can probably do in regard to the actions of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, or some other governmental agency in its operations.



“But to impose burdens or regulations that affect society generally, he would have to have Congressional authorization,” Meese added.

Obama said at a press conference Monday that tracking data on guns that criminals use could be one item done administratively that would not have to go through Congress. Democrats have been calling for new gun control measures since the school massacre in Newtown, Conn.

""I think that those of us who look at this problem have repeatedly said that responsible gun owners, people who have a gun for protection, for hunting, for sportsmanship, they don't have anything to worry about,"" Obama said.

But Stockman said any such move requires legislative action.

""Any proposal to abuse executive power and infringe upon gun rights must be repelled with the stiffest legislative force possible,"" he said. ""Under no circumstances whatsoever may the government take any action that disarms any peaceable person — much less without due process through an executive declaration without a vote of Congress or a ruling of a court.""

Modern day U.S. presidents including George H.W. Bush have used executive action for gun laws.

Obama says his legislation will be crafted from suggestions gathered by a White House task force led by Vice President Biden. He and Cabinet members such as Attorney General Eric Holder spoke with a cross-section of groups and individuals since the fatal shooting, including shooting victims, gun rights advocacy groups, gun control groups, governors and executives from the video-gaming industry."

President Obama is pushing Congress to draft gun legislation

Correction: A previous version of this story misidentified the press secretary for Sen. Mark Pryor. Her name is Lucy Speed, not Sara Lasure. Also, six people died in the Minneapolis sign store shooting last fall -- the original story had a preliminary death toll.

WASHINGTON -- Republicans in Congress are much better armed than their Democratic counterparts — a fact that helps explain the deep partisan divide as Congress gears up for its first major votes on gun control in a decade.

One hundred nineteen Republicans and 46 Democrats declared themselves as gun owners in a USA TODAY survey of lawmakers.

There is no uniform public record of gun ownership by members of Congress, and it is not part of the information lawmakers are required to reveal in their annual financial disclosure forms. So USA TODAY and the Gannett Washington Bureau contacted every congressional office to ask: Does the lawmaker own a gun?

The results show a partisan — and regional — divide. Only 10% of Republicans who responded said they do not own a gun, while 66% of Democrats said they are not gun owners.

Michael Hammond, legislative counsel of Gun Owners of America, said he's not surprised. In Republican districts, a gun ""is a campaign accoutrement,"" he said.

Plotted on a map, the survey results speak to the cultural chasm between those districts where guns are a talisman of individualism and those where guns are viewed more as a criminal tool. Only 12 lawmakers from the Northeast, including Pennsylvania, said they own firearms, while 77 Southerners said they do.

Congress' gun gap suggests that cultural factors are at least as important as the influence of the gun lobby in determining where members stand on President Obama's package of gun control proposals.

The gun gap

Some members were more than willing to give an inventory of their gun lockers. Sen. Mark Pryor, D-Ark., owns three shotguns, three rifles and two pistols, press secretary Lucy Speed said. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, owns a dozen, but her favorite is a 20-gauge Ruger, communications director Matthew Felling said.

Others — overwhelmingly Southern Republicans — declined to answer, even suggesting it was ""irresponsible"" for reporters to ask the question.

Again there is a partisan split: 36 Republicans in the House refused to say whether they own guns; 11 Democrats refused to say. Across both the House and Senate, an additional 161 lawmakers did not return repeated phone calls, e-mails and requests for comment — 97 of those were Republicans.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., said he owns guns, though he wouldn't say what kind. His Republican counterpart, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, declined to say whether he does. In the House, Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said she does not own a gun, and Speaker John Boehner's office did not respond to multiple requests.

The White House has released photos of Obama shooting skeet but asked by reporters Monday whether Obama owns a gun, spokesman Jay Carney said ""not that I am aware of.""

Obama is pushing Congress to reinstate a ban on assault weapons, expand background checks for gun purchases and adopt other measures to curb gun violence. Any new gun legislation in Congress would have to pass through the Judiciary Committee in each chamber. Eight of 23 Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee confirmed they are gun owners, but only one of the panel's 17 Democrats admitted having a gun — Rep. Steve Cohen of Tennessee.

On the Senate committee -- which is drafting gun legislation -- Chairman Patrick Leahy of Vermont and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island were the only two Democrats who said they own firearms, while six of the eight Republicans on the committee said they do.

Gun ownership is clearly correlated with members' political positions. Over the last two years, the National Rifle Association's political action committee gave 10 times more contributions to House members who own guns than to those who don't, according to an analysis of campaign finance reports filed last week. And members who owned guns were eight times more likely to get an ""A"" rating from the NRA than those who did not.

You don't say

For some members, their gun ownership is a point of pride. Rep. Phil Gingrey, R-Ga., provided a list of weapons he owns, and his spokeswoman followed up a few days later to note the congressman had also just bought ""a third-generation Glock G27"" handgun.

Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, who famously used a rifle to shoot a copy of an environmental bill in a 2010 campaign ad, seemed surprised by the question about his gun ownership, pointing out that he is from West Virginia. ""Why would anybody not own a gun?"" he asked.

At least a dozen members spoke of heirloom weapons, inherited from fathers, grandfathers and mothers, that are as much a part of the family as their name. Rep. John Barrow, D-Ga., in a television ad, proudly brandishes the Smith & Wesson his grandfather used to stop a lynching – but his office did not return phone calls to confirm his gun ownership. Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Pa., keeps a pistol and two rifles as mementos of his late father.

Asked about his gun ownership, Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, tells of his great-grandfather, a Swiss immigrant who, at age 80, ""went out into a duck blind on a frozen lake and he never came back.

""And they went out to find him at the end of the day, and he had died of a heart attack in the duck blind with his gun over his lap and with a smile on his face, which is part of the Portman family lore because he loved to hunt,"" Portman said. ""I have that gun. And my kids have shot that gun, so it's a tradition in our family.""

Portman said he's mostly concerned about the views of his constituents on gun rights — but said he couldn't deny that his own experience influences his votes.

For others, the question itself was an intrusion.

Rep. Andy Harris, a Maryland Republican, said, ""Given the security concerns for members of Congress and their families after the shooting of (former Arizona congresswoman) Gabrielle Giffords, it is irresponsible for members of the media to publish how members and their families protect themselves in public and at home.""

Rep. Tom Marino, R-Pa., through spokeswoman Sarah Wolf, provided a more succinct response: ""None of your damn business.""

Some lawmakers declined to respond to the survey even though they have already made public statements declaring themselves to be gun owners. Rep Lynn Westmoreland, R-Ga., would not respond to the survey, but his website says, ""I am a gun owner and avid hunter, and have consistently fought to protect the right to keep and bear arms.""

Rep. Sam Graves, a Missouri Republican who appears to be the only licensed gun dealer in the House, also declined to respond. Graves holds an active license for the Rockin H Gun Shop, which apparently has been in his family for some time, though there is no longer a shop affiliated with the name.

Hammond, the gun owner's group lobbyist, said he was surprised by the number of lawmakers who declined to talk about their guns. It suggests ""they feel that gun ownership is more sensitive than some of the other things they have to reveal,"" he said.

Members are allowed a few secrets.

Senate Sergeant at Arms Terrance Gainer, who previously served as chief of the Capitol Police, said lawmakers are ""permitted to have guns in their offices"" and would not have to tell anybody they had a gun.

""We discourage them,"" he said. ""I personally don't know of any member who is packing,"" he said.

In the public hallways of the Capitol, a lawmaker can carry a weapon only if it is ""unloaded and securely wrapped,"" Gainer said.

Outside the Capitol, members are governed by the gun laws of their states. Rep. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., ""travels with firearms while on official business in (his) district,"" chief of staff Doug Coutts said.

Reflecting the constituents

The responses suggest that gun ownership among lawmakers is on par with gun ownership nationwide. In a December 2012 USA TODAY/Gallup Poll, 43% of respondents said they have a gun in their home. In USA TODAY's lawmakers survey, 43% who responded said they were gun owners.

Hammond argued that gun ownership does not determine a lawmakers' vote on gun control. More likely, he said, the culture of the district they represent shapes their view of gun control and their decision to own a gun.

""Lots of Democrats live in urban areas like Chicago and New York where guns are all but banned,"" said Hammond, whose Gun Owners of America bills itself as ""the only no-compromise gun lobby in Washington.""

Those lawmakers ""don't have a lot of constituents who place a high value on the Second Amendment,"" and also ""don't have the personal experiences with guns that would lead them to see them as anything other than a dangerous nasty object,"" Hammond said.

Some gun owners in Congress support gun control. Rep. Keith Ellison, a Democrat from a Minnesota district where six people were killed in a sign-shop shooting last fall, said, ""I am a gun owner, and I believe in common-sense gun safety rules.""

But gun-control advocates say the USA TODAY survey shows how difficult it is for Republicans to endorse gun measures or to even publicly declare that they don't own guns. ""This has become a political totem — a badge of honor for many politicians,"" said Ladd Everitt, spokesman for the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence.

Gun ownership and the Second Amendment have become ""a symbol of a political identity: a rugged individualist who is willing to lay down the law when the government oversteps its bounds,"" with an emphasis on small government and personal freedom, Everitt said.

For Republicans in conservative, rural districts, he said, ""the reality of whether they own a gun may be butting up against the image they want to project.""

They're hard to aim, they're difficult to use. But shotguns, well, that's a different story.

During a Facebook Town Hall hosted by Parents magazine, Biden took a handful of questions from readers about gun violence. One questioner named Kate asked how gun owners would be able to sufficiently protect themselves if Congress passed a bill banning certain weapons and high-capacity gun magazines.

""Kate, if you want to protect yourself, get a double barreled shotgun,"" Biden responded. ""I promise you, as I told my wife, we live in an area that's wooded and somewhat secluded. I said, Jill, if there's ever a problem, just walk out on the balcony here, walk out, put [up] that double barreled shotgun and fire two blasts outside the house.""

The vice president said that by firing two shotgun blasts, anyone who might be trying to break in would be scared off.

""You don't need an AR-15,"" he said. ""Buy a shotgun! Buy a shotgun!""

Biden fielded a handful of other questions about gun reform proposals. He said he doesn't support making changes to the Second Amendment and described America's ""really healthy gun culture,"" which was a ""part of my father's ethic."" He clarified to another questioner that nobody wants to take away people's guns.

""I have two shotguns at home,"" he said. ""No one is going to come and take my guns.""

Biden appeared to get testy in some moments. When one person suggested that gun reforms would infringe on people's constitutional rights, Biden began his response by muttering, ""How can I say this politely?""

He also described his younger days of shotgun use, which were around the same time he was driving around in his cherished 1967 Corvette.

""Still have it,"" Biden said."
http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2013/07/us/jefferson-rorschach-guns/index.html,,[],Jefferson: The face of the modern gun debate,"(CNN) -- Thomas Jefferson may not have penned the Second Amendment, but the paradoxical Founding Father comes galloping into the present whenever there's a gun debate. Quotes attributed to him and tied to the right to bear arms litter the social sphere. But how did a man 200-plus years past his prime become today's gun-debate darling?

""Jefferson becomes this great political Rorschach in which people pour into him different things,"" says Saul Cornell, a professor at Fordham University who studies early American political and constitutional thought.

People read into the inkblots of antiquity, molding Jefferson into who they want him to be on the subject of guns.

""Basically, what the Internet has done is democratized or Starbucks-ified discussions of the Founding Fathers. Everyone can talk about them without actually knowing anything about them,"" Cornell says.

It's the Wikipedification of knowledge, and it doesn't matter if it's true.

Real or fake, the Internet has spoken; it's loudest after tragedies like Aurora and Newtown. Read these Jeffersonian quotes fueling the debate. What do they say to you?"

His voice wavering, Mark Mattioli wiped away tears as he recalled the day his 6-year-old son died when a man wielding an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle broke into Sandy Hook Elementary School and began shooting.

His son, James, was among the 20 children and seven adults killed by Adam Lanza on December 14 in Newtown, Connecticut – an event so horrific that it has since spawned a federal task force and kick-started a national conversation about gun control.

But unlike the handful of other parents who testified Monday at the emotionally charged hearing in Hartford, Connecticut, Mattioli said there are more than enough gun laws on the books. He called instead for a closer look at mental health policies.

Why new laws could miss America’s bigger gun problem

“I don’t care if you named it ‘James’ law,’ I don’t want (another law),” he said during the first of a series of meetings set up by a legislative task force assigned to review the state’s gun laws.

“I think there’s much more promise for a solution in identifying, researching and creating solutions along the lines of mental health.”

Connecticut’s medical examiner said he was told that Lanza, 20, had Asperger’s syndrome. Research has not shown a link between that condition and violence.

The hearing drew hundreds to the Connecticut state house and revealed the sharp divide in public opinion over what should happen next in the massacre’s aftermath.

“The time is now,” said Veronique Pozner, whose son, Noah, was also killed, referring to a strengthening of the nation’s gun laws.

Sandy Hook probe to extend until summer

With a framed photo of her slain 6-year-old propped up beside her, Pozner called on Connecticut to become “an agent for change” across the country.

During her testimony, she held up a crayon drawing that Noah once scrawled on Thanksgiving.

“I am thankful for the life I live,” he wrote.

At one point during the hearing, Neil Heslin, father of a 6-year-old boy named Jesse who was also gunned down that day, asked why the public needed assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.

Some people in the crowd then interrupted his statement and shouted the “Second Amendment shall not be infringed.”

“We’re not living in the Wild West. We’re not a Third World nation,” Heslin continued. “We have the strongest military in the world. We don’t need to defend our homes with weapons like that.”

Connecticut already has some of the nation’s strictest gun laws.

Gov. Dannel Malloy, a first-term Democrat, has also vowed to address the factors that led to last month’s massacre and set up a 16-member panel of experts to come up with recommendations. It includes experts who reviewed policies after mass shootings in Colorado and at Virginia Tech.

The panel must meet a March 15 deadline for its initial report, which Malloy is expected to use in drafting initiatives aimed at reducing gun violence.

Rep. Steve Stockman, a Republican from the Houston area, called Obama's plans to skirt Congress and implement some controls administratively ""an unconstitutional and unconscionable attack on the very founding principles of this republic."" He also threatened to defund the White House.

""I will seek to thwart this action by any means necessary, including but not limited to eliminating funding for implementation, defunding the White House, and even filing articles of impeachment,"" Stockman said.

Meese, who was the nation's top law enforcement officer in the Reagan administration, told Newsmax Stockman would have support for such a move - and a good case.

“It would not be legal. It would not be constitutional,” Meese said. “And, indeed, if he tried to override the Second Amendment in any way, I believe it would be an impeachable offense.

“An executive order without specific congressional authority can only apply to those portions of the government that are under his control — in their words, the executive branch. Now, there are some things he can probably do in regard to the actions of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, or some other governmental agency in its operations.



“But to impose burdens or regulations that affect society generally, he would have to have Congressional authorization,” Meese added.

Obama said at a press conference Monday that tracking data on guns that criminals use could be one item done administratively that would not have to go through Congress. Democrats have been calling for new gun control measures since the school massacre in Newtown, Conn.

""I think that those of us who look at this problem have repeatedly said that responsible gun owners, people who have a gun for protection, for hunting, for sportsmanship, they don't have anything to worry about,"" Obama said.

But Stockman said any such move requires legislative action.

""Any proposal to abuse executive power and infringe upon gun rights must be repelled with the stiffest legislative force possible,"" he said. ""Under no circumstances whatsoever may the government take any action that disarms any peaceable person — much less without due process through an executive declaration without a vote of Congress or a ruling of a court.""

Modern day U.S. presidents including George H.W. Bush have used executive action for gun laws.

Obama says his legislation will be crafted from suggestions gathered by a White House task force led by Vice President Biden. He and Cabinet members such as Attorney General Eric Holder spoke with a cross-section of groups and individuals since the fatal shooting, including shooting victims, gun rights advocacy groups, gun control groups, governors and executives from the video-gaming industry."

Larry Ward, chairman of Gun Appreciation Day, appeared on CNN Friday to defend the nationwide gun rally, which is scheduled for Jan. 19 -- just two days before Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Talking Points Memo notes.

Ward insists that Gun Appreciation Day, which calls on gun activists across the nation to rally in support of the right to bear arms and against President Barack Obama's “post-Sandy Hook assault on gun rights,"" actually ""honors the legacy of Dr. King.""

""We are looking for a peaceful protest,"" Ward said. Continuing, ""I think Martin Luther King, Jr. would agree with me if he were alive today that if African Americans had been given the right to keep and bear arms from day one of the country’s founding, perhaps slavery might not have been a chapter in our history.""

Maria Roach, founder of United for Change USA, an organization dedicated to prison reform and gun violence prevention, called Ward's comments simply ""ridiculous.""

""Slavery means that you are a possession,"" she said on CNN. ""Slaves were a possession, just like a gun."" She continued to criticize Ward for celebrating weapons just two days before celebrating the legacy of Martin Luther King, Jr., who was assassinated in 1968 by a single shot.

Think Progress' Aviva Shen notes the caveats in Ward's armed-slaves argument:

Ward also neglects to mention that in fact there were many armed uprisings by slaves, as early as 1526. Armed revolts almost always failed, and often led to retribution by the slave owners, who had the justice system on their side. Most famously, Nat Turner led a rebellion that resulted in 60 white deaths and 100 black deaths. The state later executed 56 blacks accused of being involved in the insurrection, and white mobs beat and killed at least 200 others in revenge.

Gun Appreciation Day, backed by a coalition of conservative groups, not only coincides with MLK Day, but also Obama's second inauguration.

Roach's United for Change USA has launched a petition to stop Gun Appreciation Day, according to ABC News. ""Gun groups are planning to have a National Gun Appreciation Day on January 19th, the same weekend that Americans celebrate the life and service of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., an American leader who was assassinated by a rifle's bullet,"" reads the petition. ""This is an outrage and a slap in the face to Americans who value life and freedom!""

As of Friday, the petition had garnered more than 26,000 of the 30,000 signatures needed on SignOn.org."
http://news.yahoo.com/nras-lapierre-wonk-million-dollar-megaphone-130419426--politics.html,,[],NRA's LaPierre: Wonk with million-dollar megaphone,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Wayne LaPierre would just as soon read a book as fire a gun.

That's right, the National Rifle Association's fire-breathing defender of gun rights is more academic than marksman.

""A policy wonk,"" says Joseph Tartaro, president of the pro-gun Second Amendment Foundation. ""He is more professorial than you would think.""

""Wayne is a Washington-type person,"" says John Aquilino, a former NRA spokesman who worked with LaPierre. ""He is best characterized as an absent-minded professor.""

A professor, that is, with a million-dollar megaphone and a well-honed ability to dish apocalyptic warnings about a tyrannical government angling to grab people's firearms.

""It's about banning your guns ... PERIOD!"" LaPierre wrote in a January email to the NRA's 4 million-plus members.

For decades, LaPierre, 63, has been serving up heated us-vs.-them rhetoric to rally the NRA faithful. Usually it works; sometimes it backfires.

There was his 1995 reference to federal law enforcement agents as ""jack-booted government thugs."" (He later apologized.)

And his 2000 declaration that President Bill Clinton was ""willing to accept a certain level of killing to further his political agenda."" (No apology.)

And his 2002 complaint that tougher airport screenings after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks signaled that ""I guess it's OK to wand-rape someone's daughter in public.""

A week after the December school shooting in Newtown, Conn., LaPierre gave a fiery speech calling for armed guards in every school. He blamed violence on a culture that celebrates gory video games and ""blood-soaked slasher films"" and rewards killers with fame.

""Gun nut!"" the New York Post screamed on its front page.

""The most revolting, tone-deaf statement I've ever seen,"" tweeted then-Rep. Chris Murphy, now a Democratic senator from Connecticut.

""Call me crazy,"" LaPierre retorted on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ''I think the American people think it's crazy not to do it,"" referring to armed school guards.

Story continues

In fact, a Washington Post/ABC News poll conducted in January found that 55 percent of Americans said they would support a law ""placing an armed guard in every school in the country.""

In the weeks since Newtown, LaPierre has been the ever-present public face of gun-rights forces, shuttling between speeches, hearing rooms and TV studios to forcefully reject proposals for tighter gun controls as misguided ideas that will do nothing to stop criminals and everything to tangle law-abiding citizens in a bureaucratic nightmare.

Jimmy Carter was president when LaPierre first went to work for the NRA in 1977, and for the past 22 years LaPierre has been the organization's executive vice president, steering it through a transformation from a clubby marksmanship group into a political movement adept at beating back efforts to tighten firearms regulations.

Along the way, says Josh Sugarman, head of the pro-gun-control Violence Policy Center, LaPierre's tenure has been marked by a willingness to push the envelope with over-the-top language that casts the government as the enemy and stokes ""fear-driven paranoia.""

LaPierre has been richly rewarded for his efforts: NRA tax returns show he earned $835,000 in salary and $126,000 in other compensation in 2010.

For all of LaPierre's tough talk, friends and former colleagues describe a soft-spoken man who's a little scattered.

Aquilino, the former NRA spokesman, remembers his former colleague oversleeping and missing a golf outing with Vice President Dan Quayle. Leaving a trail of dropped notebooks and papers on the path from his office to a cab. Sitting head in hands in an airport terminal, unable to remember what flight he was booked on.

Aquilino says he once asked LaPierre what he wanted to do eventually and was told, ""To tell the truth, I'd like to run an ice cream parlor in Maine.""

How does all of that square with LaPierre's combative reputation?

""It's all done on purpose,"" says Grover Norquist, an anti-tax crusader and member of the NRA's board. ""It's hard to say: 'The Second Amendment's in danger' and say it in a shy, soft-spoken way.""

Or, as LaPierre himself put it in a 2000 interview: ""When I used less strong words for the last three years, everyone dozed off.""

No one snoozed in 1995 when LaPierre signed an NRA fundraising letter that accused the Clinton administration of empowering police to ""murder law-abiding citizens"" at will and described the ban on semi-automatic weapons as a law giving ""jack-booted government thugs more power to take away our constitutional rights, break in our doors, seize our guns, destroy our property, and even injure or kill us.""

Even some NRA members were aghast. Former President George W. Bush very publicly quit the group. LaPierre at first defended the letter then offered a qualified apology.

He'd slipped over the line from hard-nosed to incendiary in an episode that will always brand him.

By those standards, his words have been generally more measured since. But when LaPierre speaks, those who watch him wonder what undercurrents he's tapping.

The NRA's website describes LaPierre as ""a skilled hunter, from Chesapeake waterfowl to African Cape buffalo."" Online, there are lots of suit-and-tie photos of LaPierre, and a couple of hunting shots, including a picture of him next to a downed buffalo in Botswana.

The NRA declined to make LaPierre available for an interview or to answer questions about him.

But former colleagues say LaPierre did not show great interest in shooting. And they're hard pressed to recall any LaPierre hobbies beyond devouring nonfiction. LaPierre is married but does not have children.

""There was an opportunity for him to learn about firearms, and he certainly knows about them,"" says Tanya Metaksa, who hired LaPierre at the NRA and later worked under him. ""But he's more the intellectual in his understanding of the history of the issue and the philosophical underpinnings of what it means to uphold the Second Amendment.""

LaPierre's path to the top of the NRA began with an interest in politics, not guns.

Richmond attorney Tom Lisk grew up across the street from LaPierre in Roanoke, Va., and remembers him as an avid bowler, passionate about hockey and politics. As a teenager, LaPierre would take his young neighbor along to the bowling alley on Saturday mornings, and he'd hang out at Lisk's house to talk government with Lisk's father, who was on the city council.

The NRA executive who's worked against many a Democratic presidential candidate over the years actually cut his teeth working for Democrat George McGovern's campaign in Roanoke back in 1972, when LaPierre was 22. LaPierre, who has a bachelor's degree from Siena College in Loudonville, N.Y., and a master's from Boston College, got a job early on as an aide to Vic Thomas, a pro-gun Democratic state legislator in Virginia. He worked on gun legislation for Thomas, and that led to his hiring by the NRA in 1978.

Lisk, whom LaPierre later recommended for an NRA job, remembers LaPierre as ""a person that people gravitated toward"" at the organization.

""Wayne wanted to be liked,"" says Lisk, noting that he'd send out for ice cream as the group's lobbyists met to decide which candidates would get campaign contributions.

Richard Feldman, who worked with LaPierre at the NRA but later had a falling out and now runs the Independent Firearm Owners Association, says LaPierre's success as a lobbyist came in part from never saying ""no"" to those he might need.

""Wayne's approach would be, 'That's a good idea. Yeah, I'm with you on that,'"" says Feldman. ""Meanwhile, he's doing everything around your back to kill it.""

After a surprisingly long run as the NRA's executive vice president, surviving insider plots along the way, LaPierre remains the hero to many a gun lover and villain to opponents.

The sharpened battle lines since Newtown have made it easier for LaPierre to pitch his uncompromising message that gun owners must band together to fight liberal elites out to take their firearms.

LaPierre has been here before.

When he went before the Senate Judiciary Committee last month, one of the questioners was Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., his longtime nemesis on the subject of banning assault weapons.

Feinstein welcomed the witnesses and made a point of saying, ""Even you, Mr. LaPierre. It's good to see you again. I guess we tangled, what was it, 18 years ago? You look pretty good, actually.""

An agreement would be a bold first step toward consideration of legislation to limit gun violence in the wake of the mass shootings at a Connecticut elementary school in December and comes as the Senate Judiciary Committee is expected this week to begin considering new proposals to limit gun violence.

The talks, led by two Democrats and two Republicans, are expected to earn more GOP support in the coming days and likely enough to move the bill through the Senate, according to senior aides of both parties who were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.

“These negotiations are challenging, as you’d expect on an issue as complicated as guns,” the chief negotiator, Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), said in a statement Saturday. “But all of the senators involved are approaching this in good faith. We are all serious about wanting to get something done, and we are going to keep trying.”

Resolution of whether to keep records of private sales is key to earning the support of one of the Republicans involved in the talks, Oklahoma Sen. Tom Coburn, who has a solid A-rating from the influential National Rifle Association and could provide political cover for lawmakers of both parties who are wary of supporting the plan.

Coburn has declined to comment on the talks, saying recently that “I don’t negotiate through the press.”

Democrats say that keeping records of private sales is necessary to enforce any new law and because current federal law requires licensed firearm dealers to keep records. Records of private sales also would help law enforcement trace back the history of a gun used in a crime, according to Democratic aides. Republicans, however, believe that records of private sales could put an undue burden on gun owners or could be perceived by gun rights advocates as a precursor to a national gun registry.

Coburn and Schumer are joined in their talks by Sens. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) and Mark Kirk (R-Ill.), while aides in both parties anticipate that Republican Sens. John McCain (Ariz.), Jeff Flake (Ariz.) and Susan Collins (Maine) could also endorse the plan soon. McCain and Collins have said they generally support legislation expanding background checks, while a Flake spokeswoman said Saturday that he is still reviewing the proposal.

More Republican support is anticipated in part because the four senators involved in the talks have agreed that any new background check program would exempt private transactions between family members or people who completed a background check in order to obtain a concealed-carry permit, according to aides.

But the four senators are grappling with how to make the process of obtaining a background check as seamless as possible for private dealers while also ensuring that someone keeps a record of the transaction.

Senators are considering whether to establish a new online portal where buyers and sellers could conduct the background check or to allow federally licensed gun retailers like Wal-Mart or Dick’s Sporting Goods to charge a small fee to conduct background checks for private dealers, aides said. A record of the sale then could be turned over to a licensed retailer, sent to the gun’s manufacturer or kept by the seller.

The background check proposal is considered the most politically viable plan among several introduced in the weeks since the Newtown, Conn., school shooting. Schumer is facing pressure from the White House and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) to draft a bill by this week in time for the committee to consider as early as Thursday, when the panel is scheduled to meet to review bills.

Aides expect that the committee will not pass a comprehensive bill, but instead will refer individual proposals to the full Senate. In addition to the background check bill, aides expect the panel to approve a bill that would make gun trafficking a federal crime for the first time. Less certain is the fate of bills limiting the size of ammunition magazines and a ban of military-style assault weapons; those measures face opposition from Republicans and some moderate Democrats.

During a town-hall meeting in Arizona last week, McCain bluntly told the mother of a victim of the Aurora, Colo., movie theater shooting that the assault weapons ban will not pass in the House or Senate “because a majority of members of Congress don’t support it.”

Meanwhile, House Republicans are beginning work on gun legislation even though GOP leaders have said the House would not touch the issue until after the Senate acted.

“We’re obviously interested in what the Senate does, but we are hard at work on this issue right now, studying information available,” House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) said in an interview with C-SPAN’s “Newsmakers” program airing Sunday that included questions from a Washington Post reporter.

Goodlatte added that any discussion of new gun laws should come only if the Obama administration steps up enforcement of current laws.

“There are laws on the books right now that prohibit the illegal sale of firearms to people who shouldn’t be buying them, people who shouldn’t be selling them, and they’re just not being enforced as well as they could be,” Goodlatte told C-SPAN. “It would save a lot of lives if they were.”

Proposal will still get a vote as an amendment

Ban was never considered likely to pass

Gun votes could begin in the Senate next month

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Tuesday he hopes to have a bill to address gun violence on the Senate floor soon after the Easter break, but confirmed that measure will not include the assault weapons ban.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., told reporters Tuesday she is disappointed that her assault weapons ban will not be part of a larger bill, but acknowledged it will likely make it easier to pass gun-related legislation through the Senate.

Feinstein said Reid told her Monday afternoon that the ban on certain types of military-style assault weapons and high-capacity magazines would not be part of package of bills that would make up the Senate legislation.

Reid, D-Nev., said Feinstein's measure simply did not have the support necessary to clear the floor and could not pass the 60-vote threshold needed in order to be considered by the full Senate.

""Right now, her amendment, using the most optimistic numbers, has less than 40 votes. That's not 60,"" he told reporters. ""I have to get something on the floor so we can have votes on that issue and the other issues.""

The Senate Judiciary Committee passed three other measures, in addition to the assault weapons ban, over the past two weeks that are expected to be considered in some form on the Senate floor.

These measures include bills to strengthen federal penalties for trafficking and straw purchases, improve school safety and require background checks for nearly every firearm purchase.

Feinstein's ban will be voted on as an amendment to the larger package.

""Obviously, I'm disappointed, because if was in the package, it would take 60 votes to get it out. You know, the enemies on this are very powerful. I've known that all my life,"" she said. As an amendment, it will require a majority of Senators to vote to add it to the bill.

Feinstein reintroduced the ban in January as a response to the mass shooting of 20 children and six adults at an elementary school Dec. 14 in Newtown, Conn.

While acknowledging her own bill would face an uphill climb as an amendment, she held out hope that a proposal by Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., to ban high-capacity magazines could be voted on as a separate amendment to the bill.

Even if the full Senate legislation does get through, Feinstein said, the fight is far from over.

""Then we face the wonderful House of Representatives,"" she said in a sarcastic reference to the Republican-controlled chamber.

It was unclear when the full package of bills will be released, but they are expected to be voted on as early as April.

The path in the House remains even murkier.

Asked Tuesday about the progress on the gun issue in the House, Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said, ""There's nothing new on that front right now.""

""We are hard at work looking at enforcement of current gun-control laws, but we are really focused on immigration right now,"" he said."
http://news.yahoo.com/california-governor-vetoes-several-tough-gun-control-bills-202721952.html,,[],California governor vetoes tough gun control bills,"By Sharon Bernstein SACRAMENTO, California (Reuters) - California Governor Jerry Brown vetoed several gun control bills on Friday, a move that essentially rebuffs an effort by fellow Democrats to enact a sweeping expansion of firearms regulation in the most populous U.S. state. Brown vetoed the strictest bill, which would have classified any rifle with a removable magazine as an assault weapon, calling it an ""infringement on gun owners' rights."" ""I don't believe that this bill's blanket ban on semi-automatic rifles would reduce criminal activity or enhance public safety enough to warrant this infringement on gun owners' rights,"" Brown said in his veto message. He also vetoed a measure that would have banned people from owning a gun for 10 years if they had been convicted of substance abuse violations or ordered to undergo outpatient mental health treatment. Brown did approve a measure to ban kits used to convert standard guns into semi-automatics with large capacity magazines, which he described as closing a loophole in existing state law. California's actions come amid national political lobbying around gun control, as lawmakers struggle to balance calls for more regulation following mass shootings against fear among gun rights supporters that their constitutional right to bear arms may be violated. State lawmakers sent 17 gun control measures to Brown's desk, in part because the U.S. Congress, mired in partisan bickering, failed to act after several high profile gun rampages last year, including a deadly Connecticut school shooting that killed 20 children and six adults in December. ""Large-capacity magazines have no place on our streets,"" said Assemblywoman Nancy Skinner, who represents Berkeley. ""We seized the opportunity to make California a model for common-sense gun violence prevention."" Chuck Michel, a Southern California attorney who advises the National Rifle Association on gun rights issues, said that with the exception of a bill phasing out the use of lead in ammunition used in hunting, Brown vetoed the measures that were of greatest concern to the NRA. ""I am pleased he's shown some respect for the rights of California gun owners and those who would choose to own a gun to defend their families,"" Michel said. Even so, the gun rights organization is concerned about several measures that Brown did sign, including the one banning conversion kits. ""He vetoed the worst of the worst,"" Michel said, ""But the rest are still bad."" In all, Brown signed 10 new gun control bills and vetoed seven. Those he signed included a measure to ban people from gun ownership for five years if they tell a licensed psychotherapist that they plan to shoot people. Another, by Republican Ted Gaines, would give mental health professionals 24 hours to report such threats. In addition to the semi-automatic weapons ban, bills vetoed included a measure that would have limited the ability of private parties to sell guns in the state, and one that would have allowed the city of Oakland to enact its own gun restrictions.

The Army Times, citing the Temple Daily Telegram, reports an attorney for U.S. Army Master Sgt. Christopher Grisham has filed a notice of his intent to appeal in a case that has attracted the interest of gun advocates nationwide.

The attorney, Blue Rannefeld, reportedly asserted in the motion that the prosecution's claims were not supported by the evidence.

KWTX-TV News reports jurors convicted Grisham – a soldier stationed at Ford Hood in Texas – on Nov. 20 of the class-B crime, which carries a fine not to exceed $2,000 and a jail sentence of not more than 180 days.

Grisham was arrested while hiking with his 15-year-old son, who was working on the requirements for a Boy Scout badge.

Grisham was carrying an AR-15 rifle and a concealed handgun, for which he had a permit. Texas law allows for rifles to be carried in public.

Someone reportedly called police expressing alarm over a man carrying a rifle along a road. Officer Steve Ermis responded and, according to court testimony, was initially concerned because he didn't know Grisham's intentions.

Rannefeld argued at trial that Grisham was carrying the rifle to protect against aggressive wild hogs. He reportedly said Ermis ""went above and beyond to control and intimidate,"" when he stopped the two.

Court documents say Grisham tried to prevent Ermis from taking his rifle and later resisted as the officer attempted to place Grisham's hands behind his back. Prosecutor John Gantt Jr. told jurors that Grisham refused to follow Ermis' orders.

Grisham's son used his cellphone to record the confrontation."

USA TODAY

The White House says President Obama is close to completing a series of executive actions to address gun violence, but they are not a substitute for congressional legislation.

In a report issued Tuesday, the administration has ""completed or made significant progress"" on 21 of 23 executive actions that Obama outlined Jan. 16 as part of a major gun-control initiative.

""But Congress must also act,"" the report says. ""Passing common-sense gun safety legislation, including expanding background checks and making gun trafficking a federal crime, remains the single most important step we could take to reduce gun violence.""

With Obama in Northern Ireland for the G-8 summit, Vice President Biden will discuss the report in a speech Tuesday afternoon.

The Senate blocked a background check bill in April, thanks mostly to the votes of Republicans. Obama administration officials and Senate Democrats are trying to revive the bill by pressuring senators who voted against it to reconsider.

Gun-control opponents say the proposals are ineffective, and undermine the Second Amendment rights to gun ownership.

The Obama administration began pushing for new gun legislation after the Dec. 14 shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., that killed 20 students and six educators.

The new White House report listed the executive actions on guns taken by the administration.

Among them: Ending a freeze on federal research into the causes of gun violence, reducing barriers that prevent states from submitting certain records to the existing background check system, and easing the ways in which federal law enforcement agencies can trace guns recovered in investigations.

The report did not mention two other legislative proposals backed by gun-control supporters: A new ban on assault weapons, and restrictions on the size of ammunition magazines. Neither proposal has sufficient support in Congress as of yet.

The White House report says the president's executive actions are designed to address several goals, including improvements to the existing background check system, law enforcement, and school safety, as well as promote responsible gun ownership."

The Center for American Progress is recommending 13 new gun policies to the White House — some of them executive actions that would not require the approval of Congress — in what amounts to the progressive community’s wish list.

CAP’s proposals — which include requiring universal background checks, banning military-grade assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines, and modernizing data systems to track gun sales and enforce existing laws — are all but certain to face stiff opposition from the National Rifle Association and its many allies in Congress.

Obama — as well as Vice President Biden, who is leading the administration’s gun violence task force — has voiced support for many of these measures. Yet it is unclear which policies he ultimately will propose to Congress. Biden is planning to present his group’s recommendations to Obama on Tuesday.

CAP’s recommendations, presented Friday to White House officials and detailed in an 11-page report obtained by The Washington Post, establish a benchmark for what many in Obama’s liberal base are urging him to do after last month’s massacre at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn.

But how well do you know the NRA's history and background? 1. Its first president might be better known for sideburns. Gen. Ambrose E. Burnside, formerly a gunsmith, bemoaned the Union's shooting inaccuracy and tactics in the Civil War. He became the NRA's first leader when it was founded in 1871 in New York with the goal to ""promote and encourage rifle shooting on a scientific basis.'' The word sideburns is a play on Burnside's last name, used to describe the hair on the side of his face that curled around to join his mustache. Library of Congress/AP Wait 1 second to continue.

“There’s nothing here that interferes with the rights of people to have a gun to protect themselves,” CAP President Neera Tanden said. But, she added, “we have daily episodes where it seems that guns are in the wrong hands, and that’s why we think it’s important that the president acts.”

On Monday, Tanden will moderate a public discussion with three Democrats who have played leading roles in the gun debate: Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who during the Clinton administration helped get the 1994 assault-weapons ban passed; Sen. Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.), who helped write that bill as a House member; and Rep. Mike Thompson (Calif.), who chairs the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force.

One of CAP’s suggestions to toughen federal regulation of gun sales is to make the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which is currently an agency within the Department of Justice, a unit of the FBI. CAP says absorbing the ATF into the FBI would better empower the ATF to combat gun crime and illegal trafficking.

“It is a beleaguered agency lacking leadership and resources,” said Winnie Stachelberg, senior vice president of CAP. “It needs to be a well-functioning federal law enforcement agency, and we need to figure out ways to ensure that happens.”

CAP’s top recommendation is to require criminal background checks for all gun sales, closing loopholes that currently enable an estimated 40 percent of sales to occur without any questions asked. The organization also wants to add convicted stalkers and suspected terrorists to the list of those barred from purchasing firearms.

CAP is urging the Obama administration to back Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s proposal to ban assault weapons. The California Democrat wants to prohibit the sale, transfer, importation and manufacture of military-style assault weapons and ammunition magazines that carry more than 10 bullets.

The group also suggests requiring firearms dealers to report to the federal government individuals who purchase multiple semiautomatic assault rifles within a five-day period. Current law requires reporting multiple purchases of handguns, but not semiautomatic assault rifles.

CAP also wants the administration to free public health research agencies, including the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to study the impact of gun violence on injuries and deaths. For years, lawmakers, urged by the NRA, have placed riders on spending bills that restrict these and other agencies from conducting such research."

Clinton’s actions birthed Army regulations “forbidding military personnel from carrying their personal firearms and making it almost impossible for commanders to issue firearms to soldiers in the U.S. for personal protection.”

President Obama unveiled a series of measures designed to prevent gun violence

It is the most sweeping gun-control proposal in two decades

Proposals could face rough ride in Congress

President Obama unveiled the most sweeping set of gun-control proposals in two decades on Wednesday, a package that includes universal background checks on all gun buyers and a renewed ban on ""military-style"" assault weapons.

Opponents were quick to take issue with the plan: The National Rifle Association issued a statement saying that ""only honest, law-abiding gun owners will be affected and our children will remain vulnerable to the inevitability of more tragedy.""

Obama, speaking at a White House ceremony, also proposed restricting ammunition magazines to no more than 10 rounds, as well as new school safety and mental health programs, all designed to prevent shootings like the one last month at an elementary school in Connecticut.

""This is our first task as a society, keeping our children safe,"" Obama said. ""This is how we will be judged.""

The president and Vice President Biden — who developed the plan after a series of meetings with 229 groups involved in gun violence issues — appeared with the children who wrote letters to the White House expressing concern about gun violence.

MORE:White House fact sheet, executive actions

After reading some of those letters, Obama said: ""And these are our kids. This is what they're thinking about. And so what we should be thinking about is our responsibility to care for them, and shield them from harm.""

Also attending were family members of victims of the Dec. 14 attack that killed 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. ""Our hearts go out to you,"" Biden said, saying he and Obama want to ""honor the memory of your children.""

Obama said no law can ""prevent every senseless act,"" but can be valuable if it can prevent one attack. ""If there is even one life that can be saved, we've got an obligation to try it,"" the president said.

The White House issued a written plan with four goals: keeping guns out of the wrong hands, getting ""weapons of war"" off the streets, upgrading school safety and improving mental health services.

Among the specific proposals:

Keeping guns out of the wrong hands. The White House is proposing ""universal background checks"" designed to target private gun sales that are not covered by the current system, which applies to federally licensed dealers. The plan also includes four executive orders designed to remove barriers to information sharing among state and federal agencies.

Restricting ""weapons of war."" Obama's plan calls for limiting ammunition magazines to no more than 10 rounds. The document notes that the Newtown killings and the July attack in a movie theater in Aurora, Colo., involved the kinds of semiautomatic weapons that were targeted by the assault-weapons ban that expired in 2004. The administration also wants to maintain the effort to ban armor-piercing bullets.

Biden said he has no ""illusions"" about the political challenges, but the Newtown shooting has shaken the nation's conscience. ""The world has changed,"" he said.

Still, gun rights supporters criticized many of the president's plans as ineffective, unconstitutional and politically motivated. Republican Party Chairman Reince Priebus said the plan amounts to ""an executive power grab that may please his political base but will not solve the problems at hand.""

Such sentiments are indicative of the battle the proposals face in Congress, especially in the Republican-run House of Representatives.

""House committees of jurisdiction will review these recommendations,"" said Michael Steel, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. ""And if the Senate passes a bill, we will also take a look at that.""

House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said he will consider Obama's recommendations.

""However, good intentions do not necessarily make good laws,"" Goodlatte said. He said he wants to ensure that the proposals will ""actually be meaningful in preventing the taking of innocent life and that they do not trample on the rights of law-abiding citizens to exercise their constitutionally guaranteed rights.""

Even some Democrats, including Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., have questioned whether a new assault-weapons ban can pass Congress.

Reid, a gun rights supporter, told a Nevada television station over the weekend that ""in the Senate, we're going to do what we think can get through the House.""

Said Sen. Max Baucus, a pro-gun Democrat representing Montana, in a statement: ""Enforcing the laws we already have on the books is a good first step, and it's clear more needs to be done to address access to mental health care ... Before passing new laws, we need a thoughtful debate that respects responsible, law-abiding gun owners in Montana instead of one-size-fits-all directives from Washington.""

Not all the dissent is Washington-based.

Texas Republican Gov. Rick Perry said the Obama plan wouldn't have prevented the Newtown shootings, which Perry attributed to a ""sad young man"" who ""was clearly haunted by demons.""

""Guns require a finger to pull the trigger,"" said Perry, a Republican presidential candidate in 2012, who added that ""the piling on by the political left and their cohorts in the media to use the massacre of little children to advance a pre-existing political agenda that would not have saved those children disgusts me personally.""

In Mississippi, Republican Gov. Phil Bryant called for state legislation making it illegal to enforce any new federal gun control measures in the state, The Clarion-Ledger in Jackson reports.

Bryant said in a letter to high-ranking state officials -- even before Obama's presentation -- that he expected the proposals would ""infringe our constitutional right to keep and bear arms as never before in American history.""

The NRA, the nation's largest gun lobby, has vowed to fight the gun-control proposals. It has proposed armed guards in all schools, and expanding databases to block gun purchases by people who have been declared mentally ill.

Before Obama's event, the NRA released a video criticizing the president as an ""elitist hypocrite"" for opposing armed guards in every school even though his daughters receive Secret Service protection. White House spokesman Jay Carney called the ad ""repugnant and disgusting.""

But there is also plenty of support for the White House effort.

Marsha Moskowitz, a Sandy Hook, Conn., resident and former bus driver who once drove some of the kids who were killed in the school massacre, said she ""definitely"" agrees with the president's proposals.

""I understand the Second Amendment, but there's no need for assault weapons in personal homes or for hunting,"" Moskowitz said. ""If we can get one gun that was built to kill a mass amount of people out of someone's hands, I'm all for it.""

Michael Pohle Sr., 57, of Flemington, N.J., lost his son, Michael Jr., then 23, in the Virginia Tech massacre in 2007.

""I'm just so proud -- I don't care whether he's a Democrat or a Republican -- that he has put this on the table because too many elected leaders have been so afraid,"" Pohle said. He likened the journey to the yellow brick road in The Wizard of Oz. ""It's like we're at the start of the yellow brick road now,"" he said.

Mark Glaze, director of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, said he expects the families of the victims from Newtown and several other mass shootings to be very involved in the effort to push action in Congress. He noted that New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg flew several of the Newtown families to Washington in his plane. The victim advocates will be only a part of the coalition, he said.

""It does take a village, and the village is ready to riot,"" Glaze said.

Some advocates for the mentally ill expressed cautious optimism that the nation may finally take meaningful action to repair a broken mental health system.

""It's a terrible thing that it takes terrible acts for everyone, from the public to the president, to look comprehensively at this situation,"" said Doris Fuller, executive director of the Treatment Advocacy Center in Virginia. ""But we can't think in silos, such as just looking at gun control. If we leave the mental illness treatment piece out of it, we will never get to a solution.""

The civil rights community appeared divided over Wednesday's developments, applauding steps to address gun violence, and mental health issues, but opposing proposals to place armed guards in schools.

""Of particular concern to us is their (guards') interaction with children of color, whose discipline issues are often dealt with as criminal matters, effectively fast tracking them into the criminal justice system,"" wrote National Urban League president and CEO Marc Morial in a statement.

""Bringing police into schools often negatively impacts the very children we are trying to protect,"" said Damon Hewitt, director of the Education Practice Group of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, in a statement. ""Police in schools often cross the line between safety and discipline, using overzealous methods to address normal adolescent behavior. African-American students are significantly more likely than their peers to be arrested at school just for acting like teen-agers."".

Obama also signed 23 executive orders dedicated to curbing gun violence; they included directing to federal agencies to make more data available for background checks, nominating a director for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and ordering the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to do more research on neurological causes of gun violence.

The president is also proposing harsher punishments for gun trafficking between states, as well as federal money to help cities pay for more police officers. In addition, Obama nominated a new leader for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; his previous nominee has been held up for years. Other proposals:

School safety. The plan proposes money to help local school districts hire 1,000 school resource officers and school counselors.

Mental health. The administration is proposing Project AWARE, which stands for Advancing Wellness and Resilience in Education. It would be designed to reach about 750,00 people to identify mental illness early in young people and refer them for treatment. Obama said he will direct the CDC to step up research into the causes of violence, and ask Congress to fund research into the impact of violent video games on young minds.

It adds up to the biggest government anti-gun violence program since 1994, when Congress passed an assault-weapons ban that expired 10 years later. A year earlier, Congress approved the Brady Bill, requiring background checks on gun purchasers.

At the White House event, Obama said he believes in Second Amendment rights to gun ownership, and knows that nearly all gun owners are law-abiding citizens. His plans, he said, are aimed at ""an irresponsible, law-breaking few.""

While not citing the NRA by name, Obama did denounce groups that gin up ""fear"" about a fictitious plot to take away people's guns.

""The only way we can change is if the American people demand it,""' Obama said.

Newtown happened here and the country is watching Connecticut. The feckless wonders in Congress are backing off, cowed again by the man behind the curtain, the National Rifle Association. If Connecticut doesn't take the lead to lessen the impact of one of the worst public health problems in the country, the movement could wither.

That's why we'd like to see one part of the bill made stronger, and that concerns large-capacity magazines, here defined as magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition. The bill immediately bans the sale or purchase of large-capacity magazines going forward. But it allows those who already have them to keep them, and then ties itself in knots creating hard-to-enforce restrictions on their use. Just ban the damn things, as Gov. Dannel P. Malloy and some parents of Newtown victims have requested."

(CNN) – Mark Kelly, the husband of former Rep. Gabby Giffords and an outspoken advocate for new gun control measures, purchased an AR-15 assault rifle in Tucson recently as a demonstration of what he says are unobtrusive background checks.

The retired space shuttle commander wrote on his Facebook page he would turn in the weapon – which he said he hadn't yet obtained - to the city's police department.



""Looks like the judiciary committee will vote on background checks next week,"" Kelly wrote, referring to the Senate panel where gun control legislation is up for a vote this week.

""I just had a background check a few days ago when I went to my local gun store to buy a 45. As I was leaving, I noticed a used AR-15. Bought that too. Even to buy an assault weapon, the background check only takes a matter of minutes,"" he continued.

Later, on CNN's ""The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer,"" Kelly said it was ""important for me to have firsthand knowledge about how easy it is or difficult it is to buy a weapon like that.""

The AR-15 is one of America's top-selling firearms, and has become a focus of the gun control debate after being used in a recent spate of mass shootings. One was used in the December massacre at a Connecticut elementary school. Advocates for tighter gun laws argue there's no need for Americans to own the powerful rifle, but the gun's proponents say the AR-15's accuracy makes it safe.

Aside from a measure bolstering background checks that's sponsored by New York Democrat Charles Schumer, the Senate Judiciary Committee this week will consider a ban on assault weapons that was introduced by California Democrat Dianne Feinstein, which would outlaw the AR-15 among a host of other military-style weapons.

Last week the judiciary panel approved a bill toughening laws on gun trafficking and straw purchases, but on the issue of background checks – which previously appeared poised for bipartisan support in the legislature – Republicans and Democrats have reached some sticking points.

Republicans on the Judiciary Committee have expressed support for expanding the scope of mental health information submitted to the federal background check system used by gun sellers, but some have expressed concern that records would be kept on responsible gun owners.

Bipartisan talks have also failed to reach a compromise that would address the ""gun show loophole,"" which critics say provides an avenue for people who know they cannot pass a background check to obtain guns through private sales.

In his Facebook message about the AR-15 purchase, Kelly wrote it was ""scary to think of people buying guns like these without a background check at a gun show or the Internet.

""We really need to close the gun show and private seller loop hole,"" he concluded.

He added on CNN that he was ""looking forward at some point to buying a gun at a gun show, and also possibly selling a gun.""

Last week, Giffords support for background checks alongside her husband at a gun control rally in Tucson, Arizona, the same place where an assailant shot her in the head.

The former congresswoman urged lawmakers to ""Be bold. Be courageous. Please support background checks.""

At the event, Kelly said his newly formed gun-control organization, Americans for Responsible Solutions, was sending a letter to U.S. Sens. John McCain and Jeff Flake, both Arizona Republicans, urging them to support background-check legislation. McCain suggested last month that such legislation would have success in the Senate.

In Congress, a group of Democrats, led by Rep. Linda T. Sanchez of Lakewood, is pushing for an additional 10% tax on handgun purchases that could generate tens of millions of dollars nationwide to fund gun buybacks, firearms safety campaigns and anti-violence programs.

Legislation that would impose taxes on guns or bullets has also been introduced in Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey and Washington state. In Sacramento, a bill by Democratic Assemblyman Roger Dickinson would impose a nickel tax on every bullet sold in California to pay for screening and treating young children for mental illness.

The proposals are designed after similar taxes placed by federal, state and local governments on cigarettes to fund anti-smoking campaigns and healthcare programs.

“Anything that contributes to balancing out the costs that gun violence exacts on communities is a step in the right direction,” said Kristen Rand, legislative director of the Violence Policy Center. “Like cigarettes, guns should be taxed in a manner that takes into account the harm they inflict on society at large.”

Massachusetts state Rep. David Linsky, who has proposed a 25% tax on the sale of guns and ammunition to fund mental health programs, police training and crime victims’ programs, said that gun owners bore some responsibility for funding mental healthcare because of the effect of firearms on public health and safety.

“We know that cigarette smoking has a significant public health impact,” he said, citing taxes imposed on tobacco to fund healthcare. “Similarly, the use of firearms has a significant public health and public safety impact.”

Currently, gun and ammunition manufacturers pay a federal tax — often passed on to buyers — that is projected to generate about $500 million this year for wildlife conservation programs under a 1937 law. The amount is expected to increase as a result of a marked rise in sales prompted by fears of new firearm restrictions.

The proposed congressional legislation is designed to appeal to deficit-minded lawmakers by offering a way to pay for grants to local and state governments for popular buyback events without adding to Washington’s red ink. A recent buyback in Los Angeles took in 2,037 firearms, including 75 assault weapons.

But the proposals are likely to run into resistance from House Republicans strongly opposed to tax hikes. A spokesman for the National Rifle Assn. said the group strongly opposed “any misguided effort to tax law-abiding Americans exercising their fundamental constitutional right.”

“The vast, vast majority of Americans who own firearms do so with great care and a sense of serious responsibility,” said Mike Bazinet, director of public affairs at the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a gun industry trade group. “It is unfair to ask them to pay additional taxes to fund programs to address societal problems that stem from multiple causes.

“Let’s target the criminals — not the law-abiding citizens who choose to own firearms for hunting, target shooting or personal defense,” he said.

In the 1990s, then-Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) unsuccessfully sought to impose steep new federal taxes on handgun ammunition to help pay for healthcare.

But the idea has gained new interest following the Newtown, Conn., elementary school shootings.

In Maryland, legislation has been introduced to impose a 50% tax on most ammunition and establish a $25 annual gun registration fee.

The sponsor, state Delegate Jon S. Cardin, a Democrat, said the bill “goes directly to the heart of the NRA argument that says we need to focus on mental health and not banning guns,” though he also supports tougher gun laws.

Nationwide, proposals vary on how much guns and ammunition should be taxed and how the money should be spent. In Nevada, Assembly Majority Leader William Horne is preparing to introduce legislation that would impose a tax of $25 per gun and 2 cents per bullet to provide money for crime victims and mental health programs.

A New Jersey bill would impose an additional 5% tax on sale of firearms and ammunition to fund safety improvements in public buildings, including schools.

The measure has drawn mixed public reaction, said Chris Hillmann, a spokesman for state Assemblywoman Connie Wagner. Some say it is unconstitutional, while others want a 20% hike, he said.

A woman fires a handgun with help from an instructor in a file photo. Texas Governor Rick Perry's office said on Tuesday that he had signed a new law that expands Texans' existing right to use deadly force to defend themselves ""without retreat"" in their homes, cars and workplaces. REUTERS/Jeff Christensen

Governor Rick Perry’s office said on Tuesday that he had signed a new law that expands Texans’ existing right to use deadly force to defend themselves “without retreat” in their homes, cars and workplaces.

“The right to defend oneself from an imminent act of harm should not only be clearly defined in Texas law, but is intuitive to human nature,” Perry said on his Web site.

The new law, which takes affect on September 1, extends an exception to a statute that required a person to retreat in the face of a criminal attack. The exception was in the case of an intruder unlawfully entering a person’s home.

The law extends a person’s right to stand their ground beyond the home to vehicles and workplaces, allowing the reasonable use of deadly force, the governor’s office said.

The reasonable use of lethal force will be allowed if an intruder is:

- Committing certain violent crimes, such as murder or sexual assault, or is attempting to commit such crimes

- Unlawfully trying to enter a protected place

- Unlawfully trying to remove a person from a protected place.

The law also provides civil immunity for a person who lawfully slays an intruder or attacker in such situations.

Texas joins several other states including Florida that have or are considering similar laws.

Sympathy for violent offenders and criminals in general runs low in Texas, underscored by its busy death row. The state leads the United States in executions with 388 since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976 by the U.S. Supreme Court.

A conservative political outlook and widespread fondness for hunting also means Texans are a well-armed people capable of defending themselves with deadly force.

It is easy to acquire guns over the counter in Texas and lawful to carry a concealed handgun with a permit."
http://news.yahoo.com/gun-control-backers-senate-defeat-wont-stop-us-065741656--politics.html,,[],Gun control backers: Senate defeat won't stop us,"WASHINGTON (AP) — One day after the demise of gun control legislation, Senate supporters of the measure vowed to try again, while a leading opponent accused President Barack Obama of taking the ""low road"" when he harshly criticized lawmakers who voted against key provisions.

""When good and honest people have honest differences of opinion about what policies the country should pursue about gun rights...the president of the United States should not accuse them of having no coherent arguments or of caving to the pressure,"" said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas.

The fate of the bill was sealed in a string of votes on Wednesday, when Republicans backed by a small group of rural-state Democrats rejected more extensive background checks for gun purchasers and also torpedoed proposed bans on assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines.

The Senate delivered its verdict four months after a shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., left 20 first graders and six educators dead. The tragedy prompted Obama to champion an issue that Democrats had largely avoided for two decades, and that he himself ignored during his first term in the White House.

Though the gun control bill was moribund for the foreseeable future, the Senate approved two minor amendments on Thursday. One by Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., cutting aid to state and local governments that release information on gun owners, was approved 67-30. Another by Sens. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, and Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., bolstering federal mental health programs passed 95-2.

Cornyn said he agreed with Obama that Wednesday had been a shameful day but added it was because of the president's own comments, rather than the events on the Senate floor.

""He could have taken the high road...instead he chose to take the low road, and I agree with him it was a truly shameful day.""

Cornyn spoke shortly after Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., said the struggle for tougher gun legislation was not over.

Story continues

""This is not the end of the fight. Republicans are in an unsustainable position,"" he said, after voting with few exceptions against a tougher requirement for background checks for gun purchasers, a proposal that shows very high support in most public opinion polls.

Reid offered no timetable for renewing the drive to enact legislation that Obama has placed near the top of his domestic agenda.

Another Democrat, Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, said the proposed expansion of background checks that he co-authored would have passed easily had it not been for the National Rifle Association's decision to take the vote into account in deciding which candidates to support or oppose in 2014.

""If they hadn't scored it, we'd have had 70 votes,"" he said. Instead, it drew 54, six short of the 60 needed to advance.

Manchin also told reporters at a breakfast sponsored by the Wall Street Journal that the outcome would have been different if the Senate had acted more quickly after the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown. ""If we'd have gone to a bill like this immediately, boom,"" he said, predicting it would have received 65-70 votes.

Later, in the Capitol, he renewed his accusations that the NRA had spread lies about the proposal he had hoped to pass, and that fellow lawmakers had evidently believed them. ""Reading is a lost art,"" he said.

Obama spoke in clipped, angry tones at the White House on Wednesday after the Senate scuttled legislation he had campaign for energetically.

""I see this as just Round One,"" the president said, flanked by relatives of Newtown's victims and former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot in the head in Tucson, Ariz., in 2011.

Looking ahead to the 2014 congressional elections, he added, ""If this Congress refuses to listen to the American people and pass common-sense gun legislation, then the real impact is going to have to come from the voters.""

Obama blamed lawmakers' fear that ""the gun lobby would spend a lot of money"" and accuse them of opposing the Second Amendment's right to bear arms.

A spokesman, Josh earnest, told reporters on Thursday, ""we're pretty close to a consensus on this just about everywhere except in the United States Congress. And as the President alluded to yesterday, I think that is an indication of the pernicious influence that some special interests have in the United States Congress. And that is going to require a vocalization of public opinion to overcome it.""

Emotions were high on Wednesday at the Capitol.

When the background check amendment failed in the Senate, Patricia Maisch, watching from a visitors' gallery, shouted ""Shame on you!"" Maisch helped restrain the gunman at the 2011 Tucson shooting in which six people died and 13, including Giffords, were wounded.

But on Friday, Gov. Jerry Brown, also a Democrat, vetoed several key pieces, including a ban on semiautomatic weapons that many had considered the toughest restriction on gun ownership in the country.

The bill, by Darrell Steinberg, the State Senate president pro tem, would have banned semiautomatic rifles with detachable magazines. Mr. Brown, calling the bill overly broad, said the ban would have unduly constrained hunters and others using guns legally.

“The State of California already has some of the strictest gun laws in the country, including bans on military-style assault rifles and high-capacity ammunition magazines,” Mr. Brown wrote in a veto statement. “I don’t believe this bill’s blanket ban on semiautomatic rifles would reduce criminal activity or enhance public safety enough to warrant this infringement on gun owners’ rights.”

Mr. Brown signed several other pieces of gun legislation on Friday, including curbs on high-capacity magazines, a ban on lead hunting ammunition, new limits on firearms storage and several measures intended to keep mentally ill people from possessing firearms."

Republican state Rep. Carole Murray told FoxNews.com she doesn’t appreciate “East Coast politics” interfering in her state.

The concern comes ahead of a tense Senate vote -- which could come late next week -- and after a vote in the House that prompted the White House to take the unusual step of lobbying wavering Democrats. Biden’s office confirmed to FoxNews.com he made four phone calls to Colorado Democrats, two in moderate districts, but did not say what they were about.

Multiple sources, though, tell FoxNews.com that about eight hours into last week’s 12-hour House debate, Biden called Democrats Mark Ferrandino, Mike McLachlan, Tony Exum and Dominick Moreno to solidify support for the measures and to “remind them about the importance of the legislation.”

House lawmakers in Colorado, home to two of the deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history, narrowly passed a handful of gun control bills last week. The measures are headed to the Senate in early March where they are expected to face an uphill battle, though it's unclear what steps the White House might take this time to solidify support.

Explaining the substance of the Biden call last week, Exum told The Denver Post the vice president ""said it would send a strong message to the rest of the country that a western state had passed gun-control bills.""

One measure would limit magazines to 15 rounds for firearms and eight for shotguns. Every House Republican, as well as three Democrats, voted against that measure, which passed 34-31. The House also approved a bill requiring background checks on all gun purchases, including those between private sellers and firearms bought online.

The third proposal would ban concealed firearms at colleges and stadiums, while the fourth would require gun purchasers to pay for their own background checks. The closest vote was on the background check measure, which passed on a 33-32 vote.

Republicans argue that the proposals restrict their Second Amendment rights and have called the bills a “knee-jerk reaction” to the recent mass shootings in Colorado and Connecticut.

Though Democrats have a majority in both Colorado chambers, they will have a tougher time passing the legislation in the Senate, where they have only a 20-15 majority. That means Republicans and other gun rights supporters need to turn only three Democrats to defeat the bills.

Colorado has taken center stage in the country’s fight over gun control. As the White House struggles to pass gun control legislation on Capitol Hill, where a Republican majority in the House ensures that only a bipartisan bill can make it through, a successful push for such legislation in the purple, pro-gun rights state of Colorado would be seen as a major victory.

Lawyer Jan Baran, though, said lobbying state legislators from Washington would only venture into illegal territory if Biden made a promise of money for a vote.

“Unless it’s some very specific promise that involves money, it’s just good ol’ politics,” Baran said.

Colorado has attracted national interest from the National Rifle Association as well. David Keene, president of the NRA, went to Denver last month to meet with Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper and Senate President John Morse.

Keene called universal background checks a political “sweet spot” and added that the current background check systems are underfunded and that forcing them on private sales would be logistically difficult.

Hickenlooper has said in the past he supports background checks but has flip-flopped on almost every other gun control issue – something Republicans point to as proof he’s being politically pressured.

While unusual, this is not the first time the White House has meddled in state battles.

In May 2002, negotiations over two New York congressional districts intensified after a panel of federal judges approved a plan to eliminate them, but said it was still “willing, indeed eager” to let state lawmakers create a fair plan of their own. Vice President Dick Cheney called the Republican leader of the state Senate to discuss concerns about the lines the court had drawn.

In February 2000, President Clinton used a meeting of the National Governors Association to recruit governors to lobby for a bill that would normalize trading relations with China, as part of a broad effort to build support for China’s administration to the World Trade Organization.

In June 1994, then-first lady Hillary Clinton pitched her husband’s universal health care plan to a group of Oklahoma state lawmakers, a labor leader and hospital administrators. One person who attended the event told The Saturday Oklahoman that “the implication” was there that they should ask the delegation to support the Clinton plan."

“As the father of four young children, I was deeply saddened by the murder of innocent kids at Sandy Hook. In the aftermath of this terrible tragedy, I expressed my hope that President Obama and our elected leaders would take a sober look at how we can prevent such heinous murders in the future. Doing so would require addressing the underlying causes of these evil acts, and keeping guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill without curtailing the 2nd Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens. “Nothing the President is proposing would have stopped the massacre at Sandy Hook. President Obama is targeting the 2nd Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens instead of seriously addressing the real underlying causes of such violence. Rolling back responsible citizens’ rights is not the proper response to tragedies committed by criminals and the mentally ill. Making matters worse is that President Obama is again abusing his power by imposing his policies via executive fiat instead of allowing them to be debated in Congress. President Obama’s frustration with our republic and the way it works doesn’t give him license to ignore the Constitution. “Guns are not the problem; criminals with evil in their hearts and mentally ill people prone to violence are. Rather than sweeping measures that make it harder for responsible, law-abiding citizens to purchase firearms, we should focus on the root causes of gun violence and keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill. “As a strong defender of the 2nd Amendment, I will oppose the President’s attempts to undermine Americans’ constitutional right to bear arms.”

Mamet describes it as a “hoax”- a solution to a problem that doesn’t exist, because “assault weapons” are used in few crimes, and the very designation “assault weapon” is based on a gun’s cosmetics–i.e., does it look menacing?

Going after such guns makes some people feel safer because they have slowly, and perhaps unknowingly, traded their independence for a “government knows best” mentality.

Think about Ronald Reagan’s 10 most dangerous words in the English language–“Hi, I’m from the government and I’m here to help.” Reagan saw these words as dangerous because they were indicative of an encroaching government that had taken unto itself the role of determining what was best for you and for me: a role for which our government simply was not designed.

Mamet sees the government doing this very thing with an “assault weapons” ban, in that he sees it determining what guns we can and can’t own based on what has been determined that we do or don’t need. And as Mamet so ably points out, government officials exercise Marxist principles when they limit our exercise of freedom based on what they think we need.

This is all part of the “hoax.” It takes our eyes off of the real solution to crime in this country-namely, the strength of the individual and an armed citizenry-and it makes us think the answer is a blind trust in the supposed-altruistic aims of our government.

According to Mamet, the height of hypocrisy is that the people who are trying to disarm us are themselves surrounded (protected) by heavily armed guards.

He specifically mentions Obama in this instance, and the way Obama has ordered armed guards for himself and his family for life. To this Mamet simply says: “Evidently, [Obama] feels he is best qualified to determine his needs, and of course, he is.” And subsequently, remarks Mamet, “I [too] am best qualified to determine mine.”"

After winning a major victory over President Obama with the defeat of a gun-control bill in the Senate, the National Rifle Association will gather in Houston this weekend for its annual convention.

After winning a major victory over President Obama with the defeat of a gun-control bill in the Senate, the National Rifle Association gathered in Houston this weekend for its annual convention.

After winning a major victory over President Obama with the defeat of a gun-control bill in the Senate, the National Rifle Association gathered in Houston this weekend for its annual convention.

The National Rifle Association’s convention in Houston this weekend bristled with the combative and triumphant rhetoric of a group that achieved a major victory in 2013: completely defeating the White House-backed package of gun-control legislation.

On the surface, the gun-rights group seems stronger than ever with tens of thousands enthusiastic participants, record high membership and effusive approval for the path taken by the its leader, Wayne LaPierre.

Beneath the surface, however, some of the NRA’s allies are uneasy, saying publicly and privately that the organization is facing long-term — and even short-term — challenges on a scale it has not faced before.

Those challenges include changing demographics and patterns of gun ownership; a new willingness of gun-state lawmakers, particularly Democrats, to buck the NRA; and the rise of an organized and well-funded gun-control movement.

The concerns are playing out in a debate over whether the NRA and gun-rights advocates made a mistake by pugnaciously opposing all of this year’s major gun-control proposals — including legislation expanding background checks for gun purchases sponsored by two NRA-backed senators, Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) and Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.). That measure failed in a high-profile vote last month.

In recent days, one of the country’s best-known gun-rights advocates, Robert Levy, criticized the gun lobby for strenuously blocking the background check initiative on Capitol Hill. Levy, who was part of the legal team that won recent landmark gun-rights cases, also chairs the Cato Institute, an influential libertarian think tank that advocates for Second Amendment rights.

“The stonewalling of the background check proposal was a mistake, both politically and substantively,” Levy said recently, noting that public opinion favors such an approach. In an interview and in online blogs, Levy called for improvements in the legislation but noted overall that the Manchin-Toomey effort is “far better than the legal regime we now have.”

Levy has disagreed with NRA strategy in the past. But his views have been reinforced by others in recent weeks, most significantly by the votes of NRA-backed lawmakers who felt free to break with the gun lobby and support the background check proposal, particularly Democrats such as Jon Tester of Montana.

Pennsylvania may provide the most stark example of a reason for NRA worry. The state has one of the highest concentrations of NRA members in the country. Yet both senators — Toomey and Democrat Robert P. Casey Jr. — agreed to cross the NRA this year on its most high-profile vote of the year. In addition, three GOP House members from Pennsylvania, endorsed in the past by the NRA, have indicated support for the senators’ approach.

Still, NRA board member Grover Norquist says that NRA officials are thrilled with the results the NRA achieved this year on the state and national levels — accomplished despite the full-court press by the Obama White House and its gun-control allies.

A new report to be released this week by the Center for American Progress (CAP), a think tank with ties to the White House and the Democratic Party, looked into changes in Pennsylvania, Virginia and Colorado, citing gains there resulting in part from the grass-roots efforts of gun-control forces.

For example, since 2008, New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg (I) and the organization he founded and funds, Mayors Against Illegal Guns, has been active in the state, building a coalition of more than 150 mayors. Bloomberg’s organization also has been at work in other traditional gun states, such as Colorado and Virginia, where senators also supported the Manchin-Toomey background check proposal last month.

The support of purple-state senators for legislation that the NRA strongly opposes is not in itself an indicator of change. Members in the past have bucked the NRA, and some of them found themselves facing early retirement.

This time may be different, however, in part because of the demographic trends that seem to be running against the gun rights group. As the country becomes more suburbanized, gun culture is diminishing in popularity and influence and the gun-control movement’s support is increasing.

The CAP report, for example, notes that “while the number of guns in circulation in the country has continued to rise, the percentage of households that own guns has been steadily declining for the past three decades — reaching a low of 34 percent in 2012, down from an average of 50 percent in the 1970s.”

Perhaps most worrisome for the NRA is the flow of funds from Bloomberg to groups that are trying to take a page from the NRA playbook. The NRA remains one of the most potent political forces in American politics today because its members feel passionately about gun rights, and their passion is reflected in real political participation. But the “intensity gap” is closing, the CAP said.

“There is substantial evidence that the intensity gap has closed,” wrote the report’s author, Arkadi Gerney, who worked previously with the mayors’ group. He cited a Fox News poll conducted the day after the Toomey-Manchin vote, which “showed that three times as many Americans said that they were likely to support a candidate who voted for expanded background checks (68 percent) as a candidate who opposed expanded background checks (23 percent).” They also cited the example of Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.), who saw her approval drop since the vote and who has been dogged by gun-control advocates during a recent Senate recess.

NRA board members are aware of these new pressures, of course. Do they have regrets about the way the organization handled the background check issue with a defiant, oppositional post-Sandy Hook stance?

“None whatsoever,” said Cleta Mitchell, a board member who has served as outside counsel to the NRA in the past. “The NRA stands as a stalwart, as being true to principles and not caving.” The NRA has called for more armed guards in schools and greater attention to mental health issues and the role of violent video games and other entertainment.

Mitchell said she has concerns about the affects of Bloomberg’s spending, among them the hypocrisy of complaining by the White House and its allies on the left. “The president has the nerve to say the Senate vote outcome was due to ‘special interests.’ Why are the votes against the Second Amendment ‘principled’ and the votes on our side are ‘political?’ ” she asked.

The dedication of NRA members to protecting Second Amendment rights is an important asset for the group. Both sides in the debate over expanding background checks say the power of the NRA and the issue it champions will be visibly tested during the 2014 election campaign.

“We are in the midst of a once-in-a-generation fight for everything we care about,” LaPierre told the convention this weekend. The convention’s motto was “Stand and fight.”

http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/06/08/free-gun-initiative-begins-in-houston-neighborhood/,2013-06-08 00:00:00,[],Free gun initiative begins in Houston neighborhood,"Houston resident Cheryl Strain's inexperience with guns was apparent as she struggled to load shells into a 20-gauge shotgun.

Over the piercing blasts of gunfire in the shooting range, Strain's instructor, Dan Blackford, patiently directed her on how to use her thumb to shove a shell all the way inside the barrel and feel it click.

""Now we got a round in the chamber ready to go,"" Blackford said as he positioned her body on the right way to hold the shotgun. ""Look down your sight, put that BB right in the middle of your target and press the trigger.""

Strain's northwest Houston community of Oak Forest is the first neighborhood in the country being trained and equipped by the Armed Citizen Project, a Houston nonprofit that is giving away free shotguns to single women and residents of neighborhoods with high crime rates.

While many cities have tried gun buy-backs and other tactics in the ongoing national debate on gun control, the nonprofit and its supporters say gun giveaways to responsible owners are actually a better way to deter crime. The organization, which plans to offer training classes in Dallas, San Antonio, and Tucson, Ariz., in the next few weeks, is working to expand its giveaways to 15 cities by the end of the year, including Chicago and New York.

But others in Houston, while expressing support for Second Amendment rights, question whether more guns will result in more gun-related deaths rather than less crime.

Residents of Oak Forest say their neighborhood, made up of older one-story houses and a growing number of new townhomes, has experienced a recent rash of driveway robberies and home burglaries. On a recent Sunday afternoon, a group of 10 residents, including Strain, went through training at Shiloh Shooting, a northwest Houston gun range.

Kyle Coplen, the project's 29-year-old founder said his group expects to train at least 50 Oak Forest residents and put up signs saying the neighborhood is armed.

""When we have a crime wave, we don't just say let's just increase police and that's all we do. We do multiple things. I see this as one aspect of what we can do,"" said Coplen, who graduated from the University of Houston with a master's degree in public administration.

It costs the organization about $300 to arm and train an individual and about $20,000 for an entire neighborhood. All costs are paid through donations, said Coplen, though he declined to say how much his organization has raised so far.

While some residents in the neighborhood are supportive, several officials have mixed feelings about it.

Sandra Keller, Strain's neighbor, said she is participating in part because of the helplessness she felt after her furniture store was robbed a couple of years ago.

""If you don't have a gun, you're just a walking victim. You're just waiting for somebody to take advantage of you and your property,"" said Keller, 64, after practicing at the shooting range.

But Houston City Councilwoman Ellen Cohen, who represents Oak Forest, said, ""I have serious concerns about more guns in homes.""

Cohen said she supports Second Amendment rights and believes that such a responsibility should include proper training and background checks.

David Hemenway, a professor of health policy and management at the Harvard School of Public Health who has written about firearms and health, said studies suggesting gun ownership deters crime have been refuted by many others that say the opposite.

""Mostly what guns seem to do is make situations more lethal because most crime has nothing to do with guns,"" he said. ""When there is a gun in the mix, there is much more likely to be somebody dying or somebody incredibly hurt.""

Proponents of increased gun ownership point to a variety of statistics to support their argument, including ones showing that some cities with strict gun control laws, like Chicago, still have high murder rates.

Blackford, the firearm instructor in the Oak Forest training, said the group is teaching residents not only how to handle and store a weapon but also when to use deadly force.

""The sad part is most people think if you're pro-gun, that you've got this gunslinger attitude, that you are walking around looking for a gun fight to get into and that is so far from the truth,"" said Blackford, a former Secret Service agent.

Harris County Precinct One Constable Alan Rosen, whose deputies patrol Oak Forest, said that while he believes the best deterrent to crime is effective neighborhood watch programs, he believes people should have the right to protect themselves.

""In terms of having a shotgun, after you've been properly trained on it, to have that in your home to protect your home, I'm for it,"" he said.

Strain, 46, a single mother who has never owned a gun, said she was nervous firing the shotgun but that more training will help. She also had her 12-year-old son Rory practice firing the shotgun so ""if God forbid something happens, he could be prepared as well."""

The massacre in Newtown%2C Conn.%2C has prompted calls for gun restrictions

Aides say Sens. Joe Manchin and Pat Toomey could have a deal early this week

Gun-control advocates have called for expanded background checks

WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. Congress returns Monday from a two-week recess with gun control legislation high on the Senate's agenda as President Obama looks for a breakthrough in his efforts to curb gun violence following the December massacre at a Connecticut school.

The administration moved quickly after the shooting amid concerns that the high emotions would settle and politics would go back to normal on one of the country's most sensitive issues. The country's top gun lobby has opposed the gun control drive, and the president's proposals have weakened in the months since the shooting amid fears that the more controversial ones, such as an assault weapons ban, will harm an overall gun control package.

On Monday, Obama travels to Connecticut to again make the case for gun legislation.

Senators could start debating gun legislation before week's end, but leaders might take more time to seek a breakthrough deal on expanding background checks for gun buyers — the proposal seen as having the best chance of passage.

Two influential senators, one from the Democrats and one from opposition Republicans, are working on an agreement that could expand background checks on firearms sales to include gun shows and online transactions, Senate aides said Sunday.

Federal background checks are currently required only for transactions handled by the roughly 55,000 federally licensed firearms dealers. Private sales such as gun show or online purchases are exempt. The system is designed to keep guns from criminals, people with serious mental problems, some drug abusers and others.

After the Connecticut massacre, Obama proposed applying the requirement to virtually all firearms sales. Gun control advocates consider expanded background checks to be the most effective step lawmakers could take to curb gun violence.

The NRA and other critics say the checks are ignored by criminals, and they fear that expanding the system could be a step to the government maintaining files on gun owners.

Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin and Republican Sen. Pat Toomey could reach an accord early this week, said the aides, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the private talks.

Manchin is a moderate who touts a top ""A'' rating from the National Rifle Association, the influential gun rights lobbying group which has led the opposition to Obama's gun control drive. Toomey has solid conservative credentials.

Their united front would make it easier for gun control advocates to attract support from moderate Democrats who have been wary of supporting the effort and from Republicans who have largely opposed it so far.

With conservative Republicans threatening to use legislative maneuvers to prevent a final vote on gun control legislation, Democrats will need 60 of the chamber's 100 votes to prevail. There are 53 Democrats and two Democratic-leaning independents in the Senate.

Sen. John McCain urged his fellow Republicans to allow debate on gun legislation to go forward without the maneuver. However, he declined to express support for an expanded background check bill.

Other Obama gun control priorities include banning assault weapons and ammunition magazines with more than 10 rounds. Both bans are expected to be offered as amendments, but the assault weapons ban seems sure to be defeated, and the high-capacity magazine prohibition also faces difficult odds.

Gun control advocates are worried their allies might cut a deal that goes too far.

""We want a vote on the issues. We don't want them watered down so they're unrecognizable,"" said Josh Horwitz, executive director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. ""If they can't vote for it, let the American people judge them on that. Don't let a dumbed-down bill be the outcome of this.""

Justice Department figures show that from 1994, when the current background check system began, through 2010, 118 million potential gun buyers were checked and 2.1 million were denied firearms. Defenders say the data proves the checks prevent many dangerous people from getting weapons.

With or without an agreement, the Senate gun legislation would toughen federal laws against illegal firearms sales, including against people who buy firearms for criminals or others barred from owning them. The legislation also would provide $40 million a year, a modest increase from current levels of $30 million, for a federal program that helps schools take safety measures such as reinforcing classroom doors

Also high on Congress' agenda as it returns is immigration, where a decisive moment is approaching.

Bipartisan groups in the House and Senate are expected to present legislation as early as this week aimed at securing the U.S. border, fixing legal immigration and granting legal status to the estimated 11 million who are in the United States without authorization. That will open months of debate on the issue.

Lawmakers will also devote time to the 2014 budget that Obama plans to release Wednesday. It calls for new tax increases, which Republicans oppose, and smaller annual cost-of-living increases in Social Security pension payments to retirees and other government benefit programs, over the objections of many of the president's fellow Democrats.."

(The Washington Post)

President Obama delivered an impassioned and urgent plea in West Hartford, Conn., Monday evening for swift action, asking a state still shaken by the Newtown school massacre why there isn’t more support in Congress for gun control legislation. (The Washington Post)

With his proposed gun regulations in serious jeopardy, President Obama delivered an impassioned and urgent plea here Monday evening for swift action, telling a state still shaken by the Newtown school massacre, “We’ve got to expect more from Congress.”

The call for stricter gun laws — his most forceful yet — came in a campaign-style event in front of several thousand people packed into the University of Hartford’s basketball arena. Obama recalled last December’s slaughter of 20 small children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School as the toughest day of his presidency and added, “If we don’t respond to this, that will be a tough day for me, too.”

“We’ve got to expect more from ourselves,” he continued. “And we’ve got to expect more from Congress. We’ve got to believe that, you know, well, every once in a while we set politics aside and we just do what’s right.”

Obama, who met before his speech with parents of slain children, also vowed not to forget the Connecticut slayings. He wore a green bracelet, while many in the audience wore green ribbons, honoring the school’s colors.

“Newtown, we want you to know that we’re here with you,” Obama said. “We will not walk away from the promises we’ve made. We are as determined as ever to do what must be done.”

Obama’s visit to Connecticut comes at the start of a critical week on Capitol Hill that could determine the fate of his sweeping gun-control agenda, with signs that senators may be nearing a deal to expand background-check requirements but with other proposals in serious jeopardy.

“I know that some of these proposals inspire more debate than others, but each of them has the support of the majority of the American people,” Obama said. “All of them are common sense. All of them deserve a vote.”

The crowd cheered so loudly it was difficult at times to hear the president’s remarks. At one point, people interrupted Obama with chants of, “We want a vote! We want a vote! We want a vote!”

Obama ticked through each of his proposals, including universal background checks and bans on assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines, highlighting polls showing nine in 10 Americans are in favor of expanding background checks.

“If our democracy's working the way it’s supposed to, and 90 percent of the American people agree on something, in the wake of a tragedy, you’d think this would not be a heavy lift,” Obama said. “And yet some folks back in Washington are already floating the idea that they might use political stunts to prevent votes on any of these reforms.”

A growing coalition of Senate Republicans, including Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), has warned it would filibuster gun legislation, meaning any bill would require a plurality of 60 votes rather than a simple majority to pass.

Obama is ratcheting up his efforts to somehow translate popular support for his proposals into legislative momentum. His visit here comes just days after Connecticut Gov. Dan Malloy (D) signed into state law one of the nation’s strictest firearms restrictions.

On Monday night, 11 relatives of Sandy Hook victims plan to fly to Washington with Obama aboard Air Force One so they can lobby lawmakers Tuesday, according to a White House official. The White House offered to fly them so they could attend both the president’s speech in Hartford and their meetings the next day in Washington, the official said.

The Newtown families will be joined this week in Washington by survivors and the family members of victims from mass shootings in Arizona, Colorado, Wisconsin and Virginia, according to groups organizing the meetings.

Obama has made similar pleas on gun control, including an address last week in Denver, near the scene of last summer’s movie-theater shooting in Aurora.

Although the president’s push is resonating with voters, it has not yet led to momentum on Capitol Hill. Amid an intense lobbying effort by the National Rifle Association and other gun-rights groups, senators have yet to reach a deal on universal background checks for gun sales.

The prospects for passing his proposed bans on so-called assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines are significantly worse, and administration officials quietly acknowledge the prohibitions are unlikely to pass.

Obama and other gun control proponents are zeroing in on the background checks proposal, which advocates argue would be the most effective of the plans because it would help keep all guns — assault weapons as well as common handguns — out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill.

This week, proponents are making their biggest public relations push yet to increase pressure on senators to pass expanded background checks. Vice President Biden and Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. plan to deliver remarks Tuesday about reducing gun violence during an event at the White House with law enforcement officials. And on Wednesday, first lady Michelle Obama will return to her home town of Chicago to give a speech about gun violence from the perspective of a mother.

Meanwhile, other gun control advocates are trying to rally the public. Parents of Sandy Hook victims appeared on CBS’s “60 Minutes” on Sunday, making the emotional case for senators to back stricter gun laws.

Nicole Hockley, referring to a photograph of her dead son, told CBS: “They need to not just look us in the eyes, but look at our children and the lost ones and see those faces, see what’s gone and remember this isn’t just about political parties. This isn’t just about careers. This is about people. And this is about making change to save people. And it’s important to remember the people you are doing this for.”

On Monday morning, former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.), who was shot and severely injured in 2011 during a constituent event in her Tucson district, tweeted: “What are we waiting for? I can’t remember a time when this many Americans spoke with such a united voice in favor of anything.”

From the Washington Post/ABC poll taken April 11-14, 2013.

The latest Washington Post/ABC poll shows little deviation in American views about new gun legislation from what we've been seeing in other polls since the elementary school slaughter in Newtown, Connecticut, four months ago. Americans, the poll showed, still support changes that would tighten rules on owning firearms. By a small plurality, however, 49 percent to 45 percent, they disapprove of how President Obama is handling the matter.

The poll, which also inquired about views on immigration, budget cuts, jobs and the economy, included 13 questions on guns.

Among them:

• Would you support or oppose a law requiring a nationwide ban on the sale of assault weapons? 56 percent supported, 42 percent opposed.

• Would you support or oppose a law requiring a nationwide ban on high-capacity ammunition clips, meaning those containing more than 10 bullets? 56 percent support, 41 percent oppose.

• Would you support or oppose a law requiring background checks on people buying guns at gun shows or online? 86 percent support, 13 percent oppose.

• Say someone legally sells a gun that later is used in a crime. Do you think the crime victim should or should not be able to sue the gun seller for damages? 24 percent say they should be able to sue, 72 percent say they should not.

• Do you or does anyone in your house own a gun, or not? 43 percent say yes, 55 percent say no.

The federal suit, filed in Buffalo, said the law violates the constitutional rights of ""law-abiding citizens to keep commonly possessed firearms in the home for defense of self and family and for other lawful purposes.""

In announcing the NRA's support for the lawsuit, Chris Cox, executive director of NRA’s Institute for Legislative Action, said Gov. Andrew Cuomo ""usurped the legislative and democratic process"" in passing the measures without sufficient input from the public.

“Despite the wishes of Governor Cuomo, law-abiding citizens have a fundamental right to keep commonly possessed firearms for defense of themselves and their families and for other lawful purposes including the enjoyment of New York’s rich hunting and sporting heritage,” Cox said in a news release.

The challenge takes aim at two key provisions of the law: a lower limit on magazine capacity and an expansion of the state's assault weapons ban to include some popular and formerly legal semi-automatic rifles.

The law pushed through by Cuomo on Jan. 15 -- the first new gun restrictions in the nation following the Dec. 14 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. -- also requires registration of an estimated 1 million older guns.

Other provisions require five-year renewals of handgun licenses statewide, direct mental health professionals to notify authorities of patients deemed likely to seriously hurt themselves or others and require federal background checks for private gun sales in New York. It will require registration of ammunition sellers and buyers.

The law also reduces the size of legal magazines from 10 bullets to seven, though lawmakers and Cuomo have recently proposed amending that.

The New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, the lead plaintiff and NRA affiliate, said it was bringing the suit on behalf of its 45,000 members. President Tom King has estimated there are about 4.75 million gun owners among New York's 19 million residents. Other plaintiffs include the Westchester County Firearms Owners Association, Beikrich Ammunition Corp., Blueline Tactical & Police Supply, gun manufacturer Bedell Custom and the Sportsmen's Association for Firearms Education.

""Criminals have and use magazines without any limitation in capacity. The act's provisions on magazines put law-abiding citizens at a grave disadvantage to criminals, who will not comply with the seven-round limit,"" the suit said. Likewise, it said the ban on assault weapons, ""a pejorative term,"" is being broadened ""to describe countless numbers of rifles, handguns and shotguns that were commonly possessed under prior law.""

The suit seeks a ruling that both provisions violate the constitution's Second Amendment right to bear arms and the 14th Amendment right to equal protection under the laws as well as injunctions stopping enforcement. The suit does not challenge many other provisions, including stronger penalties for gun crimes.

State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, named along with Cuomo as a defendant, said Thursday the law is ""making New York communities safer, while ensuring constitutional protections to responsible gun owners. My office will continue to aggressively defend the protections embodied in the law because every New Yorker deserves to live in a safe neighborhood free from the threat of gun violence,"" he said.

The group also spent $500,000 on Wednesday alone, on an advertising campaign criticizing “Obama’s gun ban” and using Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, a deep-pocketed gun control advocate, as a foil. “Tell your senator to listen to America’s police instead of listening to Obama and Bloomberg,” the ad said.

The action on Wednesday was initially supposed to be only the first series of votes in a debate to take days if not weeks. But as the measures’ chances faded this week, Senate leaders decided to rush the process, reaching a bipartisan agreement to hold nine votes in succession, each with a 60-vote threshold for passage.

Using the 60-vote hurdle so early in the process allowed Democrats to prevent the passage of an amendment mandating that any state with a concealed-weapons law, no matter how rigorous, would have to recognize the concealed-weapons permit of residents from any other state. The amendment received 57 votes in favor, including those of 12 Democrats, and 43 votes against.

Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, a lifelong backer of the N.R.A. who also pushed for new restrictions in recent weeks, made one last plea for his amendment, which would extend background checks to Internet and gun show sales. While acknowledging that “the politics are risky,” he said it was “a defining time in politics, where you know the facts are on your side.”

The bipartisan measure, which had appeared to have a strong chance of passage, received 55 votes before Mr. Reid changed his vote to “no” to preserve the parliamentary right to bring the measure up again. Four Republicans voted “yes”: Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, a co-author of the legislation; John McCain of Arizona; Mark Steven Kirk of Illinois; and Susan Collins of Maine. An equal number of Democrats voted “no”: Mark Begich of Alaska, Mark Pryor of Arkansas, Max Baucus of Montana and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota. All are from states that Mr. Obama lost by wide margins last fall, and all but Ms. Heitkamp face difficult re-election campaigns in 2014.

Debate over the measures consumed the Senate on Wednesday, with speeches from both sides meant to stir emotions. “I choose to vote my conscience,” Mr. Reid said, announcing his decision to vote for the bans on assault weapons and magazines that carry more than 10 rounds of ammunition, “because, if tragedy strikes again — if innocents are gunned down in a classroom or a theater or a restaurant — I could not live with myself as a father, as a husband, as a grandfather or as a friend knowing that I didn’t do everything in my power to prevent it.”

The assault weapons vote was 40 in favor and 60 against. The magazine ban fell with 46 in favor and 54 against."

Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) questioned President Barack Obama's commitment to the Second Amendment on Thursday morning, telling ""Fox and Friends"" he thought Obama lacked the ""political courage"" to admit his real feelings.

""Look, I have questions about whether he is truly committed to the Second Amendment as I understand it, most Americans would understand it, and I don't think he has the political courage to admit that,"" he said.

The Republican senator went on to explain that while he didn't think Obama would try to repeal the Second Amendment, he worried about efforts to weaken it.

""If they don't fully understand the Second Amendment and how it's supposed to apply, they are willing to test it and they are willing to see how much they can infringe on it,"" Rubio said. ""My problem with that is, that you're going to do that in exchange for policies that dont work.""

His comments echoed those he made on Wednesday night on Fox. “I actually think the president -- and he just doesn’t have the guts to admit it -- is not a believer in the Second Amendment, although he states that he is,” Rubio said, as reported by The Washington Post. “If he doesn’t want the Second Amendment to be in the Constitution, or if he wants to reform it, then have the guts to admit that.”

Both appearances were in response to Obama's press conference on Wednesday, where the president unveiled his recommendations to Congress to reform gun control policy, and announced 23 executive actions. ""I intend to use whatever weight this office holds to make them a reality,"" Obama vowed. ""If there's even one life that can be saved, then we've got an obligation to try.""

In Florida, which is sometimes referred to as the ""Gunshine state,"" no permit is required to buy or possess a rifle, shotgun or handgun.

On Wednesday, Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) expressed support for a review of his state's gun laws, but quickly appeared to walk back his comments. In a statement, his press secretary, Jackie Schutz, said Scott ""supports the Second Amendment and is not proposing any gun law changes."""

The sparse turnout outside City Hall had to be discouraging Thursday for a phalanx of government leaders intent on bringing public pressure to bear on the nation’s wavering lawmakers to enact gun controls. “The overwhelming majority of Americans have been on our side,” noted Senator Richard Blumenthal, who had to concede, “but they have been the silent majority.”

He underlined the central question: Are the strong public opinion poll numbers for gun controls, which registered at 90 percent immediately after the December school massacre in nearby Newtown, already fading in the bewildering maw of gun politics on Capitol Hill?

Here on Main Street, the art of suffocating needed reform by Congress felt palpable. The proposed ban on the sort of assault rifle used in Newtown is sagely pronounced a political nonstarter even before the Senate votes. Hope fades for a ban on high-capacity ammunition magazines. And the call for universal background checks for gun ownership is increasingly in doubt as Senate Republicans, sensing dwindling interest, resort to usual vows to filibuster.

The gathering here of a few score of people was one of more than 100 rallies organized by the Obama administration and mayors as part of a national grass-roots campaign. Hopeful speeches were delivered, but it seemed clear that a far more fully aroused public will be required to budge enough lawmakers from their obeisance to the gun lobby. Gov. Dannel Malloy of Connecticut made no secret of his frustration with the pace of nonaction, both in the Statehouse across town and in Congress. He denounced the “silliness” of a drawn-out police investigation that has kept basic information about the tragedy secret for three months — information the public and lawmakers need to know in driving for a solution."

HOUSTON — Sen. Ted Cruz brought a pro-Constitution, anti-crime message to the National Rifle Association's annual meeting Friday, challenging Vice President Biden to an hour-long debate on gun violence.

More than 6,000 NRA members gave Cruz, a freshman Texas Republican and a rising GOP star, a standing ovation for threatening to filibuster attempts to pass gun-control legislation.

Just a couple of months ago, Cruz said, the gun bill ""looked like an unstoppable freight train."" But that legislation is now in doubt after senators blocked an amendment last month that would have expanded background checks to include sales at gun shows and over the Internet.

""The Constitution matters. All of the Constitution,"" Cruz said. ""It's not pick and choose. It's not take the parts you like and get rid of the parts you don't like.""

Some senators have faced home-state protests for voting against that background check amendment last month. But Cruz said there ought to be protests against Democrats who voted against another amendment, which he sponsored with Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, that would have cracked down on violent crime. ""Citizens ought to ask them, 'Why aren't you willing to support going after felons and fugitives who try to illegally buy guns?' "" he said.

Cruz mocked Biden, who has taken the lead for the Obama administration on gun issues.

Biden's advice that firing a warning from a double-barreled shotgun is sufficient to ward off attackers would be ""very useful — if it so happens that you're being attacked by a flock of geese.""

Several opening speakers at the NRA's annual legislative forum took aim at President Obama, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and — above all — the media. The underlying theme: Political elites and the media don't understand gun-owning Americans.

""The lamestream media just doesn't get you, and you don't give up,"" said former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. Wearing a black-and-pink ""women hunt"" T-shirt, she called the media ""a poodle-skirted cheerleader"" for Obama.

""The media and the political elites can lie about us and demonize us all they want, but that won't stop us,"" NRA Vice President Wayne LaPierre said.

The annual meeting of the nation's largest and most powerful gun rights group is ""the biggest celebration ever of our American values,"" LaPierre said. The event is expected to be the group's largest ever, with perhaps 70,000 people attending the gun exhibition that accompanies the annual meeting.

Among them: The Van Sweden family of Fort Worth, Ind. Bruce and Jenny Van Sweden took their 10-year-old daughter Catherine out of school for the day to listen to three hours of political speeches. ""It's an education for her,"" Jenny said.

""I think the government is going crazy, and nothing they're talking about will change a thing,"" said Bruce. ""The polls say, 'Are you in favor of background checks?' Yeah, I am -- the ones we already have.""

The NRA is clearly feeling its oats after its big legislative victory last month.

The man who gets almost single-handed credit for that, NRA President David Keane said, is the group's chief lobbyist, Chris Cox. ""Did anyone think in January or February that we'd be where we are today?""

Cox said politicians and the media were taking advantage of the shooting of 26 children, teachers and staff at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.

""Think about that, when a deranged criminal murders innocent children, they blame us,"" Cox said. ""They use tragedy to restrict freedom, and it's up to us to stop them.""

Opposition protests are scheduled for Saturday, but for most of Friday a single protester stood across the street from Houston's George R. Brown Convention Center and read the names of victims of gun violence since Sandy Hook. ""We want the NRA to hear the consequences of their actions,"" said Heather Ross, a 27-year-old Austin woman who read the names from her iPhone. ""The Second Amendment says we can regulate guns, and that's all we want to do."""

Ernie Gullerud, a former professor of social work at the university, came upon a previously unpublished poem by Carl Sandburg titled ""A Revolver,"" which addresses the issue of guns and violence.

""I'm no judge of what makes a great poem, but this one said so much and so succinctly and to the point. I thought 'Golly, someone could have written this today,'"" said Gullerud, 83.

It's not clear when Sandburg typed the poem:

Here is a revolver.

It has an amazing language all its own.

It delivers unmistakable ultimatums.

It is the last word.

A simple, little human forefinger can tell a terrible story with it.

Hunger, fear, revenge, robbery hide behind it.

It is the claw of the jungle made quick and powerful.

It is the club of the savage turned to magnificent precision.

It is more rapid than any judge or court of law.

It is less subtle and treacherous than any one lawyer or ten.

When it has spoken, the case can not be appealed to the supreme court, nor any mandamus nor any injunction nor any stay of execution in and interfere with the original purpose.

And nothing in human philosophy persists more strangely than the old belief that God is always on the side of those who have the most revolvers.

Gullerud has volunteered at the Rare Book and Manuscript Library every Thursday for more than seven years. For the past two years, he's been working to classify and enter a file folder of poems into the school's electronic system.

He was working through poems by Sandburg this month when he came across ""A Revolver"" typed on scratch paper and recognized its relevance to current cultural debates across the country.

""When I wrote down that last line, I knew this was really big,"" Gullerud said.

Sandburg, a Galesburg native and at one time a Chicago newspaperman, received Pulitzer Prizes for poetry in 1919 and 1951 and another in 1940 for his biography of Abraham Lincoln.

Gullerud took the poem to Valerie Hotchkiss, head of the Rare Book and Manuscript Library, who also noted its relevance.

U. of I. English professor emeritus George Hendrick, who has published multiple volumes of Sandburg's poems, said ""A Revolver"" appears to be from the writer's later work. Hendrick speculated that the poem could be related to Lincoln's assassination.

""Sandburg wrote the multi-volume biography of Lincoln. … Lincoln was his great hero, and his great hero was cut down by a man who used a gun to end his existence,"" Hendrick said. ""It's clear that Sandburg had very strong feelings about weapons being used to end the life of others.""

Hendrick said many of Sandburg's undocumented poems and draft work remain in the U. of I. library. Sandburg's wife and daughter gave the papers to the library years ago, he said, and it's now a ""great collection.""

Sandburg died in 1967.

Senate takes key vote at 11 a.m. to break filibuster

Vote will set up first major gun debate in 19 years

Debate on gun bills likely to take weeks

The Senate on Thursday voted 68-31 to move forward and start the most comprehensive debate on reducing gun violence in 19 years.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev, said the process of amending the gun legislation will begin -- and there are several proposed changes that will be introduced. The first amendment offered will be the bipartisan deal to expand background checks on gun purchases negotiated by Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa. Scroll down for highlights:

11:38 a.m. ET: Reid announces the amendment process will begin. He says it will possibly take ""weeks"" to legislate. Reid also says there will be a vote on an assault weapons ban, which is not expected to pass.

11:35 a.m. ET: The final vote is 68-31. The debate begins. By our count, there were 16 Republican senators who agreed to move forward.

11:23 a.m. ET: Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, another Democrat from a red state being targeted in 2014, votes ""yes.""

11:20 a.m. ET: Another vote with political connotations: Sen. Mark Begich, D-Alaska, votes ""no."" He is also facing voters next year, but is probably not as vulnerable as Pryor.

11:17 a.m. ET: Sen. Mark Pryor, D-Ark., votes ""no."" He is up for re-election next year and is a top target for defeat. Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., also on the ballot in 2014, votes ""yes."" The key will be to watch how they vote on the bill itself.

11:16 a.m. ET: The clerk has announced the first votes. GOP Sens. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, Susan Collins of Maine, Jeff Flake of Arizona, Johnny Isakson of Georgia and John McCain of Arizona are among the ""yes"" votes. That means they want to start debate. Collins is the only GOP senator up for re-election next from a state that President Obama carried in 2012.

11:13 a.m. ET: A reminder: A ""yes"" vote Thursday means the senator wants to go ahead and start debating gun legislation. It is not an indication of support for the substance of the bill. A ""no"" vote means stop -- don't move forward -- and essentially would kill the bill.

11:03 a.m. ET: The clerk is starting to call the roll and the senators are coming to the Senate floor. A bit of procedure: The senators are actually voting on what is called a motion to invoke cloture, which requires 60 votes. Then the next step would be to start the clock (for 30 hours of debate) on what is called a motion to proceed.

10:49 a.m. ET: USA TODAY's Jackie Kucinich is at a news conference with families of Newtown victims. They have a statement about the bipartisan deal announced Wednesday by Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa., on expanded background checks for gun purchases. ""We are deeply encouraged,"" they say. ""No one should have to experience the pain we have endured.""

10:44 a.m. ET: Senate Minority Whip John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 GOP leader, brings up the point that the focus should be on keeping guns away from the mentally ill. He warns about choosing ""symbolism"" over ""solutions.""

10:40 a.m. ET: Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., makes reference to the National Rifle Association and its warning that it will ""score"" senators on their votes Thursday. ""We do not need a lobby's permission to pass laws,"" Leahy said, before imploring his colleagues to ""stand up and be counted. Have the courage.""

10:26 a.m. ET: Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, one of the Republicans seeking to filibuster gun legislation, just said the Senate needs more debate on guns -- not less -- to ensure that Second Amendment rights are upheld. ""Proponents say the people deserve a vote,"" he said. ""Don't they deserve to know what they're voting on?""

10:14 a.m. ET: Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., is telling the stories of children killed at Newtown as he stands besides a poster of some of the Sandy Hook victims. Politics may be politics, but it's clear that there will be several efforts to personalize the issue.

10:12 a.m. ET: Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democratic leader, brings up Hadiya Pendleton, the 15-year-old Chicago girl who was shot and killed shortly after participating in President Obama's inauguration.

9:50 a.m. ET: A reminder that the Senate is taking up gun legislation because of the Dec. 14 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., explains that several family members who lost loved ones at Sandy Hook are in the chamber. ""Today let us decide there will be no more Newtowns,"" Blumenthal urges.

9:30 a.m. ET: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., kicked things off by saying he wants to start debate — but whether the gun legislation passes won't be known for some time. ""I hope we can ... start legislating today,"" he said. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell followed."

Take away the criminals’ weapons, not the law-abiding citizens’. Sound familiar? It’s the mantra of the gun lobby.

That is, until the government actually attempts to do it. Then the lobby changes its lyrics.

It seemed surreal listening to lobbyists for gun rights groups Monday, as if the ears were playing tricks. They testified at a state Senate Budget Committee hearing in opposition to legislation that would spend $24 million in surplus money to confiscate guns possessed by people who legally aren’t supposed to have them.

They weren’t opposed to the gun seizure, they said—only to the use of this particular money. It would come from the $19 fee each gun buyer pays for a background check to determine whether he’s legally eligible to possess a weapon. Is he a felon? Mentally ill?

The lobbyists contended the fee is too high and should be lowered. Never mind that the gun buyer already probably is spending several hundred dollars to buy the weapon. And bullets—depending on the caliber—may go for around, say, $1 each.

They also argued the money should be used to speed up the background check and reduce the 10-day waiting period for taking possession of a gun. In other words, it’s more important to rush a weapon into the hands of a purchaser than to grab one from the clutches of a violent criminal.

“They’re trapped and lost in their own world, and it’s not the real world,” says Sen. Mark Leno (D-San Francisco), coauthor of the bill, SB 140, and chairman of the budget committee.

Let’s back up.

California has a unique program—the only one in the nation—that tracks known handgun and assault weapons owners to make sure they’re still legally permitted to possess a firearm. Starting next year, they’ll also be doing it with buyers of all long guns.

Although the gun owner originally was a legal purchaser, he may have since been convicted of a violent misdemeanor, or been subject to a restraining order or been diagnosed with a mental illness. A little computer cross-checking produces a red flag. And a squad of armed officers can knock on the door and seize the arsenal. Roughly 11,000 weapons have been grabbed over the past six years.

Advertisement

But a few weeks ago, it was revealed by the state Department of Justice that roughly 19,700 Californians still illegally owned around 39,000 firearms, and there wasn’t enough money to confiscate them.

So Leno and Senate leader Darrell Steinberg (D-Sacramento) introduced the bill appropriating the money on an urgency basis, which means it will require a two-thirds majority vote in each house.

At the committee hearing, the Justice Department reported that the list of “prohibited” gun owners, as of March 1, had risen to an even 20,000 people, possessing 40,790 firearms.

“We know 40,000 guns are in the hands of people who shouldn’t have them,” Steinberg told the committee. “We know their addresses, we know who they are….

Advertisement

“We’re not unmindful that money is precious. But here is $24 million. Go get those guns as fast as you can….This is about the notion that you do whatever you can with what you have.”

A no-brainer, you’d think. But not for the gun lobby.

Although the number of prohibited persons possessing weapons is “inexcusable,” said Kathryn Lynch, representing the National Shooting Sports Foundation and the California Assn. of Firearms Retailers, it is “inappropriate” to use background-check money to seize the guns.

“I would argue,” she continued, “that this is tantamount to an attack on honest citizens.”

Advertisement

National Rifle Assn. lobbyist Ed Worley contended that the $19 fee is too high.

Tom Pedersen, of the California Rifle and Pistol Assn., said the surplus money should be spent on upgrading the system to accelerate the checks.

Advertisement

Sam Peredes, lobbyist for Gun Owners of California, said that using money from “law abiding gun purchasers” to seize the guns of bad guys “is not fair and reasonable, and we believe places an undue burden on those people who are exercising their 2nd Amendment rights.”

He contended the weapons confiscation should be paid for out of the state’s general fund.

Guess that also means hunting-license revenue shouldn’t be used to hire game wardens to track down poachers, who despoil everyone’s wildlife.

Peredes lamented that the committee had blown a “historic opportunity to have both the anti-gun and the pro-gun side come together.”

Advertisement

And in that sentence he verbalized the gun lobby’s isolation from mainstream America. It’s blinded by an uncompromising view that either people are “anti-gun” or “pro-gun,” denying the reality that someone can support gun ownership while still seeking common-sense solutions to gun violence.

A Field Poll recently found that 61% of California voters believe it’s more important to impose stiffer gun controls than to protect gun rights.

Advertisement

The committee ignored the gun lobby and voted for the bill 14-0 — with both Republicans and Democrats on board. Leno says he’ll take it up soon on the Senate floor.

A Republican co-author, Sen. Anthony Cannella of Ceres, told me, “It’s a great bill. It seems a great use of the fees. It just makes common sense.”

Advertisement

As for the gun lobby opposition, Cannella said: “I don’t understand it. They always say, ‘Take guns out of the hands of the people who shouldn’t have them.’ ”

No longer. They’ve reloaded with a new refrain.

They squeezed into the rotunda for their annual lobbying day only moments after Gov. Pat Quinn delivered his budget speech, an event that drew a sizable crowd of its own. The gun rights backers let lawmakers know they oppose both a proposed ban on military-style assault weapons and heavy restrictions on legislation to allow carrying concealed weapons in public.

Quinn wants both, but the Legislature is divided along regional lines on the issues. Lawmakers from Chicago and nearby suburbs have fought for gun control, while Downstate lawmakers and some suburbanites oppose legislation they feel might infringe on the rights of hunters.

The legislative fight over the shape of gun proposals has been playing out the last several weeks with advocates on both sides of the issue, but on Wednesday, thousands swelled around the statehouse lawn's showcase statue of Abraham Lincoln as they chanted, ""Concealed carry now.""

The concealed weapons issue has gained prominence since a federal appeals court ruled in December that Illinois should come up with legislation by early June to allow people to carry guns in public. Illinois is the only state in the nation without some form of concealed carry, a ban that lasted for decades.

At the rally, Republican Sen. Sam McCann of Carlinville drew heavy cheers as he thanked gun rights advocates, including the Illinois State Rifle Association and the National Rifle Association.

""Government of the people, by the people and for the people requires you — the people — not the politicians,"" McCann said.

The outpouring came a day after House Speaker Michael Madigan, D-Chicago, held a floor debate on the proposed assault weapons ban, a legislative move that allowed lawmakers to vote piece by piece on amendments. A week earlier, Madigan held a marathon hearing on concealed weapons before the full House. Lawmakers tacked on amendments that would ban carrying guns in public in places that ranged from commuter buses and trains to casinos.

But both gun proposals are a work in progress, and neither side appears to have gained a clear upper hand. Republicans have refused to cast votes, saying the hearings are a political game designed to put GOP lawmakers on controversial roll calls that could be used against them in their next campaigns.

""At the end of the day, that's not fruitful,"" said Republican Rep. Dennis Reboletti, a former prosecutor.

Even so, Democratic Rep. Brandon Phelps, a gun rights champion from Harrisburg, said the votes so far on the gun bills have represented tests of what might be acceptable to various legislators.

Phelps acknowledged that both sides are a ""long way from a compromise"" in concealed carry and assault weapons legislation but are trying to find a middle ground. Phelps said an assault weapons ban proposed by Rep. Eddie Acevedo, a Chicago Democrat and police officer, would represent an ""all-out attempt to ban most firearms.""

In turn, Acevedo said the gun issue is ""not a game"" and that he is ""trying to make a compromise with the NRA"" that can pass.

""Make no mistake, this debate is not over,"" Reid said. He acknowledged that he and President Obama had agreed to hit ""pause"" on the current package, but said the Senate would ""come back to this bill"" and take up expanded background checks.

At the same time, critics of the legislation vowed to ensure any future proposals protect both ""the lives and liberty"" of Americans.

Both sides of the debate, it seemed, were gearing up for a protracted legislative battle that could last through the next congressional election. Democrats appeared to acknowledge that the amendment's failure Wednesday meant they would not be able to pass any gun bill in the short-term, despite initial claims that the mass shooting in Newtown, Conn., might spur a hasty legislative response in Congress.

The amendment that was defeated Wednesday would have expanded background checks to gun shows and Internet sales, while exempting personal transactions. It failed on a 54-46 vote; it needed 60 to pass.

Opponents, which included Republicans and rural-state Democrats, said the measure would infringe on Second Amendment rights by imposing a burden on law-abiding gun owners while doing little to stop criminals. They also repeated the concern that the system could lead to a gun registry, though the amendment language prohibited this.

Both sides of the debate indicated a willingness to keep working toward new legislation to address gun violence. But the debate became far more combative in the wake of Wednesday's vote. While Republicans want more of a focus on the mental health system, school security and the entertainment industry, Democrats are focusing even harder on background checks.

Obama, speaking in the Rose Garden late Wednesday, sought to shame those who voted against the background check plan and accused the gun lobby of lying about the bill to scare lawmakers.

""All in all, this was a pretty shameful day for Washington,"" Obama said. He called the vote ""just round one.""

Obama's campaign arm, Organizing for Action, swiftly began planning the next round. The group's director, Jon Carson, announced events this Saturday ""in states where senators hold the key to expanding background checks.""

Republicans bristled at Obama's comments. ""When good and honest people have honest differences of opinion about what policies our country should pursue when it comes to the Second Amendment and gun rights and mass gun violence, the President of the United States should not accuse them of having no coherent arguments or caving to the pressure,"" Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said.

It's unclear exactly how Democrats will proceed. Reid, in freezing the bill, preserves the option of returning to it at a later date.

Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., who helped craft the bipartisan plan widening background checks, said he would continue talking to other senators to see whether there were changes he could make that would attract their votes.

Senate Democrats could call a do-over vote with a revised piece of legislation.

But they also appeared to acknowledge the deep resistance to any legislation seen to curb gun rights, and threatened to take the campaign into the 2014 congressional elections.

""If this Congress refuses to listen to the American people and pass common-sense gun legislation, then the real impact is going to have to come from the voters,"" Obama said.

Obama blamed lawmakers' fear that ""the gun lobby would spend a lot of money"" and accuse them of opposing the Second Amendment's right to bear arms.

But opponents of the restrictions -- which would have been the most meaningful gun curbs approved by Congress in two decades -- said the curbs were defeated because they wouldn't have worked.

Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., said most proposals were ""predicated on one assumption that somehow we think that the criminal element will single out this one law to comply with.""

Added Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., of the expanded background check plan, ""This is the first step in the erosion of my rights under the Second Amendment.""

The day was not a complete victory for the NRA. Senators defeated one GOP amendment requiring states that let people carry concealed weapons to honor other states' concealed carry permits. Also rejected was a Republican proposal letting some veterans with mental problems have firearms unless a court blocks them from getting the weapons.

No. 2 Senate leader Richard Durbin, D-Ill., was among several Democrats who joined Obama in saying Wednesday's roll calls left them with an issue to take to voters.

""We're now in the world of Gabby Giffords and Mayor Bloomberg and organizations that are organized to come out and support those who vote for gun safety and oppose those who don't,"" he said, referring to wealthy New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who has been financing gun control efforts.

But Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., expressed doubts.

""If it were a real effective political strategy, you wouldn't have seen a lot of Democrats from Southern states voting with Republicans today,"" he said.

Some Western Democrats voted against restrictions as well.

NRA lobbyist Chris W. Cox thanked lawmakers for defeating the ""misguided"" background check expansion, saying it would have criminalized gun transactions between friends -- a charge Obama and others called untrue.

Mayors Against Illegal Guns, financed by Michael Bloomberg, called the vote ""a damning indictment"" of the gun lobby's power.

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/03/11/Schakowsky-Assault-Weapons-Ban-is-Just-the-Beginning,2013-03-11 00:00:00,['Joel B. Pollak'],Schakowsky: Assault Weapons Ban 'Just the Beginning',"Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-IL), a member of the Democratic Party’s leadership in the House of Representatives, suggested to Jason Mattera at a Feb. 13 women’s rights rally that plans for an assault weapons ban and private-sales background checks were only the beginning of a broader gun control agenda extending to handguns as well.

Schakowsky evidently did not recognize Mattera, a conservative video journalist and senior investigative reporter for Talk Radio Network, who infamously confronted Vice President Joe Biden in the Capitol. (Mattera introduced himself to Schakowsky by name but did not indicate that he was filming or that he is conservative.) She spoke to Mattera as if he were a fellow gun control enthusiast–and Mattera played along, eliciting answers about Schakowsky’s enthusiasm for gun control.

“We want everything on the table,” Schakowsky told Mattera. “This is a moment of opportunity. There’s no question about it.”

One poignant exchange was as follows:

Schakowsky: We’re on a roll now, and I think we’ve got to take the–you know, we’re gonna push as hard as we can and as far as we can. Mattera: So the assault weapons ban is just the beginning? Schakowsky: Oh absolutely. I mean, I’m against handguns. We have, in Illinois, the Council Against Handgun… something [Violence]. Yeah, I’m a member of that. So, absolutely.

In another exchange, Schakowsky proposed allowances for states and municipalities to ban guns–though such laws have been repeatedly rejected by the Supreme Court:

Mattera: We’ll never get a handgun ban with the Second Amendment as stated. Schakowsky: I don’t know. I don’t know that we can’t. And there may be an allowance, once again, for communities–I have communities in my district that prohibited handguns within their borders. The rights of municipalities and states to view that as a sensible way to keep people safe–I don’t think it’s precluded.

When Mattera asked why legislators were not pressing for a handgun ban, given that most murders are committed with handguns, Schakowsky replied: “Because we’re not going to be able to win that. Not now.” She went on to explain why background checks were a useful interim policy, arguing that they would “address any kind of weapon.”

Schakowsky’s remarks about plans for broader gun control are not the first time she has revealed the long-term goal behind short-term policy debates. She has a tendency to do so when speaking to apparently sympathetic audiences. In 2009, she told a crowd that the goal of Obamacare would be to “put the private insurance industry out of business.”

Officially, Democrats–including Schakowsky–hew to the party line as laid down by the president, which pledges support for the Second Amendment and for gun ownership in rural communities where hunting and shooting are viewed as traditional pastimes.

Gun owners fear that the Sandy Hook-inspired gun control measures before Congress–none of which would have stopped the mass shooting at Sandy Hook–are a prelude to broader regulations, including the banning of handguns and the eventual registration and confiscation of firearms, despite earnest assurances by Democrats to the contrary.

The Democratic Party has taken a hard line on guns recently, with President Obama’s strategist, David Axelrod, joining New York mayor Michael Bloomberg in backing gun control enthusiast Robin Kelly over former Rep. Debbie Halvorson, who has an “A” rating from the National Rifle Association, in the recent primary to replace former Rep. Jesse Jackson, Jr. of Illinois. Kelly has promised to be a “leader” in “banning guns.”"

The NRA has once again stopped the most FUNDAMENTAL background check for owning an assault rifle---no doubt with many fence-sitting GOP senators hoping the front-page publicity of this awful terror attack will shield them from potential fallout.

The same day that the NRA's GOP minions decided that it was okay for a violent criminal to shoot me in the face, I discover that the Boston investigators are blocked from doing a thorough investigation because of the NRA and their allies.

Identification taggants are used to make it possible to trace explosive materials after detonation back to the source of the bomb. It is simple, cheap, and allows tracing to a point of sale. Law enforcement, the ATF, and others have pleaded for it. Clinton tried to make it mandatory after the OK City bombing. Current experts say it would have helped with the current investigation.

WHO would POSSIBLY oppose this technology?

The same idiots who oppose a background check for a killing machine...."

""I don't think there's ever been an issue where the public has spoken so clearly, where Congress hasn't eventually understood and done the right thing,"" Bloomberg, who has become one of the most vocal gun control advocates in the wake of the Newtown, Conn., school shootings, said in a taped interview with NBC's David Gregory.

""We are going to have a vote for sure on assault weapons and we're going to have a vote on background checks,"" Bloomberg continued. ""And if we were to get background checks only, it wouldn't be as good as if we got both, but we demanded a plan and then we demanded a vote. We've got the plan, we're going to get the vote. And now it's incumbent on us to make our voices heard.""

To do so, the billionaire mayor said he's spending $12 million on an advertising campaign—set to launch in 10 states on Monday—that touts tougher gun laws.

""I think I have a responsibility, and I think you and all of your viewers have responsibilities, to try to make this country safer for our families and for each other,"" he said. ""And if I can do that by spending some money and taking the NRA from being the only voice to being one of the voices, so the public can really understand the issues, then I think my money would be well spent, and I think I have an obligation to do that.""

LaPierre says Bloomberg would be better off spending his money elsewhere.

""He's going to find out this is a country of the people, by the people and for the people,"" LaPierre told Gregory. ""And he can't spend enough of his $27 billion to try to impose his will on the American public. They don't want him in their restaurants, they don't want him in their homes. They don't want him telling them what food to eat; they sure don't want him telling them what self-defense firearms to own. And he can't buy America.""

The NRA chief criticized the gun control legislation currently on Capitol Hill, calling the proposed universal background checks a ""speed bump"" for law-abiding gun owners.

""The whole thing, universal checks, is a dishonest premise. There's not a bill on the Hill that provides a universal check. Criminals aren't going to be checked,"" LaPierre said. ""The mental health records are not in the system, and they don't prosecute any of the criminals that they catch. ... It slows down the law abiding and does nothing to anybody else.""

LaPierre then reiterated the NRA's post-Newtown plea for armed security officers in every American public school. ""Not a mom or dad wants to drop their kid off at school and leave their kids unprotected."""

http://news.yahoo.com/ariz-bill-passed-makes-cities-153751047.html,,[],Ariz. bill passed makes cities sell turned-in guns,"PHOENIX (AP) -- Arizona cities and counties would have to sell guns turned in at community buyback events instead of destroying them under a law passed by the Legislature.

The bill doesn't have any effect on guns seized by law enforcement, which already have to be sold to a federally licensed dealer under a law passed last year. But that didn't stop a lengthy debate that veered into the possibility that the gun used to shoot U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords might end up back on the street.

The bill is designed to eliminate a loophole in last year's law that requires police agencies to sell seized guns. Cities, including Tucson, have continued to hold buyback events and destroy the weapons, arguing that because they were voluntarily surrendered, they aren't covered by the law.

The Senate passed House Bill 2455 Tuesday on an 18-12 party-line vote and it now goes to Republican Gov. Jan Brewer for action.

Democrats argued that Republicans complain about the federal government when it requires the state to take action, yet they're quick to force local governments to do what they want.

""We hate it when the federal government mandates it to the state, and we're doing the same thing,"" said Sen. Lynne Pancrazi, D-Yuma. They also complained about victims having to deal with the knowledge that a gun that killed a loved one could end up back on the streets.

Republicans countered that allowing cities and counties to destroy guns that could be sold is a waste of taxpayer's money.

""It's not about protecting Second Amendment rights, it's about protecting the taxpayers,"" said Sen. Rick Murphy, R-Peoria. He also argued that the state doesn't require the destruction of cars involved in fatal accidents, so requiring guns to be destroyed is simply a feel-good measure that protects no one.

Murphy and Senate President Andy Biggs, R-Gilbert, pushed back at the argument against the state telling cities and counties what to do. Both noted that states retain rights not given to the federal government through the U.S. Constitution, while under the state constitution, cities and counties are subdivisions of the state.

During testimony before a House committee in February, Maricopa County Supervisor Mary Rose Wilcox said buyback programs give people who no longer want guns in their homes a safe way to dispose of them. Some are worried the weapons could be stolen, and others want to prevent a family member from accessing them, she said.

""There are many, many reasons, but they would never fathom that the guns they turn in would be recirculated again,"" Wilcox said."
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/16/us/sheriffs-refuse-to-enforce-laws-on-gun-control.html,2013-12-16 00:00:00,['Erica Goode'],Sheriffs Refuse to Enforce Laws on Gun Control,"GREELEY, Colo. — When Sheriff John Cooke of Weld County explains in speeches why he is not enforcing the state’s new gun laws, he holds up two 30-round magazines. One, he says, he had before July 1, when the law banning the possession, sale or transfer of the large-capacity magazines went into effect. The other, he “maybe” obtained afterward.

He shuffles the magazines, which look identical, and then challenges the audience to tell the difference.

“How is a deputy or an officer supposed to know which is which?” he asks.

Colorado’s package of gun laws, enacted this year after mass shootings in Aurora, Colo., and Newtown, Conn., has been hailed as a victory by advocates of gun control. But if Sheriff Cooke and a majority of the other county sheriffs in Colorado offer any indication, the new laws — which mandate background checks for private gun transfers and outlaw magazines over 15 rounds — may prove nearly irrelevant across much of the state’s rural regions.

Some sheriffs, like Sheriff Cooke, are refusing to enforce the laws, saying that they are too vague and violate Second Amendment rights. Many more say that enforcement will be “a very low priority,” as several sheriffs put it. All but seven of the 62 elected sheriffs in Colorado signed on in May to a federal lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the statutes."

Saturday's recall election was sought by gun rights supporters who say the council ignored their objections to a failed proposal that would have allowed the attorney general to oversee Exeter's concealed weapons permits.

Under current law, those seeking a permit may apply to either the attorney general or their local police. The town of 6,000 has no police department so permits are now handled by the town clerk. The council recently voted 4-1 for a resolution asking the Rhode Island legislature to take the responsibility for the permitting process away from the town, The Wall Street Journal reported. The members said the clerk lacks the resources to conduct proper background checks.

“My personal belief is those four are antigun, plain and simple,” Letita Davis, a resident who helped organize the effort told The Wall Street Journal.

“Our rights are at issue here – our Second Amendment rights as well as our rights to be listened to by our elected leaders,” she told the newspaper.

The council members say gun rights supporters are trying to make them an example for other officeholders considering changes to gun laws. The members say they were trying to beef up background checks for public safety in the interest of public safety.

“Gun-rights groups are pushing harder and harder to get lawmakers to stay away from guns altogether, and we’re seeing them give payback to those that don’t,” Joshua Spivak, a recall elections expert told The Wall Street Journal.

In September, two Democratic Colorado state senators were recalled over their support for changes to gun laws following the theater massacre outside Denver in 2012.

The four officials being targeted by the recall effort are Council President Arlene Hicks and Councilmen Cal Ellis, Robert Johnson and William Monahan. All are Democrats. A fifth member is not up for recall: independent Councilman Raymond Morrissey Jr., who voted against the resolution.

Should one or more of the council members be recalled, their council seats will go to the losing candidates from the last election. Daniel W. Patterson would get the first seat, Edward F. Nataly the second and Lincoln P. Picillo the third.

The fourth seat would be filled by a council appointment.

Polls opened at 7 a.m. and will close at 8 p.m. Both sides were concerned about a low-turnout with snow in the forecast.

http://news.yahoo.com/white-house-photo-shows-obama-skeet-shooting-233507241--politics.html,,[],White House photo shows Obama skeet shooting,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Two days before President Barack Obama's first trip outside Washington to promote his gun-control proposals, the White House tried Saturday to settle a brewing mystery by releasing a photo to back his claim to be a skeet shooter.

Obama had set inquiring minds spinning when, in an interview with The New Republic magazine, he answered ""yes"" when asked if he had ever fired a gun. The admission came as a surprise to many.

""Yes, in fact, up at Camp David, we do skeet shooting all the time,"" Obama said in the interview released last weekend, referring to the official presidential retreat in rural Maryland, which he last visited in October while campaigning for re-election. Asked whether the entire family participates, the president said: ""Not the girls, but oftentimes guests of mine go up there.""

Obama never mentioned skeet shooting prior to that interview.

The White House photo released Saturday is dated Aug. 4, 2012. The caption says Obama is shooting clay targets on the range at Camp David. Obama is seen holding a gun against his left shoulder, his left index finger on the trigger and smoke coming from the barrel. He is wearing jeans, a dark blue, short-sleeved polo shirt, sunglasses and earmuffs.

The National Rifle Association, which has rejected Obama's proposals, scoffed at the photo.

""One picture does not erase a lifetime of supporting every gun ban and every gun-control scheme imaginable,"" said Andrew Arulanandam, the organization's spokesman.

The NRA opposes Obama's call for Congress to ban assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines and says requiring background checks for all gun purchases would be ineffective because the administration isn't doing enough to enforce existing gun laws.

Asked at Monday's press briefing how frequently Obama shoots skeet and whether photos existed, White House press secretary Jay Carney said he didn't know how often. Pictures may exist, he said, but he hadn't seen any.

Story continues

""Why haven't we heard about it before?"" Carney was asked.

""Because when he goes to Camp David, he goes to spend time with his family and friends and relax, not to produce photographs,"" Carney said.

Obama is accompanied almost everywhere by at least one White House photographer.

Carney declined to comment on the decision to release the photo, which he had announced on Twitter. The release appeared to be part of a strategy to portray Obama as sympathetic to gun owners and opponents of his gun-control measures who argue the proposals would infringe on an individual's Second Amendment right to bear arms.

A top official with the National Skeet Shooting Association said the photo suggests Obama is a novice shooter.

""This isn't something he's done very often because of how he's standing, how he has the gun mounted,"" said Michael Hampton, executive director of the San Antonio-based association.

Hampton said Obama's remark about ""skeet shooting all the time"" and the White House photo would have met less skepticism had the president spoken about his hobby months before this new debate over guns in the U.S.

""Once it becomes controversial and there's problems, to talk about it then, that's where it becomes very debatable and is not being received as well as if he would have done this six months ago,"" Hampton said.

In interview, appearing in The New Republic's Feb. 11 issue, Obama said gun-control advocates should be better listeners in the debate over firearms, which was sparked by the December killing of elementary school pupils in Connecticut. He also declared his deep respect for the long tradition of hunting in this country.

""I have a profound respect for the traditions of hunting that trace back in this country for generations. And I think those who dismiss that out of hand make a big mistake,"" Obama said. ""Part of being able to move this forward is understanding the reality of guns in urban areas are very different from the realities of guns in rural areas. And if you grew up and your dad gave you a hunting rifle when you were 10, and you went out and spent the day with him and your uncles, and that became part of your family's traditions, you can see why you'd be pretty protective of that.""

""So it's trying to bridge those gaps that I think is going to be part of the biggest task over the next several months. And that means that advocates of gun control have to do a little more listening than they do sometimes,"" Obama said.

His gun control measures also have met resistance on Capitol Hill.

In Minneapolis on Monday, Obama plans to make remarks and discuss his proposals with local and law enforcement officials during a stop at the police department's special operations center. He's also expected to hear from community members about their experiences with gun violence.

Obama announced his proposals in mid-January, about a month after the Dec. 14 shooting deaths of 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.

On Wednesday, the same day the US Senate voted down gun control legislation, powerful Democrat Speaker Michael Madigan tried to push a restrictive gun control measure through his chamber. The result was an open revolt by downstate Democrats, with almost half the Democrat caucus joining the GOP to kill the measure. The bill went down 31-76, a rare defeat for the legendary Madigan.

Illinois is currently the only state in the country which doesn’t allow its citizens to have a concealed-carry gun permit. In December 2012, a federal appeals court struck down the state’s ban on concealed-carry permits, effectively ordering the state to enact the gun rights’ permit. The state is under a court-ordered deadline to pass the legislation.

On Wednesday, Dem leadership in the House moved legislation that would put severe restrictions on concealed-carry permits. It would provide that local law enforcement officials “may issue” permits, a provision that would allow local officials to effectively deny citizens in a particular jurisdiction a permit. “Must issue” permits, as long as certain criteria are met, conform more to our 2nd Amendment rights as local officials are not given the power to deny the permits.

My first political job was in the Illinois legislature a life-time ago. Madigan, who is Chair of the IL Democrat party and father to state Attorney General Lisa Madigan, was Speaker then, as well. He is among the more shrewd and calculating political power-brokers in the country. He almost never loses a floor vote.

It is possible, however, that he orchestrated the vote to allow his members from outside Chicago to vote against the measure. It wouldn’t be the first time he allowed the defeat of a progressive policy to protect members of his caucus.

Either way, the Democrat revolt on the gun control measure shows the bad politics around the issue. Even while Obama embraces gun control at the federal level, Democrats in his home state reject them. Unlike Obama, they have to face voters again.

The invitation from Rep. Steve Stockman (R-Texas), announced Monday, comes as some Democratic lawmakers have invited people who have been affected by gun violence to attend the presidential address.

Stockman, in a statement announcing the invitation, said he was “excited to have a patriot” like Nugent join him in the House chamber, and that afterward he’s sure “Ted will have plenty to say.”

All 23 of President Obama’s gun policy proposals

It was Nugent’s remarks at the National Rifle Assn. convention in 2012 that sparked a Secret Service investigation. Nugent, who endorsed Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, said that if Obama were to win reelection he “will either be dead or in jail” and called on conservatives to “ride into that battlefield and chop their heads off.”

The Secret Service, the agency charged with protecting the president, met with Nugent shortly afterward. Nugent later called it a “good, solid, professional meeting” and said the agency concluded “that I have never made any threats of violence toward anyone.”

Stockman, who served a single term in the mid-1990s before returning to Congress this year, has already attracted attention as an outspoken critic of Obama. He announced Friday that he would live-tweet the president’s speech using the hashtag ""#youlie,” borrowing the infamous “You lie!” outburst of South Carolina Rep. Joe Wilson during Obama’s speech to a joint session of Congress on healthcare in September 2009.

Stockman also said he would consider filing articles of impeachment against the president in response to executive orders Obama issued as part of his administration’s response to gun violence in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.

Earlier Monday, the White House said that First Lady Michelle Obama would sit with Americans from middle-class families whose lives the president believes would be improved by his policy proposals. Among those guests will be the parents of Hadiya Pendleton, a Chicago teenager who was killed in a shooting just days after participating in events in Washington celebrating Obama’s inauguration.

Obama’s proposal is expected to include a call for banning military-style assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, as well as strengthening the background check system for gun buyers. While Congress would have to approve those major steps, he may also lay out 19 actions he can take by executive order, such as mandating that federal agencies gather data on gun safety.

In the wake of the schoolroom massacre in Newtown, Conn., and many other brutal gun-related tragedies in recent months, ideas for dealing with school safety and mental illness are also said to be on Obama’s list. But most of the attention will be directed at his gun control plan, and much of it will be hotheaded and shrill.

The usual gun rights lunatics are preemptively saying it may be necessary to take up arms to stop the government from confiscating everyone’s guns. Rabid rocker Ted Nugent has declared Obama’s proposals “psychotic” and said putting Vice President Joe Biden and Atty. Gen. Eric Holder in charge of the task force to come up with gun legislation is comparable to “hiring Jeffrey Dahmer to tell us how to take care of our children.”

Although assault weapons have been banned in the past without a loss of liberty, and no regulation Obama is considering comes close to negating the right to keep and bear arms, one congressman from Texas said he would push impeachment of the president for trying to nullify the 2nd Amendment.

Tea party hero Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky equated Obama’s proposed administrative actions with the monarchy of King George III and pledged to fight the president “tooth and nail” as if 2013 were 1776.

Clearly, the debate about guns is not going to be a reasoned discussion about how to better regulate the hundreds of millions of guns in America and keep them out of the hands of criminals and crazy people. At least on the right, it will be an exercise in paranoia and fear-mongering.

Meanwhile, in the sane state of New York, Republican and Democratic legislators have joined together to pass new gun restrictions that will ban high-capacity magazines, strictly limit ownership of assault weapons and ban their sale online. They did it quickly in a bipartisan fashion and Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed the measure into law on Tuesday. So far, the Empire State shows no sign of turning into a Stalinist nightmare. Other than the significant exceptions of Illinois and Michigan, gun deaths are generally lower in states, such as California, that have strict guns laws. New York was on that list even before this newest law was passed.

Of the annual 30,000 gun deaths in the U.S., only 200 are homicides resulting from acts of self-defense, according to the FBI. Still, no one is talking about stripping away the right of anyone to own a gun to scare off a prowler or hold off a rapist (even though most people shot by guns in homes are relatives and friends). The only types of gun anyone is talking about restricting are the assault rifles that former Gens. Colin Powell and Stanley McChrystal say should only be in the hands of soldiers -- the kind of weapon used by a mentally unstable young man to murder first-graders in Newtown.

But folks on the right disagree with the generals. Apparently, that is the kind of weapon they think they may desperately need in the event of civil war against the would-be monarch in the White House."

Five months after his resounding reelection victory, President Obama is bumping up against the boundaries of his political power in Washington as the core of his second-term legislative agenda moves into a still-divided Congress.

His ability to secure the three high-profile legislative items now confronting Congress — gun-control measures, reform of the immigration system and his long-term budget priorities — is likely to determine his domestic legacy. Obama’s plan now is to ensure that as much of his politically challenging agenda as possible is enacted, after months of effort to frame the policies for the American public and, perhaps more important, for the House and Senate.

Each of the issues that Obama is pursuing is being managed independently by the second-term White House team — an improvisational strategy that is testing the president’s ability to calibrate when to get involved and when to stay out of the way.

But senior administration officials acknowledge that only immigration legislation has a chance of resembling Obama’s ideal bill once it emerges from the Democratic-run Senate and the Republican-controlled House.

On his other major initiatives, they say Obama would settle for less than he claims he wants, a sign that he remains pragmatic in the face of partisan opposition that continues to limit his ambitions.

“I have the same worry about all of these issues, and it’s the Republican House,” said Dan Pfeiffer, an Obama senior adviser.

Obama outlined a broad progressive agenda in his second inaugural address, and he has spoken frequently about the validation that he believes the public gave his plans by reelecting him last year. But second-term presidents traditionally have less than two years to secure a legislative agenda before lame-duck status sets in, and Obama already has seen his popular support shrink in recent months from its post-

election highs.

The election also did not change the basic political dynamic in Washington: a Democratic president in conflict with congressional Republicans, only some of whom believe last year’s election represented a call for compromise.

Each morning, the new White House chief of staff, Denis McDonough, reviews the overall legislative progress with senior staff. Inside the White House, each issue has a group responsible for its day-to-day management on Capitol Hill.

The strategy has led Obama to alternately court Senate Republicans — as he did last week in his second such dinner with a dozen of them — and to scold them before outside-the-Beltway audi-

ences, as he did this month in denouncing GOP threats to block gun-control legislation. Advisers say he does so to keep the political momentum alive in Washington for measures with strong public support outside the capital.

After months of campaigning for his agenda, two of his priorities appear to be inching through the Democratic-controlled Senate: a compromise on gun-purchase background checks was announced last week and another deal is expected this week on immigration.

But the budget he announced last week, which proposed restricting cost-of-living increases for Social Security, appears to have angered his own supporters more than it has convinced Republicans. It is an issue on which his strongest political leverage lies in going against his own party.

“I think they put something on the table which no Democrat should ever put on the table,” said Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. “It’s not okay to be bargained with. The risk is that voters mistakenly identify his budget priorities with all of ours.”

Immigration

After outlining what he wants in an immigration bill, Obama has largely taken a hands-off approach to designing the legislation, now the subject of negotiations among a bipartisan group of senators known as the Gang of Eight.

The strategy was adopted soon after his second-term inauguration, when Obama, eager to push the issue after winning more than 70 percent of the Latino vote, prepared to introduce his own bill during a visit to Las Vegas to break a long-standing deadlock among Senate negotiators.

Administration officials said Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), a Gang of Eight member, called the White House a few days before the Jan. 29 event. Schumer said the group was close to reaching consensus on a bill and asked Obama to hold off on announcing his own in order to avoid disrupting the talks.

Obama agreed.

“On any issue where there is progress being made, we don’t want to get in the way,” said a senior administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the White House legislative strategy and assess its prospects. “Every one of these issues has potential pitfalls and potential opportunities.”

Inside the White House, the issue is being managed by Cecilia Muñoz, director of the Domestic Policy Council. Administration officials acknowledge that immigration is the issue on which they can be the most patient, given that many Republicans are eager to repair relations with the fast-growing Latino electorate after the November election.

While Obama has allowed Senate negotiators to work on a compromise that can win approval, a White House staff member attends each staff-level meeting to monitor progress and assist with the technical aspects of writing the bill.

“We know we have the upper hand on immigration,” the administration official said, acknowledging that Obama has far less sway when it comes to gun-

control measures and the budget.

Guns

Obama has employed an outside-the-Beltway strategy on guns, traveling to the sites of mass shootings to implore Congress to take action.

White House aides believe that the school massacre in Newtown, Conn., in December, in which a gunman killed 20 children and six adult staff members, created the first political moment in decades for Congress to tighten gun laws. A large majority of the public supports tighter restrictions, but many in Congress would rather not confront the powerful gun rights lobby.

Obama’s aides also worry that the political environment could change quickly unless the president keeps pressuring Congress to act, which he did Monday when he visited the University of Hartford in the company of Newtown parents.

This weekend, for the first time ever, Obama turned his weekly radio address over to someone other than Vice President Biden: Francine Wheeler, whose 6-year-old son, Ben, was fatally shot in Newtown’s Sandy Hook Elementary School.

“Please help us do something before our tragedy becomes your tragedy,” Wheeler said, adding that the Senate hasn’t “yet passed any bills that will help keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people. “

The president began the year with a sweeping set of proposals to ban military-style assault weapons, limit the size of ammunition magazines, require background checks for virtually all weapons sales and increase funding for mental health care, among other issues.

Yet it has become increasingly clear to the administration that most of the ambitious ideas don’t have enough support to pass Congress. The issue is being managed by Biden’s office, and the White House is trying to strike a balance between when to pressure lawmakers and when to accept a compromise, even if it is far more modest than originally envisioned.

Obama took the latter approach last week when he praised a bipartisan deal to expand background checks, while acknowledging it is not as expansive as he wanted.

Advisers concede that the most high-profile of the Obama proposals — renewing the expired federal ban on assault weapons — has virtually no chance of becoming law.

“You have to have an analysis of the possible,” the senior administration official said. “Anything we do on guns is a positive for the country.”

Budget

Obama’s continuing struggles over the budget, perhaps more than anything else, show the limits of his power.

White House officials believe that Obama won the public argument over taxes and spending in the recent presidential election — a long “outside game” that Obama hopes will translate into leverage inside the Beltway.

Now the administration is trying to coax Republicans into a budget compromise that would replace across-the-board spending cuts, known as the sequester, that took effect last month and undercut Obama’s vision for how to build the economy.

Last week, Obama presented a budget that he said did not reflect his ideal view but that he believes might appeal to moderate Republicans looking to put fiscal fights behind them.

The budget fully incorporates the offer Obama made to House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) in December during “fiscal cliff” talks, embracing policies such as cuts to Social Security benefits that are noxious to many Democrats.

Obama is counting on preliminary discussions to try to reconcile separate budgets passed by House Republicans and Senate Democrats last month, although it’s not clear whether those talks will reach a more serious phase.

As Congress goes through that process, Obama plans to continue reaching out to Republicans who may be open to a deal.

“There’s an awful lot of work to be done,” said Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) after the latest GOP dinner with Obama on Wednesday. “But these overtures are encouraging.”

White House aides are looking for help from lawmakers such as Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who organized the guest list for the first dinner with Obama and suggested he would be open to a compromise that raises revenue in exchange for significant entitlement reform.

But White House officials acknowledge there is no clear path toward a deal, meaning that sequester spending cuts are likely to remain in place for the foreseeable future.

The budget process is being handled by the same men who have been running it for several years: National Economic Council Director Gene Sperling and deputy chief of staff Rob Nabors. Any progress on the budget will rely on Republicans agreeing to at least some degree of higher tax revenue, White House officials said, by way of scaling back tax breaks that benefit the wealthy.

Administration officials say the only hope of getting an agreement through the House is to have resounding support in the Senate. They concede they will need to work to get even some Democrats on board given the changes to Social Security now on the table.

“The best strategy for the House is to do as well as we can in the Senate,” the administration official said. “Step two is to get as many Democrats as possible.”

http://news.yahoo.com/ariz-bill-passed-makes-cities-sell-turned-guns-125026520.html,,[],Ariz. bill passed makes cities sell turned-in guns,"PHOENIX (AP) — Arizona cities and counties would have to sell guns turned in at community buyback events instead of destroying them under a law passed by the Legislature.

The bill doesn't have any effect on guns seized by law enforcement, which already have to be sold to a federally licensed dealer under a law passed last year. But that didn't stop a lengthy debate that veered into the possibility that the gun used to shoot U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords might end up back on the street.

The bill is designed to eliminate a loophole in last year's law that requires police agencies to sell seized guns. Cities, including Tucson, have continued to hold buyback events and destroy the weapons, arguing that because they were voluntarily surrendered, they aren't covered by the law.

The Senate passed House Bill 2455 Tuesday on an 18-12 party-line vote and it now goes to Republican Gov. Jan Brewer for action.

Democrats argued that Republicans complain about the federal government when it requires the state to take action, yet they're quick to force local governments to do what they want.

""We hate it when the federal government mandates it to the state, and we're doing the same thing,"" said Sen. Lynne Pancrazi, D-Yuma. They also complained about victims having to deal with the knowledge that a gun that killed a loved one could end up back on the streets.

Republicans countered that allowing cities and counties to destroy guns that could be sold is a waste of taxpayer's money.

""It's not about protecting Second Amendment rights, it's about protecting the taxpayers,"" said Sen. Rick Murphy, R-Peoria. He also argued that the state doesn't require the destruction of cars involved in fatal accidents, so requiring guns to be destroyed is simply a feel-good measure that protects no one.

Murphy and Senate President Andy Biggs, R-Gilbert, pushed back at the argument against the state telling cities and counties what to do. Both noted that states retain rights not given to the federal government through the U.S. Constitution, while under the state constitution, cities and counties are subdivisions of the state.

During testimony before a House committee in February, Maricopa County Supervisor Mary Rose Wilcox said buyback programs give people who no longer want guns in their homes a safe way to dispose of them. Some are worried the weapons could be stolen, and others want to prevent a family member from accessing them, she said.

""There are many, many reasons, but they would never fathom that the guns they turn in would be recirculated again,"" Wilcox said."

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/08/29/missouri-poised-to-enact-bill-to-nullify-federal-gun-control-laws/,2013-08-29 00:00:00,[],Missouri poised to enact measure nullifying federal gun laws,"The Republican-led Missouri Legislature is expected to override Gov. Jay Nixon’s veto of a bill that would expand gun rights and make federal gun regulations unenforceable -- even as similar laws adopted in other states to buck federal gun rules face legal challenges.

Several of Nixon’s fellow Democrats told The Associated Press that they would vote to override his veto when lawmakers convene in September, even while agreeing with the governor that the bill couldn’t survive a court challenge. Many of them noted that in some parts of Missouri, a “no” vote on gun legislation could be career ending.

The legislation would make it a misdemeanor for federal agents to attempt to enforce any federal gun regulations that “infringe on the people’s right to keep and bear arms.” The same criminal charges would apply to journalists who publish any identifying information about gun owners. The charge would be punishable by up to a year in jail and a $1,000 fine.

Nixon said the bill infringes on the U.S. Constitution by giving precedence to state law over federal laws and by limiting the First Amendment rights of media.

The legislation is one of the boldest measures yet in a recent national trend in which states are attempting to nullify federal laws. A recent Associated Press analysis found that about four-fifths of the states have enacted local laws that directly reject or ignore federal laws on gun control, marijuana use, health insurance requirements and identification standards for driver’s licenses. Relatively few of those go so far as to threaten criminal charges against federal authorities.

The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last week ruled against a series of laws enacted in Montana that attempt to declare that federal firearms regulations don't apply to guns made and kept in that state. Similar laws have been adopted in other states.

In the Montana case, the Justice Department successfully argued that the courts have already decided Congress can use its power to regulate interstate commerce to set standards on such items as guns.

The ruling has the potential to affect similar laws in several other states and leaves open the possibility of an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.

The state of Montana has intervened in support of its law. The case also attracted the support of Utah, Alaska, Idaho, Michigan, Nebraska, South Carolina, South Dakota, West Virginia, and Wyoming.

In Missouri, gun rights legislation typically has received bipartisan support. In 2003, the Republican-led Legislature overrode Democratic Gov. Bob Holden’s veto of legislation legalizing concealed guns with the help of more than two dozen Democrats. That same year, Democrats helped Republicans to override another Holden veto of a bill limiting lawsuits against gun manufacturers.

“We love our guns and we love hunting. It’s not worth the fight for me to vote against it,” said Rep. T.J. McKenna, D-Festus. But, he added, “the bill is completely unconstitutional, so the courts are going to have to throw it out.”

McKenna was among 11 House Democrats who joined Republicans to pass the Missouri gun legislation in May, by a 116-38 vote. The bill cleared the Senate 26-6, with two Democrats supporting it. A veto override needs a two-thirds majority in both chambers, or 109 votes in the House and 23 in the Senate.

Republicans hold 24 Senate seats. Although Republicans currently hold 109 House seats, they’re down at least one of their own. Rep. Jay Barnes was the only Republican to vote against the original bill and said he opposes a veto override.

“Our Constitution is not a Chinese buffet, which we like and do not like,” the Jefferson City attorney told the AP. “The First Amendment is part of the Constitution that we must uphold. … (And) the supremacy clause means that states cannot criminalize the activities of agents of the federal government.”

If the rest of the Republicans stick together, and none are absent, that means they will need at least one Democratic vote to override the veto.

But so far, at least three House Democrats McKenna, Keith English of Florissant and Ben Harris of Hillsboro said they would support a veto override, and Democratic Rep. Jeff Roorda of Barnhart said he was leaning toward it.

“Being a rural-area Democrat, if you don’t vote for any gun bill, it will kill you,” Harris said. “That’s what the Republicans want you to do is vote against it, because if you vote against it, they’ll send one mailer every week just blasting you about guns, and you’ll lose” re-election.

Four other Democrats who voted for the bill told the AP they were now undecided. At least one of the original Democratic “yes” votes Rep. Steve Hodges, of East Prairie said he would switch to a “no.”

This year’s vetoed gun bill is entitled the “Second Amendment Preservation Act” a label that some Democrats said makes it politically risky to oppose.

Democratic Rep. Ed Schieffer, who proclaims himself “100 percent pro-gun,” said he voted for the bill in May with an eye toward a potential 2014 state Senate campaign against Republican Rep. Jeanie Riddle, of Mokane, who also supported the bill. Schieffer, of Troy, said he is undecided whether to support a veto override.

“I personally believe that any higher court will probably rule this particular gun law unconstitutional on that, I probably agree that the governor’s right,” Schieffer said. “But I may end up still voting for the gun bill, because I don’t want to be on record for not supporting guns.”

That’s good news. On the minus side, there’s what is happening in California.

Don’t get us wrong, there are some worthwhile bills floating around in Sacramento. But most of the bills either introduced or under proposal seem primarily designed to seize headlines on behalf of individual lawmakers in the aftermath of the Newtown, Conn., school massacre. As much as we support stricter gun-control laws, we don’t want just any old bill to pass; we want laws that will help solve demonstrable problems. California already ranks No. 1 in the nation when it comes to strict gun laws, according to the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. If the rest of the nation took actions as strong as the Golden State already has, interstate gun trafficking would be far more difficult and the entire country would be immeasurably safer.

So does California need to do even more? To some degree, yes. There are still loopholes that allow felons and the mentally ill to acquire guns, and where possible, these should be closed. But most of the bills that are currently being considered wouldn’t address them, and in many ways the state would be better off enforcing the laws already on the books than imposing new ones.

SLIDESHOW: The 10 trigger-happiest states in America

As just one example of a questionable bill, there is AB 48 from Assemblywoman Nancy Skinner (D-Berkeley), which would apply to the sale of ammunition many of the same requirements the state now imposes when guns are sold, such as licensing sellers and requiring sales to be reported to the Department of Justice. The cost of all that? Unknown. A proposal from Assemblyman Roger Dickinson (D-Sacramento), meanwhile, would tax ammunition sales to pay for screening young children for mental illness. Yes, there is a connection between mental illness and mass murder, but it takes a flight of fancy to see this as a reasonable use for a tax that would mainly be paid by hunters.

Again, that’s not to say there isn’t room for progress. Imposing higher taxes on ammunition is a fine idea if the proceeds are spent on something more directly related, such as preventing gun violence. Also promising is a bill from state Sens. Mark Leno (D-San Francisco) and President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg (D-Sacramento) that would help officials pay for tracking and seizing firearms that were bought legally but whose owners were later convicted of felonies or diagnosed with mental illness. Although it would cost an estimated $25 million to clear the backlog of these gun owners within three years, the lawmakers think they’ve found a funding source in a $20-million surplus in the account in which fees are deposited when gun buyers register for new purchases. They should pursue it."

Savage Has Covered The Supreme Court', 'Legal Issues For The Los Angeles Times In The Washington Bureau Since']",Supreme Court turns down challenge to N.Y. concealed-carry law,"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court left in doubt Monday whether gun owners have a 2nd Amendment right to carry a firearm in public.

Without a comment or dissent, the justices turned down a gun-rights challenge to a New York law that strictly limits who can legally carry a weapon when they are on the streets. To obtain a “concealed carry” permit, New Yorkers must convince a county official that they have a “special need for protection” that goes beyond living or working in a high-crime area.

Only about one-tenth of 1% of New Yorkers have concealed-carry permits, compared to more than 6% in the neighboring states of Connecticut and Pennsylvania, the court was told.

Several gun owners who were denied a “concealed carry” permit sued, arguing they had a 2nd Amendment right to carry a gun for self-defense.

Rather than hear their appeal, the high court let stand a ruling by a federal appeals court that held states have broad authority to regulate guns in public.

New York Atty. Gen. Eric Schneiderman said the decision keeps in place the state’s “sensible and effective regulations of concealed handguns. This is a victory for families across New York who are rightly concerned about the scourge of gun violence.”

The court’s refusal to hear an appeal does not set a legal precedent, and the justices do not explain their reasons for turning away a case.

For now, however, the reach of the 2nd Amendment right “to keep and bear arms” remains uncertain.

In a pair of decisions in 2008 and 2010, the Supreme Court struck down ordinances in Washington and Chicago because they prohibited all private possession of handguns, including keeping a gun at home for self-defense. The justices did not address whether this right to self-defense includes a right to be armed in public.

Most states allow law-abiding gun owners to obtain a concealed-carry permit.

However, at least six states besides New York, including California and Illinois, have laws that make it difficult or nearly impossible for gun owners to obtain a permit that allows them to be armed in public.

Those laws are under challenge in the lower courts.

The Illinois law, the nation’s strictest, was struck down in December by the U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago. State lawmakers are considering a new law that would permit at least some gun owners to obtain a license for carrying a weapon.

The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco has also heard several 2nd Amendment challenges to counties in California that routinely deny concealed-carry permits.

The justices may well revisit the issue after rulings by several other lower courts.

State bill would ban magazines that hold 15+ rounds

Wyo.%2C Texas have expressed interest in Magpul%27s business

State Democrats would allow Magpul to sell large magazines out of state

ERIE, Colo. (AP) — Unnoticed amid dozens of tract homes in the Denver suburbs, a nondescript industrial building is suddenly in the middle of the gun-control debate in Colorado.

Magpul, started in an ex-Marine's basement in 1999, is in a standoff with Colorado Democrats who want to restrict the size of ammunition magazines after mass shootings in a suburban Denver movie theater and a Connecticut elementary school. The company has issued lawmakers an ultimatum potentially worth millions: Pass the bill, and the business will move.

It's a bold threat from a company that, by its founder's admission, has distanced itself from politics.

""The people who wrote the bill didn't even know we existed in the state,"" said Richard Fitzpatrick, the founder and president of the company that produces magazines and other firearm accessories for gun enthusiasts, law enforcement and the military.

The warning from Erie-based Magpul underscores the political pressures Democrats are weighing as they advance the strictest gun-control measures lawmakers have ever considered in a state that still prides its frontier spirit. Other gun-control proposals include universal background checks, a ban on concealed firearms on campuses, and holding assault-weapon sellers and owners liable for shootings.

Opponents need only three Democrats in the Senate to vote no against the magazine proposal to defeat it, and two have already said they won't support the bill. But most Democrats are not budging.

""When you have the means available to you at every single corner to commit a horrendous act, we will continue to see what we've seen, which is the status quo, where unfortunately gun violence and violence in general is prevalent in our communities,"" said Democratic Sen. Jessie Ulibarri, who will be considering the magazine bill on Monday in the Judiciary Committee. The bill has already passed the House, and Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper has promised to sign it.

The bill would make it a crime to have magazines that can carry more than 15 rounds, with a stricter limit of eight for shotguns. People who own larger magazines now would be allowed to keep them.

As the debate unfolds, states have made overtures to Magpul, including offering to pay their moving costs. The company won't name the states, but Wyoming and Texas have expressed interest in netting the $85 million the company projects it will spend in Colorado next year in payments to suppliers, subcontractors and service providers. Magpul said the move would also impact its 200 employees, plus an additional 400 who work for suppliers and subcontractors.

""It's not so much, 'Oh, these people are making something that's going to cost Colorado lives.' We truly believe this bill will do nothing. It's a feel-good measure,"" Fitzpatrick said. ""But these (workers) will be directly affected.""

Fitzpatrick said the bill's requirement that all magazines have serial numbers adds enough production costs to make it worth leaving. He also said smaller magazines can be easily connected to each other — magazines can be hooked up to make a 60-round magazine, for example — and the company fears it would legally liable if people were to do that.

Democrats have tried to ease Magpul's fears, amending the bill to make clear that the company can still manufacture magazines of any size, as long as they're sold only out-of-state, to the military or law enforcement.

Republicans who oppose the restrictions argue Democrats are sending mixed messages about gun control to keep a company in Colorado.

""It's being hypocritical. These things are either bad or they're not,"" said Republican Rep. Brian DelGrosso.

Magpul argues that limiting magazine sizes will not reduce gun violence, and that criminals will find ways around laws, including going to other states to buy larger magazines. Magpul officials note that some of their products sometimes end up in California, which limits magazine sizes to 10 rounds.

""The solutions that people want to bring up are hardware solutions,"" said Magpul Director Duane Liptak. ""And they want to talk about this physical piece of equipment that's not inherently evil. It's not inherently good. It's a tool like anything else. It can be used for good, and it can be used improperly by people who have evil in their hearts.""

Supporters of the proposals say Magpul is bluffing and that a move would prove too costly.

""I don't think Magpul is about to pull out,"" said Bill Hoover, 83, whose grandson AJ Boik was among the 12 killed in the theater shooting. ""It's going to cost them a bundle of money.""

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/10/19/gun-rights-rally-to-break-century-long-alamo-tradition/,2013-10-19 00:00:00,[],Gun rights rally to break century-long Alamo tradition,"This is how to make another gun rally in gun-friendly Texas stand out: Tell everybody to bring their rifles and shotguns to the Alamo, the state’s most popular attraction, which sits downtown in the country’s seventh-largest city. And be sure to invite the state’s gun-friendliest politician, who also happens to hold the keys to the historic site.

When the organizers of “Come and Take It San Antonio!” made plans for a display of long guns today, this setting seemed ideal but the event is now drawing attention for breaking a century-long tradition against public demonstrations at the shrine of Texas liberty, where Col. William Travis and 200 Texas defenders famously died in a siege with the Mexican army in 1836. Such public displays have usually been relegated to an adjacent plaza.

Some are asking whether a pro-gun group has gone too far in extolling firearms rights, a feat considered near impossible in Texas. And whether a politician may have been too willing to accommodate them.

“We certainly consider the Alamo our family cemetery,” said Lee Spencer White, president of the Alamo Defenders’ Descendants Association. “Our guys died there and we take it very seriously.”

Inside the weathered stone mission church where the Texans made their last stand, “You instantly become reverent,” she said. “You feel the sacrifice and the emotions of those who died there. You can’t help but leave feeling moved and changed forever.”

But rally organizers say the site fits their cause, protesting a San Antonio local ordinance they say impinges on firearms rights.

“We’re doing this to show that we’re not going to back down,” said Victoria Montgomery, a spokeswoman for Open Carry Texas, one of the groups behind the event.

The gun groups organized the rally after a confrontation with San Antonio police two months ago. Police threatened to arrest several activists who were carrying their rifles outside a Starbucks.

Texas law prohibits open carrying of handguns but has no similar restriction for long guns. The Texas penal code, however, does bar display of a “deadly weapon in a public place in a manner calculated to alarm.” A San Antonio ordinance restricts firearms in public parks or at political rallies.

“We are going to fight for our rights, and it’s not OK for police to just say whatever they want and make up the rules as they go along,” said Montgomery.

In late September, the gun rights groups got permission to use the Alamo from the Texas Land Commission.

The four-acre historical site downtown includes the small mission church, whose foundation was laid by the Spanish in 1744, other surviving buildings and artifacts including Davy Crockett’s desk. About 2.5 million people visit every year.

From 1905 to 2011, the Daughters of the Republic of Texas organization kept the church sacrosanct from events deemed inappropriate. But the state took control after allegations of mismanagement by the Daughters. The decision on the long gun protest rested with Texas Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson, who as a legislator was known for carrying a pistol in his boot. The Marine veteran is running for lieutenant governor largely on a single-barrel platform of gun rights.

Patterson acknowledged his office had not developed rules on use of the mission. But he said he doesn’t think the restrictions should be extensive.

“Citizens who want to gather and exercise their First Amendment rights, who behave in a lawful manner, I’m not sure we have the lawful authority to say no, even if we wanted to,” he said Wednesday.

As for the long gun rally, Patterson, who as a senator wrote the state’s concealed handgun law, says he plans to explain to San Antonio city attorney afterward that the city’s ordinance is unconstitutional.

San Antonio officials disagree but say they anticipate no problems Saturday. “We are expecting it to be a peaceful gathering and within the limits of the law,” Police Chief William McManus said in an emailed statement.

Not all Alamo devotees object to the gun extravaganza. Stephen Hardin, a professor of history at McMurry University in Abilene, who has written extensively on the Alamo and spoke recently at a symposium sponsored by Patterson’s office, said the site is a natural rallying place.

“Free speech was one of the rights the defenders fought and died for,” Hardin wrote in an email. “Can you think of a better place for Texans to exercise their rights?”

But White, a descendant of George C. Jennings, who manned a cannon in the siege against Mexican General Santa Anna’s forces, sees this as an ominous step.

“You’re setting a precedent here,” she said. “Today it’s a gun rally. What is it going to be next month, next year?”"

The SHOT show draws more than 60,000 gun enthusiasts, dealers and manufacturers to see the latest weapons and accoutrements. The convention floor contains 12 miles of firearms displays, mostly military-style assault rifles, and many booths display the kinds of high-capacity clips the administration wants to ban.

On Wednesday, the brass from the NRA and other gun-advocacy groups spent the day in closed-door sessions planning a response to Obama’s proposals, according to people close to the groups who spoke on condition their names not be used in describing internal deliberations.

LaPierre accused Vice President Biden of lying when he said there would be an open discussion before the administration developed its plan to restrict access to certain weapons and clips.

“The NRA sat in on a White House meeting that was sold to the public as an ‘open discussion’ about how to improve school safety.” LaPierre wrote. “But that was a dirty lie. They didn’t listen to gun owners’ concerns…they didn’t consider any real solutions on how we can keep our kids safe. Instead Barack Obama, Joe Biden and their gun ban allies in Congress only want to BLAME you, VILIFY you, BULLY you, and STRIP you of your Second Amendment freedoms.”

LaPierre warned his members about Obama’s plan, saying: “Right now, they’re steamrolling ahead with legislation that would ban your guns, register your ammunition purchases and even force you to register the firearms you already own with Obama’s anti-gun bureaucrats.”

The president of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, which is sponsoring the SHOT show, said in a dinner address to more than 1,000 attendees last night that the huge multibillion gun industry is misunderstood.

“You didn’t cause the monstrous crimes in Newtown,” said Steve Sanetti, the CEO and president of the foundation. “And neither did we.” In his speech, he specifically addressed military assault rifles, which the NSSF has rebranded “modern sporting rifles.”

“Millions of law-abiding sportsmen across the nation own them, and when those misinformed about firearms say that 'no sportsman has any need for a gun that is only used to kill people,' they are in effect calling millions of American sportsmen murderers---not exactly the way to promote civil discourse,” said Sanetti.

LaPierre’s letter took a tougher line.

“The media has been on a vicious tirade to slander and intimidate you, me and our fellow NRA members, “ LaPierre wrote. “We’ve been called terrorists and worse. They’ve blamed us and our Second Amendment freedoms for the actions of violent criminals and madmen. Our lives have been threatened.”

Several gun industry executives now have 24-hour armed guards since the Newtown shootings, according to firearms industry officials interviewed here.

“But I won’t let these brutal and bitterly personal attacks on you and me go unchallenged. I’ll fight freedom’s enemies. I’ll fight to make our schools safer. And I’ll fight for your fundamental right to self-defense and your sacred Right to Keep and Bear Arms,” LaPierre wrote. “…I need you in our corner TODAY.”

Remembering the victims of Newtown: Their stories"

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/03/09/Sheriffs-and-Guns,2013-03-09 00:00:00,['Alfred S. Regnery'],Sheriffs and the Second Amendment,"“A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.”

Those twenty-seven words enshrined in the Constitution by our founding fathers clearly give us the right to own firearms in the protection of God-given liberty.

Most Americans agree with the right to bear arms. According to a recent Rasmussen survey, 65% of Americans see gun rights as “a protection against tyranny.” Among those 65% are thousands of uniformed local and state police officers who see real criminals on a daily basis who not only have not properly registered their firearms or submitted to a background check; regardless of what liberals and the Obama Administration try to jam through Congress, they’re not going to succeed.

As the Supreme Court affirmed in the 1997 case Printz v. United States, county sheriffs are the chief law-enforcement officers in their jurisdictions, with more authority than even federal agents. As such, sheriffs work for their constituents and must comply with their oath to defend both the United States and state constitutions, not do the bidding of out-of-control politicians in Washington who apparently recognize no limits on their power.

So elected leaders, such as Arizona Sheriff Richard Mack, Jackson County, Kentucky Sheriff Denny Peyman, Milwaukee County Sherriff David Clarke Jr., and others are speaking out against Obama’s campaign against gun ownership. Almost 300 sheriffs from across the country and at least 13 state sheriff organizations have announced their opposition to President Obama’s proposed gun control measures, pledging to defend the Second Amendment within their jurisdiction. That number is increasing on a daily basis.

While some liberal legal scholars find ambiguity in the unusual wording of the 2nd Amendment, most state constitutions are very explicit in allowing citizens to own guns. For example, the Ohio Constitution states “The people have the right to bear arms for their defense and security[…],” while Delaware’s Constitution goes further: “A person has the right to keep and bear arms for the defense of self, family, home and State, and for hunting and recreational use.”

However, with the Executive Branch under control of Barack Obama, and too many liberal Democrats in Congress, our Constitutionally-protected rights are under attack

Using the senseless carnage at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut as a vehicle (remember Rahm Emanuel’s comment that you should never let a crisis go to waste?), gun control advocates have shamelessly stood upon the graves of innocent children to promote their misguided political agenda. President Obama has already taken immediate steps to limit legal gun usage through constitutionally questionable executive orders; he promised more limitations during his recent State of the Union Address.

In Congress, the anti-gun efforts are lead by Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, who recently announced proposed legislation that would ban 157 makes and models of military-style “assault” rifles, pistols, shotguns, and semi-automatic weapons. In addition, she proposes to outlaw fixed ammunition clips that can hold more than 10 rounds and ban civilian variations of military combat model firearms.

Feinstein was the author of the 1994 assault weapons ban (which expired in 2004) and had access to plenty of data which suggests crime rates did not drop during the ban. Murder and violent crime rates never went above what they were in the year prior to the ban sunsetting. Most policemen will gladly tell you that criminals almost always use handguns.

Our rights are in jeopardy. Police officers, while they serve our communities proudly, cannot be everywhere at once, and law-abiding citizens must have the ability to protect their families before help arrives. It is time to support our police officers by standing up to President Obama’s anti-gun agenda."

So, luckily in my circumstance, having a family helps. … It gives you a better appreciation of what a lot of people have to go through and it does also, I think in the public's mind, soften you, presuming you're actually engaged with your family and aren't just using them as political props."""

But Tuesday, voters in the bluer-than-red state-of Colorado told Scarborough and company to go get their shine box. Here is their unforgettably awkward and red-faced reaction:

—

—

What we saw from Scarborough and company, in the months following the terrible murders at Sandy Hook Elementary, wasn’t even concern-trolling; it was The Sanctimony of Our Betters coming from those who had deluded themselves into believing the GOP and NRA were on the path to irrelevance unless they reversed course and restricted Americans’ Second Amendment civil rights with laws that would have done absolutely nothing to stop another Sandy Hook.

To listen to Scarborough, it was NRA that was losing its political clout. To listen to Scarborough, it was the GOP ensuring they would lose seats. “Oh, no,” Joe screamed! “The ‘lying‘ GOP is doomed if they don’t listen to me and hand Obama a victory on guns!”

Even after Manchin-Toomey died in the Senate, Scarborough and his peanut-gallery practiced a scorched-earth policy to hammer the NRA and GOP as out-of-touch, suicidal nitwits for not caving to their relentless emotional blackmail and cherry-picked polls.

Well, a funny thing happened on the way to Reality, a funny thing called democracy — something that would not have caught The Bubbled off-guard had they been adult enough to consider this poll, or perhaps this one. Tuesday in Colorado, although outspent by the opposition, everyday citizens, with some help from the NRA, booted out two Democrat State Senators for passing the same gun control laws Scarborough demanded the GOP pass in order to survive.

In other words, Scarborough was 100% wrong — it is Democrats and Bloomberg’s anti-gun group that took a beating for taking Scarborough’s advice.

So watch the video again… This what a boorish, unrelenting, shrill, dishonest, and holier-than-thou crusade looks like after it meets American Liberty.

""People who suggest that there's anything unusual about the delaying of a deadline in the implementation of a complex and comprehensive law are deliberately sticking their heads in the sand or are just willfully ignorant about past precedent,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters at a daily briefing. ""It's not serious.""

The administration announced last week that it would delay for one year the enforcement of penalties for larger employers who fail to provide health insurance for their workers, saying that businesses need more time to meet the overhaul’s requirements.

The announcement prompted outcry from Republicans – who have long tried to repeal or gut the 2010 law –who say that the delay proves that Obama’s administration will cherry-pick pieces of laws that it wants to execute while ignoring the rest.

But the grumbles haven’t been entirely limited to the GOP.

Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin, a Democrat, was quoted Wednesday in the New York Times questioning whether Obama could choose to delay the implementation of the so-called “employer mandate” without congressional approval.

“This was the law. How can they change the law?” he asked."

To some extent, Obama could argue that such changes should get him off the hook from his pledge, but the White House continues to claim that costs will not rise as quickly as previously estimated. But rather than $2,500 by the end of Obama’s first term, the White House says it would be $2,000 in savings by 2019—in part because the health care law will not even be fully implemented until 2014."

Confusion persisted Wednesday around the long-awaited opportunity for Americans to sign up for coverage through new health-insurance marketplaces, with the federal Web site for more than half the states remaining balky and health plans uncertain whether they had any new customers.

The federal site, Healthcare.gov, was sluggish and flashed error messages much of the day. The Obama administration said the delays were simply the result of an initial rush of people flocking to the site — 4.7 million unique visitors in the first 24 hours — while some in the health-care industry suggested that the problem was more serious.

Officials at the White House and the Department of Health and Human Services insisted that some people were able to get far enough into the site to peruse their insurance options, find out whether they qualify for financial help and ultimately enroll in a health plan. But administration officials, for a second day, declined to disclose how many people actually had enrolled and where in the country they live.

Meanwhile, interviews with health insurers, industry consultants, nonprofit groups and people trying to sign up for coverage suggested that the number was very low. Some companies that are offering plans on the federal site said Wednesday that no one had signed up with them.

“Very, very few people that we’re aware of have enrolled in the federal exchange,” said one insurance industry official, who like many in the industry, spoke on the condition of anonymity out of concern for possibly offending the Obama administration. “We are talking single digits.”

At center, Leidy Rambarde gives a presentation to clients about the Affordable Care Act, commonly called Obamacare. Sarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post Wait 1 second to continue.

A spokesman for one major Blue Cross Blue Shield plan in a southern state said that, as of Wednesday afternoon, it had not received word from federal health officials of any customers who had completed enrollment in the plan — even though a local news outlet had reported about a man who thought he had signed up. So, plan officials didn’t know whether the man’s enrollment was incomplete or whether the federal reporting of enrollment was running behind.

Whether the snags of the opening days — and the apparently small number of people enrolling right away — present a long-term problem is a matter of intense debate, given that consumers may sign up for the new coverage for the next six months.

Some insurers and policy specialists speculated that the small trickle of early enrollments reflects prudent decisions by consumers to shop carefully, exploring the price and coverage under the various health plans newly available to them. “I wonder if, besides the glitches, people aren’t going on to the system and being smart consumers. If they can get on, looking and comparing . . . but let’s not make a decision immediately,” said William Hoagland, senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center and a former top official at the insurer Cigna.

On the other hand, others said that the early kinks, especially if they persist, could undermine consumer confidence in a law that already has sparked fevered political opposition and widespread public confusion. “Everybody will give you a few days,” said Peter Beilenson, the chief executive of Evergreen Health, an insurer that is selling policies on the Maryland exchange. “But by next week, it’s got to be up and running.”

Experiences varied in the states, plus the District, that are operating their own insurance marketplaces.

In the District, access to the online marketplace, D.C. Health Link, remained relatively smooth, although city officials declined to provide figures to show the volume of second-day interest.

Maryland consumers continued to encounter “a significant bottleneck” in creating accounts that are the first step toward shopping on the state’s exchange, according to Joshua Sharfstein, Maryland’s health secretary. He said a central impediment is that Maryland’s system requires online verification of each person’s identity.

Sharfstein said technicians are developing workarounds, such as having consumers provide identity verification to the customer call center. That has led to times when the function to create accounts is not available.

Sharfstein said the exchange has had enrollment in the “double digits.” But, he added, “We know there’s a lot of interest.” On Tuesday, more than 1,000 people showed up at local health and social service departments around the state eager to sign up.

“We’ve been trying incessantly to get online all morning and we can’t get on, we can’t log in,” Linda Cornelius, a worker at the Montgomery County nonprofit Interfaith Works, said Wednesday. She is one of more than 300 specially trained consumer guides in Maryland helping people sign up for Obamacare coverage.

Virginia is relying on the federal exchange, for which no enrollment figures were yet available.

Kentucky, running its own exchange, provided especially detailed enrollment information, saying that it had signed up 2,989 individuals or families, divided roughly evenly between Medicaid and private insurance, according to spokeswoman Gwenda Bond.

Obama administration officials running the federal Web site urged patience. For example, people logging onto the site may run into a “holding page” for a few minutes before they are able to begin their applications. They should not refresh their browsers or leave the page, as they will lose their places in line.

Many people encountering problems have taken them in stride, willing to give officials the benefit of the doubt. For others, frustration has already started creeping in.

Beltsville resident Nancy Jean Beigel, 55, was among about a dozen people selected to stand with President Obama during a brief appearance Tuesday at the White House to tout the law. But after two unsuccessful attempts at signing up for coverage, once Tuesday and once Wednesday, she gave up for the moment.

“It’s a little confusing,” said Beigel, who earns $8,000 a year running a small cleaning service and likely will qualify for free care under expanded Medicaid. “It’s not so great.”

http://news.yahoo.com/obama-s-healthcare--fix--strictly-a-political-move-000041574.html,,[],"Obama's health care 'fix' strictly political move, experts say","At best, President Obama's proposed health care “fix” offers political protection for vulnerable lawmakers. That's because beyond giving insurance companies permission to continue offering individual health care plans that don't comply with the Affordable Care Act, the president's fix doesn't compel anyone to do anything.

So why even propose such a fix, and especially a remedy that, according insurance experts, could lead to more expensive premiums for the people the fix is supposed to help?

As Kaiser Family Foundation Vice President Larry Levitt explained to Yahoo News, the best ""fix"" supporters of the Affordable Care Act could offer is to simply let the current process play out.

""From the perspective of keeping the market stable and premiums down, a quicker transition to new coverage is the best approach,"" Levitt said. ""Any plan that allows individuals to keep their old policies will tend to raise costs and raise premiums.”

In other words, according to Levitt and other experts, Obama's proposed fix offers little in the way of actual help to consumers or even insurance providers.

What it does do is provide Obama (and by extension the Democrats in Congress) a scapegoat and a much-needed short-term political gain.

""This doesn't change anything other than force insurers to be the political flack jackets for the administration,"" an insurance industry insider told Buzzfeed. ""So now when we don't offer these policies the White House can say it's the insurers doing this and not being flexible.""

The president's proposal creates a number of challenges. For example, insurers are not actually required to restore canceled plans. And if consumers keep their less expensive plans, it will almost certainly drive up costs for those who are buying plans from the health care exchanges.

""If due to these changes fewer younger and healthier people choose to purchase coverage in the exchange, premiums will increase in the marketplace and there will be fewer choices for consumers,"" Karen Ignagni, chief executive of America's Health Insurance Plans, a leading organization of insurance providers, said in a statement.

Story continues

Levitt adds that it will be ""complex but not impossible"" for insurers to reverse course on canceled plans. But while that course is theoretically possible, the insurers have little incentive to reverse course and ""throw a wrench in the works in the bottom half of the 9th inning,"" as Levitt described it.

""It is unclear how, as a practical matter, the changes proposed today by the president can be put into effect,"" said Jim Donelon, president of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and Louisiana Insurance commissioner. ""In many states, cancellation notices have already gone out to policyholders, and rates and plans have already been approved for 2014. Changing the rules through administrative action at this late date creates uncertainty and may not address the underlying issues.""

Regardless of whether the president's fix does anything to actually help consumers, you can almost certainly expect more political fixes to be offered before the January 2014 deadline for all Americans to be insured goes into effect.

Republicans in the House are gearing up to consider a bill by Fred Upton, R-Mich., that would allow insurers to continue to offer non-ACA compliant plans on a yearly basis, while a potential Democratic bill in the Senate would require insurers to continue these plans.

House Speaker John Boehner said he plans to go forward with a Friday vote on the Upton bill. When asked if Democrats in the House would propose their own legislative fix, Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi told reporters, ""We'll do what we have to do.""

""My guess is that because the House and Senate proposals all go further in their own way, I would expect that they would stick around for awhile,"" Levitt said."

White was fired.

White was called into a meeting Friday afternoon with one of Mayor Vincent C. Gray’s (D) top deputies and told that the mayor “wants to go in a different direction,” White told The Washington Post on Saturday.

White said the mayoral deputy never said that he was being asked to leave because of his Thursday statement on health care. But he said the timing was hard to ignore. Roughly 24 hours later, White said, he was “basically being told, ‘Thanks, but no thanks.’ ”

White was one of the first insurance commissioners in the nation last week to push back against Obama’s attempt to smooth over part of the botched rollout of the Affordable Care Act: millions of unexpected cancellations of insurance plans.

In persuading Congress to vote for the health-care overhaul, Obama had promised that Americans who liked their insurance plans would be able to keep them. When that turned out to not be the case, Obama apologized last week. And to stem growing bipartisan dissent, he announced Thursday that plans slated to be canceled next year to comply with the legislation could be extended for one year.

While the president’s plan sounded like a simple fix, it rattled the insurance industry, which had set prices for next year based on many of its products changing to comply with the health-care law. Allowing some plans to continue beyond Jan. 1 could also run afoul of provisions in laws passed by dozens of states and the District to implement the Affordable Care Act.

In a statement issued Thursday, White hinted strongly that he opposed the idea.

“The action today undercuts the purpose of the exchanges, including the District’s DC Health Link, by creating exceptions that make it more difficult for them to operate,” the statement said.

He also pointed to a statement issued by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners that said the Obama order “threatens to undermine the new market, and may lead to higher premiums and market disruptions in 2014 and beyond.”

“We concur with that assessment,” White said Thursday.

White’s statement was removed from the department’s Web site sometime before Friday morning. Asked about the removal Friday, spokesman Michael Flagg said the department’s statement had changed.

“Our statement now is that we’re taking a close look at the implications of the president’s announcement on the District’s exchange and we will soon recommend a course of action after taking into consideration the positions of all the stakeholders,” Flagg wrote in an e-mail.

On Saturday, Flagg declined to comment on whether White had been fired, saying the department doesn’t comment on personnel issues.

A senior city official said White’s initial statement was sent to the mayoral communications director, Pedro Ribeiro, only minutes before it was issued publicly. It was not sent to Deputy Mayor Victor Hoskins, White’s immediate supervisor, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak about a personnel matter.

A formal statement critical of the president should have been closely vetted and approved by the mayor’s office, and White refused to acknowledge the misstep, the official said. White said Hoskins fired him Friday.

White said he thought he would have been derelict in his duties to not quickly make a statement on the president’s announcement.

“Everyone was looking for responses from the regulators. One of my chief concerns is always consistency and clarity in the marketplace — you can’t have something that big sitting out there without responding to it,” he said.

White had served as Gray’s commissioner for the D.C. Department of Insurance, Securities and Banking since February 2011. Prior to last week, his most high-profile and controversial role had been as chief of the department that took control of Chartered Health Plan, the city’s largest manager of health care for low-income residents, amid questions about “irregularities” in its finances.

Chartered was owned by businessman Jeffrey E. Thompson, who has been implicated in funding a $650,000 “shadow campaign” to elect Gray. White oversaw the successful sale of the insurer’s assets, and his department’s handling of the transition has been generally viewed positively.

White said he had known since he took the job that he served at the pleasure of the mayor. He said he was proud of his record and would have stayed.

On the president’s proposed health-care fix, he said: “I wasn’t saying I was against it, I also was saying I didn’t know enough to fully support it — I want to be clear, and I think it is, I was not speaking for Mayor Gray.”

This is what happens when you let this guy actually do stuff.

Last week, the Office of Personnel Management (sort of the HR department for the federal government) released its fix for the glitch in which congressional staff were in danger of losing their the employer contribution part of their health insurance. That would have meant that some staff couldn't afford to be insured at all. Under the fix, staffers will still purchase health insurance on the exchange, and will keep the employer subsidy (but not get the tax credit, or Obamacare subsidy).

Immediately, the Right screeched that Congress made itself exempt. FreedomWorks pretends like staff keeping their subsidies is an entirely new thing and that this is congress exempting itself from the law. Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) called it an ""outrageous exemption for Congress.""

As Jonathon Cohn points out, yes congressional employees are treated differently under the law. But it's because Congress adopted an amendment from Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley to make it so. Grassley thought he was being cute and putting Democrats in a bind when he suggested that Congress be put into the exchanges. Democrats thought, why the hell not, but in accepting the Grassley amendment, didn't get all the kinks worked out because Congress was the only large employer that already provided benefits being forced onto the exchange.

Making sure employees retained their employer contribution would have been an easy legislative fix, but Republicans aren't going to allow any fix to Obamacare, even one that benefits their staff. So OPM made the decision, giving the GOP yet another opportunity to screech about the law. But this time, they're screeching about their own provision. It gets more surreal every day."

Mr. Obama, addressing the annual convention of the Disabled American Veterans, said that his administration was finally shrinking a backlog of years of benefits claims — by 20 percent in the past five months. But new waves of claims were coming in, he added, including from aging Vietnam veterans able to seek help for ailments that may stem from exposure to Agent Orange, and from recent combat casualties suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder or traumatic brain injuries.

“This time of war may be coming to an end, but the job of caring for our veterans goes on,” Mr. Obama said. “And our work caring for our newest veterans has only just begun.”

The president noted that even though the last veteran of World War I died two years ago, survivor benefits still go to the children of those who fought in that war, as well as in the Spanish-American War, and even to the daughter of a Civil War veteran — just as benefits will go to the heirs of what he called “the 9/11 generation.”"

Angering Republicans who lead the House, Mr. Reid kept the Senate shuttered on Sunday, in a calculated move to stall action on the House measure until Monday afternoon, just hours before the government’s spending authority runs out at midnight.

Without a complete capitulation by House Republicans, large sections of the government would close, hundreds of thousands of workers would be furloughed without pay, and millions more would be asked to work for no pay.

Polls show that the public is already deeply unhappy with its leaders in Congress, and the prospect of the first government shutdown in 17 years would be the latest dispiriting development. With a temporary shutdown appearing inevitable without a last-ditch compromise, the battle on Sunday became as much about blaming the other side as searching for a solution."

Shear']","Inside the Race to Rescue a Health Care Site, and Obama","When the problems occur — and they still do — the command center sees them first, in charts that suddenly spike on the television monitors. The data also serves as a reality check in a hypersensitive media environment. Last month, CNN reported that HealthCare.gov had gone down again. A quick look at the screens made it clear that whatever the problem had been, it was fleeting.

Mr. Zients’s metrics, meanwhile, are improving. When the repair effort began, response time — how long it takes a page to load — averaged eight seconds; now it is less than one. The error rate — how often users are unable to click through to the next page — was 6 percent; now it is 0.75 percent. When Mr. Dickerson announced that the day had ended with no major crashes and no one who could not log in, the engineers erupted in applause.

“That’s the job,” he said. “When things break, you have to fix them.”

But even as the White House points to its progress, the administration on Wednesday said troubles with HealthCare.gov had forced it to delay, by one year, an online exchange for small business.

Other people working on the project, speaking anonymously because they are not authorized to talk to reporters, say significant challenges remain.

Some of the companies building the system opposed an early decision by the Medicare agency to use database software from a company called MarkLogic, which handles data differently from systems by companies like IBM and Oracle. Some suggest that its unfamiliar nature slowed their work. By mid-November, more than six weeks after the rollout, the MarkLogic database — essentially the website’s virtual filing cabinet and index — continued to perform below expectations, according to one person who works in the command center.

In interviews, MarkLogic’s executives faulted inadequate computing power and instability at the site’s data center, as well as the failure to properly integrate their product, problems repeatedly cited by other website vendors.

But perhaps most important, it remains unclear whether the enrollment data being transmitted to insurers is completely accurate. In a worst-case scenario, insurance executives fear that some people may not actually get enrolled in the plans they think they have chosen, or that some people may receive wrong information about the subsidies for which they are eligible."

In a meeting Wednesday with the House Republican conference, Boehner said that a bill offered by Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.) to allow individuals to keep their health care plans fits in with that strategy. ""Remember the strategy for stopping Obamacare we laid out to you back in July. It had two components: Aggressive, coordinated oversight, and targeted legislative strikes aimed at shattering the legislative coalition the president has used to force his law on the nation,” Boehner said, closely following his earlier comments. ""That plan is being executed as we speak.""

The statements signal how much of a reversal of fortune Republicans have enjoyed since the Obamacare exchange glitches and cancellations of individual health insurance plans. The shutdown failed to make any changes to Obamacare, while the cancellations have caused even Senate Democrats -- including liberals such as Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) -- to sign onto a bill to allow individuals to keep their health insurance plans.

The White House opposes the Upton bill. However, Roll Call reported Monday that the White House is exploring an ""administrative fix"" to cancellations. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Thursday morning that there may be a presidential announcement on Obamacare by midday.

A Boehner spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The uninsured are clearly the biggest beneficiaries of the legislation, which would extend the health care safety net for the lowest-income Americans.

The legislation is meant to provide coverage for as many as 32 million people who have been shut out of the market — whether because insurers deem them too sick or because they cannot afford ever-rising insurance premiums.

For people already covered by a large employer — most Americans, in other words — the effect would not be as significant. And yet, just about everyone might benefit from tighter insurance regulations."

At the annual meeting here of the nation’s Republican governors, the ones who are eyeing presidential runs in 2016 say they oppose the health care law. But there is sharp disagreement among those who have helped carry out the law and those who remain entrenched in their opposition.

These early divisions reveal not only the difficult calculations of ambitious Republican politicians as they look to the next presidential campaign, but also the complexities of being a governor rather than a lawmaker at a time when the party’s base is hostile to those who cooperate with Democrats.

On one side, Republicans — both the base and the political leadership — have decided that health reform is already a failure; that conviction is actually helping the leadership rein in some of the crazies, by telling them that now is the time to wait and let the political payoff from Obamacare’s collapse fall into their laps.

On the other side, Democrats see a law that got off to a terrible start but is getting rapidly better.

Which is right? There’s data showing a sharp rise in enrollments, but there are continuing problems with the back end, and then there are dueling anecdotes. It would be hard to assess all this objectively even if political passions weren’t running so high.

But one group has a strong incentive to be objective — and also has a much better perspective on what’s really going on than any lay observer. Namely, the insurance industry. So the shoe we’ve all been waiting to see drop — or not — was the surge of advertising urging people buying insurance through the exchanges to buy from me, me, me.

That shoe has just dropped, with $500 million of advertising spending now in the pipeline. Insurers think this is going to work.

Now, some people will see this as bad news. Obamacare is just going to add to insurer profits! And it will indeed make money for the likes of Aetna and Wellpoint. In an ideal world, this wouldn’t be happening: single payer would clearly have been a better system. But it wasn’t going to happen. This was the health reform we could get — and when it works, as the big money now believes it will, it’s going to make a huge, positive difference to millions of lives."

The Board', 'Which Operates Separately The Newsroom', 'Proceeds On The Presumption That Serious']","Finally, the Obamacare rollout","State insurance-buying exchanges — one of the centerpieces of President Obama’s controversial 2010 healthcare law — begin their first open enrollment period Tuesday, an event that both supporters and opponents have been eagerly anticipating practically since the legislation was signed 3 1/2 years ago. For the first time, low- and moderate-income Americans who don’t have health benefits at work will be able to sign up for comprehensive coverage at a discount, thanks to taxpayer subsidies that offset much of the costs.

The exchanges are opening their doors as federal and state governments are still struggling to implement some important elements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare. Some requirements, such as the mandate on larger employers to provide affordable health benefits, have been postponed. Outside California, some exchanges aren’t yet ready to offer certain features, such as online sign-ups. And in several red states, elected officials are actively undermining the exchanges and their uninsured constituents’ ability to obtain coverage.

Add to that the misguided effort by congressional Republicans last week to “defund Obamacare,” and you have a lot of drama surrounding the exchanges’ debut. Still, the test of the exchanges’ viability — and the sustainability of the Affordable Care Act — isn’t what happens on Day One. It’s whether they attract a broad and deep pool of the previously uninsured by the time the enrollment period ends March 31.

The idea of an insurance exchange has broad bipartisan support because the concept is elegantly simple: Give people an easy way to compare and sign up for insurers’ offerings and that will increase competition, hold down premiums and expand coverage. The technical challenges are significant, however, because the exchanges’ computer systems have to inter-operate with those of federal, state and county governments and the health plans that are offering coverage.

State officials and health plan executives say they’re confident that Covered California, the state’s exchange, is ready to handle the calls and Web traffic it is expected to receive on opening day. But that’s partly because most buyers are likely to enroll closer to Jan. 1, when the coverage becomes effective. Some applicants will run into problems regardless — that’s inevitable on a venture of this scale. It’s impossible to know how manageable those problems will be until people start applying.

Although some troubling glitches have surfaced, the delays and shortcomings experienced so far have been overblown. The exchanges will not invite insurance fraud on a grand scale, as some have suggested, nor will they will lead employers to stop offering health benefits en masse.

The real challenge for Covered California and its counterparts will be getting their message out to the uninsured, then persuading younger, healthier individuals to pay for coverage that they have been content to live without until now. Although insurers aren’t charging as much as federal budget analysts predicted, the price of coverage will go up for many of the healthy people insurers have been eager to have as customers, while dropping for many of the ailing and higher-risk people insurers have been reluctant to cover. That’s because the law requires insurers to cover all applicants, ignore preexisting conditions and charge older customers no more than three times as much as they do younger ones. It also requires adult Americans to carry coverage, although the penalty for going uninsured will likely be smaller than the premiums.

The subsidies will make a huge difference in the cost of coverage for many low- and moderate-income Americans. Yet a new survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that almost three-fourths of eligible Californians were unaware of the aid or assumed (wrongly) that they were ineligible.

That lack of awareness is one hurdle. Another is the relentless invective about Obamacare that’s reducing support for the law among the people who have the most to gain from it. But the exchanges have started telling the other side of the story, and their outreach begins in earnest Tuesday. Rather than getting caught up in the overheated rhetoric, consumers should explore Covered California’s offerings and measure the costs and benefits of the law for themselves."

Seriously. That’s what all the yelling and screaming is about. As my grandmother used to say, it’s hard to know whether to laugh or cry.

The GOP has tried its best to make Obamacare a synonym for bogeyman and convince people that it’s coming in the night to snatch the children. In fact, and I know this comes as a shock to some, Obamacare is not a mythical creature. It is a law, incorporating what were originally Republican ideas, that will make it possible for up to 30 million people now lacking health insurance to obtain it.

Officially, the law in question is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Republicans intended the term “Obamacare” to be mocking, which is perhaps why President Obama started using it with pride.

It is, indeed, an achievement of which the nation can be proud. About 48 million individuals in this country lacked health insurance in 2012, according to the Census Bureau, representing about 15 percent of the population. Other industrialized nations provide universal health care — and wonder if this is what we mean when we talk about American exceptionalism.

About 25 percent of people in households with annual incomes below $25,000 are uninsured, compared with just 8 percent in households earning more than $75,000. Do the working poor not deserve to have their chronic medical conditions treated as punishment for not making enough money?

Other rich countries provide truly universal care through single-payer systems of various kinds. Obama chose instead to model the Affordable Care Act after a program implemented on the state level by the Republican governor who became Obama’s opponent in the 2012 presidential election. Yes, before Obamacare there was Romneycare, a private-sector, free-market solution designed to be in accord with the GOP’s most hallowed principles.

But in the years between Mitt Romney’s tenure in Massachusetts and his presidential run, the Republican Party lost its way, or perhaps its mind.

The party shows no serious interest in finding a GOP-friendly way to provide the uninsured with access to health care. Rather, it pursues two goals at any cost: opposing Obama no matter what he does, and making people see Obamacare as a failure.

For the radical far right, making health care more widely available through the existing network of insurers, most of them for-profit companies, is a giant leap toward godless socialism. These extremists hold outsize power in the GOP — enough to make sane Republican officials fear, with some reason, that anything short of massive resistance to Obamacare could lead to a primary challenge and a shortened career.

Some of Obamacare’s provisions are already in force and seem to be having the intended effect. For example, young adults are now allowed to stay on their parents’ health insurance policies until age 26. In 2009, 29.8 percent of those 19 through 25 were uninsured; in 2012, 27.2 percent lacked insurance, a modest but significant decline.

Now the central provisions of the Affordable Care Act are set to come into effect — the individual mandate, the insurance exchanges, the guarantee of coverage for those with preexisting conditions. Republicans scream that Obamacare is sure to fail. But what they really fear is that it will succeed.

That’s the reason for all the desperation. Republicans are afraid that Obamacare will not prove to be a bureaucratic nightmare — that Americans, in fact, will find they actually like it. The GOP fears that Obamacare will even be credited with slowing the rise of health-care costs to a more manageable rate. There are signs, in fact, that this “bending of the curve” is already taking place: Medical costs are still rising much faster than inflation but at the slowest rate in decades.

Keeping premiums under control will require persuading lots of young, healthy people to buy insurance — and thus, in effect, subsidize those who are older and sicker. That is why a group called Generation Opportunity, funded by the ultraconservative Koch brothers, plans to tour college campuses with disgusting ads in which a creepy Uncle Sam subjects a young woman to a pelvic examination.

The GOP message: Whatever you do, don’t buy health insurance. It may be — shudder — good for you.

A Minnesota health care provider is testing a new program in the hopes of reducing ER admissions and keeping people healthier: they’re sending paramedics on house calls to some of the area’s sickest patients who might otherwise end up in the ER.



The need for such out-of-the-box solutions is clear. In the last year, one in five Americans went to the ER at least once for an estimated 130 million visits. The cost of all those ER visits is staggering, considering that the price for treating some of the most common conditions can range from an average of $750 all the way up to $73,000.

“We don’t screen for insurance at the door,” said Dr. Joey Duren, an emergency physician with North Memorial Healthcare System in Minnesota. “So in our country now, a big thing is that the emergency department is a safety net for people who don’t have insurance.”

Patients with chronic conditions like asthma and diabetes can spiral out of control without regular monitoring and land in the ER multiple times in a single year. The number of repeat patients is often staggering; some of whom visit dozens of times each month, according to North Memorial's chief medical officer, Dr. Kevin Croston.

“What’s really the biggest cost in health care are the chronic conditions where there are readmissions to the emergency department,” Duren said. “We realized we needed to create care that stopped that.”

That’s where house calls from the community paramedics came in. Since the program began last October paramedics have made more than 1,000 home visits, at a fraction of the cost for a trip to the ER. Although North Memorial doesn't have data yet on the savings, officials believe the program will help reduce admissions.

“The role of this community paramedic is helping people get on top of their chronic disease processes so they aren’t getting so sick that they need to come to us in the emergency department,” Duren explained. “We’re controlling their diseases so they can be handled in an outpatient setting versus having to come here or be admitted to the hospital for multiple days because they’ve gotten so far behind in their insulin for their diabetes or their COPD has gotten out of control.”

Chris Anderson is among the first group of paramedics who were specially trained to make house calls. He quickly recognized the value of those home visits.

“It’s when you get to spend more time with [patients], you get to find out what’s going on, what’s truly bothering them, what they need the most help with,” Anderson said.

The house calls have been a life-saver for folks like 65-year-old Victoria Denbleyker, who suffers from multiple, hard-to-manage chronic conditions, like diabetes, congestive heart failure, and rheumatoid arthritis—problems that used to routinely send her to the ER.

With doctors, Denbleyker said, “you don’t have that much time to really talk to them, even if you get the maximum amount of time, which is half an hour. Sometimes there are too many things going on. “

Without consistent monitoring, Denbleyker’s condition can rapidly descend into the danger zone.

“My system can change in a heartbeat,” she said. “I never know what is coming next. So the fact that they know what is going on with me means a lot.”

The Minnesota project started last October. To figure out which patients might benefit from the program, the hospital searched for anyone who had used the ER nine or more times in a year.

Nine was “the number we had to land on for our own survival mode,” said North Memorial's Croston.

Think that’s a lot?

“We’ve had some patients that were here 23 times in a month,” he said.

Croston said, “readmission rates are down for us as a health system, and that’s largely due to the fact that we’re intervening once they leave the hospital or once they leave the emergency department.”



Barb Andrews, who runs the program, says it’s a new way of thinking about health care.

“It gives us, as paramedics, an opportunity to be proactive rather than reactive,” she said. “The community paramedics empower [patients] to be able to manage their own health better in the home.”

And ultimately, she said, that can “keep them out of the hospital, keep them out of the nursing home.”"

The White House says Obamacare will be working by Sunday. Here’s what that means.

Much of the Beltway establishment scoffed at the promise of cost savings. The prevalent attitude in Washington is that reform isn’t real unless the little people suffer; serious savings are supposed to come from things like raising the Medicare age (which the Congressional Budget Office recently concluded would, in fact, hardly save any money) and throwing millions of Americans off Medicaid. True, a 2011 letter signed by hundreds of health and labor economists pointed out that “the Affordable Care Act contains essentially every cost-containment provision policy analysts have considered effective in reducing the rate of medical spending.” But such expert views were largely ignored. So, how’s it going? The health exchanges are off to a famously rocky start, but many, though by no means all, of the cost-control measures have already kicked in. Has the curve been bent? The answer, amazingly, is yes. In fact, the slowdown in health costs has been dramatic.

When the first attempt by the United States to launch a satellite into orbit, in 1957, ended in disaster, did Democrats start to cheer, and unify to stop a space program in its infancy? Or, when Medicare got off to a confusing start, did Republicans of the mid-1960s wrap their entire political future around a campaign to deny government-run health care to the elderly? Of course not. But for the entirety of the Obama era, Republicans have consistently been cheerleaders for failure. They rooted for the economic recovery to sputter, for gas prices to spike, the job market to crater, the rescue of the American automobile industry to fall apart. I get it. This organized schadenfreude goes back to the dawn of Obama’s presidency, when Rush Limbaugh, later joined by Senator Mitch McConnell, said their No. 1 goal was for the president to fail. A CNN poll in 2010 found 61 percent of Republicans hoping Obama would fail (versus only 27 percent among all Americans). Wish granted, mission accomplished. Obama has failed -- that is, if you judge by his tanking poll numbers. But does this collapse in approval have to mean that the last best chance for expanding health care for millions of Americans must fail as well?

The ""President as failure"" is a rhetorical device here, but it's all too assumed by journalists, and pushed by GOP flacks.

More politics and policy below the fold."

We’re on the cusp of a deep and entirely self-inflicted national economic wound because of a tragic clash of psychologies. In 2011, President Obama let the GOP use the threat of default as extortion; when he caved in during that standoff, and agreed to an all-spending cut budget deal plus the creation of the ill-fated “supercommittee,” the blackmailers won. Two irreconcilable lessons were drawn. First, Obama learned he can never let this brand of hostage-taking happen again, lest he weaken his office and assure the endless spectacle of governance by crisis. Second, tea party Republicans learned that, when push comes to shove, this president blinks. Little wonder they think Obama will shortly buckle again. But no sane steward of the office can allow the debt-ceiling tactics of 2011 to prevail once more. Thus, real danger is much closer than even the sliding stock market in recent days suggests.

We need a way out. It would be nice if Obama simply said, “let’s raise the debt ceiling just enough to accommodate the $1.2 trillion in new debt the latest Republican budget calls for” — but the GOP would assent only if the rest of its (deeply misguided) budget were also enacted. It also would be nice if the press pointed out (in between breathless countdowns to calamity) that we’re the only nation that even has a “debt limit” available to be hijacked as a forcing device; in countries with common sense, when a budget is passed, any new debt associated with that budget is automatically okayed. It would be nice, too, if Congress hadn’t made a foolish fetish of eliminating earmarks, so a shrewd set of courthouses and bridges in “deserving” Republican districts could have sealed a reasonable budget deal weeks ago.

Alas, we are where we are. And so the cry goes up from across the land: If only there were a deal to be struck that honored both parties’ values, a deal that advanced the cause of both economic rationality and social justice.

The surprising news is that, with a little imagination, that deal exists. It’s this: The president should offer to give states a waiver from the rollout of Obamacare if (and only if) they implement instead a system of universal catastrophic health insurance in their state.

How might this work? Governors could ask the Department of Health and Human Services for the ability to consolidate all federal cash now coming to their state for nonelderly health care — including Medicaid, the new Obamacare subsidies and, ideally, the cost of the tax subsidy for employer-provided care — to fund a universal catastrophic plan. (Regulations say such waivers can’t be sought until 2017, but Obama would offer to start them immediately).

Two (and only two) requirements would be imposed on the state plans. First, “catastrophic” would be defined relative to income. (A $5,000 deductible for a family earning $22,000 doesn’t make sense). Second, there would have to be some form of funding — perhaps via pre-loaded health savings accounts — to assure that people can pay for proper preventive care, typically shortchanged in catastrophic insurance schemes.

What would this deal accomplish? The president would show unprecedented “flexibility” vis-a-vis his signature domestic accomplishment, while getting Republicans to join him (finally) in endorsing the principal of universal coverage. (Since Obamacare will leave as many as 25 million people still uncovered, it is possible that many more Americans would become secure against financial ruin from illness under this proposal than under the Affordable Care Act itself).

Republicans can boast of plunging a dagger into the heart of that “evil” Obamacare; of moving states to the forefront of policy innovation, itself a conservative ideal; and of rescuing poor Americans from the clutches of that “second-class” system, Medicaid, because poorer folks would have private catastrophic/preventive plans instead.

In short, this deal walks everyone back from the brink and lets both sides and their allies claim important victories. House Speaker John Boehner and Obama could agree to a “term sheet” now, and pledge to legislate within a few months. Tea party leader Steve King (R-Iowa) told me Tuesday that this kind of deal held promise.

Of course, in Lt. Colombo’s famous mantra, “there’s one more thing” — the debt limit must be scrapped altogether. The president is right: The hostage taking can’t go on. In a sense, Obama would have submitted to “blackmail” one last time to get Republicans on board with universal coverage and to bury the debt limit forever as an instrument of policy. Rightly understood, this would cement the president’s legacy in ways even the unfettered rollout of Obamacare in current form can’t achieve. Meanwhile, in exchange for “slaying” Obamacare, Republicans would agree to have us join the community of nations that views the passage of a budget as authorization for any debt that budget may contain.

In the hothouse of today’s crisis, this deal may be beyond the imagination of those ostensibly in charge. But a few creative lawmakers on each side of the aisle could join to float something like it tomorrow. The alternative, I fear, will be some muddled repeat of 2011, a new chain of pointless fiscal cliffs that further diminishes the United States’ s standing in the world, or worse, an unforgivable but all-too-plausible “Guns of August”-style tumble into catastrophe.

Oregon is ahead of much of the country in implementing the Affordable Care Act. They've already got a preview of the exchange website up, where people can begin to research their options come October's enrollment period. Right now, it's largely limited to the proposed rates insurance companies are offering, but that's where the good news comes in.



""Posting rate comparisons company-by-company is a taste of what is to come,"" says Cheryl Martinis of the Oregon Insurance Division. Judging by the reaction, there's already an impact. Providence Health Plan on Wednesday asked to lower its requested rates by 15 percent. Gary Walker, a Providence spokesman, says the ""primary driver"" was a realization that the plan's cost projections were incorrect. But he conceded a desire to be competitive was part of it. A Family Care Health Plans official on Thursday said the insurer will ask the state for even greater decrease in requested rates. CEO Jeff Heatherington says the company realized its analysts were too pessimistic after seeing online that its proposed premiums were the highest. ""That was my question when I saw the rates was, 'Can we go in and refile these?'"" he said. ""We're going to try to get these to a competitive range.""

The state will be approving rate approvals from all companies in July, so the information available to prospective Oregon shoppers is just a rough preview at the moment. But it's important, because for the first time it's brought real transparency to this market—even between competing insurers."

SERGIO LIMAWhen funding for Dr. Pedro Hallal’s COVID-19 study was abruptly slashed, deaths from the virus had just surged to grim new peaks in Brazil.The reason? Hallal says the government simply didn’t like what his study was unveiling: that indigenous people are five times as likely to get infected with COVID-19 than other ethnic groups in Brazil. His findings came amid a surge in invasions of indigenous lands by soy farmers, cattle ranchers, and illegal miners egged on by friendly signals from Brazil’s denialist President Jair Bolsonaro.“I’m absolutely certain it was meant to shut me up,” said Hallal, an epidemiologist and professor at the Federal University of Pelotas, told The Daily Beast. “The study was showing results that they didn't want it to show.”Hallal, whose COVID research funding was cut last year, is not alone. Dozens of researchers studying the virus say they have been targeted by fans and allies of Bolsonaro, who has long styled himself as a Trump-like populist opposed to science, mainstream media, and the “corrupt” liberal elite.How Bolsonaro Seized Trump’s Crown as the World’s Worst COVID LeaderResearchers in Brazil claim they have suffered through relentless social media attacks, death threats, funding cuts, and arbitrary investigations over the past year as they seek to better understand the virus ravaging the country. They say these attacks are a thinly-veiled attempt at muzzling them and suppressing their work.Bolsonaro has downplayed the virus as a “fantasy” and “little flu,” railed against lockdowns and—until recently—rejected vaccines. “Brazilians need to be studied. They don’t catch anything. You see the guy jumping in the sewer, diving in. And nothing happens to him,” the president said of the virus last year.Even though COVID has killed 398,000 people in Brazil, the president and his allies have repeatedly questioned its toll and accused governors and mayors of inflating the number of deaths in order to weaken the president politically.“There is this conservative base that casts itself as the opposition to science,” said Pablo Ornelas Rosa, a professor at the University of Vila Velha in Espírito Santo. “If you are pro-science and pro-facts, you are labelled as a leftist, as a communist, as an enemy to the president.”“The health minister freaked out,” recalled Hallal, who was coordinating the study—Brazil’s largest epidemiological analysis of the virus and its spread across the country. The scientist maintains that at a press conference organized to unveil its latest findings, the ministry barred the release of data about the heightened risks to indigenous people. Hallal says he was never told why officials took issue with the findings.A few weeks later, the study—commissioned by a prior health minister who was fired last April after clashing with Bolsonaro—lost its federal funding. Soon, Hallal was being investigated by the federal auditing body after criticizing Bolsonaro in a livestream and his allies were being sidelined in university elections.On social media, the vicious attacks on the scientist poured in, including from Bolsonaro himself. Hallal told The Daily Beast that supporters of the president made threatening phone calls to him and even photographed him on the street with his family.“It was direct persecution, triggered by my stance on the pandemic,” he said. “Instead of correcting its errors, the government attacked those who were uncovering its mistakes.”Attacks have been particularly harsh against those questioning Bolsonaro’s stance on chloroquine, an antimalarial that he—along with Donald Trump—embraced as a “miracle cure” despite no evidence it could combat COVID-19. Bolsonaro quickly got behind the drug and ordered the army to sharply scale up national production. When the president got COVID himself, he took the drug over livestream and boasted that he was improving rapidly.Dr. Marcus Lacerda’s trouble began when he decided to investigate whether the drug really was a “miracle cure” for the novel coronavirus. In the Amazon city of Manaus, the research group he led had used chloroquine for years as part of its malaria research. As infections overwhelmed hospitals in his city last March, Lacerda decided to put his team’s know-how to work by testing the drug’s ability to fight COVID-19.But the team’s clinical study quickly found that chloroquine was not only ineffective against COVID-19, but high doses of the drug could cause severe heart problems in patients infected with the virus. The results caught global attention, spurring scathing critiques of Trump’s support of chloroquine.But, at home in Brazil, Lacerda’s team saw a different response. He says it started with a tweet by the president’s son, who accused the researchers of being a group of “leftists” who were intentionally killing people with high doses of chloroquine just to demonstrate the drug didn't work. This triggered a wave of attacks on social media by the president’s supporters.“People were saying that they knew where I lived, that I had killed people on purpose, that I would pay for this,” said Lacerda, an infectious disease specialist and a researcher at the Carlos Borborema Institute of Clinical Research in Manaus.Lacerda says he received a slew of attacks and death threats over social media. Concerned for the safety of himself and his family, he was forced to walk around with armed bodyguards for two weeks.“It was one of the worst experiences of my life,” he said. “It was this intense climate of fear.”Triggered by complaints from allies of Bolsonaro, state and federal medical bodies as well as public prosecutors opened investigations into Lacerda’s study. He says he spent the better part of last year defending his research in front of lawyers, instead of carrying out studies in a lab.The attacks on Brazilian researchers echo the United States’ own war on science, which intensified during Trump’s tenure as president. Scientists in the U.S. faced over 150 attacks during Trump’s presidency, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists.“Governments on the radical right—like those we saw in the U.S. and here in Brazil—are not prepared for science to show something that contradicts what they are doing,” Lacerda said. “When a study shows something that you don't agree with, you just take down the scientists.”The assault on science has had a profound impact in Brazil. Scientists say that the attacks they have suffered have derailed research or discouraged some to tackle studies linked to the virus. Others have left the country, pushed out by threats or disillusionment.“The sciences are being persecuted right now,” said Rosa, who has studied the behavior of Bolsonaro supporters on WhatsApp and Telegram. “We’re living in a really dark moment. And this has a direct impact on the research and the quality of scientific output.”Meanwhile, Brazil is still grappling with one of the world’s worst outbreaks, with a death toll second only to the United States. In recent weeks, infections have exploded, fuelled by highly-infectious new variants and weak lockdown restrictions. With doses running out, vaccinations have brought little relief.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) said Tuesday that she and several of her Republican colleagues in the House of Representatives are considering suing President Barack Obama for allowing plans canceled under the Affordable Care Act to be extended through 2014.

According to Politico, Bachmann, speaking at an event sponsored by the Heritage Foundation, accused the president of violating the constitutional separation of powers by changing the health care law through administrative means, rather than consulting Congress.

""That's the essence of lawlessness and now it's our time to defend our prerogative,"" she said.

When asked about the lawsuit by MinnPost, Bachmann's office said a lawsuit was not imminent, but was under discussion.

""She and some of her colleagues have had discussions about the best recourse to put a stop to his unconstitutional actions,"" a spokesman said in a statement.

Last week, facing backlash over plan cancellations under the health care law, Obama asked insurers to let individuals whose plans had been cancelled to renew their plans another year.

""Insurers can extend current plans that otherwise would be canceled into 2014 and Americans whose plans have been canceled can choose to re-enroll in the same kind of plan,"" Obama said. ""This fix won't solve every problem for every person, but it's going to help a lot of people. Doing more would require work with Congress.""

The White House later offered legal justification for Obama's fix to the Washington Post's Greg Sargent.

“The Supreme Court held more than 25 years ago that agencies charged with administering statues have inherent authority to exercise discretion to ensure that their statutes are enforced in a manner that achieves statutory goals and are consistent with other administrative policies,"" a Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson said. ""Agencies may exercise this discretion in appropriate circumstances, including when implementing new or different regulatory regimes, and to ensure that transitional periods do not result in undue hardship.”"

Steve King missed the message from party leaders about how supporting an immigration overhaul could help boost the GOP’s standing among Latino voters.

He just isn’t buying it.

“I’m incredulous with the conclusion they drew when the sun came up on the morning of Nov. 7,” the firebrand Iowa congressman said the other day, standing outside the Capitol. “They just said that Mitt Romney would be president-elect on that morning if he just hadn’t said two words: self-deport.”

It was a sparsely attended news conference: Just a handful of hard-line House Republicans protesting the immigration bill a Senate committee was poised to approve.

So it goes these days with the opposition to revamping the immigration system, a movement that has been more muted than six years ago when a similar effort successfully turned back a reform bill.

The opponents this time include a sizable coalition of tea party and conservative leaders, including many local-level talk radio hosts.

NumbersUSA, a group that has long fought to limit immigration, has run radio and television ads in more than a dozen states, seeking to pressure senators to vote against the bill. The organization’s president, Roy Beck, brushes off the idea that opposition has waned, noting that polls suggest Americans have mixed feelings about granting citizenship to immigrants. “It seems lonely — just us and the American people,” he said.

But the opponents face a much different landscape than six years ago. Not only are key Republicans not overtly attacking the proposal, but support appears much more solid among Democrats, who had also played a role in dashing earlier efforts.

The growing influence of the Latino electorate, which spurned Romney to help reelect President Obama, and the defeat of much of Arizona’s strict anti-immigration law in the Supreme Court, “created a lot of running room for Republicans to come to the table,” said Simon Rosenberg, president of NDN, a center-left think tank in Washington.

Republicans as well as Democrats have become more comfortable with offering legal status to an estimated 11 million people who have entered the U.S. illegally or stayed beyond their visas.

The lawmakers are being nudged along, in part, by the stories being told by young people brought to the United States as children who have become adults without legal status. These young adults, who call themselves “Dreamers,” after the Dream Act, a failed legislative effort that would have offered them a route to citizenship, have given a compelling voice to a once largely unheard immigrant population.

Frank Sharry, executive director of America’s Voice, an immigration reform advocacy group, recalls that a “sort of death march” took hold of the 2007 legislative effort as both sides found reasons to back away.

“I don’t think there are as many shaking Democrats today as there were in 2007,” said Angela Kelley, vice president of immigration policy at the left-leaning Center for American Progress.

One other element has weighed heavily on both parties: the White House.

Obama used executive authority last summer to defer deportations of Dreamers who came forward and registered. It was, for many lawmakers, a turning point.

Democrats saw the move as a political win that helped give Obama a 44-percentage-point lead among Latinos over Romney in the election.

Republican leaders have since sought to persuade reluctant colleagues that the time has come for Congress to fix the immigration system, lest Obama take further action on his own — and Democrats seize a permanent advantage among the growing Latino electorate.

House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) has privately pushed a bipartisan group of lawmakers to complete their work on the House’s proposed immigration overhaul. “We’re not going to be stampeded by the White House or stampeded by the president,” he said last week.

Advertisement

King says that there are more Republican lawmakers on his side than the few who stood beside him on that sunny spring day and that he believes more will join to defeat the bill as voters learn about it.

In the NumbersUSA spots, a man’s voice argues that an overhaul will allow too many legal immigrants into the U.S. who would then compete with out-of-work Americans for jobs.

Advertisement

The group has enlisted its 2 million members to corner lawmakers at home. “We’re hoping to shame the senators: ‘You’ve got these long lines of unemployed Americans, and you’re going to pass this sort of bill?’” Beck said.

Like-minded Republican opponents also exist in the Senate, and so far not one beyond the four who helped draft the bill has fully endorsed the overhaul.

King predicted that over time, Republican leaders would join him.

“If they’re not on our side,” he said, “I’d suggest that they are convertibles.”

(CNN) —

Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, one of Obamacare’s architects and staunchest supporters, is also the only top congressional leader to exempt some of his staff from having to buy insurance through the law’s new exchanges.

Reid is the exception among the other top congressional leaders. GOP House Speaker John Boehner, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell have all directed their staffs to join the exchange, their aides said.

After website woes, President pushes benefits of Obamacare

In the charged atmosphere surrounding Obamacare, Reid’s decision only gives Republicans more ammo to attack Democrats already suffering politically from the law’s botched rollout.

In September, Reid told reporters, “Let’s stop these really juvenile political games – the one dealing with health care for senators and House members and our staff. We are going to be part of exchanges, that’s what the law says and we’ll be part of that.”

With website deadline met, Obamacare scrutiny increases

That’s true. Reid and his personal staff will buy insurance through the exchange.

But it’s also true that the law lets lawmakers decide if their committee and leadership staffers hold on to their federal employee insurance plans, an option Reid has exercised.

Reid spokesman Adam Jentleson emphasized, “We are just following the law.”

Insurers still reporting errors on Obamacare applications

But Republicans are already taking aim.

“I’m sure that regular Americans who just lost their insurance will feel comforted to know that Senator Reid’s staff gets to keep their government plan,” a senior GOP Senate aide said.

Former Reid staffer Jim Manley defended his old boss, arguing that “the only people hypocritical here are Republicans, who made this an issue in the first place.”

And all four House and Senate leaders are required to relinquish their federal employee insurance plans next year and are choosing to enroll in the exchanges.

Obama gave a speech in the White House briefing room as a small but growing number of restive congressional Democrats join the Republican chorus that legislation is needed to preserve the policies being eliminated. The House of Representatives is scheduled to vote Friday on a bill sponsored by Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton (R-Mich.) that would permit health insurers to extend these health plans. In the Senate, Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) and others are backing similar bills to address the canceled plans.

""Insurers can extend current plans that otherwise would be canceled into 2014 and Americans whose plans have been canceled can choose to re-enroll in the same kind of plan,"" Obama said. ""This fix won't solve every problem for every person, but it's going to help a lot of people. Doing more would require work with Congress.""

Obama's health care reform law has been under siege since its faulty rollout on Oct. 1. HealthCare.gov, the online portal for health insurance shopping in more than 30 states, hasn't reliably worked during the first month and early enrollment figures came in well below expectations. In the meantime, between hundreds of thousands and millions of consumers have been notified that their insurance policies don't meet the health care law's standards and will be discontinued next year, in violation of Obama's vow that his law would allow people to keep their current coverage.

""That's on me,"" Obama said. ""We fumbled the rollout on this health care law.""

Obama vowed to press ahead with implementing his law, and reiterated that the health insurance market needs reforming to guarantee stable health insurance coverage. ""I make no apologies for us taking this on,"" he said. ""Because somebody sooner or later had to do it.""

""It took a hundred years for us to even get to the point where we could start talking about and implementing a law to make sure everybody's got health insurance, and my pledge to the American people is, is that we're going to solve the problems that are there, we're going to get it right, and the Affordable Care Act is going to work for the American people,"" Obama said.

Under the policy Obama announced Thursday, health insurance companies will be permitted to extend current policies, even though they don't comply with Affordable Care Act standards for benefits and financial protections, for their customers into next year. Insurers won't be allowed to enroll new customers into these extended policies, Obama said.

Consumers should still examine the health insurance available on the exchanges to determine whether the new plans are better or less expensive than their current plans, or whether they qualify for financial assistance, Obama said. ""If you received one of these letters I'd encourage you to take a look at the marketplace,"" he said.

Insurers will be required to disclose to customers that these new plans won't include the new consumer protections in the law and explain that alternatives are available on Obamacare's health insurance exchanges, and that tax credits to cut the cost of private insurance are only available on the exchanges. Insurance companies will also have to tell consumers that they may qualify for Medicaid, the federal-state health program for low-income people. State health insurance regulators are being asked to permit the administration's new policy.

Health insurance companies ultimately will be responsible for deciding whether to carry out Obama's new policy, which puts the onus on them. ""The Affordable Care Act is not going to be the reason why insurers have to cancel your plan,"" Obama said.

The White House acknowledged this new policy could have a limited reach. ""It may not be taken by all insurance companies and by all state insurance commissioners,"" a senior White House official said during a conference call with reporters prior to Obama's remarks.

This proposed solution would be problematic for health insurance companies that have already eliminated the current plans from their books of business and would have to recreate them. In addition, enabling a portion of the health insurance market to stay outside of the health insurance exchanges could cause future premiums to rise for those using the new marketplaces. If healthier people with lower medical expenses avoid the exchanges and purchase policies with less generous benefits, the exchanges would attract a relatively older and sicker population, the health insurance industry has warned.

“Changing the rules after health plans have already met the requirements of the law could destabilize the market and result in higher premiums for consumers,"" Karen Ignagni, CEO of the trade group America's Health Insurance Plans, said in a statement.

State regulators were also cool to Obama's proposal. ""This decision continues different rules for different policies and threatens to undermine the new market, and may lead to higher premiums and market disruptions in 2014 and beyond,"" Jim Donelon, Louisiana's insurance commissioner and president of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, said in a press release. ""It is unclear how, as a practical matter, the changes proposed today by the president can be put into effect.""

Health insurance plans are being canceled next year because the Affordable Care Act includes a slew of benefit mandates and consumer protections at the heart of Obama's reform platform.

Plans sold on the exchanges can't exclude people with pre-existing conditions, charge women higher rates than men, must cover at least 60 percent of a person's annual medical expenses, and can't impose annual or lifetime caps on coverage. In addition, exchange plans must cover a basic set of benefits that includes hospitalizations, prescription drugs and maternity care. Health insurance extended via Obama's new policy would not include those guarantees.

""The old individual market was not working well. And it's important that we don't pretend that somehow that's a place worth going back to,"" Obama said. ""Too often it works fine as long as you stay healthy. It doesn't work well when you're sick.""

Obama rejected legislative proposals akin to Upton's bill. ""I will not accept proposals that are just another brazen attempt to undermine or repeal the overall law and drag us back into a broken system.""

White House officials visited Capitol Hill Thursday to meet with House and Senate Democrats to assure them that Obama is addressing issues with canceled policies and the broken website, and to urge them not to back legislative changes to the president's signature domestic policy achievement.

Obama again addressed his oft-stated pledge that individuals would be able to keep their current insurance plans when his law was implemented, noting that the Affordable Care Act leaves in place the employer-sponsored health plans and government programs that cover more than 90 percent of insured Americans. But he acknowledged underestimating the law's effects on the remaining consumers.

""We chose a path that was the least disruptive to try to finally make sure that health care is treated in this country like it is in every other advanced country, that it's not some privilege that just a certain portion of people can have,"" he said. ""There is no doubt that the way I put that forward unequivocally ended up not being accurate.""

Only about 27,000 people chose a new health insurance plan using HealthCare.gov between Oct. 1 and Nov. 2, according to a report issued by the Department of Health and Human Services Wednesday. About 79,000 people did so via the health insurance exchanges being operated by 15 states and the District of Columbia. Almost 400,000 individuals have been deemed newly eligible for Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program.

""In just one month, despite all the problems that we've seen with the website, more than 500,000 Americans could know the security of health care by Jan. 1, many of them for the first time in their lives,"" Obama said. ""Is that as high a number as we'd like? Absolutely not. But it does mean that people want affordable health care.""

The White House maintains that HealthCare.gov will be functioning better by the end of this month and that enrollment via the exchanges will have substantially increased by the end of the sign-up period on March 31. The Congressional Budget Office has projected that 7 million people would use the exchanges to buy health insurance for 2014.

""We should have done a better job getting that right on day one, not on day 28 or on day 40,"" Obama said.

Obama restated his administration's aim to improve the website by the end of November, but stopped short of guaranteeing it would work perfectly. ""The website will work much better on Nov. 30, Dec. 1, than it worked certainly on Oct. 1. That's a pretty low bar,"" Obama said. ""It is not possible for me to guarantee that a hundred percent of the people a hundred percent of the time going on this website will have a perfectly seamless, smooth experience.""

House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) expressed skepticism that the Affordable Care Act permits Obama to carry out the policy he unveiled Thursday. ""I'm highly skeptical they can do this administratively. I just don't see within the law their ability to do it,"" Boehner said during a press briefing.

A senior White House official said the Department of Health and Human Services has the authority to allow health insurance plan extensions via the law's ""grandfathering"" provisions, which already enabled some plans to be continued if they hadn't been substantially changed since 2010, and via administrative discretion.

Many who selected a plan as early as October are now being told by insurance companies that they have no record of their enrollment. Consumers are enduring long waiting periods on the phone, computer errors, and conflicting information from California navigators and insurers.

Meanwhile, the state is still trying to clear a log jam of October and November paper applications that they received by mail.

“The back end is so backed up, and no one can give me an answer,” said Thomas Gallo, who was a strong supporter of Obamacare. Gallo signed up for healthcare for his family on October 2 but did not hear back for weeks. When he followed up on his application, he was told at the end of November that it was lost. “What happens if we don’t get coverage by Jan. 1? There are real problems here,” Gallo said.

Blue Shield of California Chief Executive Paul Markovich admitted, “There are certainly some people who have enrolled or think they have enrolled and haven’t received confirmation. It’s our version of Black Friday right now and that is what we are coping with.”

The target date of January 1 is extremely important for Bret Winton and his wife because they are expecting their first child in early January. Winton is a self-employed consultant living in the Venice, CA. His insurance is being cancelled as a result of Obamacare, along with one million other Californians, because his family plan does not meet the requirements set out by the Affordable Care Act. Winton endured repeated glitches and delays as he struggled with the online exchange. He ultimately selected an Anthem Blue Cross policy, which would provide access to his wife’s doctor and hospital.

Winton called the Covered California exchange and a recording said he would be called back in four hours. He never got the call back. He resorted to a sanctioned chat line that told him he would need to wait 14 days and then he could reapply.

California resident Jim Arenson, a self-employed engineer, also had difficulty with the online exchange. He complained it took him two months to finally receive notice confirming he was covered through Blue Shield. “I was very scared I wouldn’t have health insurance,” said Arenson, who needs additional care after cancer surgery this year. “The exchange and the insurance company were pointing fingers at each other. There could be a lot of people falling through the cracks.”

State Sen. Ed Hernandez (D-West Covina), chairman of the Senate health committee, is deeply concerned that time is running out to fix some of these enrollment problems. Now that Obamacare is the law of the land, “The question now is whether we can meet that demand. Everything seems to be bottlenecked until we open more lanes,” Hernandez said."

Kaiser Health News

Only a handful of states have rules similar to New York%27s.

Starting Jan. 1%2C the federal health law will require nearly everyone to carry insurance.

President Obama mentioned New York%27s lower rates during a speech touting the benefits of the 2010 health law.

This story was originally published July 20, 2013.

New York's announcement this week that insurance premiums would drop 50% next year for individuals buying their own coverage in new online marketplaces made good talking points for proponents of the Affordable Care Act, but consumers in most states are unlikely to see similar savings.

That's because only a handful have New York's rules, which — like the federal law — bar insurers from rejecting people with health problems. Unlike the federal law, however, New York does not require consumers to purchase coverage, so over time, mainly older, sicker people, have purchased coverage. That drove up prices and discouraged younger, healthier people from buying policies, as did a requirement that insurers charge the same rates regardless of age or health status.

As a result, premium prices listed for individuals often top $1,000 a month for some New Yorkers buying their own coverage, making the state's rates among most expensive in the nation.

""New York with such extreme rules sets the stage for a larger drop in rates than you'd expect to see in many other states,"" said Paul Ginsburg, president of the Center for Studying Health System Change, a non-partisan think tank in Washington D.C. ""It's clearly in the minority.""

A handful of other states — including Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Vermont — have similar rules barring insurers from rejecting applicants with health conditions when selling coverage directly to individuals. Only Massachusetts currently requires the flip side of that equation: that consumers also purchase coverage or face a fine.

Starting Jan. 1, the federal health law will require nearly everyone to carry insurance, with the aim of expanding the markets to include the young and healthy, who can be charged less than older people. At the same time, subsidies become available to help people earning up to about $44,680, helping offset the costs of those premiums. Those changes could moderate costs not just in New York, but in those other states that currently require insurers to sell to all comers — if it works to bring more young and healthy people into the market, according to the Society of Actuaries and other experts.

In New Jersey, benefit firm Milliman projects up to a 25% reduction in premiums for some consumers who buy their own insurance as a result of the health law, for similar reasons. Individual coverage costs about 60% more in that state than the national average. New Jersey officials have not yet disclosed proposed or final premium prices for the new online market.

In Vermont, the actuary group predicted a more substantial drop, but when the state released its proposed premium rates for next year, the rates were largely unchanged.

Vermont, however, is a small, rural state with only two insurers offering to sell policies in the marketplace; only about 9% of the state's residents lack insurance, compared with a 16% average nationwide.

That contrasts with New York, where 17 insurers have been approved to sell coverage, and fewer than 26,500 people out of 2.6 million uninsured buy their own coverage currently, according to state data analyzed by the United Hospital Fund.

""Competition helps drive down health insurance costs for consumers and businesses,"" said Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat.

Another factor contributing to lower-than-expected premiums in some places is how the policies are structured. Many insurers nationally are creating smaller networks of doctors and hospitals, or limiting the range of prescription drugs they will cover as a way to lower premiums, said Dan Mendelson, CEO of Avalere Health, a private research firm in Washington, which recently released a study showing that premium prices may be lower than expected in some states.

President Obama mentioned New York's lower rates during a speech touting the benefits of the 2010 health law on Thursday, saying ""the progress we're seeing in California and Washington and Oregon and now New York – that's progress that we want to see across the country.""

He was seeking to rebut Republican criticism of the health law, and the largely symbolic vote by the Republican-led House of Representatives to postpone the requirement that everyone buy insurance. The so-called individual mandate is at the heart of the law and without it, the exchanges could lose the business of the younger and healthier people needed to balance out the higher costs of older, sicker people.

The administration released its own analysis showing that individual premiums in the online marketplaces will be 10% to 18% less than projected next year, based on an average of rates in 10 states and the District of Columbia. While the rates insurers will charge in most states won't be known until closer to the time enrollment begins, Oct. 1, the administration was able to analyze proposed and final premium prices from California, Colorado, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, Washington state and D.C.

Although the administration said the figures show the health law is working, the premiums cited may not reflect what individual consumers will actually pay next year, because the numbers are averaged within and across states. As a result, some consumers in those states are likely to pay more than they do now, while others will see savings.

""The impact of the ACA will vary considerably depending on a person's age, gender, health status, and where they live,"" said Robert Zirkelbach, spokesman for the America's Health Insurance Plans. ""Simply looking at averages doesn't tell you what these reforms are going to mean for a particular person in a particular state.""

Fortunately all the data suggest that Obamacare is actually working. Americans will now have brochures with actual plans and options to choose from. They can now compare reality with the lies they heard.

Anyone wondering why Right Wing Republicans are in overdrive to shut the government down lest Obamacare is defunded realizes the eyes of many Americans are about to be opened. The millions that will see not a giveaway but help in getting access to affordable health insurance, screenings, and health care for the first time in years are also voters. They are voters that will wonder how a politician could be so convincingly evil to have wanted them denied something many needed for their health care or financial survival.

Kentucky Republican Senator Mitch McConnell is adamant that Obamacare be defunded. But Kentucky citizens are yearning for health insurance.

The crush of people don't greet Diaz-Dempsey with tea party dogma or amateur constitutional scholarship. No one is there to complain about the individual mandate or heckle about death panels. They have questions. They wonder if they could get coverage despite having a pre-existing medical condition, how much it will cost them. They ask if Indiana has a similar program, or if this was only for Kentucky. Could they just enroll their child? They talk about their sons and daughters, neighbors going without health care, and ask about the subsidies. The vast majority are relieved to learn about the health exchange. Linda Parrish, 47, showed up at the table and gushed to Diaz-Dempsey: ""This is what I've been waiting on."" Parrish has health insurance, but her best friend doesn't.

It is not all roses in Kentucky. The tea party has been calling people telling them not to sign up because they falsely claim there are no real health insurance exchanges. Many low income workers are against it because they were lied to about what the costs would be.

Christopher McClure hobbles through the doors, his inner thigh hurting from what he suspects are a pair of spider bites. He is not employed and does not have health insurance. His wife Michelle, 29, works as an assistant manager at a pizza chain making $12,000 a year. She also has no insurance and would qualify for the Medicaid expansion. But she's against Obamacare, convinced that it will wipe out her meager earnings. “Next enrollment season,"" she says, ""they’re going to sock it to me.”

The McClures under Obamacare would be fully subsidized. They are so misinformed that they have no clue that Obamacare is that one leg on the stool that removes a financial burden that is materially affecting their access to real financial independence. It makes sense to remove the health care anchor from people’s neck giving them the wherewithal to go seek a job or make their own job.

The reelection of President Obama which makes it impossible to kill Obamacare before implementation is the best thing that has happened to the uninsured, the poor, and the working middle class. The pilfering of the last disposable dollar by insurance companies will eventually end. Medical bankruptcy will cease and families’ economic stabilization will begin."

Obama%2C top Dems said those who liked their plans could keep them under new law

Most people are covered through their jobs%2C and the law doesn%27t stop employers from dropping or changing plans

The law sets minimum standards%2C and the upgrades mean some inexpensive plans will no longer exist

The Line: If you like your health insurance plan, you can keep it.

The Party: Democratic

For years, President Obama promised millions of Americans with health insurance that ""if you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan"" under his health care overhaul. He wasn't the only one, either.

Back in 2009, several top congressional Democrats echoed the president's assurances that those who were happy with their plans would be able to keep them.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said the health care overhaul efforts ""means making sure you can keep your family's doctor or keep your health care plan if you like it.""

Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin told the happily insured ""we are going to put in any legislation considered by the House and Senate the protection that you, as an individual, keep the health insurance you have, if that is what you want.""

And current Senate Budget Committee Chairwoman Patty Murray also said: ""If you like what you have today, that will be what you have when this legislation is passed.""

But longtime readers of FactCheck.org know we've been writing since August 2009 that that promise simply couldn't be made to everyone who already had health insurance.

That's because most Americans are covered by plans through their jobs, and nothing in the health care law prohibited employers from dropping coverage or changing health plans as they have been able to previously. Before the health care bill even became law, the Congressional Budget Office projected that up to 10 million people who otherwise would have been covered by employer-provided plans would not be offered coverage under one Democratic proposal.

The health care law also sets minimum standards for insurance coverage, requiring that all health plans cover mental health benefits, prescription drug coverage, vaccinations, dental and vision care for children, maternity care for women, and more. The upgrades mean that some plans that were inexpensive for purchasers — but didn't cover the required benefits — would eventually cease to exist.

Americans who purchase such plans on the individual insurance market have been receiving notices that their current plans will no longer be offered after this year, as severalnewsorganizations reported in October. Those notices make it clear that Obama was over-simplifying and over-promising when he kept saying, ""if you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan.""

Obama, in a Nov. 4, 2013, speech, tried to explain his past promises by saying ""what we said was you can keep it if it hasn't changed since the law passed."" Asked when the president had previously included that detail, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney, in a Nov. 5 press briefing, said Obama was referring to the law's clause allowing insurers and employers to ""grandfather"" plans offered before the bill became law.

""The president was referring to the law and to the fact that the law was written in a way — and everybody who closely covered the drafting of that legislation knew it was written about — that the grandfathering clause was in the law, and he was referring to the implementation of that law through the rule process,"" Carney said.

Grandfathered health plans do not have to meet all of the law's new coverage requirements. But in order to be grandfathered, health plans must have existed on March 23, 2010. Those with individual grandfathered plans had to have them before the law took effect. And to maintain their grandfathered status, the plans must not be changed to cut benefits or significantly raise prices for consumers through deductibles or co-pays.

It's true that Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius explained the grandfather clause in a June 14, 2010, blog post announcing new health care regulations.

""Under the rule issued today, employers or issuers offering such coverage will have the flexibility of making reasonable changes without losing their 'grandfathered' status,"" Sebelius wrote. ""However, if health plans significantly raise co-payments or deductibles, or if they significantly reduce benefits – for example, if they stop covering treatment for a disease like HIV/AIDS or cystic fibrosis – they'll lose their grandfathered status and their customers will get the same full set of consumer protections as new plans.""

Sebelius went on to say that the ""bottom line is that under the Affordable Care Act, if you like your doctor and plan, you can keep them."" But that still wouldn't be true for many, and Obama glossed over those details in his speeches. The president made the sweeping promise, in one variation or another, while the Affordable Care Act was being debated in Congress in 2009. He said it again after he signed the bill into law in 2010. And he continued to say it after the Supreme Court ruled the law was constitutional in 2012.

Even the president now acknowledges that his promise went too far.

In an interview with Chuck Todd of NBC News on Nov. 7, Obama offered an apology to the many Americans who have been notified that they are, in fact, losing the health plans they previously had and wanted to keep.

""I am sorry that they are finding themselves in this situation based on assurances they got from me,"" Obama said. ""We've got to work hard to make sure that they know we hear them and that we're going to do everything we can to deal with folks who find themselves in a tough position as a consequence of this.""

Strangely, the White House linked to the apology on a health care Web page that carried the same promise he now says went too far.

President Obama, March 25, 2010: From this day forward, all of the cynics, all the naysayers — they're going to have to confront the reality of what this reform is and what it isn't. They'll have to finally acknowledge this isn't a government takeover of our health care system. They'll see that if Americans like their doctor, they'll be keeping their doctor. You like your plan? You'll be keeping your plan. No one is taking that away from you. (Source: Remarks in Iowa City, Iowa.)

Sen. Max Baucus of Montana, Sept. 29, 2010: From the beginning, the law has been about preserving what is good about American health care.

If a person has a plan,and he or she likes it, he or she can keep it. (Source: Remarks on the Senate floor.)

Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, April 6, 2012: This bill will help make health insurance more secure for those who already have it and make coverage available for millions of uninsured Americans.

According to the poll (pdf), which surveyed American adults between Nov. 18-20 with a margin of error of ±3.5 points:

Most Americans believe Obamacare's current problems will be solved. 54 percent say they believe current problems will be fixed, compared with 43 percent who say they won't be. Most Americans believe it's too early to judge whether Obamacare is a success or failure. A total of 53 percent think it is too early to say whether Obamacare is a success or failure. A total of 39 percent think it's a failure and 8 percent already think it is a success. Most Americans do not support conservative critiques of Obamacare. According to the poll, 41 percent of Americans think Obamacare is too liberal, slightly more than 40 percent who support Obamacare. But 14 percent think it's not liberal enough.

As you might expect, the poll's crosstabs show that most Republicans are certain Obamacare can't be fixed and has already failed, but outside of the GOP universe, people aren't merely open to Obamacare, they are optimistic about its prospects and want it to work.

Obviously, it doesn't matter how open or optimistic the public is if the Obama administration can't ultimately deliver on the promise of Obamacare, but if they do, most Americans are on their side. Republicans have bet everything on failure. If they lose that bet, it will be an absolute political nightmare for them—and it should be."

Or that Congress made sure to minimize disruptions to air travel. Or perhaps you know someone being furloughed as a result of the cuts.

But did you know a major fight is being waged over sequester cuts to some cancer drugs?

After Congress failed to pass a budget this spring, a 2 percent cut to Medicare chemotherapy drug reimbursements went into effect April 1 as part of the across-the-board federal spending cuts designed to save $85.4 billion this year.

[Read sequester stories from Yahoo News readers here.]

Many doctors and patients are infuriated, and the issue has made its way into Congress, with a bill introduced in the House to help alleviate the burden being put on those in the cancer community.

Dr. John Cox, a community oncologist at Texas Oncology Methodist Cancer Centers in Dallas and a member of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), told Yahoo News that the idea of treating Medicare patients differently from other patients goes against everything for which doctors stand.

""It makes all of us uneasy when we realize we are treating different populations in our practice differently,"" Cox said.

The pressure put on doctors is significant. Oncologists are typically reimbursed the average sales price for chemotherapy drugs plus 6 percent to cover the cost of storing and administering these drugs. Because purchasing those drugs costs the same as it did before the sequester, many cancer doctors, especially community oncologists who operate in smaller, nonhospital settings—are now unable to keep up with the costs associated with treating Medicare cancer patients who are typically elderly and on fixed incomes.

Indeed, studies from various oncology groups bear out a negative trend: Due to the sequester cut, community practices have begun to turn some people away or to close their doors entirely, shifting patients to hospitals for their chemotherapy treatments where the infrastructure is larger, costs can be better absorbed and some drugs can be purchased for less.

Story continues

A May 9 survey from the Community Oncology Alliance found 49 percent of respondents were sending Medicare patients elsewhere, with many more planning to begin doing so; 21 percent of practices were laying off staff; and 14 percent were in talks with hospitals about forming alliances.

A new survey from ASCO found that 80 percent of respondents say the sequester has affected their practice. Nearly 50 percent said they wouldn't be able to continue caring for Medicare patients who didn't have supplemental insurance, and 50 percent had begun sending patients elsewhere, primarily to hospitals.

Some doctors say that the shift to hospitals could be detrimental to Medicare patients' care due to less personalized service, personal mobility issues and the typically higher overall cost of treatment at a hospital.

""I'm sure that there's some people who say that they are enraged,"" Dr. Jeffery Ward, a community oncologist at Swedish Cancer Institute in Edmonds, Wash., told Yahoo News of the cut. ""I'm just saddened that our government system is so completely inept that they will take the most fragile and vulnerable people in our society and hang them out to dry—and that's what Congress and our government has done.""

Ward said that his practice as a result of the crush of costs—which in addition to the sequester cut includes a shrinking reimbursement system and a Washington state business and operations tax—formed a nonprofit and became part of a local hospital group on April 1. It's a fate he says will become more common under the sequester.

He added that he and his patients are among the luckier ones: Not only can his new hospital group help with costs, but the convenient location means his doctors can continue treating the same patients. But he noted that others might not be as fortunate, especially those in rural areas.

""If you're in a situation where [a] hospital is not willing to work with you or does not wish to take on cancer care, or if you're operating a long ways from a hospital, those are places where clinics may end up closing their doors and where patients will be disadvantaged or put out,"" Ward said.

Cox said some of the talk about the damaging impacts of the sequester from the oncology community might be hyperbole, but negative effects are real and contributing to an already crushing system of physician reimbursement, in his opinion.

""We have not changed any practice, at least that I’m aware of, in our group because of the 2 percent sequester,"" Cox said of his larger practice. But he said that fact belies a gradual ""belt-tightening"" and ""dramatic"" changes in outpatient medical oncology.

If the cut remains and other financial pressures continue to ramp up, he added, his group will reevaluate its ability to operate outreach centers and conduct clinical research work.

""Fiscally, I want people to be responsible, but taking a blood axe to the federal budget and doing it broadly across the board seems crazy to me,"" he added about the sequester.

Similar opinions were expressed earlier this year about the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) air traffic controller furloughs under the sequester, which threatened to result in the cancellation of flights and disruption of air travel for millions, as well as the closing of some airports.

Congress asked the FAA to step in and shift money to avoid furloughs, but the government said it had no authority to do so. As a result, Congress united and passed a bill to give special permission to the FAA to transfer money within its budget and cut elsewhere to avoid furloughs to air traffic controllers.

Members of Congress have urged the government to make a similar exception to protect cancer drugs from the sequester.

Members of the Senate and House sent letters—124 House members to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) —asking if officials could exempt cancer drugs.

The 124 House members who wrote CMS received their response last Wednesday, and it wasn't encouraging.

From Marilyn Tavenner, administrator of the CMS:

The Department of Health and Human Services assessed whether the law allows discretion to administer the sequestration reductions in a manner that is different from the across the board approach that has been used to implement it. We do not believe that we have the authority under the Budget Control Act of 2011 to exempt Medicare payment for Part B drugs.

That response appears to put the onus on Congress for a policy solution.

North Carolina Republican Rep. Renee Ellmers, a former registered nurse—who supports the sequester's aim to reduce federal spending, but not its indiscriminate cuts—introduced in early April a bill to exempt cancer drugs from the sequester and to force Medicare to reimburse oncologists for the reduced payments they have so far been issued under the sequester.

She told Yahoo News last week that she believes Tavenner's response, while disappointing, boosts the argument for her legislative fix.

""I feel that this will increase the number of co-sponsors quickly,"" Ellmers said of the CMS response. Indeed, supporters believe that some members were awaiting a formal response from the government before signing on to Ellmers' bill.

Ellmers said she picked up two co-sponsors the day after Tavenner's letter was released—""probably the result"" of the response from CMS. She ended the week with four additional co-sponsors, putting her total at 85 supporters from both parties as of late Friday.

Supporters of Ellmers' bill say that much like the FAA fix, this legislation has the potential of being passed due to wide bipartisan support.

""Needing those spending cuts to me was the ultimate goal, but at the same time when you realize that you've hurt vulnerable individuals, that's when you need to make the changes,"" Ellmers said. ""And that's what we should be doing here in Washington. ... If we see that we've affected someone on a personal level as an unintended consequence of something that we've done, then we need to fix that problem."""

Savage Has Covered The Supreme Court', 'Legal Issues For The Los Angeles Times In The Washington Bureau Since']",More legal trouble for Affordable Care Act,"WASHINGTON— If computer glitches are not enough of a problem, President Obama’s healthcare law also has a legal glitch that critics say could cause it to unravel in more than half the nation.

The Affordable Care Act proposes to make health insurance affordable to millions of low-income Americans by offering them tax credits to help cover the cost. To receive the credit, the law twice says they must buy insurance “through an exchange established by the state.”

But 36 states have decided against opening exchanges for now. Although the law permits the federal government to open exchanges instead, it does not say tax credits may be given to those who buy insurance through a federally run exchange.

Apparently no one noticed this when the long and complicated bill worked its way through the House and Senate. Last year, however, the Internal Revenue Service tried to remedy it by putting out a regulation that redefined “exchange” to include a “federally facilitated exchange.” This is “consistent with the language, purpose and structure … of the act as a whole,” the Treasury Department said.

But critics of the law have seized on the glitch. They have filed four lawsuits that urge judges to rule the Obama administration must abide by the strict wording of the law, even if doing so dismantles it in nearly two-thirds of the states. And the Obama administration has no hope of repairing the glitch by legislation as long as the Republicans control the House.

This week, U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman in Washington, a President Clinton appointee, refused the administration’s request to dismiss the suit. Instead, he said the challengers had put forward a substantial claim, and he promised to issue a written ruling.

“This is a problem,” said Timothy Jost, a law professor at Washington and Lee University. “This case could have legs,” although “it was never the intent of Congress to establish federal exchanges that can’t do anything. They were supposed to have exactly the same powers.”

Michael Carvin, the Washington lawyer leading the challenge, says the wording of the law is what counts. “This is a question of whether you believe in the rule of law. And the language here is as clear as it could possibly be,” he said.

Last year, Carvin went before the Supreme Court to argue that the law’s mandate to buy insurance was unconstitutional. The high court handed down a split decision. By a 5-4 vote, the justices ruled the government may impose a tax penalty on those who can afford to buy insurance but decline to do so. But in a 7-2 decision, they said states had the option to expand their Medicaid coverage under the law, or to turn down extra federal money.

The states have now split evenly, as 25 of them have opted to take the extra money from Washington and expand their Medicaid coverage, and 25 have refused. As a result, the law’s aim to provide free healthcare for those who are poor will go forward in only half of the nation.

The new suits take aim at the parts of the law that offer subsidies to those who are above the poverty level but still may struggle to pay for insurance. A single person with an income up to $45,960 can qualify for subsidies now, as can a family of four with an income up to $94,200. If the federal government cannot offer these subsidies in the 36 states without exchanges, it cannot enforce the mandate to have insurance, lawyers say.

“My jaw dropped when I first saw this,” said Michael F. Cannon, a health policy expert at the Cato Institute and a fierce critic of the law. He and others credit former Justice Department attorney Tom Christina and Jonathan Adler, a Case Western Reserve University law professor, with first highlighting the glitch.

“This has the potential to sink Obamacare. It could make the current website problems seem minor by comparison,” Cannon said.

Defenders of the law say the courts are being used as part of the political campaign against the law.

“This is definitely heating up. It is now the major focus of the Republican strategy for undoing the Affordable Care Act,” said Simon Lazarus, a lawyer for the Constitutional Accountability Center. “The lawsuits should be seen as preposterous,” he said, because they ask judges to give the law a “nonsensical” interpretation.

No judge has ruled directly on the claim that the IRS rule put forth by the administration is illegal and contradicted by the words of the law. Indiana Atty. Gen. Greg Zoeller filed one of four lawsuits this month. A federal judge in Oklahoma is considering a similar suit filed by that state’s attorney general. A fourth suit is scheduled to be heard by a judge in Richmond, Va.

If any of the four judges agree with the challengers, they are likely to be asked to put the law on hold until the legal dispute is resolved. And that in turn could quickly send the issue to a U.S. appeals court and then to the Supreme Court.

“They are betting on getting five votes at the Supreme Court,” Lazarus said. “I don’t think it will happen.”

(CNN) —

Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, one of Obamacare’s architects and staunchest supporters, is also the only top congressional leader to exempt some of his staff from having to buy insurance through the law’s new exchanges.

Reid is the exception among the other top congressional leaders. GOP House Speaker John Boehner, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell have all directed their staffs to join the exchange, their aides said.

After website woes, President pushes benefits of Obamacare

In the charged atmosphere surrounding Obamacare, Reid’s decision only gives Republicans more ammo to attack Democrats already suffering politically from the law’s botched rollout.

In September, Reid told reporters, “Let’s stop these really juvenile political games – the one dealing with health care for senators and House members and our staff. We are going to be part of exchanges, that’s what the law says and we’ll be part of that.”

With website deadline met, Obamacare scrutiny increases

That’s true. Reid and his personal staff will buy insurance through the exchange.

But it’s also true that the law lets lawmakers decide if their committee and leadership staffers hold on to their federal employee insurance plans, an option Reid has exercised.

Reid spokesman Adam Jentleson emphasized, “We are just following the law.”

Insurers still reporting errors on Obamacare applications

But Republicans are already taking aim.

“I’m sure that regular Americans who just lost their insurance will feel comforted to know that Senator Reid’s staff gets to keep their government plan,” a senior GOP Senate aide said.

Former Reid staffer Jim Manley defended his old boss, arguing that “the only people hypocritical here are Republicans, who made this an issue in the first place.”

And all four House and Senate leaders are required to relinquish their federal employee insurance plans next year and are choosing to enroll in the exchanges.

SERGIO LIMAWhen funding for Dr. Pedro Hallal’s COVID-19 study was abruptly slashed, deaths from the virus had just surged to grim new peaks in Brazil.The reason? Hallal says the government simply didn’t like what his study was unveiling: that indigenous people are five times as likely to get infected with COVID-19 than other ethnic groups in Brazil. His findings came amid a surge in invasions of indigenous lands by soy farmers, cattle ranchers, and illegal miners egged on by friendly signals from Brazil’s denialist President Jair Bolsonaro.“I’m absolutely certain it was meant to shut me up,” said Hallal, an epidemiologist and professor at the Federal University of Pelotas, told The Daily Beast. “The study was showing results that they didn't want it to show.”Hallal, whose COVID research funding was cut last year, is not alone. Dozens of researchers studying the virus say they have been targeted by fans and allies of Bolsonaro, who has long styled himself as a Trump-like populist opposed to science, mainstream media, and the “corrupt” liberal elite.How Bolsonaro Seized Trump’s Crown as the World’s Worst COVID LeaderResearchers in Brazil claim they have suffered through relentless social media attacks, death threats, funding cuts, and arbitrary investigations over the past year as they seek to better understand the virus ravaging the country. They say these attacks are a thinly-veiled attempt at muzzling them and suppressing their work.Bolsonaro has downplayed the virus as a “fantasy” and “little flu,” railed against lockdowns and—until recently—rejected vaccines. “Brazilians need to be studied. They don’t catch anything. You see the guy jumping in the sewer, diving in. And nothing happens to him,” the president said of the virus last year.Even though COVID has killed 398,000 people in Brazil, the president and his allies have repeatedly questioned its toll and accused governors and mayors of inflating the number of deaths in order to weaken the president politically.“There is this conservative base that casts itself as the opposition to science,” said Pablo Ornelas Rosa, a professor at the University of Vila Velha in Espírito Santo. “If you are pro-science and pro-facts, you are labelled as a leftist, as a communist, as an enemy to the president.”“The health minister freaked out,” recalled Hallal, who was coordinating the study—Brazil’s largest epidemiological analysis of the virus and its spread across the country. The scientist maintains that at a press conference organized to unveil its latest findings, the ministry barred the release of data about the heightened risks to indigenous people. Hallal says he was never told why officials took issue with the findings.A few weeks later, the study—commissioned by a prior health minister who was fired last April after clashing with Bolsonaro—lost its federal funding. Soon, Hallal was being investigated by the federal auditing body after criticizing Bolsonaro in a livestream and his allies were being sidelined in university elections.On social media, the vicious attacks on the scientist poured in, including from Bolsonaro himself. Hallal told The Daily Beast that supporters of the president made threatening phone calls to him and even photographed him on the street with his family.“It was direct persecution, triggered by my stance on the pandemic,” he said. “Instead of correcting its errors, the government attacked those who were uncovering its mistakes.”Attacks have been particularly harsh against those questioning Bolsonaro’s stance on chloroquine, an antimalarial that he—along with Donald Trump—embraced as a “miracle cure” despite no evidence it could combat COVID-19. Bolsonaro quickly got behind the drug and ordered the army to sharply scale up national production. When the president got COVID himself, he took the drug over livestream and boasted that he was improving rapidly.Dr. Marcus Lacerda’s trouble began when he decided to investigate whether the drug really was a “miracle cure” for the novel coronavirus. In the Amazon city of Manaus, the research group he led had used chloroquine for years as part of its malaria research. As infections overwhelmed hospitals in his city last March, Lacerda decided to put his team’s know-how to work by testing the drug’s ability to fight COVID-19.But the team’s clinical study quickly found that chloroquine was not only ineffective against COVID-19, but high doses of the drug could cause severe heart problems in patients infected with the virus. The results caught global attention, spurring scathing critiques of Trump’s support of chloroquine.But, at home in Brazil, Lacerda’s team saw a different response. He says it started with a tweet by the president’s son, who accused the researchers of being a group of “leftists” who were intentionally killing people with high doses of chloroquine just to demonstrate the drug didn't work. This triggered a wave of attacks on social media by the president’s supporters.“People were saying that they knew where I lived, that I had killed people on purpose, that I would pay for this,” said Lacerda, an infectious disease specialist and a researcher at the Carlos Borborema Institute of Clinical Research in Manaus.Lacerda says he received a slew of attacks and death threats over social media. Concerned for the safety of himself and his family, he was forced to walk around with armed bodyguards for two weeks.“It was one of the worst experiences of my life,” he said. “It was this intense climate of fear.”Triggered by complaints from allies of Bolsonaro, state and federal medical bodies as well as public prosecutors opened investigations into Lacerda’s study. He says he spent the better part of last year defending his research in front of lawyers, instead of carrying out studies in a lab.The attacks on Brazilian researchers echo the United States’ own war on science, which intensified during Trump’s tenure as president. Scientists in the U.S. faced over 150 attacks during Trump’s presidency, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists.“Governments on the radical right—like those we saw in the U.S. and here in Brazil—are not prepared for science to show something that contradicts what they are doing,” Lacerda said. “When a study shows something that you don't agree with, you just take down the scientists.”The assault on science has had a profound impact in Brazil. Scientists say that the attacks they have suffered have derailed research or discouraged some to tackle studies linked to the virus. Others have left the country, pushed out by threats or disillusionment.“The sciences are being persecuted right now,” said Rosa, who has studied the behavior of Bolsonaro supporters on WhatsApp and Telegram. “We’re living in a really dark moment. And this has a direct impact on the research and the quality of scientific output.”Meanwhile, Brazil is still grappling with one of the world’s worst outbreaks, with a death toll second only to the United States. In recent weeks, infections have exploded, fuelled by highly-infectious new variants and weak lockdown restrictions. With doses running out, vaccinations have brought little relief.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

James Inhofe (R-Okla.) said Sunday that he ""probably wouldn't be here"" if he had been insured under the Affordable Care Act, referring to his emergency quadruple bypass surgery earlier this month.

In a radio interview with WABC's Aaron Klein, Inhofe said his doctors discovered multiple blocked arteries during a colonoscopy and that he needed surgery immediately.

The senator said he was able to be treated right away because of his health care plan, but under a program like the Affordable Care Act, Inhofe said ""with my age, that would have been about a six-month wait"" because he did not have a heart attack.

""It's amazing.

Inhofe, who has served in the Senate since 1995, is an ardent opponent of President Barack Obama's signature health care reform law. Prior to the government shutdown that ended last week, he voted against a continuing resolution to fund the government because it did not defund the health care law.

“Today I kept my promise to Oklahomans that I would not vote for a continuing resolution that funds the President's disastrous health care law,"" Inhofe said in a statement on the September vote. ""I will continue to work with my colleagues in Congress and do whatever it takes to fight for ObamaCare to be defunded and repealed."""

(CNN) —

More than 2 million people have signed up so far for health coverage under Obamacare, officials said Tuesday in trying to put the best face forward before the controversial health care reforms fully kick in with the start of 2014.

The enrollment figure represented a big increase after the botched launch of the system in October, but Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius was unable to say how many of the 2.1 million who enrolled have paid their first premium to ensure their policies take effect on Wednesday.

Sebelius and other officials also acknowledged the possibility of more potential problems, warning people to bring proof of coverage with them to their doctor or pharmacy, pay premiums when due and double-check with insurers that they are covered.

CNNMoney: Starting the new year in Obamacare limbo

Under the reforms, Americans will be required to have health coverage or face a fine. Sebelius called the full implementation of reforms under the 2010 Affordable Care Act a new era in health insurance, noting they mean no denial of coverage for pre-existing conditions or other discriminatory practices such as charging women more than men.

“Starting tomorrow, being a woman will no longer be a pre-existing condition,” Sebelius said on a conference call with journalists.

The Obamacare enrollment figure is below the target of 3 million originally set by the administration for the end of December, which is halfway through an initial six-month sign-up period under the law intended to help millions of previously uninsured Americans get coverage.

Overall, the administration hopes to enroll 7 million people by March 31 while also expanding eligibilty for Medicaid, the government health care program for the impoverished.

Sebelius said Tuesday that another 3.9 million people were eligible for coverage through expanded Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program, but she was unable to specify how many have become new enrollees.

The botched rollout of the new marketplaces on October 1, when the HealthCare.gov website set up to handle the enrollment failed to work properly, damaged the sign-up process until the system began working better in early December.

Sebelius said the administration was “doing everything we can to help ensure a smooth transition period” for people getting new coverage.

Anticipating possible problems in the enrollment system, Sebelius also advised in her blog post that “if you thought you enrolled in health coverage but aren’t showing up in the system, call your insurance company directly.”

She also said people could contact the Obamacare call center for assistance.

Asked if the website woes in October and November could be due to attacks from outside by Obamacare opponents, a spokeswoman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services told reporters there were technological problems but no sign of hacking.

The health care reforms championed by President Barack Obama have become the defining issue of his presidency, with Republicans led by tea party conservatives trying to dismantle them while some Democrats appearing leery of campaigning on them in the November congressional elections.

While the Supreme Court ruled the mandate to obtain health coverage was constitutional, further legal challenges are being mounted.

Also on Tuesday, a group of Catholic organizations, in an emergency appeal, asked the Supreme Court to delay the Obamacare requirement that certain religious-affiliated groups provide contraception and “abortion-inducing drug” coverage to their workers.

Catholic groups ask Supreme Court to delay Obamacare mandate

Archdioceses in Washington, D.C., Tennessee and Michigan – along with affiliated groups that include Catholic University – asked Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Elena Kagan to block enforcement of the related employer mandates set to take effect on Wednesday.

The issue has been a major sticking sticking point with religious groups and private for-profit companies that have strong moral objections.

The Supreme Court agreed last month to hear two cases involving for-profit corporations who say their religious liberty is violated by the law.

Shear', 'Pam Belluck']",Obama to End Effort to Restrict Morning-After Pill,"Mr. Obama had expressed personal concern about making the drug more broadly available last year and offered support to Kathleen Sebelius, his secretary of health and human services, when she blocked a decision by the F.D.A. that would have cleared the way for nonprescription distribution to all girls and women regardless of age. He said that as the father of two young girls, the idea of making the drug available to them without a prescription made him uncomfortable.

But a federal judge angrily accused the administration of blocking the drug because of politics, not science, and ordered Ms. Sebelius to reverse her decision. Last week the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York City partially refused the Justice Department’s request for a delay in the judge’s order while the government appealed.

In its letter to the court, the Justice Department outlined the procedural steps that the F.D.A. plans to take. It said the maker of Plan B One-Step, Teva Pharmaceuticals, has been asked to “promptly” file an application asking for no age or sales restrictions, and that the “F.D.A. will approve it without delay.”

Once that is done, the F.D.A. expects makers of generic versions of Plan B One-Step — the most popular of those is Next Choice One Dose — to ask for a similar arrangement. The F.D.A. will evaluate those requests, based on whether it decides to give Plan B One-Step any type of market exclusivity, but most likely generic pills will also eventually be available without restrictions.

The Justice Department said it would not remove restrictions from two-pill emergency contraceptives because it is concerned that young girls might not be able to adequately understand how to take two separate doses. But two-pill versions are a diminishing fraction of the market.

The fight to make emergency contraceptives universally available without a prescription is more than a decade old. Plan B, the trade name for the morning-after pill, was approved in 1999 as a prescription-only product. In 2001 the Center for Reproductive Rights filed a citizens petition for it to be made available over the counter or without a prescription.

By December 2011, after years of pressure from women’s reproductive rights groups and the companies selling the drug, the F.D.A. was poised to lift all age restrictions. By then the F.D.A. also said it had determined that the drug was safe. But in an unprecedented move Ms. Sebelius overruled the agency. She said at the time that she had based her decision on science because she said the manufacturer had failed to study whether the drug was safe for girls as young as 11, about 10 percent of whom are physically able to bear children."

(CNN) - President Barack Obama continued to promote his signature health care reform on Saturday and argued Republicans are trying to ""confuse people"" about the law.

His comments come as some GOP members in Congress have called for an effort to defund Obamacare in an upcoming budget deadline.



""A lot of Republicans seem to believe that if they can gum up the works and make this law fail, they'll somehow be sticking it to me. But they'd just be sticking it to you,"" the president said in his weekly address.

Read a transcript of his remarks below.

Hi, everybody. Over the past few weeks, I've been visiting with Americans across the country to talk about what we need to do to secure a better bargain for the middle class.

We need to rebuild an economy that rewards hard work and responsibility; an economy built firmly on the cornerstones of middle-class life. Good jobs. A good education. A home of your own. A secure retirement. And quality, affordable health care that's there when you need it.

Right now, we're well on our way to fully implementing the Affordable Care Act. And in the next few months, we'll reach a couple milestones with real meaning for millions of Americans.

If you're one of the 85% of Americans who already have insurance, you've already got new benefits and protections under this law that you didn't before. Free checkups, mammograms, and contraceptive care. Discounted prescription medicine on Medicare. The fact you can stay on your parents' plan until you turn 26. And much, much more. And it's okay if you're not a fan of the Affordable Care Act – you can take advantage of these things anyway.

If you don't have insurance, beginning on October 1st, private plans will actually compete for your business. You can comparison shop in an online marketplace, just like you would for cell phone plans or plane tickets. You may be eligible for new tax credits to help you afford the plan that's right for you. And if you're in the up to half of all Americans who've been sick or have a preexisting condition, this law means that beginning January 1st, insurance companies have to cover you – and they can't use your medical history to charge you more than anybody else.

You can find out more about the law, and how to sign up to buy your own coverage right now at HealthCare.gov. Tell your friends and neighbors without insurance about it, too. And tell your kids that there's a new, easy way to buy affordable plans specifically tailored to young people.

Many Members of Congress, in both parties, are working hard to inform their constituents about these benefits, protections, and affordable plans. But there's also a group of Republicans in Congress working hard to confuse people, and making empty promises that they'll either shut down the health care law, or, if they don't get their way, they'll shut down the government.

Think about that. They're actually having a debate between hurting Americans who will no longer be denied affordable care just because they've been sick – and harming the economy and millions of Americans in the process. And many Republicans are more concerned with how badly this debate will hurt them politically than they are with how badly it'll hurt the country.

A lot of Republicans seem to believe that if they can gum up the works and make this law fail, they'll somehow be sticking it to me. But they'd just be sticking it to you.

Some even say that if you call their office with questions about the law, they'll refuse to help. Call me old-fashioned – but that's lousy constituent service. And it's not what you deserve.

Your health insurance isn't something to play politics with. Our economy isn't something to play politics with. This isn't a game. This is about the economic security of millions of families.

See, in the states where governors and legislatures and insurers are working together to implement this law properly – states like California, New York, Colorado and Maryland – competition and consumer choice are actually making insurance affordable.

So I'm going to keep doing everything in my power to make sure this law works as it's supposed to. Because in the United States of America, health insurance isn't a privilege – it is your right. And we're going to keep it that way.

Thanks. And have a great weekend."

Federal health officials announced Friday afternoon that they'd give people another eight days this year to enroll in an insurance policy and still get covered by Jan. 1. Previously, people had to enroll by Dec. 15 to avoid any break in coverage and have insurance at the start of 2014. The administration, amid lingering problems with the main ObamaCare website, is now pushing that deadline to Dec. 23.

The move comes after the administration announced a more significant delay to the start of next year's ObamaCare enrollment period. That decision was pitched as a way to give consumers and insurance companies more time to study their options, but also conveniently pushes the second round of enrollment past the 2014 midterm elections.

With the administration still offering only modest relief for the current enrollment period, Republicans questioned why the administration was focusing on the second round of enrollment, a year away.

""Another day, another delay, which begs the question, does the president think enrollment will be just as bad next year?"" House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton, R-Mich., said in a statement. ""It's stunning to see the president so willing to delay next year's open enrollment period rather than focus on the ongoing chaos and uncertainty that is plaguing implementation today.""

More On This...

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney and a Department of Health and Human Services official confirmed the change to the 2014 sign-up on Friday. That decision does not affect those trying to enroll this year. Rather, it affects those who will sign up late next year for 2015 coverage.

The administration will allow consumers to start signing up on Nov. 15, 2014, as opposed to Oct. 15. Enrollment will last until Jan. 15, 2015, instead of Dec. 7.

An HHS official told Fox News the move will give insurers ""the benefit of more time to evaluate their experiences during the 2014 plan year"" and let them take into account late-filing customers when setting their 2015 rates.

The official added: ""This change is good news for consumers, who will have more time to learn about plans before enrolling and an open enrollment period that's a week longer.""

The administration so far has rebuffed calls to delay or extend the current enrollment period beyond March 31, 2014, even as HHS scrambles to repair the flawed HealthCare.gov site and some states struggle with their own exchanges.

But by pushing off next year's enrollment period, the administration conveniently pushes off the possibility of any ObamaCare hiccups until after the midterm elections. Some of the biggest critics of the current rollout have been Democrats up for reelection next year.

Obama recently tried to address some of their concerns by allowing states and insurance companies to re-offer cancelled insurance policies -- a trend which has become a major headache for the administration. Many states, though, are refusing to make any changes to the way they handle those plans.

HHS argued that the delay next year will give consumers more time to educate themselves about the plans, though it would not affect coverage this year.

WASHINGTON — President Obama is bleeding support among Millennials just as he begins a renewed push to boost enrollment under his health care law, according to a Harvard Institute of Politics poll published Wednesday.

The new poll shows that Obama's approval rating with 18- to 29-year-olds now stands at 41%, a dramatic 11-point drop from April. Fifty-four percent said they disapprove of the president's performance.

The Harvard pollsters noted that during the time they conducted their latest survey of young Americans, national polls of the general population showed that Obama's approval rating hovered between 37% and 40%.

Support from young voters was crucial to Obama's two successful presidential campaigns.

Perhaps more troubling for Obama, the poll showed 40% of young Americans believe Obamacare will bring worse care, 51% believe it will bring higher costs and 57% said they disapprove of the president's signature law.

""Although Millennials have held firm in their approval of the president in past polls, we are now seeing a sea change among this critical demographic,"" said Trey Grayson, director of Harvard Institute of Politics.

Among the 18- to 29-year-olds currently without health insurance, less than a third say they're likely to enroll in the exchange. Thirteen percent say they will definitely enroll, 16% say they will probably enroll, and 41% say they are split 50-50 on whether they will enroll, according to the poll.

The latest sobering poll numbers come as Obama took part in a youth summit at the White House on Wednesday, where he encouraged uninsured young people to sign up for health care. Enrolling plenty of young, healthy people is considered critical to making the Affordable Care Act a success.

During a speech earlier on Wednesday on the economy, Obama downplayed the importance of polls, while highlighting that more than 3 million young Americans under the age of 26 have been able to stay on their parents' plan as a result of the law and hundreds of thousands of Americans--including many who have never had health insurance--are poised to be signed up for coverage by Jan. 1.

""It is these numbers -- not the ones in any poll -- that will ultimately determine the fate of this law,"" Obama said.

John Della Volpe, polling director at the Harvard Institute of Politics, however said that it's ""absolutely the case"" that Obama has not been effective in communicating to young Americans about his health law.



""There are very few aspects of the health care initiative that they approve of,"" Della Volpe said.

The poll of 2,089 young Americans was conducted Oct. 30 through Nov. 11. The margin of error is +/- 2.1 percentage points."

In 2004, David Blood and former Vice President Al Gore co-founded Generation Investment Management. Schweizer says despite the perception that Gore’s investments are all green energy-related, Blood and Gore’s investment portfolio is currently comprised of 27% health care investments and stands poised to score big from Obamacare.

“David Blood was a bundler for Barack Obama,” said Schweizer. “Even though they talk about being in green technology, 27% of their investment portfolio right now is in health insurance companies designed to profit from this sector.”

Blood bundled over $500,000 in campaign donations for Obama in 2012.

Schweizer, whose new book Extortion debuted at number eight on the New York Times bestseller list, said other Obama fundraisers are also cashing in on the government health care overhaul.

“The same thing goes for the private equity firms,” said Schweizer. “Evercore Partners–who is headed by Roger Altman, a bundler for the Obama campaign–they are said to cash in on what everybody is saying is going to be massive mergers between hospital companies, etc. Wall Street firms need to broker those deals and a company like Evercore Partners is perfectly positioned to do that.”

Even as 4.9 million Americans are losing their health insurance plans under Obamacare, Schweizer says top Obama campaign fundraisers and insiders stand to rake in millions.

“It’s a great business for them because the law basically creates a market for products that didn’t exist before,” said Schweizer.

“Your book, Extortion, is going to open a lot of eyes,” said Fox & Friends co-host Elisabeth Hasselbeck."

The uninsured are clearly the biggest beneficiaries of the legislation, which would extend the health care safety net for the lowest-income Americans.

* Republicans deeply divided on strategy to stop or weaken health law

By Caren Bohan and Rachelle Younglai

WASHINGTON, Aug 22 (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner warned rank-and-file Republicans in a conference call on Thursday against using the threat of a government shutdown to stop the implementation of Obamacare, according to people on the call.

In the call, Boehner reminded Republicans of the political backlash their party suffered when the government shut down in 1995-1996, according to one person on the call.

Another participant in the call, Oklahoma Representative Tom Cole, said the speaker's main message was that he and other leaders were still committed to killing President Barack Obama's signature health care law but that they did not want a government shutdown.

Republicans agree strongly on their opposition to Obamacare, viewing the law as a burden to businesses that will cost jobs.

But the party has been roiled by heated debate over the strategy for trying to stop the law.

Hours before Boehner's conference call, about a third of the Republican caucus sent a letter to Boehner and Majority Leader Eric Cantor urging them to oppose any annual spending bills that include funding for Obamacare.

Without an agreement between Congress and Obama on fresh legislation to fund federal agencies, the government could shut down on Oct. 1. Even many Republicans believe Obama would never agree to sign a spending bill that removed funding for his signature domestic policy achievement.

Cole disagrees with the idea of using a government shutdown threat to try to take aim at Obamacare but added, ""the frustration is how do you keep fighting it without taking an action that is counterproductive.""

On the call, Boehner sketched out a plan in which Republicans would pass a short-term measure to fund the government until around December while insisting on keeping in place steep cuts in spending known as the ""sequester.""

When Congress reconvenes on Sept. 9 after its summer break, Boehner said, ""Our intent is to move quickly on a short-term continuing resolution that keeps the government running and maintains current sequester spending levels.""

Earlier on Thursday, about a third of the Republican caucus sent a letter to Boehner and Majority Leader Eric Cantor urging them to oppose any annual spending bills that include funding for Obamacare.

The letter was spearheaded by Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina and got the signatures of 80 House Republicans.

During the call, one member asked Boehner, ""Can you at least announce that you want to defund Obamacare?"" Another asked Boehner how he would get a short-term spending measure passed, according to one person on the call.

Congressional Republicans have sought repeatedly to repeal the law.

While Republicans say the law will hurt job creation, supporters view it as a landmark initiative that will extend health insurance coverage to millions of Americans.

In addition to the House lawmakers who signed the letter to Republican leaders, there is support for denying funds to Obamacare from prominent Republican senators including Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida.

During the five-week summer recess, Obamacare has been riling up constituents at town hall-style meeting in lawmakers' home districts, with both critics and supporters airing their views.

Republican Representative Tim Huelskamp of Kansas told Reuters there was a ""large divide between Republican leaders in (Washington) D.C. and Republicans in the rest of the country.""

Huelskamp, who participated in the call and agrees with using the government shutdown strategy on Obamacare, said Republican leaders were ignoring that divide ""at their own peril.""

Republican leaders have been working to find alternative ways to weaken the health law.

One idea under consideration is tying approval of an increase in the country's borrowing limit to agreement by the Obama administration to delay implementation of the measure.

An aide to Cantor, the No. 2 House Republican, told Reuters on Wednesday that the debt limit was a good ""leverage point"" to try to force action on Obamacare."
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/16/business/what-sweden-can-tell-us-about-obamacare.html,2013-06-16 00:00:00,['Robert H. Frank'],What Sweden Can Tell Us About Obamacare,"LAST month, for the 37th time, the House of Representatives voted to repeal Obamacare, with many Republicans saying that its call for greater government involvement in the health care system spells doom. Yet most other industrial countries have health care systems with far more government involvement than we are ever likely to see under Obamacare. What does their experience tell us about Republican fears?

While in Sweden this month as a visiting scholar, I’ve asked several Swedish health economists to share their thoughts about that question. They have spent their lives under a system in which most health care providers work directly for the government. Like economists in most other countries, they tend to be skeptical of large bureaucracies. So if extensive government involvement in health care is indeed a recipe for doom, they should have clear evidence of that by now.

Yet none of them voiced the kinds of complaints about recalcitrant bureaucrats and runaway health costs that invariably surface in similar conversations with American colleagues. Little wonder. The Swedish system performs superbly, and my Swedish colleagues cited evidence of that fact with obvious pride.

The United States spends more than $8,000 a person per year on health care, well more than twice what Sweden spends. Yet health outcomes are far better in Sweden along virtually every dimension. Its infant mortality rate, for example, was recently less than half that of the United States. And males aged 15 to 60 are almost twice as likely to die in any given year in the United States than in Sweden."

USA TODAY Collegiate Correspondent

Although many young students say they think health insurance is important%2C nearly 80%25 know little about the Affordable Care Act%27s new insurance marketplace.

Students will benefit in many ways from the online marketplace%2C one health-organization official says.

Unlike most college students, Tara Carey chose her own health insurance plan.

Three years ago, Carey's father passed away from a chronic blood disorder after being laid off and losing his health insurance, rendering him temporarily unable to afford chemotherapy treatments. With her mother unemployed and uninsured, the Emory University junior was required by her school to get insured, but opted out of Emory's Student Aetna plan because it didn't offer reasonable coverage.

""The insurance that I have now actually is fine — it has great coverage with low co-pays, but the premium costs too much of my monthly income,"" says Carey, 20. ""When I had the Aetna plan as a freshman and sophomore, the amounts I paid out of pocket were ridiculous. I had to have a minor surgery that cost roughly $4,000, and I had to pay $2,500 — doesn't exactly sound like good coverage for a college student.""

Still working to pay for the procedure, Carey plans to utilize the open enrollment period — Oct. 1 to March 31 — of the health insurance marketplace under the Affordable Care Act to find a plan that better suits her needs.

While she admits she doesn't entirely understand how the marketplace will work, she thinks the impact on college students will depend on their family income.

""Yes, Emory is a wealthy school, but many people have a health plan that doesn't meet their needs, so people need to know,"" Carey says.

Yale senior Christina Chandra, 21, found herself in a similar position when the restaurant where her parents worked closed and they lost their health insurance. As a result, Chandra opted into Yale's default student plan only to find it expensive and lacking coverage for services such as dental care.

Come Oct. 1, Chandra hopes to use the marketplace to find a suitable plan — not only for herself but for her entire family.

""[My parents] feel as though they don't understand the health insurance marketplace at all, so at the moment they are depending on me and the Affordable Care Act to get them a plan at a reasonable rate that will cover essential health services,"" she says.

According to a recent Kaiser Family Foundation Health Tracking Poll, around three quarters of those ages 18 to 25 believe it is important for them to personally get insurance and that insurance is worth the cost. However, nearly 80% of those under 30 had heard little to nothing about the marketplace.

One organization trying to change that is Young Invincibles.

Currently in the midst of a nationwide education campaign called Healthy Young America, Young Invincibles has reached more than 1,000 youth-serving organizations and health partners with information about the ACA and new options through the exchanges.

Jennifer Mishory, deputy director at Young Invincibles, says students will be affected by the online marketplace in three significant ways:

Students can enroll in plans without the threat of being denied coverage because of a pre-existing condition. Students who earn less than about $46,000 or families that earn less than $94,000 annually may be able to access free coverage through Medicaid or discounted coverage through monthly tax credits depending on the state and their exact income level. New plans will provide free preventive services, annual checkups, prescriptions and substance use disorder services.

""We need to make sure that young people understand their new options and know where to go to see if they can get monthly tax credits,"" Mishory says. ""We also need to make sure that young people are armed with information about how insurance works so they can make good choices for themselves.""

With national road maps to coverage and health care finder apps, Young Invincibles hopes to ease this process.

However, the option itself for college students to optin has been nothing short of a contentious debate.

The National Center for Public Policy Research's David Hogberg recently found that more than 3.7 million young adults will be at least $500 better off if they forgo insurance and pay the opt-out penalty.

Josh Archambault, a senior fellow in health care at the Pioneer Institute in Massachusetts, says it is important to remember this claim is from an economic standpoint. He says only 1,913 of 6 million residents under 30 are on Massachusetts' Young Adult Plan (YAP) because most remain on their parents' insurance until they turn 26.

""I think college students should visit the federal website to look at the possible costs and options that are available to them, but I think a lot of them will find that it makes more sense for them to remain uninsured, remain on their parents' plan or seek out a more catastrophic plan Archambault says.

After using the Yale health plan freshman year without knowing she could opt out, Yale senior Rachel Kubi has been under her parents' insurance for the past three years and plans to stick with it.

""It just seems easier than researching and purchasing insurance on my own, especially since I can stay on my parents' plan until I'm 26,"" says Kubi, 21. ""After graduation, hopefully my employer will cover insurance, but if not, I would decide between staying on my parents' insurance and using the health insurance marketplace.""

Emory junior Audrey Zeis will also be staying on her parents' plan and thinks others will do the same until they absolutely have to find their own plan.

""It's really hard to get people our age involved with this kind of issue because there's the mentality 'I'm not going to get sick, so I don't need to worry about it,'"" she says.

However, by volunteering in free clinics at local hospitals in Texas — which has the largest uninsured population —Zeis has seen reason for concern firsthand.

""It was really disheartening to see people sit there for seven hours then tell them they couldn't be seen that day, knowing the only reason they came into the free clinic is because it's their only option,"" Zeis says. ""If any of those people had insurance, it'd be so much easier for them to get the basic care they needed.""

Carey echoes this sentiment.

""People think that health disparities are only problems of developing countries across the globe, when in fact, it is a huge problem right here in the U.S.,"" she says. ""That is something I believe Obamacare will change significantly. People just need to be educated about the marketplace and their options — the word needs to spread."""
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/12/31/sebelius-no-more-obamacare-delays/,2013-12-31 00:00:00,[],Sebelius: No more ObamaCare delays,"Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, on the eve of the ObamaCare launch, told Fox News she doesn't anticipate any more delays for the health care law.

The secretary voiced confidence in the law as her department announced what it claimed was a ""surge"" in enrollment. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said Tuesday that more than 2.1 million people have enrolled through the federal- and state-run marketplaces.

""I'm thrilled that we're going to have millions of people for the first time that have health security, and it should be a great New Year for lots of families across America,"" Sebelius told Fox News in an exclusive interview, as she left a downtown D.C. restaurant Tuesday afternoon.

Sebelius acknowledged there could continue to be hiccups going into 2014. ""There always are,"" she said. ""People change plans every year.""

But she predicted a relatively smooth transition and said she doesn't see more delays in the future.

The administration, though, has announced a string of delays and exemptions over the last several weeks. Among the changes, the administration recently announced it would let people whose health care policies were canceled under ObamaCare buy bare-bones ""catastrophic coverage"" plans which would have otherwise been unavailable.

The requirement on mid-sized and large employers to provide insurance was also delayed by a year. Given all the changes being punched in the law, one Republican lawmaker has likened it to a ""Jenga game.""

A big part of the problem was the difficulty individuals had signing up through the slow, error-prone federal website.

But the secretary's remarks Tuesday marked a significant change in tone from just a few weeks ago when, during testimony on Capitol Hill, she agreed with a Republican congresswoman who called the launch of HealthCare.gov a ""debacle.""

The administration has scrambled to fix the technical problems with the site, though several states are still grappling with technical difficulties.

CMS announced Tuesday that December enrollment is ""nearly 6 times that of October and November combined.""

""We expect these numbers to continue to grow through the end of March when open enrollment ends,"" the agency said.

Republicans have signaled they're not impressed by the growth in enrollment.

Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., said Sunday that the surge is nothing to ""celebrate.""

""It was a failed [website] launch, a flawed law and it needs real change,"" he said.

With coverage beginning Jan. 1, the administration is hoping a total of 7 million sign up through the exchanges by March 31. That's when the federal government will begin to assess a penalty on those who do not buy health insurance, as required under the law.

A majority of Americans say they believe the new health care law will increase their medical costs and taxes, according to an Aug. 8 Fox News poll. The survey found 57 percent of those polled felt the way ObamaCare was being rolled out was ""a joke.""

Overall, 63 percent of voters believe that the 2010 health care law needs to be changed. That number is up from 58 percent of those asked the question in July 2012.

The number of Republicans who think the law should be changed remained steady at 84 percent. According to the poll, more voters used negative terms to describe the health care overhaul -- with 39 percent calling it ""disastrous"" and 14 percent calling it ""a step backwards.""

The Fox News poll, which is based on landline and cellphone interviews with 1,007 randomly chosen registered voters, found 71 percent of voters believed ObamaCare will increase their taxes, while 62 percent believe it will increase the cost of their premiums. Sixty-five percent believe implementing the law will add to the federal deficit.

The confusion over what will happen with the Affordable Care Act seems to be growing as the Oct. 1 opening of ObamaCare exchanges draws near.

Major elements of the law have been met with strong opposition and the White House's plan to pump up support appears to be running into hardening perceptions.

Initially, the goal was to provide medical coverage for the country's 50 million uninsured and to restrain skyrocketing costs. Last month, Obama acknowledged glitches in implementing the law and announced a one-year delay in a major provision requiring companies to provide coverage for their workers.

In the latest development, the administration has also delayed for a year a cap on out-of-pocket medical costs. A partial cap will still go into effect, but the delay could lead to consumers paying more for out-of-pocket drug costs in the interim.

So far, 21 governors have opted out of the law's Medicaid expansion and even more refused to set up a health insurance marketplace -- those marketplaces are supposed to get off the ground at the beginning of 2014.

Labor unions have also ramped up their criticism of ObamaCare and its impact on union-run health plans. Many claim the law will drive up costs for plans that are managed jointly by small business owners and unions which could cause unionized employers to drop coverage to 20 million people.

Union officials also have been upset that the Obama administration listened to employer requests to delay a provision requiring bigger companies to provide insurance coverage or pay a penalty.

Laborers International Union of North America President Terry O'Sullivan sent Obama an email last month saying the law has ""destructive consequences."" O'Sullivan's letter echoed the sentiments written in a separate letter by the heads of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, the United Food and Commercial Workers and Unite Here. The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers went a step further and took out print ads raising concerns over the law.

The setbacks seem to be taking a toll on how Americans view the overhaul.

According to an Aug. 12 Rasmussen Reports poll, 53 percent of U.S. voters said they viewed Obama's health care law unfavorably. The national survey of 1,000 voters found 42 percent of that group having a ""very unfavorable"" opinion of the law.

Those numbers are in line with a Gallup poll that found more Americans to have a negative rather than a positive view about the health care law's future impact on their family and the country.

Fifty-two percent of Americans say they disapprove of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, while 44 percent approve. Last fall, 48 percent said they approved of the law and 45 percent disapproved. Americans have generally been divided in their views of the law since it was passed in 2010.

Obama defended the law at a press conference this past Friday, and blasted Republicans for continuing to speak ill of it.

""I think the really interesting question is why it is that my friends in the other party have made the idea of preventing these people from getting health care their holy grail, their No. 1 priority. The one unifying principle in the Republican Party at the moment is making sure that 30 million people don't have health care and, presumably, repealing all those benefits,"" Obama said.

He continued: ""There is no doubt that in implementing the Affordable Care Act, a program of this significance, there are going to be some glitches. No doubt about it.""

But he said the goal is to deliver ""high-quality, affordable health care for people and to reform the system so costs start going down and people start getting a better bang for the buck. And I make no apologies for that."""

“These are not glitches. The extent of the problems is pretty enormous,” an insurance executive who participated in Obamacare conference calls told the Times. “At the end of our calls, people say, ‘It’s awful, just awful.'”

The Times says those closest to the three-and-a-half year-long building of Obamacare, like embattled Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, ignored or quashed the myriad warning bells sounding all around them. On Tuesday, the Republican National Committee released a #FireSebelius web ad calling for Sebelius’s ousting.

“We foresee a train wreck,” one insurance executive working on Obamacare IT said in February. “We don’t have the IT specifications. The level of angst in health plans is growing by leaps and bounds. The political people in the administration do not understand how far behind they are.”

The comments mirror those made in April by Sen. Max Baucus (D-MT) who helped craft Obamacare. At the time, Baucus said Obamacare was “a huge train wreck coming down.”

Now, the companies that bagged millions to build the Obamacare digital architecture are scurrying to avoid public ridicule and scrutiny. “Worried about their reputations, contractors are now publicly distancing themselves from the troubled parts of the federally run project,” reports the Times.

Development Seed President Eric Gundersen told the Times his company built the busted HealthCare.org website but “had nothing to do with what happened after a user hit the ‘Apply Now’ button.”

Oracle, which was subcontracted to handle identity management software used in the Obamacare registration process, claims its services are running swimmingly. “Our software is running properly,” said Oracle communications vice president Deborah Hellinger.

One of Obamacare’s biggest winners of taxpayer dollars has been CGI Group. Washington Examiner reporter Richard Pollock says that the U.S. subsidiary of Canadian company CGI (which stands for “Conseillers en Gestion et Informatique”) Group, CGI Federal, received a no-bid sweetheart contract worth $93 million. Since 2009, CGI has scored $678 million in taxpayer money for 185 separate task orders.

Even progressive Democrats are now blasting Obamacare’s failures.

Former Obama White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs says President Barack Obama should fire those responsible for the “excruciatingly embarrassing” Obamacare rollout.

Progressive Washington Post columnist Ezra Klein, a strong Obamacare supporter, wrote on Monday that “So far, the Affordable Care Act’s launch has been a failure. Not ‘troubled.’ Not ‘glitchy.’ A failure.”

Obamacare will cost taxpayers $2.6 trillion over the next ten years."

The delay in the tax, which has long been a goal of Big Labor, is expected to be part of a spending agreement brokered by Sens. Reid and McConnell.

At issue is a “reinsurance” tax levied against all group health plans. The funds raised would be used to compensate insurance companies for providing coverage to extremely sick individuals. Labor unions have made eliminating the tax a top priority, arguing that it would drive up the cost of health insurance for union members. At the recently concluded AFL-CIO annual meeting last month, union members passed a resolution calling for a repeal of the tax. The outlines of the emerging Senate spending deal will delay imposition of the tax for one year.

When House Republicans passed their government spending bill, with a one-year delay in ObamaCare’s individual mandate, President Obama countered that the health care program was the “settled” law of the land. Which, apparently, is true unless one has a PAC that showers millions of dollars in campaign contributions on lawmakers.

Earlier this year, the Obama Administration delayed for one year the mandate that large employers provide health insurance to their employees. This came soon after a similar one-year delay in the set-up of health exchanges for small businesses. Since ObamaCare passed Congress, the Administration has issued hundreds of waivers to special interests, exempting them from the effects of the law.

It seems that only the average American citizen will be made to comply with the ObamaCare program. Democrats, throughout the fiscal stand-off, have argued that ObamaCare should not be altered or reformed. Unless, of course, you are a labor union."

USA TODAY

Consumers taking a more active role in their care could push premiums down

Medicare Part D experience shows how industry competition influenced premiums

Insurers say they want more customers to balance their pool of insured patients

WASHINGTON — Market forces and an impetus to attract younger, healthier people into the insurance market will help keep health insurance premiums lower as the 2010 health care law takes effect on Jan. 1, industry analysts and insurance officials say.

""If they price too high, young people won't buy insurance, and that's going to hurt the companies,"" said Jay Angoff, who led initial implementation of the law for HHS. ""They need these people to come in. It's an industry problem.""

Starting Jan. 1, most Americans will be required to buy insurance or pay a fine. Insurers may not turn away these customers because of pre-existing conditions, age or gender, so Americans previously unable to buy insurance are likely to sign up by the millions. The changing health environment, say industry figures and analysts, will offer these new customers:

• Consumer-driven health policies that require people to pay more attention to their costs or receive rewards for healthy actions — such as annual health exams, the use of generic medications and programs that correct chronic conditions. These features will help drive down premiums, said Tom Richards, president of individual plans for health insurer Cigna.

""Broadly, we're trying to attract a wide swath of people of all ages and health conditions,"" Richards said. But he does expect premiums to go up in the individual market.

• A general industry push to keep premiums low to attract customers, just as what happened with the implementation of Medicare's Part D prescription drug program, said Jon Kingsdale, who directed Massachusetts' health exchanges when that state started its health care program.

Companies assumed only sick Medicare patients would join the program, so they priced premiums higher to compensate for higher costs, Kingsdale said. But the plans with lower premiums attracted a broader range of patients and eventually captured more of the market.

""If you bet that you'll get sick people so you price high, you will discourage younger people from joining your plan,"" he said. ""If you price more aggressively, thinking you'll attract more enrollees, you'll get healthier people.""

Individual premiums over the past two years in Massachusetts have dropped 12%, said Joel Ario, managing director at Manatt Health Solutions and former director of health insurance exchanges under President Obama.

""I think that's what most people (think) will happen in this market, too,"" he said, referring to the new federal and state exchanges. ""The single risk pool will be more stable than ever because it will be based on the whole pool's experience.""

While the insurance industry wants to keep premiums low, there are parts of the health care law that may drive costs higher, said Robert Zirkelbach, spokesman for America's Health Insurance Plans. One factor is the requirement that insurers must provide more comprehensive coverage, which means someone will have to pay for the additional services that must be covered by insurance.

That, Zirkelbach said, can drive up premiums for even those consumers who want to buy catastrophic-coverage plans or those with fewer benefits.

""The industry is focused on affordability,"" he said, adding that there is a move toward wellness programs, lowering out-of-pocket costs for those who choose higher-quality and lower-cost providers, and working with hospitals to move away from fee-for-service payment systems.

Insurers know the subsidies included in the law for Americans who make less than 400% of the poverty level — about $92,000 for a family of four — will help offset increased premiums for young people, said Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a health care advocacy group.

To him, the arguments for fewer taxes on insurers or the ability to charge more for those with pre-existing conditions to make up for fewer young people are moot.

Just how much premiums will change depends on the state you live in, Kingsdale said.

Individual premiums decreased when Massachusetts' health care took effect, he said, because the state already had high-priced and insurers were not allowed to turn away the sick and could not charge large premium differences based on age, gender and health.

""Other states will see exactly the opposite happen,"" he said. ""Their premiums tend to be quite low, but they're getting skimpy insurance.""

In Oregon, Ario said, large differences in premium prices have already appeared.

In one case, a 40-year-old non-smoker in Oregon could buy a low-cost or bronze-level plan for $162 a month from one company or the same plan from another for $400 a month, Ario said. Anti-trust laws prevented the insurers from comparing pricing before developing their premiums.

When the companies with the higher rates saw their competitors' lower premiums, he said, they asked the state to allow them to file for reduced premiums.

""The good news is that in most marketplaces, there will be some carriers that will be bold and price competitively to get more market share,"" Ario said."

Health care helpers turn to paper, phones","Volunteers and staffers trying to help people sign up for health insurance on the new federal websites say they’ve turned to 20th-century technology after being frustrated by bottlenecks. They’re signing people up using telephones and paper applications.

Federal IT experts took down the new health insurance market at www.healthcare.gov Monday night and struggled well into Tuesday to get it up and running.

Users were able to create accounts and even got e-mails confirming they had signed in. but were then sent to an online “waiting room”. “We have a lot of visitors on the site right now. Please stay on this page,” it advised.

Dizzy Warren, Community Outreach Manager for Michigan Consumers for Healthcare, says her team is trying to keep people calm. Michigan is one of 36 states that is letting the federal government run its health insurance exchange, so people there have been hitting the online traffic jams.

“At this time we cannot honestly confirm how many people have been enrolled through the state,” Warren told reporters in a telephone briefing Tuesday.

“Some navigators have been able to help people over the telephone,” she added. “We have actually been encouraging them to make appointments with these individuals for some time next week.”

But Warren confirms what the federal government has been saying – a big part of the problem has been that so many people are trying to enroll. “All of our phones are ringing off the hook, even well beyond regular business hours,” she said.

The federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which is running the websites, says more people should be able to get through now, after some work to increase both capacity and efficiency of the network. “An extraordinary number of people are coming to check out HealthCare.gov. Traffic on the website and at the call center continues to be high, suggesting a strong interest by consumers in learning about their health coverage options,” CMS said in a statement.

“Our top issue is that too many people are coming to check out plans and find out more about the health care law.”

Jill Hanken, a health attorney at the Virginia Poverty Law Center, said volunteers there are also advising people to come back next week or to call. Virginia is another one of the states relying on the federal site.

“We have been taking this opportunity to take a deep breath,” she said. “Our navigators are taking appointments so people can come in next week.”

But even some states running their own exchanges are straining. Maryland navigators said they turned to paper forms to help the most impatient people enroll in health insurance.

More than 174,000 people had visited Maryland’s website as of Sunday, the state said, but only 326 people had actually signed up for health insurance. “We are working around the clock to make the site better. Marylanders can use the system now, and they should also know that we expect the user experience to improve substantially in the days and weeks ahead,” officials there said in a statement.

Kentucky has been having fewer problems. Kentucky opted to run its own exchange. Governor Steve Beshear, a Democrat, used an executive order to push the plan through.

“I just did it,” Beshear said in an interview this week. “I issued an executive order. It’s just too important for our state.”

Barbara Gordon of Kentuckiana Regional Planning & Development Agency, one of the non-profit groups helping people enroll, said the state’s exchange had some problems the first day, but not since. “Statewide, the numbers indicated this morning that over 7,000 Kentuckians have enrolled in health insurance at the exchange,” she said. Kentucky has about 640,000 people without health insurance.

Some states report better progress. New York says 40,000 people have signed up on its state-run site, California says more than 16,000 have signed up and Washington state signed up 9,400 -- most of whom will go onto the state's expanded Medicaid program.

Despite the delays, groups like Hanken’s are still trying to reach out and encourage Virginia’s 1 million uninsured people to sign up for health insurance. “We don’t want to lose anybody, so we’ll make sure the public is aware when we get up to full speed,” Hanken said.

Ron Pollack of the non-profit group Families USA, which has been pushing to help publicize the health insurance exchanges, says he thinks people will keep trying. Anyone who signs up by Dec. 15 can buy a health insurance policy that starts coverage on Jan. 1 and people have until March 31 to get coverage in the 2014 open enrollment period.

“Given how significant health coverage is, especially for people who don’t have it today … I can’t imagine that people are going to give up, given what the stakes are,” Pollack said.

Mark Nelson, an Arizona insurance broker who has been trying to sign up on the federal exchange since it first opened a week ago, says he was finally able to set up an account Tuesday.



“However, the site is extremely unstable and temperamental. It erred out on the final page,” Nelson said via email. “I think I did get the info in so will see what I get back. I believe this is far too complicated and overly secured to simply get a rate.”"

But what will enrollees actually get for that monthly charge?

States are starting to roll out details about the exchanges, providing a look at just how affordable coverage under the Affordable Care Act will be. Some potential participants may be surprised at the figures: $2,000 deductibles, $45 primary care visit co-pays, and $250 emergency room tabs.

Those are just some of the charges enrollees will incur in a silver-level plan in California, which recently unveiled an overview of the benefits and charges associated with its exchange. That's on top of the $321 average monthly premium.

For some, this will be great news since it will allow them to see the doctor without breaking the bank. But others may not want to shell out a few thousand bucks in addition to a monthly premium.

""The hardest question is will it be a good deal and will consumers be able to afford it,"" said Marian Mulkey, director of the health reform initiative at the California Healthcare Foundation. ""The jury is still out. It depends on their circumstances.""

A quick refresher on Obamacare: People who don't have affordable health insurance through their employers will be able to sign up for coverage through state-based exchanges. Enrollment is set to begin in October, with coverage taking effect in January. You must have some form of coverage next year, or you will face annual penalties of $95 or 1% of family income (whichever is greater) initially and more in subsequent years.

Each state will offer four levels of coverage: platinum, gold, silver and bronze. Platinum plans come with the highest premiums, but lowest out-of-pocket expenses, while bronze plans carry lower monthly charges but require more cost-sharing. Gold and silver fall in the middle.

The federal government will offer premium subsidies to those with incomes of up to four times the federal poverty level. This year, that's $45,960 for an individual or $94,200 for a family of four. There will be additional help to cover out-of-pocket expenses for those earning less than 250% of the poverty line: $28,725 for a single person and $58,875 for a family of four. The subsidies are tied to the cost of the state's silver level plans.

California offers insight into how much participants will actually have to pay under Obamacare. The state, unlike most others, is requiring insurers to offer a standard set of benefits and charges in each plan level. The only variables are monthly premiums, doctor networks and carriers in your area.

For those in need of frequent medical care, the platinum or gold plans would reduce out-of-pocket costs for treatment. These plans have no deductible, and doctors' visits and medication are cheaper. But the trade-off is that they have higher monthly premiums. California has not yet released the premium range for these tiers.

On the flip side, a young man who never visits the doctor and wants to minimize his monthly charge could opt for a bronze plan. A 40-year-old enrolling in this plan could pay as little as $219 a month. But, if he did get sick, he'd get socked with a $5,000 deductible, $60 co-pays for primary care visits and a $300 emergency room charge.

Obamacare provides protection for those who need a lot of care by placing a cap on out-of-pocket expenses. The maximum a person in an individual platinum plan will spend a year is $4,000, while those in the other tiers will shell out no more than $6,400.

""Insurance is expensive. It's hard for anyone who isn't well off to afford it,"" said Gary Claxton, director of the health care marketplace project at the Kaiser Family Foundation. ""But it is good enough that you can afford to get sick without bankrupting yourself.""

Whether potential enrollees find these plans affordable will depend on how healthy they are and whether they are currently insured.

Many individual insurance offerings currently available come with much higher deductibles, cover fewer expenses and limits on how much they'll pay out in a year. Plans on the exchange, on the other hand, are required to cover a variety of ""essential benefits,"" including maternity care, mental health services and medication.

""In many cases, depending on the plan, the coverage will be more comprehensive than what the enrollee currently has,"" said Anne Gonzalez, a spokeswoman with Covered California, which is running the state's exchange."

While many residents in New York and California may see sizable decreases in their premiums, Americans in many places could face significant increases if they buy insurance through state-based exchanges next year.

That's because these people live in states where insurers were allowed to sell bare-bones plans and exclude the sick, which has kept costs down. Under Obamacare, insurers must offer a package of essential benefits -- including maternity, mental health and medications -- and must cover all who apply. But more comprehensive coverage may lead to more expensive insurance plans.

Under Obamacare, all Americans must have insurance coverage starting in 2014 or face penalties of $95 or 1% of family income, whichever is greater. Enrollment in the exchanges begins October 1, with coverage kicking in in January. Plans will come in four tiers, ranging from bronze to platinum.

Some lightly regulated states, including Indiana, Ohio, Florida and South Carolina, have recently released preliminary rate information highlighting steep price increases. Unlike the blue states of California and New York, these are Republican-led states that have strongly opposed the Affordable Care Act, as Obamacare is officially known.

Comparing this year's and next year's plans isn't easy because the structure of the plans is so different. Each state comes up with its own method.

Behind the numbers in 3 key states. In Florida, for instance, officials constructed a hypothetical silver-level plan based on the offerings available today. Then they looked at how the cost of that plan compares to the average silver plan that will be available on the exchange. Florida found premiums will rise between 7.6% and 58.8%, depending on the insurer. The average increase would be 35%.

The main driver of the premium increases is the Obamacare mandate that coverage be offered to everyone, said Kevin McCarty, Florida's insurance commissioner. There are just short of a million enrollees in the individual market in Florida, while 3.8 million are uninsured. The state does not allow new entrants into a ""high-risk pool,"" which provides coverage to the sick.

""People who are in their 50s with high blood pressure have no coverage options,"" he said.

Ohio, meanwhile, said there would be an average increase of 41% by comparing a trade association's report of premiums for all plans available today with the average premium expected on the exchange.

Indiana officials said prices would rise an average of 72%. But they were looking at the cost of providing care, not actual premiums.

All of these rate hikes must still be reviewed by the federal government and do not take into account the fact that Americans with incomes up to $45,960 for an individual and $94,200 for a family of four will be eligible for federal subsidies.

So why aren't there such big premium increases in other states? New York, for example, already required that insurers provide comprehensive coverage to all who apply. Rates there could fall by half since the pool will expand to include many younger, healthier residents under Obamacare. But New York is more the exception than the rule, experts said.

Rate hikes depend on age and gender. To give consumers a better idea of how premiums will change, CNNMoney took a look at the plans provided by one insurer: Physicians Health Plan of Northern Indiana.

Our analysis found that 21-year-old men will pay a lot more for an exchange plan, but 42-year-old women and 62-year-old men will shell out less for a silver-level plan that comes with a $2,500 deductible and a roughly $25 co-pay for office visits.

Under this scenario, a young man's monthly rate will rise to $214 on the exchange next year, up 63% from today. The woman, however, will pay $284, a drop of more than 7%, while the older man will be charged $615, a nearly 6% decrease. This is because Obamacare requires that women pay the same amount as men and does not allow insurers to charge older participants more than three times the young.

Physicians Health expects most enrollees to sign up for bronze or silver plans, which have lower monthly premiums but carry higher deductibles and co-pays, according to Jim Brunnemer, the insurer's chief financial officer. Today, its members typically buy high deductible plans.

To be sure, there are some states where premiums will fall or come in lower than expected. The Obama administration pointed to a recent Department of Health and Human Services study of 11 states with publicly available premium data that showed rates are below Congressional Budget Office projections.

""When the marketplaces open on Oct. 1, plans will have to compete side by side, and consumers will be able to choose the one that best fits their budget and needs,"" said Joanne Peters, a department spokeswoman.

While premiums may go up in other states, Obamacare advocates say people will receive more comprehensive coverage. Also, the law limits the amount people have to pay out-of-pocket for deductibles and co-pays to $6,350 in 2014.

""A lot of people will get more for their money,"" said Sarah Lueck, senior policy analyst for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. ""Even people paying a higher rate will benefit. It will be a big change in most states."""

Pollak'],Obama Cancels 'You Can Keep Your Plan' Promise: 'Just Shop Around',"In a speech at Boston’s Faneuil Hall on Wednesday afternoon, President Barack Obama discarded his now-infamous broken promise: “If you like your health insurance, you can keep your health insurance.” Instead, he offered a new promise: “You will be getting a better deal,” the president told health insurance consumers.

He blamed insurance companies, not Obamacare, for the canceled policies:

Now, if you had one of these substandard plans before the Affordable Care Act became law, and you really like that plan, you were able to keep it. That’s what I said when I was running for office. That was part of the promise we made. But ever since the law was passed, if insurers decided to downgrade or cancel the substandard plans, what we said under the law is that you have got to replace them with quality, comprehensive coverage because that, too, was a central premise of the Affordable Care Act from the very beginning… So if you’re getting one of these letters [canceling your insurance policy], just shop around in the new marketplace. That’s what it’s for… For the fewer than 5% of Americans who buy insurance on your own, you will be getting a better deal. So anyone peddling the motion that insurers are canceling people’s plan without mentioning that almost all the insurers are encouraging people to join better plans with the same carrier and stronger benefits and stronger protections, while others will be able to get better plans with new carriers through the marketplace, and then many will get new help to pay for these better plans and make them actually cheaper–if you leave that stuff out, you’re being grossly misleading, to say the least.

Ignoring evidence that the “better deal” is often far more expensive than existing plans, the president updated his promise without apologizing for misleading voters for years about the consequences of Obamacare. He also ignored the fact that companies were compelled by the law to change their plans to comply with new rules.

Obama, repeating a common Democrat talking point, also cited Medicare Part D to claim that Democrats had helped Republicans improve that policy, even though they had opposed it. However, as Rep. Renee Ellmers (R-NC) pointed out in Congress earlier Wednesday, Medicare Part D is voluntary–unlike Obamacare."
http://news.yahoo.com/obamacare-enrollment-low-democrats-unhappy-081903799--finance.html,,[],Obamacare enrollment low; Democrats unhappy,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama on Thursday planned to announce a fix to counter the millions of health coverage cancellations going to consumers, as the White House tried to stem Democratic impatience over a program likely to be at the center of next year's midterm elections for control of Congress.

At the same time, the administration was promising improvements in a federal website so balky that enrollments totaled fewer than 27,000 in 36 states combined. The administration had said in advance the enrollment numbers would fall far short of initial expectations. After weeks of highly publicized technical woes, they did.

A paltry 26,794 people enrolled for health insurance during the first, flawed month of operations for the federal ""Obamacare"" website.

Adding in enrollment of more than 79,000 in the 14 states with their own websites, the nationwide number of 106,000 October sign-ups was barely one-fifth of what officials had projected — and a small fraction of the millions who have received private coverage cancellations as a result of the federal law.

The administration said an additional 1 million people have been found eligible to buy coverage in the markets, with about one-third qualifying for tax credits to reduce their premiums. Another 396,000 have been found eligible for Medicaid, which covers low-income people.

Republicans were unmoved.

""Even with the administration's Enron-like accounting, fewer people have signed up for Obamacare nationwide than the 280,000 who've already lost their plan in Kentucky as a result of Obamacare mandates,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said.

Administration officials and senior congressional Democrats expressed confidence in the program's future. ""We expect enrollment will grow substantially throughout the next five months,"" said Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, who is in charge of the program.

""Even with the issues we've had, the marketplace is working and people are enrolling,"" she added.

Story continues

Despite the expressions, the White House worked to reassure anxious Democrats who are worried about the controversial program, which they voted into existence three years ago over Republican opposition as strong now as it was then.

Senate Democrats arranged a closed-door meeting for midday Thursday in the Capitol with White House officials, who held a similar session Wednesday with the House rank and file. Ahead of that meeting, Obama planned to speak from the White House about new efforts to help Americans receiving insurance cancellation notices.

So far, five Senate Democrats are on record in support of legislation by Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., to make sure everyone can keep their present coverage if they want to. The bill would require insurance companies to continue offering existing policies, even if they fall short of minimum coverage requirements in the law.

The measure has little apparent chance at passage, given that it imposes a new mandate on the insurance industry that Republicans will be reluctant to accept.

At the same time, a vote would at least permit Democrats to say they have voted to repair some of the problems associated with the Affordable Care Act, as many appear eager to do.

In a statement, Landrieu said Sens. Jeff Merkley of Oregon, Kay Hagan of North Carolina and Mark Pryor of Arkansas were now supporting the legislation, as is Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California. All but Feinstein are on the ballot next year.

Across the Capitol, majority Republicans in the House set a vote for Friday on legislation to permit insurance companies to continue selling existing policies that have been ordered scrapped because they fall short of coverage standards in the law.

While House passage of the measure is assured, each Democrat will be forced to cast a vote on the future of a program that Republicans have vowed to place at the center of next year's campaign.

Democratic Rep. Mike Doyle of Pennsylvania, who voted for the initial Obama health care bill, said Thursday that members of his caucus want an opportunity to go on the record in support of allowing people to keep the insurance they had.

Doyle told MSNBC in an interview that at a White House meeting Wednesday, House Democrats told Obama about ""the frustration level that many of us have"" with the health care roll-out.

Doyle said Democrats warned Obama that ""if you don't give us something by Friday"" to fix the insurance cancellation problem, then many Democrats are likely to vote for the pending House bill sponsored by Republican Rep. Fred Upton of Michigan, which would accomplish that goal.

The promise of keeping coverage was Obama's oft-stated pledge when the legislation was under consideration, a calling card since shredded by the millions of cancellations mailed out by insurers.

Obama apologized last week for the broken promise, but aides said at the time the White House was only considering administration changes, rather than new legislation.

Two-year improvement in Medicare finances over last year%27s report

Social Security trust fund outlook unchanged from last year

President Obama determined to work with Congress on long-term plan%2C Lew said

WASHINGTON -- The federal Medicare trust fund will be exhausted in 2026, two years later than last year's forecast, according to the Medicare trustees report released Friday.

The report, which also projected the Social Security system trust fund would be exhausted by 2033, is expected to influence upcoming congressional debates over the nation's debt ceiling, proposals to reduce the deficit and the future of entitlement programs.

Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew called the change for Medicare a modest improvement.

""But more has to be done,"" Lew said. ""The president recognizes how essential reform is, and he is determined to work on a bipartisan basis to put Social Security and Medicare on stronger footing.""

Last year, the report said the Medicare and Social Security trust funds were both on ""unsustainable paths"" — as they have been for years — and will be exhausted by 2024 and 2033, respectively. The Social Security projection was unchanged.

But after several reports of continuing lowered costs in health care spending, including a reduced projection of spending from the Congressional Budget Office, it was expected that the trustees might change that date for Medicare.

Earlier this month, the CBO determined projected Medicare and Medicaid spending would drop $618 billion over the next decade. That's 5% less than they projected in early 2010.

While some of that decrease can be attributed to the recession, analysts say changes in Medicare payment systems, reductions in hospital readmissions, a move toward generic medications and better efficiency from providers have affected both government and private spending.

""The Medicare report demonstrates once again the importance of the Affordable Care Act, which has strengthened Medicare's finances by reining in health care costs,"" Lew said. The trustees extended Medicare projections by eight years when the law was passed in 2010.

Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius cited the reduced hospital readmissions, fraud and payment changes as reasons for the improved Medicare outlook and that the improvement came without cutting mandatory Medicare benefits.

""With the health care law, our goal was to put Medicare on more stable footing,"" she said, adding that it was just a start.

Sebelius cited recent reports that show the slowdown in health care spending is due to factors beyond the recession, saying that costs have slowed for the past three years. Medicare spending is at 1% below the GDP, and Medicaid spending is down 2%, she said. She also said the Medicare Part B premium will remain the same for next year as it was this year.

While Medicare's outlook improved, policy makers should not overlook bad news for the Social Security disability program, said Pamela Villarreal, senior fellow for the National Center for Policy Analysis, a conservative think tank. That program is expected to be insolvent in three years, after which time, the government would be able to pay only 80% of scheduled benefits.

""America just got poorer,"" she said in a statement. ""We've promised benefits that far exceed expected revenue. The total amount we owe is more than four times the size of the economy.""

Her group also said it is ""by no means certain"" that Affordable Care Act cuts in physicians' fees would be enacted as Republicans continue to try to gut the law.

Trustee Robert Reischauer acknowledged that both Medicare and Social Security are on unsustainable paths, though he said he is ""cautiously optimistic"" that health spending will continue to slow and the health care law will continue to help. He said there is ""low-hanging fruit,"" such as addressing hospital infection rates, for continued cost savings.

Trustee Seth Harris, the acting secretary of Labor, said the improving economy is helping both programs. Comprehensive immigration reform is needed, Harris said, to bring ""millions out of the shadows"" so they can contribute to the funds.

The trustees emphasized the need to find ways to improve the long-term financial outlook for both trust funds, and interest groups reacted Friday by saying reduced benefits should not be the answer.

""The best way to preserve and reinforce our social safety net over the long haul is to ensure that millionaires and billionaires pay the same Social Security contribution rates on all wages just like everybody else,"" said Jim Dean, chairman of the advocacy group Democracy for America.

Americans pay Social Security taxes up to $113,700 in annual income; any income higher than that is not taxed for Social Security.

Projections for lower Medicare spending are ""due to successful innovations in the private sector,"" said Mary Grealy, president of the Healthcare Leadership Council, which opposes reductions in Medicare funding. Anything that cuts payments for Medicare services would damage such innovations, she said.

The American Hospital Association also released a statement praising private-sector decreases in health care costs: ""The Trustees Report states that actual 2012 benefit payments were lower than projected in large part due to lower wage and price growth at hospitals and health systems,"" said president Rich Umbdenstock. ""Hospitals are contributing to these trends, with hospital cost growth at its lowest rate in 10 years.""

Proposed changes in immigration laws could also boost Medicare, according to a report released earlier this week by researchers at Harvard University Medical School. That showed that immigrants contributed about $115 billion more from their paychecks to the Medicare Trust Fund than they took out over a seven-year period in the past decade, and that the number could be greater if more people were allowed to remain in the country legally.

Last year's 2024 date for exhaustion of the Medicare trust fund was the same as predicted in 2011, while trustees moved up the date for the Social Security fund exhaustion by three years compared with 2011. The trustees have predicted the depletion of the Medicare trust fund every year since they began issuing reports in 1970. After 2033, income from the dedicated payroll tax is expected to finance about three quarters of scheduled benefits through 2087.

Last year, then-Treasury secretary Timothy Geithner predicted the law would lower costs and that without it Medicare's trust fund would be exhausted in 2016."

The insurance reforms in the 2010 federal healthcare law (a.k.a. Obamacare) are expected to raise the price of coverage for younger, healthier Americans in order to make it more affordable for older, sicker ones. A computer glitch threatens to make that shift even more pronounced, albeit just for younger people who smoke.

The Obama administration confirmed Tuesday that a glitch in its software for evaluating insurance plans will prevent insurers from imposing as big a gap as they may have wanted between the premiums for younger and older smokers. In short, it means either older smokers will be charged less than insurers might have planned or young smokers will be charged more.

The glitch is (supposedly) temporary, and applies only to the market for individual insurance policies. And it may not affect some of the states running their own insurance exchanges, although it apparently will affect California. That’s because this state’s exchange, Covered California, is relying on the feds’ computers to check whether the premiums proposed by insurers comply with the law.

[Updated, 5:30 p.m. July 9: As it turns out, California’s reliance on the federal government’s computer system isn’t germane because Covered California previously decided not to allow insurers to charge smokers higher premiums, regardless of their age. It’s one of at least four states to bar the surcharges. That’s a win for smokers, whose risks will be spread across all those who shop at the exchange.]

To dive deeply into the weeds, the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act allows insurers to vary their premiums in only four ways: They can charge more for family coverage than individual plans, and assess different premiums in different regions of a state. They can vary their premiums by age, but the highest age-based premiums can be no more than three times the lowest ones. And they can charge smokers up to 50% more than nonsmokers.

The law doesn’t require insurers to apply the same differential for smokers across the board. Insurers had been expected to apply a much higher differential to older smokers’ policies than younger smokers’ coverage, mainly because the latter tend to be a lot healthier than the former. As a result, the premiums for older smokers could be as much as 4.5 times what younger smokers pay.

These rules will be enforced by the federal government in at least the 33 states where Washington will be operating the local insurance exchange, along with any other state that is relying on Washington to evaluate insurers’ compliance. But the computer system the Department of Health and Human Services is using ran into some, err, computational issues that caused it to reject some proposed premiums that don’t actually violate the law.

As a result, next year insurers won’t be able to impose tobacco surcharges that push older smokers’ premiums more than three times higher than those paid by younger smokers.

“In 2015 and beyond, the system will expand to allow issuers to increase this ratio, if they choose to do so,” said HHS spokeswoman Joanne Peters. “This is a temporary circumstance that in no way impacts our ability to open the [exchanges] on Oct. 1, when millions of Americans will be able to purchase quality, affordable insurance for the first time.”

Some analysts speculated that insurers would impose smaller-than-anticipated surcharges on older smokers to keep rates low for young smokers -- a relatively healthy group that insurers are afraid will be deterred by the cost of coverage. Without young people on board to balance out the risks posed by older consumers, insurers could be stuck with spiraling medical expenses.

Others, however, predicted that insurers would react by imposing higher surcharges than planned on younger smokers, raising the premium surcharges on older smokers as well.

What they will actually do, however, remains to be seen. No matter how small a surcharge they impose on young smokers, their premiums are still going to be higher than the ones for bare-bones policies available today. They’re also going to be considerably more expensive than the tax penalty imposed for not obtaining coverage, at least in 2014.

The anti-choice bill in Texas currently being debated is a great start, but we need to go right to the source: the horrible murder of sperm that occurs during male masturbation.

Some activists would have you believe these are just clumps of cells, but anyone who looks at semen under a microscope can tell you that individual sperm demonstrate purposeful movements.

Did you know that we have no actual study that proves sperm can't feel pain when unnecessarily ejaculated? It's true! For all we know, these are living organisms that endure excruciating nerve stimulation when exposed outside of the male reproductive system.

There are those who would argue that we are regulating men's bodies and taking away their freedom to make their own healthcare choices, but as our conservative brethren have pointed out in many a debate on rape culture, men simply can't control their sexual urges on their own as per the landmark legal reasoning of ""boys will be boys."" Therefore, they need help and incentives.

To that end, I am proposing a bill in the Texas Legislature that does the following:

1. Ejaculation of semen outside of an active effort to procreate is banned. Some would make the case that we should allow exemptions for cases of rape, incest, or if the man's life is in danger, but this is all nonsense and doesn't correspond with our strong, Texas values. A life is a life. Just consider if our great governor Rick Perry had been ejaculated by his father during a self-pleasuring act.

In the event Section 1 isn't passed, we should include further restrictions that make it incredibly difficult for men to masturbate without facing criminal prosecution:

2. Men who masturbate must apply for a state permit, pay a $500 fee for that permit, undergo a transanal sonogram to view the internal route sperm must take to leave the male body, be counseled by a physician on the benefits of a celibate lifestyle, and view a two-hour video on the modern genocide that is male masturbation.

3. Men who obtain masturbation permits are only permitted to do so in designated areas for such activities, specifically masturbation centers that receive licensing by the state.

4. The state will be limited to a total of six masturbation centers in order to better monitor this activity, all of which will be placed at least 200 miles outside towns with populations greater than 20,000 residents. We must think of the children who could see a sign for one of these centers.

5. Male members of the Texas Legislature are examples to all men everywhere and thus, should submit to daily external and internal swab samples when the Legislature is in session that will be analyzed for evidence that masturbation has occurred.

6. In order to evaluate charges that unsanctioned masturbation has occurred by a male member of the Texas Legislature, a Committee to Understand Male Masturbation (CUMM) will be formed to determine if reported transgressions should result in the impeachment of investigated members.

7. To avoid bias in these investigations, CUMM will be composed entirely of women in the Texas Legislature. All testimonies given on this subject will be limited to the approval of the committee.

8. The Chairwoman of CUMM could hold a possible bias if she is heterosexual, and therefore, it is advised that she be a lesbian to avoid impropriety in oversight of this committee.

We love men and believe they are the bedrock of the Texas family. We are only choosing to do what's best for them and avoid a breakdown in the societal order of this state.

Chris Christie became the eighth Republican governor to back expanding Medicaid under President Barack Obama's health care reform law on Tuesday.

Christie, a potential 2016 presidential contender who is up for reelection this year, defied conservative opponents of Obamacare by embracing one of its key components when he announced his plan to the Democratic-controlled state legislature in Trenton. So far, more than a dozen Republican governors, including Scott Walker of Wisconsin and Rick Perry of Texas, have declared their opposition to the Medicaid expansion.

""After considerable discussion and research, I have decided to participate in Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. While we already have one of the most expansive and generous Medicaid programs in the nation, including the second highest eligibility rate for children, we have an opportunity to ensure that an even greater number of New Jerseyans who are at or near the poverty line will have access to critical health services beginning in January of 2014,"" Christie said.

Expanding Medicaid in New Jersey would provide new health care coverage to an estimated 291,000 people through 2022, according to an analysis released by the Urban Institute and the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation in November. New Jersey would spend an additional $1.5 billion and receive $15.4 billion from the federal government to finance the expansion during that time period, the report predicted.

The health care reform law calls for Medicaid coverage to be available to anyone who earns up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level, which is $15,282 for a single person this year. When the Supreme Court upheld Obamacare last year, it gave states the option to refuse the Medicaid expansion because the program is jointly funded by the federal and state governments.

Other Republican governors, including Florida's Rick Scott and Ohio's John Kasich, also support the Medicaid expansion. Altogether, 25 states and the District of Columbia plan to broaden the program under the health care reform law beginning next year. Most of the new enrollees in states that expand are expected to be adults without children living at home, who were not previously covered by Medicaid.

""These folks are consistently among those who need help the most -- men and women who have suffered trauma in their lives, live with mental illness, rely on New Jersey’s emergency rooms for primary health care, or those citizens who lack insurance or access to treatment in other ways,"" Christie said.

The federal government will pay the full cost of insuring newly eligible people from 2014 through 2016 under the health care reform law expansion. That share declines over several years until it reaches 90 percent in 2022 and beyond. For other people on Medicaid, such as children, pregnant women and people with disabilities, the federal government pays states an average of 57 percent of the expenses.

The New Jersey Medicaid expansion actually would save the state $227 million in fiscal year 2014, Christie said. Some governors, like Jay Nixon of Missouri (D), expect to use new federal Medicaid funding to replace spending currently conducted by other state programs. Christie also echoed Kasich and other Republicans by noting his state's residents would pay federal taxes to finance Medicaid expansions in other states and not see benefits themselves if New Jersey doesn't participate.

Christie has opposed the health care reform law and has expressed some hostility to the Medicaid expansion in the past. He likened the Medicaid provisions in the health care reform law to ""extortion"" during an appearance at the Brookings Institution in Washington in July. Prior to the Supreme Court ruling, states that defied the Medicaid expansion under Obamacare risked losing all their federal Medicaid dollars. ""I'm really glad that a majority of the Supreme Court still supports the notion, as a former prosecutor, that extortion is still illegal, even when done by the president of the United States,"" Politico reported Christie saying at the time.

Christie also previously indicated that New Jersey's Medicaid program was broad enough. ""Medicaid is pretty well expanded in our state already because of the legacy of previous Democratic governors, and so I don't think there's a lot more for us to do in New Jersey in that regard,"" Christie said on Fox News Channel in July.

New Jersey currently doesn't provide Medicaid benefits to childless adults, though it does offer less-generous coverage to poor adults with incomes below 23 percent of the federal poverty level, which is $2,643 for a single person this year. New Jersey does offer Medicaid to the parents of poor children and to pregnant women who earn up to 133 percent of poverty.

Christie's Medicaid plan could provoke ire among conservatives who remain opposed to all aspects of Obamacare. Christie also angered some conservatives during the presidential campaign last year when he appeared with Obama and praised his handling of the response to Hurricane Sandy just days before Obama defeated GOP nominee Mitt Romney. Christie hasn't been invited to next month's Conservative Political Action Conference after being a featured speaker at the event last year.

""I am no fan of the Affordable Care Act. I think it is wrong for New Jersey and for America. I fought against it and believe, in the long run, it will not achieve what it promises. However, it is now the law of the land and I will make all my judgments as governor based on what I believe is best for New Jersey,"" Christie said on Tuesday.

Christie rejected another aspect of Obamacare when he twice vetoed bills passed by the Democratic-controlled state Legislature last year that would have established a state-run health insurance exchange. The exchanges will be websites where residents can comparison shop for coverage and learn whether they qualify for Medicaid or for tax credits to pay for private health insurance options that are available to people who earn between the poverty level, $11,490 for an individual this year, and four times that amount.

Washington (CNN) – Red state-blue state governors Rick Perry and Martin O’Malley debated job creation and healthcare on Wednesday, with Perry equating adding people to Medicaid via Obamacare with “putting tens of thousands on the Titanic knowing how it’s going to turn out.”

Both men are thought to be contenders for the White House in 2016 and on CNN’s “Crossfire,” they aired out some of the key issues that are likely to define their campaigns should they run.



Perry has been noncommittal about his plans to pursue the Republican nomination for a second time after the Texas governor’s campaign imploded last year. He showed none of the hesitation of 2012 on Wednesday night however, hammering home points about Texas job creation through limited government policies.

Ex-advisers hint at future as Perry announces exit as governor

When challenged on the disproportionately large number of minimum wage jobs created in Texas along with the large number of Texans without health insurance, Perry stuck to his talking points.

“We’re about giving people freedom,” Perry said, the freedom to have a job and the freedom to choose whether or not they have health insurance.

Perry continually cited the businesses that have set up shop in Texas, including Amazon, Facebook and Toyota.

“They didn’t come there if they were worried about whether or not there was not going to be a skilled workforce, or people were going to have healthcare,” Perry said.

Perry and O’Malley clashed most sharply over jobs, in large part spurred by Perry’s media outreach aimed at poaching Maryland businesses.

In response to Texas’ business-friendly environment, O’Malley fell back on job-creation language coined by President Barack Obama.

Rather than Texas policies that seem to disproportionately create minimum wage jobs, Maryland has chosen to focus on “building an economy from the middle out,” O’Malley said, via things like improving education.

2016 watch: O'Malley New Hampshire bound

O’Malley, a Democrat, told Perry that Texas is “not an economy that is actually lifting up the middle class.”

The two came at their different positions with radically different statistics and perspectives.

O’Malley spoke of talent creation and entrepreneurship encouraged in Maryland while Perry trumpeted improving education standards and the various options Texans have for healthcare, although he didn’t elaborate.

Texas and Maryland have also taken polar opposite views on the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, Obama’s signature legislative achievement better known as Obamacare.

O’Malley has continued to hold up Maryland’s early adoption of Obamacare while Perry has refused federal money to expand Medicaid via the healthcare law.

Perry argued that expanding Medicaid and embracing Obamacare would ultimately end up costing Texas $100 billion.

Putting “tens of thousands of people on a system that is broken,” Perry said of adding them to Medicaid, is akin to “putting tens of thousands on the Titanic knowing how it’s going to turn out.”

In turn, O’Malley argued that the flexibility of the Obamacare healthcare exchanges that get underway next month, regardless of the inevitable hiccups in the system, will offer Maryland workers a competitive advantage – allowing them to move from job to job without worrying about losing their health insurance."

Washington (CNN) – Sen. Ted Cruz got a lot of pushback from Republican colleagues during a closed-door meeting questioning his relentless effort to tie government funding to derailing Obamacare.

""Cruz was completely unapologetic about the ads that he is featured in on the Senate Conservatives Fund website that attack other Republicans. He sees himself as the only truly pure Republican. His colleagues are furious. He has no successful strategy but has managed to generate grass roots support for his position,"" one senior Republican source at Wednesday's meeting told CNN Chief Political Analyst Gloria Borger.



Cruz has urged Republicans in the House to stand firm and continue pushing any plan to fund the government to proposals aimed at curtailing the Affordable Care Act.

This summer, he appeared in ads produced by the Senate Conservatives Fund urging Republicans to push Congress to defund Obamacare.

This strategy has upset Senate Republicans and some House GOP members because some privately blame the freshman Texas lawmaker for causing the shutdown and boxing House Speaker John Boehner into a corner.

Cruz's spokesman did not have a response to reports of pushback during the Wednesday meeting. Cruz told Politico the media loves to cover internal Republican disagreements and ""apparently some senators are content to fuel those stories with anonymous quotes.""

Cruz also was unapologetic talking to conservative talk radio host Laura Ingraham earlier Wednesday.

""We've had now three times, the House has endeavored to pass compromise bills that would keep the government funded, but at the same time would start to address the enormous harms that Obamacare is inflicting on the American people. And three times, Harry Reid has said 'no, absolutely not, I will not talk, I will not compromise, I will not do anything – no.' And as long as he maintains that absolutist position, both Reid and President Obama have said they won't even sit down to talk. They want a shutdown,"" he said.

At a previous meeting of Senate Republicans, Sen. Susan Collins spoke about some of the ads in Maine that said she was not conservative enough, blaming Cruz for helping to divide the party.

During the Wednesday session, many senators spoke out and aimed their comments directly at Cruz, the GOP source told Borger.

While Cruz initially drew the anger of some Republicans weeks ago when the House passed the first bill to keep the government operating only if Obamacare was defunded because Democrats controlled the Senate, he then staged a 21-hour talkathon last week trying to prevent the Obamacare provision from being removed. He lost that effort but helped cement his stature with the Republican base.

That caused some Republicans to go public with their consternation.

Asked why Boehner can't bring up for consideration any bill he wants, Rep. Devin Nunes, R-California, told CNN Wednesday night that the ""leadership made a decision to take the position that we are going to take the Ted Cruz strategy, and we are not going to fund the government until we get rid of Obamacare.""

Nunes blames Cruz for causing the GOP not to have a choice and causing a shutdown.

""John Boehner said we'll take this Ted Cruz strategy. You guys went out for two months, made these commitments. We'll take it. We'll implement it. And now, here we are, it's fully implemented. ... I think Ted Cruz is one of the best politicians that's come around in a long time. He's able to rally the base, he's got a lot of money … There's a lot of consultants making money off this and lots of TV ads going on. The problem with it is, it's one thing to be good at politics. It's another thing to be not good at strategy.""

Rep. Peter King, R-New York, has previously called Cruz ""a fraud"" for his promises of defunding Obamacare. But other Republicans are not backing away from Cruz, including Virginia gubernatorial candidate Ken Cuccinelli, who is scheduled to hold an event with the senator on Saturday.

For Democrats, there is little question of who is in fact leading the anti-Obamacare effort and are eager to highlight Cruz's efforts.

""Senator Cruz is now a joint speaker,"" Reid said Thursday on the Senate floor. ""He lectures the House on occasion as he does people over here.""

Mo Elleithee, communications director for the Democratic National Committee, said in a statement regarding Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus: ""I think he probably has Speaker Cruz Boehner's number somewhere.""

The good folks at snopes.com debunked it some time ago. I’m just going to hit the highlights here. You should check out the above link if you want the whole story.

First: There is no mention of exemptions for Islam or any other specific religion in the health care bill.

Second: There is in fact a mention of a “religious conscience objection” in the law. It states that certain religious sects may be exempt from the health care mandates if they fall into a particular category set out in Section 1402(g)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code. When you look up that section of the code, you find that the exemptions are for specific religious sects that have conscientious objections to receiving government assistance, both because they preach self-sufficiency and because their members make a moral commitment to caring for one another themselves. The code was written this way to deal with Social Security and Medicare tax issues. The reasoning, as I understand it, is that the members of these faiths are morally obligated never to participate in Social Security or Medicare, so they should be exempt from those taxes.

For the most part, these religious groups are Old Amish and Mennonite sects with a long history of self-sufficiency and caring for their own. As long as they work for one another only, and do not hire outsiders, they have been allowed not to pay Social Security taxes. The health care law obviously contemplates the same sort of exemptions for these groups. None of the sects recognized under this part of the IRS code is Muslim as far as I can tell. You can check the list for yourself on this spreadsheet (Careful—this link will download an Excel spreadsheet to your computer!), which was compiled by Factcheck.org.

In addition, the IRS has been really hard-nosed about these exemptions. When the exempted groups do hire outsiders, they have been required to pay Social Security taxes for those workers. Factcheck.org sums it up this way:



The Social Security bureaucracy has been slow to respond to our queries about which religious groups have been granted exemptions from the payroll tax. But both the federal government and the courts have been very strict on such exemptions in the past. For instance, in 1982 the Supreme Court found that a member of the Old Order Amish claiming exemption under 1402(g) was in fact subject to payroll tax for his employees. That section, the Court said, is applicable only to the self-employed. And in two cases where self-employed individuals claimed a religious opposition to Social Security but weren’t members of approved sects, they were also ordered to pay the tax.

While it is conceivable that some new religious group may try to become exempt under these sections of the tax code, an extremely high bar has been set for them. They would have to demonstrate not only a conscientious objection to receiving government aid, but also a history of, and a mechanism for, taking care of their own. Most religions, including Catholicism and Islam, would have a very, very difficult time making such a case.

So the notion that the health care law already contains lots of religious exemptions—and, in particular, that it contains exemptions for specifically Muslim groups—is simply mistaken.

But it also points up a real problem with the so-called religious-freedom objections that are being thrown around on the right. Religiously affiliated institutions want to access the government support that makes them viable (religiously affiliated colleges and hospitals, for instance, probably couldn’t exist without government subventions), but they don't want to fulfill the duties to their fellow citizens that taking the support entails. This is especially so in the case of the Roman Catholic bishops’ objections to the health care mandate, in which the only possible conflict of conscience is a Catholic’s putative reluctance to be indirectly involved with someone else’s decision to commit what the Catholic considers to be a sin.

But Catholics really don’t object very much to this kind of indirect involvement, or there would have been much more outcry before now, since a number of states already have health care mandates for birth control coverage. And they don’t seem to object to any other sort of indirect involvement in other people’s decisions to commit sins. I don't think there are too many Catholic NRA supporters who lose much sleep over the fact that their backing for plentiful and easily obtainable guns of all sorts indirectly contributes to the decision of someone else to pick up a gun and murder someone.

* * * * *

Now where did this mistaken idea come from? Like many similar beliefs that have currency inside the conservative bubble (as Bill Maher likes to call it), the Muslim heath-care exemption meme seems to have started with chain emails sent around among conservatives. These emails were being circulated during the furor following passage of the Affordable Care Act in December of 2009—like the following email from early 2010:



Subject: Dhimmitude

Word of the Day: Dhimmitude

Dhimmitude is the Muslim system of controlling non-Muslim populations conquered through jihad. Specifically, it is the TAXING of non-Muslims in exchange for tolerating their presence AND as a coercive means of converting conquered remnants to Islam.

The ObamaCare bill is the establishment of Dhimmitude and Sharia Muslim diktat in the United States. Muslims are specifically exempted from the government mandate to purchase insurance, and also from the penalty tax for being uninsured. Islam considers insurance to be “gambling,” “risk-taking,” and “usury,” and is thus banned. Muslims are specifically granted exemption based on this. How convenient. So I, Ann Barnhardt, a Christian, will have crippling IRS liens placed against all of my assets, including real estate, cattle, and even accounts receivables, and will face hard prison time because I refuse to buy insurance or pay the penalty tax. Meanwhile, Louis Farrakhan will have no such penalty and will have 100% of his health needs paid for by the de facto government insurance. Non-Muslims will be paying a tax to subsidize Muslims. Period. This is Dhimmitude. Dhimmitude serves two purposes: it enriches the Muslim masters AND serves to drive conversions to Islam. In this case, the incentive to convert to Islam will be taken up by those in the inner cities as well as the godless Generation X, Y and Z types who have no moral anchor. If you don’t believe in Christ to begin with, it is no problem whatsoever to sell Him for 30 pieces of silver. “Sure, I’ll be a Muslim if it means free health insurance and no taxes. Where do I sign, bro?” I recommend sending this post to your contacts. This is desperately important and people need to know about it—quickly.

The intellectual pedigree of this communication is quite manifest. It comes from the “Christians under attack” subgroup within the conservative bubble. (The obvious racist and Christian supremacist orientation is just icing on the cake.) This subgroup lives in fear of multiculturalism and the inevitable cosmopolitanism that is the quite natural result of instant global communication. As more and more people realize that the universal claims of the world’s various religious faiths cannot all be true, the “Christians under attack” feel increasingly more threatened. Many of their beliefs about the how the world works, and especially their religious beliefs, simply conflict with different beliefs on the same issues held by different people in different parts of the world. Everyone who is plugged into the internet knows that this is simply a fact. Young people, who are disproportionately plugged in, already accept it as a fact.

For the “Christians under attack” group, this is a frightening reality. Since Christianity’s ancient claims to some sort of dominance over temporal goods as well as spiritual goods depended on ignorance of other faiths, those claims are being eroded by the new knowledge. As the relativity of religious beliefs to time and place becomes more obvious, the “Christians under attack” see themselves as losing power. How can they maintain their superiority in a world where their religious beliefs have no privileged status?

And of course, since these people tend to conflate religion and morality, they simply jump to the conclusion that relativity of religious beliefs implies relativity of morality. This is simply not the case. Everyone knows that religion is no guarantee of morality: James Madison famously pointed out in The Federalist No. 10 that “neither moral nor religious motives can be relied on as an adequate control” for the tyranny of the majority. And some people know that you can be a person of extremely high moral standards without religion: anyone who has understood Aristotle’s Nichomachean Ethics knows that you can construct an ethics of virtue based solely on human happiness in this life. The fact that you can be moral with or without religion means that relativity among religious beliefs has nothing to do with relativity of morals. The latter is a sign of poor education and weak-mindedness. The former is just a factual consequence of history and culture.

I understand that none of these objections holds any weight inside the conservative bubble. I understand that fear is very rarely dispelled by reason. But those of us who live outside the bubble shouldn’t allow ourselves to be taken in by the fearful hysteria that reigns inside. Every “bubble fact” that goes unchallenged is a seed of corruption in the real world. And while fear generates far too many “bubble facts” to stay on top of, we should be ready to weed up any that begin to set roots outside the bubble.

So if you hear the one about Muslim exemptions to the Affordable Health Care Act, you know what to say."

SERGIO LIMAWhen funding for Dr. Pedro Hallal’s COVID-19 study was abruptly slashed, deaths from the virus had just surged to grim new peaks in Brazil.The reason? Hallal says the government simply didn’t like what his study was unveiling: that indigenous people are five times as likely to get infected with COVID-19 than other ethnic groups in Brazil. His findings came amid a surge in invasions of indigenous lands by soy farmers, cattle ranchers, and illegal miners egged on by friendly signals from Brazil’s denialist President Jair Bolsonaro.“I’m absolutely certain it was meant to shut me up,” said Hallal, an epidemiologist and professor at the Federal University of Pelotas, told The Daily Beast. “The study was showing results that they didn't want it to show.”Hallal, whose COVID research funding was cut last year, is not alone. Dozens of researchers studying the virus say they have been targeted by fans and allies of Bolsonaro, who has long styled himself as a Trump-like populist opposed to science, mainstream media, and the “corrupt” liberal elite.How Bolsonaro Seized Trump’s Crown as the World’s Worst COVID LeaderResearchers in Brazil claim they have suffered through relentless social media attacks, death threats, funding cuts, and arbitrary investigations over the past year as they seek to better understand the virus ravaging the country. They say these attacks are a thinly-veiled attempt at muzzling them and suppressing their work.Bolsonaro has downplayed the virus as a “fantasy” and “little flu,” railed against lockdowns and—until recently—rejected vaccines. “Brazilians need to be studied. They don’t catch anything. You see the guy jumping in the sewer, diving in. And nothing happens to him,” the president said of the virus last year.Even though COVID has killed 398,000 people in Brazil, the president and his allies have repeatedly questioned its toll and accused governors and mayors of inflating the number of deaths in order to weaken the president politically.“There is this conservative base that casts itself as the opposition to science,” said Pablo Ornelas Rosa, a professor at the University of Vila Velha in Espírito Santo. “If you are pro-science and pro-facts, you are labelled as a leftist, as a communist, as an enemy to the president.”“The health minister freaked out,” recalled Hallal, who was coordinating the study—Brazil’s largest epidemiological analysis of the virus and its spread across the country. The scientist maintains that at a press conference organized to unveil its latest findings, the ministry barred the release of data about the heightened risks to indigenous people. Hallal says he was never told why officials took issue with the findings.A few weeks later, the study—commissioned by a prior health minister who was fired last April after clashing with Bolsonaro—lost its federal funding. Soon, Hallal was being investigated by the federal auditing body after criticizing Bolsonaro in a livestream and his allies were being sidelined in university elections.On social media, the vicious attacks on the scientist poured in, including from Bolsonaro himself. Hallal told The Daily Beast that supporters of the president made threatening phone calls to him and even photographed him on the street with his family.“It was direct persecution, triggered by my stance on the pandemic,” he said. “Instead of correcting its errors, the government attacked those who were uncovering its mistakes.”Attacks have been particularly harsh against those questioning Bolsonaro’s stance on chloroquine, an antimalarial that he—along with Donald Trump—embraced as a “miracle cure” despite no evidence it could combat COVID-19. Bolsonaro quickly got behind the drug and ordered the army to sharply scale up national production. When the president got COVID himself, he took the drug over livestream and boasted that he was improving rapidly.Dr. Marcus Lacerda’s trouble began when he decided to investigate whether the drug really was a “miracle cure” for the novel coronavirus. In the Amazon city of Manaus, the research group he led had used chloroquine for years as part of its malaria research. As infections overwhelmed hospitals in his city last March, Lacerda decided to put his team’s know-how to work by testing the drug’s ability to fight COVID-19.But the team’s clinical study quickly found that chloroquine was not only ineffective against COVID-19, but high doses of the drug could cause severe heart problems in patients infected with the virus. The results caught global attention, spurring scathing critiques of Trump’s support of chloroquine.But, at home in Brazil, Lacerda’s team saw a different response. He says it started with a tweet by the president’s son, who accused the researchers of being a group of “leftists” who were intentionally killing people with high doses of chloroquine just to demonstrate the drug didn't work. This triggered a wave of attacks on social media by the president’s supporters.“People were saying that they knew where I lived, that I had killed people on purpose, that I would pay for this,” said Lacerda, an infectious disease specialist and a researcher at the Carlos Borborema Institute of Clinical Research in Manaus.Lacerda says he received a slew of attacks and death threats over social media. Concerned for the safety of himself and his family, he was forced to walk around with armed bodyguards for two weeks.“It was one of the worst experiences of my life,” he said. “It was this intense climate of fear.”Triggered by complaints from allies of Bolsonaro, state and federal medical bodies as well as public prosecutors opened investigations into Lacerda’s study. He says he spent the better part of last year defending his research in front of lawyers, instead of carrying out studies in a lab.The attacks on Brazilian researchers echo the United States’ own war on science, which intensified during Trump’s tenure as president. Scientists in the U.S. faced over 150 attacks during Trump’s presidency, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists.“Governments on the radical right—like those we saw in the U.S. and here in Brazil—are not prepared for science to show something that contradicts what they are doing,” Lacerda said. “When a study shows something that you don't agree with, you just take down the scientists.”The assault on science has had a profound impact in Brazil. Scientists say that the attacks they have suffered have derailed research or discouraged some to tackle studies linked to the virus. Others have left the country, pushed out by threats or disillusionment.“The sciences are being persecuted right now,” said Rosa, who has studied the behavior of Bolsonaro supporters on WhatsApp and Telegram. “We’re living in a really dark moment. And this has a direct impact on the research and the quality of scientific output.”Meanwhile, Brazil is still grappling with one of the world’s worst outbreaks, with a death toll second only to the United States. In recent weeks, infections have exploded, fuelled by highly-infectious new variants and weak lockdown restrictions. With doses running out, vaccinations have brought little relief.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Three years after President Obama’s landmark law was passed, the state unveiled the first details Thursday on what many Californians can expect to pay for coverage from 13 health plans offering policies in the state’s exchange, in which as many as 5 million people will shop for coverage next year.

Developments in California are being watched carefully around the country as an important indicator of whether the healthcare law can deliver on its promise to expand health coverage at an affordable price. Many Republicans, insurance executives and other critics of the law have been warning that consumers are in for a shock next year when insurance companies raise rates to comply with the law’s many new requirements.

Supporters were upbeat after an initial look at the proposed premiums, while critics remain unimpressed.

“These rates are way below the worst-case gloom-and-doom scenarios we have heard,” said Peter Lee, executive director of Covered California, the state agency implementing the healthcare law. “But let’s be clear, some consumers will have prices that go up. There may be some sticker shock.”

The new government-run market is aimed at many of the state’s uninsured and at Californians who already purchase their own health insurance. The majority of Californians receive health coverage from their employers and are not among those targeted for enrollment.

The health plans selected by the state will sell uniform benefits, each offering four broad categories of coverage called Platinum, Gold, Silver and Bronze.

Platinum policies will offer the most comprehensive benefits and carry the highest prices, followed by Gold, Silver and Bronze. The Bronze package will have the lowest premiums, but people would be on the hook for a greater share of their medical bills. The rates revealed Thursday still must be reviewed by state regulators.

Within each of those four benefit categories, plans will have the same co-pays, deductibles and limits on out-of-pocket medical expenses.

As a result, consumers will be able to compare insurance prices in their regions more easily, once these rates are finalized by July.

Consumers shopping in the exchange will have three to six health insurance plans to choose from in each of the state’s 19 regions.

In the south Los Angeles County region, for instance, rates for a 40-year-old purchasing a Silver plan ranged from $242 a month through Health Net Inc. to $325 a month through Kaiser Permanente. Overall, Los Angeles County had the lowest premiums statewide for the Silver plans.

The average premium for individual plans sold through EHealthInsurance in California last year was $177 a month. Covered California said the average premium for the three lowest Silver plans statewide was $321 a month, albeit for more comprehensive benefits.

Overall, state officials said they can’t estimate yet how much rates will rise on average. Blue Shield of California, one of the winning bidders in the exchange, said its existing individual policyholders would pay about 13% more, on average, for coverage in the state marketplace.

These rates “came in below what people legitimately expected them to be,” said Paul Markovich, Blue Shield’s chief executive.

Comparing the proposed rates for next year with current premiums is difficult, officials and experts agree, because the healthcare law mandates next year’s plans to offer richer benefits and to limit consumers’ out-of-pocket expenses.

Democrats in Washington were quick to hold up California’s announcement as a sign that the federal healthcare law is working and bringing a healthy dose of competition to a dysfunctional insurance market in which millions of people have been denied coverage because of their medical history or subjected to punishing rate hikes year after year.

Most Republican-led states have resisted the healthcare law and declined to set up their own state exchanges. Instead, they have opted for the federal government to step in.

Starting in January, most Americans must have health insurance or pay a penalty under the federal law.

Some industry experts said California’s outlook on rates remains far too optimistic in light of the hefty increases some consumers will see.

“California has no right to declare victory on rates,” said Robert Laszewski, a healthcare consultant in Virginia. He said the sample premiums released by Covered California were about 50% higher than rates for the most commonly sold health plans in the individual market primarily because of increased benefit requirements. “If rates come in higher, it speaks to the sustainability of the Affordable Care Act.”

Federal premium subsidies will ease the bite on many people’s wallets. In California, individuals earning less than about $16,000 a year will qualify for an expansion of Medi-Cal, the state’s Medicaid program for the poor. Above that threshold, individuals making less than $46,000 a year and families earning below $94,000 annually will qualify for federal subsidies.

One of the bigger risks is that high premiums turn off healthier, middle-income households that aren’t eligible for that federal assistance and have to pay the full premium. Rates could skyrocket if the exchange fails to enroll enough of those people to offset the higher costs of sicker, poorer policyholders.

Katharine King, 59 and a self-employed concert and event producer in Santa Monica, already pays $497 a month for her individual health insurance from Anthem Blue Cross. She wouldn’t qualify for federal premium help based on her income. Using the state’s online calculator, which doesn’t yet reflect the final rates, her premiums could shoot up to nearly $600 a month next year.

“The Affordable Care Act is still not all that affordable unless you qualify for a federal subsidy, which I will not,” King said. “It will likely be another case of the middle class kind of getting screwed.”

Alfredo Ceron, 44, an uninsured painter in Los Angeles, has less to worry about with these rates. He said he earns about $100 a day when he has work, which means the federal government would pick up most of the tab for him and his two adult children who still live at home.

“I’d like to get my family covered,” he said while waiting in line at a recent downtown festival to get more information about the new insurance options.

The 13 health plans selected by the state include all four of California’s largest insurance companies. They are Kaiser Permanente, Anthem Blue Cross, Blue Shield and Health Net.

The other nine health plans selected were smaller regional players and insurers that have traditionally served lower-income and Medi-Cal patients. They are Alameda Alliance for Health, Chinese Community Health Plan, Contra Costa Health Services, L.A. Care Health Plan, Molina Healthcare, Sharp Health Plan, Valley Health Plan, Ventura County Health Care Plan and Western Health Advantage.

In Los Angeles County, which was divided into two regions, six companies will compete for policyholders. They are Anthem Blue Cross, Blue Shield, Health Net, Kaiser Permanente, L.A. Care and Molina.

California Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones said he was troubled by the lack of choice in some markets. “There are only three statewide health insurers selling in Covered California,” Jones said, “which means less statewide competition than we’d hoped to see in the new marketplace.”

For the Wall Street Journal and Forbes' Avik Roy, these and other HHS contingency measures designed to help consumers manage the transition to new policies during the rocky rollout of the health insurance exchanges mean ""backdating Obamacare,"" a ""government takeover"" which treats carriers like ""battered wives.""

But the frothing at the mouth conservatives would be advised to swallow their bile. After all, when the disastrous launch of the new Medicare Part D prescription drug program left over six million seniors without their drug coverage in January 2006, President Bush ordered America's insurance companies to pay for their prescriptions while the fiasco was straightened out. And as it turned, dozens of states--most of them led by Democratic governors--had to step in cover billions more in drug costs until the Bush HHS could fix the system that left patients, pharmacists and physicians alike frustrated and confused.

As the New York Times reported on January 16, 2006 (""President Tells Insurers to Aid Ailing Medicare Drug Plan""):



With tens of thousands of people unable to get medicines promised by Medicare, the Bush administration has told insurers that they must provide a 30-day supply of any drug that a beneficiary was previously taking, and it said that poor people must not be charged more than $5 for a covered drug. The actions came after several states declared public health emergencies, and many states announced that they would step in to pay for prescriptions that should have been covered by the federal Medicare program. Republicans have joined Democrats in asserting that the federal government botched the beginning of the prescription drug program, which started on Jan. 1. People who had signed up for coverage found that they were not on the government's list of subscribers. Insurers said they had no way to identify poor people entitled to extra help with their drug costs. Pharmacists spent hours on the telephone trying to reach insurance companies that administer the drug benefit under contract to Medicare. Many of the problems involve low-income people entitled to both Medicare and Medicaid. In a directive sent to all Medicare drug plans over the weekend, the Bush administration said they ""must take immediate steps"" to ensure that low-income beneficiaries were not charged more than $2 for a generic drug and $5 for a brand-name drug. In addition, it said insurers must cover a 30-day emergency supply of drugs that beneficiaries were taking prior to the start of the new program. In an interview yesterday, Dr. Mark B. McClellan, administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said that ""several hundred thousand beneficiaries who switched plans"" in December may have had difficulty filling prescriptions in the last two weeks.

The Bush administration's desperation and insistence, as Roy would put it, that ""insurers to cover up for its mistakes"" was understandable. As the Washington Post reported on January 14, 2006 , ""Two weeks into the new Medicare prescription drug program, many of the nation's sickest and poorest elderly and disabled people are being turned away or overcharged at pharmacies, prompting more than a dozen states to declare health emergencies and pay for their life-saving medicines."" Roughly 6.4 million seniors who just days earlier had gotten their prescriptions for free faced the prospect of going without because of untrained pharmacists and computer glitches. Two days later, the New York Times reported, many states (most of them led by Democrats) came to their rescue:"

(Associated Press)

At an immigration reform rally in San Francisco Monday, President Obama confronted a heckler who demanded that he stop all deportations. (Associated Press)

The young man’s plea was direct: Stop the deportations, he urged President Obama, of the 11.5 million illegal immigrants in the United States.

“You have the power to stop deportations for all,” the man said as he interrupted Obama’s immigration policy speech here Monday afternoon.

“Actually,” the president replied, “I don’t. And that’s why we’re here.”

He added, “The easy way out is to try to yell and pretend like I can do something by violating our laws. And what I’m proposing is the harder path, which is to use our democratic processes to achieve the same goal that you want to achieve — but it won’t be as easy as just shouting. It requires us lobbying and getting it done.”

Hecklers have become a staple at Obama’s public events, but it’s rare that one underscores the message that the president is trying to deliver — in this instance, that the American people support a path to citizenship for those here illegally but that Congress is blocking comprehensive immigration reform.

Obama came to San Francisco’s Chinatown on Monday to argue that overhauling the immigration system would bring an economic windfall for the Bay Area and other communities nationwide. In remarks at the Betty Ann Ong Chinese Recreation Center, Obama said 35 percent of business owners in San Francisco are immigrants, many of them Asian Americans.

“You don’t have to be an economist to figure out that workers will be more productive if they’ve got their families here with them — they’re not worried about deportation, they’re not living halfway around the world,” Obama said. “This isn’t just the right thing to do. It’s the smart thing to do.”

Obama urged House Republicans to take up the Senate’s compromise immigration bill, saying that progress on this front is being held up by a faction of the Republican Party. He also reiterated his support for a piecemeal approach in the House if that is what it would take to pass a package of reforms.

But Obama also said, “Just because something is smart, fair, good for the economy and supported by business, labor, law enforcement and faith leaders, Democratic and Republican governors, including the governor of this state — just because all that is in place doesn’t mean we’ll actually get it done because this is Washington, after all, that we’re talking about, and everything’s looked at through a political prism.”

Brendan Buck, a spokesman for House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio), said, “The speaker is sincere in wanting to get something done, and we’re pleased the president said he can accept the step-by-step approach we’re taking in the House.”

In addition to immigration, Obama touched briefly on the troubled rollout of the federal government’s health insurance exchange. California has signed up tens of thousands of people through its own exchange.

“Even as we’re getting this darn Web site up to speed — and it’s getting better — states like California are proving the law works,” Obama said, referring to the federal insurance Web site."

The leader of the conservative Republican opposition to President Obama’s healthcare overhaul, which triggered the government shutdown, freshman Texas Sen. Ted Cruz remained defiant. Cruz said he would keep focusing on Obamacare in the coming months, despite calls from the White House and members of both parties of Congress to take up issues such as immigration reform.

On two talk shows, Cruz did not rule out another push for a shutdown in January, when continued funding for the government would once again require congressional authorization. “I would do anything and I will continue to do anything I can to stop the train wreck that is Obamacare,” Cruz said on ABC’s “This Week.” “What I intend to do is continue standing with the American people to work to stop Obamacare, because it isn’t working, it’s costing people’s jobs, and it’s taking away their healthcare.”

Cruz interpreted the bottom-of-the-barrel poll ratings for Congress that came out last week as a sign that Americans wanted Congress to work harder to dismantle Obamacare, rather than as a repudiation of its priorities. He sharply criticized his fellow Senate Republicans for agreeing to end the shutdown.

“I think the House Republicans marched out on principle to say we’re listening to the people who are hurting because of “Obamacare.” And I wish that Senate Republicans had come in like the cavalry to support them,” Cruz said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “Instead … they made a decision not just to not support the House Republicans, but to come in like an air force and dive-bomb them.”

Other, more senior Republican senators agreed with the need to halt healthcare reform. But they took issue with shutting down the government again in 2014 as a negotiating ploy. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said the GOP would do “everything possible” to repeal the Affordable Care Act but said “everything” did not include another shutdown.

“A number of us were saying back in July that this strategy could not and would not work, and of course, it didn’t. So there’ll not be another government shutdown, you can count on that,” McConnell said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.”

McConnell declined to criticize Cruz, whose great popularity with the GOP’s conservative base has amplified his clout, despite his recent arrival on the national stage. But other GOP senators such as Lindsey Graham of South Carolina were more pointed about the impact of Cruz’s approach.

“I think the tactical choice that he embraced hurt our party,” Graham said on “Face the Nation.”

“After this debacle called ‘the shutdown,’ ... our brand name’s at the lowest ever. Obamacare actually got a bump in polling, and we got in the way of a disastrous rollout.”

Graham added: “The shutdown should be in our rearview mirror as Republicans [say], ‘Don’t do this again, Ted.’ ”"

“Will the senator from Texas for the record tell us now—and those who watched this debate—whether he is protected and his family’s protected?” Durbin asked Wednesday morning, repeating a question he'd been trying to get Cruz to answer. “I’m happy to tell you now I am eligible for it and I am not currently covered under it,” Cruz responded, diverting the conversation to an uninsured diabetic woman that Durbin had mentioned earlier.

According to a 2009 New York Times report, top executive officers and managing directors at the bank participate in a health care program that costs Goldman more than $40,000 in premiums for each particpant’s family annually.

Sen. Ted Cruz had a short exchange with Sen. Dick Durbin at the tail end of his blabathon Wednesday.Then the conversation moved on without Cruz explaining where he got his coverage. Huffington Post's Ryan Grim found out. He's covered on his wife's plan. His wife is a top Wall Street executive, a regional head of a Goldman Sachs division.Yep, a regular populist, Cruz is, telling all the people that freedom means not having health insurance from his perch ensconced in a gold-plated safety net.

Tom Corbett of Pennsylvania listens to discussions about state and federal tax reform, during the committees meeting at the NGA 2013 Winter Meeting in Washington on Saturday, Feb. 23, 2013. (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)

Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett (R) announced last month that he would reject Medicaid expansion -- a key provision of President Barack Obama's health care reform law that would have made health care available to many more of the state's poorest residents.

A new study has found that Corbett's decision might end up costing the state hundreds of millions of dollars.

Expanding Medicaid in Pennsylvania would have increased the annual amount of money the state receives from the federal government by around $2 billion, adding about $200 million in state revenue every year, according to a new study by the RAND Corporation, the nation's largest independent health policy research program.

The study's findings contradict remarks made by the governor during his budget address last month when he said that “without serious reforms, [Medicaid expansion] would be financially unsustainable for the taxpayers.""

Had Pennsylvania opted into Medicaid expansion, the state would have received around $6 billion in federal funding for health care programs in 2014, according to the study. That's $2 billion more than it will receive without expanding Medicaid. The increase in funding would have added 35,000 jobs and provided a $3 billion boost in economic activity, according to the study.

“This is money that is coming into the state that wouldn’t otherwise,” RAND mathematician and lead study author Carter Price told The Huffington Post. “There are certainly substantive benefits, in that you have more people covered, more revenue coming in the state and more jobs.”

But Price cautions that the economic benefits of Medicaid expansion under Obamacare will eventually come with a cost. Starting in 2017, the federal government will begin to pay less of the state costs of the expansion, causing Pennsylvania's revenue increases to decline over time."

USA TODAY

A sign of our divided times: Even a first lady project encouraging people to drink more water is drawing criticism.

Michelle Obama traveled Thursday to Watertown, Wis. — naturally — to promote a new program by her Partnership for a Healthier America to encourage people to drink more water.

""Drink just one more glass of water a day and you can make a real difference for your health, your energy, and the way you feel,"" Obama said. ""So Drink Up and see for yourself.""

Yet Politico reports several public health experts as saying that the White House is overselling the benefits of water.

""There really isn't data to support this,"" said Stanley Goldfarb, a professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. ""I think, unfortunately, frankly, they're not basing this on really hard science. It's not a very scientific approach they've taken. ... To make it a major public health effort, I think I would say it's bizarre.""

Goldfarb also told Politico: ""The idea drinking water increases energy, the word I've used to describe it is: quixotic,"" he said. ""We're designed to drink when we're thirsty. ... There's no need to have more than that.""

The White House and its experts say too many Americans aren't drinking nearly enough water.

Ursula E. Bauer, director of the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said drinking water has many positive benefits.

""Drinking water can help people maintain a healthy weight and may be an important strategy for preventing obesity,"" Bauer said. ""Even mild levels of dehydration may result in decreased concentration, alertness, and short-term memory among children and adults as well as diminished athletic performance.""

In announcing Michelle Obama's ""Drink Up"" program, the White House said:

""To remind families of the importance of drinking water, supporters of PHA's effort will carry the Drink Up logo on nearly 300 million packs of bottled water; more than half a billion bottles of water; 200,000 packages of reusable bottles; and more than 10,000 reusable bottles in the next year.

""Additionally, more than 10,000 outdoor public taps are expected to carry the brand over the next few years. Cities will also be utilizing the logo to encourage people to drink more tap water.

""And hosts on a dozen TV shows are participating in an around-the-clock, cross-network, bilingual day of drinking water and encouraging their audience to Drink Up."""

Baucus warns of 'train wreck' for Obama health law,"A senior Democratic senator who helped write President Obama's health care law stunned administration officials Wednesday, saying openly he thinks it's headed for a ""train wreck.""

""I just see a huge train wreck coming down,"" Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus, D-Mont., told Obama's health care chief during a routine budget hearing that suddenly turned tense.

Baucus is the first top Democrat to publicly voice fears about the rollout of the new health care law, designed to bring coverage to some 30 million uninsured Americans through a mix of government programs and tax credits for private insurance that start next year.

The six-term Democrat is also expected to face a tough re-election in 2014. Baucus is still trying to recover from approval ratings that nosedived amid displeasure with the health care law in his home state.

Normally low-key and supportive, Baucus challenged Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius at Wednesday's hearing.

He said he's ""very concerned"" that new health insurance marketplaces for consumers and small businesses will not open on time in every state, and that if they do, they might just flop because residents don't have the information they need to make choices.

""The administration's public information campaign on the benefits of the Affordable Care Act deserves a failing grade,"" he told Sebelius. ""You need to fix this.""

Responding to Baucus, Sebelius pointedly noted that Republicans in Congress last year blocked funding for carrying out the health care law, and she had to resort to raiding other departmental funds that were legally available to her.

The administration is asking for $1.5 billion in next year's budget, and Republicans don't seem willing to grant that either.

""I don't know what he's looking at,"" Sebelius told reporters following her out of the room after Baucus adjourned the hearing. ""But we are on track to fully implement marketplaces in Jan. 2014, and to be open for open enrollment.""

That open-enrollment launch is only months away, Oct. 1. It's when millions of middle-class consumers who don't get coverage through their jobs will be able to start shopping for a private plan in the new marketplaces, or exchanges. They'll also be able to find out if they qualify for tax credits that will lower their premiums. At the same time, low-income people will be steered to government programs, mainly an expanded version of Medicaid.

But half the states, most of them Republican-led, have refused to cooperate in setting up the infrastructure of Obama's law. Others, like Montana, are politically divided. The overhaul law provided that the federal government would step in and run the new markets if a state failed to do so. Envisioned as a fallback, federal control now looks like it will be the norm in about half the country, straining the resources of the department Sebelius leads."

SERGIO LIMAWhen funding for Dr. Pedro Hallal’s COVID-19 study was abruptly slashed, deaths from the virus had just surged to grim new peaks in Brazil.The reason? Hallal says the government simply didn’t like what his study was unveiling: that indigenous people are five times as likely to get infected with COVID-19 than other ethnic groups in Brazil. His findings came amid a surge in invasions of indigenous lands by soy farmers, cattle ranchers, and illegal miners egged on by friendly signals from Brazil’s denialist President Jair Bolsonaro.“I’m absolutely certain it was meant to shut me up,” said Hallal, an epidemiologist and professor at the Federal University of Pelotas, told The Daily Beast. “The study was showing results that they didn't want it to show.”Hallal, whose COVID research funding was cut last year, is not alone. Dozens of researchers studying the virus say they have been targeted by fans and allies of Bolsonaro, who has long styled himself as a Trump-like populist opposed to science, mainstream media, and the “corrupt” liberal elite.How Bolsonaro Seized Trump’s Crown as the World’s Worst COVID LeaderResearchers in Brazil claim they have suffered through relentless social media attacks, death threats, funding cuts, and arbitrary investigations over the past year as they seek to better understand the virus ravaging the country. They say these attacks are a thinly-veiled attempt at muzzling them and suppressing their work.Bolsonaro has downplayed the virus as a “fantasy” and “little flu,” railed against lockdowns and—until recently—rejected vaccines. “Brazilians need to be studied. They don’t catch anything. You see the guy jumping in the sewer, diving in. And nothing happens to him,” the president said of the virus last year.Even though COVID has killed 398,000 people in Brazil, the president and his allies have repeatedly questioned its toll and accused governors and mayors of inflating the number of deaths in order to weaken the president politically.“There is this conservative base that casts itself as the opposition to science,” said Pablo Ornelas Rosa, a professor at the University of Vila Velha in Espírito Santo. “If you are pro-science and pro-facts, you are labelled as a leftist, as a communist, as an enemy to the president.”“The health minister freaked out,” recalled Hallal, who was coordinating the study—Brazil’s largest epidemiological analysis of the virus and its spread across the country. The scientist maintains that at a press conference organized to unveil its latest findings, the ministry barred the release of data about the heightened risks to indigenous people. Hallal says he was never told why officials took issue with the findings.A few weeks later, the study—commissioned by a prior health minister who was fired last April after clashing with Bolsonaro—lost its federal funding. Soon, Hallal was being investigated by the federal auditing body after criticizing Bolsonaro in a livestream and his allies were being sidelined in university elections.On social media, the vicious attacks on the scientist poured in, including from Bolsonaro himself. Hallal told The Daily Beast that supporters of the president made threatening phone calls to him and even photographed him on the street with his family.“It was direct persecution, triggered by my stance on the pandemic,” he said. “Instead of correcting its errors, the government attacked those who were uncovering its mistakes.”Attacks have been particularly harsh against those questioning Bolsonaro’s stance on chloroquine, an antimalarial that he—along with Donald Trump—embraced as a “miracle cure” despite no evidence it could combat COVID-19. Bolsonaro quickly got behind the drug and ordered the army to sharply scale up national production. When the president got COVID himself, he took the drug over livestream and boasted that he was improving rapidly.Dr. Marcus Lacerda’s trouble began when he decided to investigate whether the drug really was a “miracle cure” for the novel coronavirus. In the Amazon city of Manaus, the research group he led had used chloroquine for years as part of its malaria research. As infections overwhelmed hospitals in his city last March, Lacerda decided to put his team’s know-how to work by testing the drug’s ability to fight COVID-19.But the team’s clinical study quickly found that chloroquine was not only ineffective against COVID-19, but high doses of the drug could cause severe heart problems in patients infected with the virus. The results caught global attention, spurring scathing critiques of Trump’s support of chloroquine.But, at home in Brazil, Lacerda’s team saw a different response. He says it started with a tweet by the president’s son, who accused the researchers of being a group of “leftists” who were intentionally killing people with high doses of chloroquine just to demonstrate the drug didn't work. This triggered a wave of attacks on social media by the president’s supporters.“People were saying that they knew where I lived, that I had killed people on purpose, that I would pay for this,” said Lacerda, an infectious disease specialist and a researcher at the Carlos Borborema Institute of Clinical Research in Manaus.Lacerda says he received a slew of attacks and death threats over social media. Concerned for the safety of himself and his family, he was forced to walk around with armed bodyguards for two weeks.“It was one of the worst experiences of my life,” he said. “It was this intense climate of fear.”Triggered by complaints from allies of Bolsonaro, state and federal medical bodies as well as public prosecutors opened investigations into Lacerda’s study. He says he spent the better part of last year defending his research in front of lawyers, instead of carrying out studies in a lab.The attacks on Brazilian researchers echo the United States’ own war on science, which intensified during Trump’s tenure as president. Scientists in the U.S. faced over 150 attacks during Trump’s presidency, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists.“Governments on the radical right—like those we saw in the U.S. and here in Brazil—are not prepared for science to show something that contradicts what they are doing,” Lacerda said. “When a study shows something that you don't agree with, you just take down the scientists.”The assault on science has had a profound impact in Brazil. Scientists say that the attacks they have suffered have derailed research or discouraged some to tackle studies linked to the virus. Others have left the country, pushed out by threats or disillusionment.“The sciences are being persecuted right now,” said Rosa, who has studied the behavior of Bolsonaro supporters on WhatsApp and Telegram. “We’re living in a really dark moment. And this has a direct impact on the research and the quality of scientific output.”Meanwhile, Brazil is still grappling with one of the world’s worst outbreaks, with a death toll second only to the United States. In recent weeks, infections have exploded, fuelled by highly-infectious new variants and weak lockdown restrictions. With doses running out, vaccinations have brought little relief.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Obama gave a speech in the White House briefing room as a small but growing number of restive congressional Democrats join the Republican chorus that legislation is needed to preserve the policies being eliminated. The House of Representatives is scheduled to vote Friday on a bill sponsored by Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton (R-Mich.) that would permit health insurers to extend these health plans. In the Senate, Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) and others are backing similar bills to address the canceled plans.

""Insurers can extend current plans that otherwise would be canceled into 2014 and Americans whose plans have been canceled can choose to re-enroll in the same kind of plan,"" Obama said. ""This fix won't solve every problem for every person, but it's going to help a lot of people. Doing more would require work with Congress.""

Obama's health care reform law has been under siege since its faulty rollout on Oct. 1. HealthCare.gov, the online portal for health insurance shopping in more than 30 states, hasn't reliably worked during the first month and early enrollment figures came in well below expectations. In the meantime, between hundreds of thousands and millions of consumers have been notified that their insurance policies don't meet the health care law's standards and will be discontinued next year, in violation of Obama's vow that his law would allow people to keep their current coverage.

""That's on me,"" Obama said. ""We fumbled the rollout on this health care law.""

Obama vowed to press ahead with implementing his law, and reiterated that the health insurance market needs reforming to guarantee stable health insurance coverage. ""I make no apologies for us taking this on,"" he said. ""Because somebody sooner or later had to do it.""

""It took a hundred years for us to even get to the point where we could start talking about and implementing a law to make sure everybody's got health insurance, and my pledge to the American people is, is that we're going to solve the problems that are there, we're going to get it right, and the Affordable Care Act is going to work for the American people,"" Obama said.

Under the policy Obama announced Thursday, health insurance companies will be permitted to extend current policies, even though they don't comply with Affordable Care Act standards for benefits and financial protections, for their customers into next year. Insurers won't be allowed to enroll new customers into these extended policies, Obama said.

Consumers should still examine the health insurance available on the exchanges to determine whether the new plans are better or less expensive than their current plans, or whether they qualify for financial assistance, Obama said. ""If you received one of these letters I'd encourage you to take a look at the marketplace,"" he said.

Insurers will be required to disclose to customers that these new plans won't include the new consumer protections in the law and explain that alternatives are available on Obamacare's health insurance exchanges, and that tax credits to cut the cost of private insurance are only available on the exchanges. Insurance companies will also have to tell consumers that they may qualify for Medicaid, the federal-state health program for low-income people. State health insurance regulators are being asked to permit the administration's new policy.

Health insurance companies ultimately will be responsible for deciding whether to carry out Obama's new policy, which puts the onus on them. ""The Affordable Care Act is not going to be the reason why insurers have to cancel your plan,"" Obama said.

The White House acknowledged this new policy could have a limited reach. ""It may not be taken by all insurance companies and by all state insurance commissioners,"" a senior White House official said during a conference call with reporters prior to Obama's remarks.

This proposed solution would be problematic for health insurance companies that have already eliminated the current plans from their books of business and would have to recreate them. In addition, enabling a portion of the health insurance market to stay outside of the health insurance exchanges could cause future premiums to rise for those using the new marketplaces. If healthier people with lower medical expenses avoid the exchanges and purchase policies with less generous benefits, the exchanges would attract a relatively older and sicker population, the health insurance industry has warned.

“Changing the rules after health plans have already met the requirements of the law could destabilize the market and result in higher premiums for consumers,"" Karen Ignagni, CEO of the trade group America's Health Insurance Plans, said in a statement.

State regulators were also cool to Obama's proposal. ""This decision continues different rules for different policies and threatens to undermine the new market, and may lead to higher premiums and market disruptions in 2014 and beyond,"" Jim Donelon, Louisiana's insurance commissioner and president of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, said in a press release. ""It is unclear how, as a practical matter, the changes proposed today by the president can be put into effect.""

Health insurance plans are being canceled next year because the Affordable Care Act includes a slew of benefit mandates and consumer protections at the heart of Obama's reform platform.

Plans sold on the exchanges can't exclude people with pre-existing conditions, charge women higher rates than men, must cover at least 60 percent of a person's annual medical expenses, and can't impose annual or lifetime caps on coverage. In addition, exchange plans must cover a basic set of benefits that includes hospitalizations, prescription drugs and maternity care. Health insurance extended via Obama's new policy would not include those guarantees.

""The old individual market was not working well. And it's important that we don't pretend that somehow that's a place worth going back to,"" Obama said. ""Too often it works fine as long as you stay healthy. It doesn't work well when you're sick.""

Obama rejected legislative proposals akin to Upton's bill. ""I will not accept proposals that are just another brazen attempt to undermine or repeal the overall law and drag us back into a broken system.""

White House officials visited Capitol Hill Thursday to meet with House and Senate Democrats to assure them that Obama is addressing issues with canceled policies and the broken website, and to urge them not to back legislative changes to the president's signature domestic policy achievement.

Obama again addressed his oft-stated pledge that individuals would be able to keep their current insurance plans when his law was implemented, noting that the Affordable Care Act leaves in place the employer-sponsored health plans and government programs that cover more than 90 percent of insured Americans. But he acknowledged underestimating the law's effects on the remaining consumers.

""We chose a path that was the least disruptive to try to finally make sure that health care is treated in this country like it is in every other advanced country, that it's not some privilege that just a certain portion of people can have,"" he said. ""There is no doubt that the way I put that forward unequivocally ended up not being accurate.""

Only about 27,000 people chose a new health insurance plan using HealthCare.gov between Oct. 1 and Nov. 2, according to a report issued by the Department of Health and Human Services Wednesday. About 79,000 people did so via the health insurance exchanges being operated by 15 states and the District of Columbia. Almost 400,000 individuals have been deemed newly eligible for Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program.

""In just one month, despite all the problems that we've seen with the website, more than 500,000 Americans could know the security of health care by Jan. 1, many of them for the first time in their lives,"" Obama said. ""Is that as high a number as we'd like? Absolutely not. But it does mean that people want affordable health care.""

The White House maintains that HealthCare.gov will be functioning better by the end of this month and that enrollment via the exchanges will have substantially increased by the end of the sign-up period on March 31. The Congressional Budget Office has projected that 7 million people would use the exchanges to buy health insurance for 2014.

""We should have done a better job getting that right on day one, not on day 28 or on day 40,"" Obama said.

Obama restated his administration's aim to improve the website by the end of November, but stopped short of guaranteeing it would work perfectly. ""The website will work much better on Nov. 30, Dec. 1, than it worked certainly on Oct. 1. That's a pretty low bar,"" Obama said. ""It is not possible for me to guarantee that a hundred percent of the people a hundred percent of the time going on this website will have a perfectly seamless, smooth experience.""

House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) expressed skepticism that the Affordable Care Act permits Obama to carry out the policy he unveiled Thursday. ""I'm highly skeptical they can do this administratively. I just don't see within the law their ability to do it,"" Boehner said during a press briefing.

A senior White House official said the Department of Health and Human Services has the authority to allow health insurance plan extensions via the law's ""grandfathering"" provisions, which already enabled some plans to be continued if they hadn't been substantially changed since 2010, and via administrative discretion.

Here’s $25k.,"Sean Hannity isn’t generally a fan of handouts, but he’s made an exception for the Obamacare call-center worker who was fired from her job after talking to him.

Hannity says he’ll give $25,000 to Earline Davis, a mother of two, who was sacked after Hannity asked her questions about the Affordable Care Act on his radio program earlier this week.

“I don’t want you to have to pay a price just for taking our phone call,” Hannity told Davis during a follow-up interview. “I’m very sorry you had to go through that.” Davis agreed to speak with Hannity over the radio and said she was never told that speaking to the media wasn’t allowed.

Hannity figured that Davis’ hourly wage added up to a salary of about $25,000 for a year’s work, which he offered to pay. That wasn’t all: “I want to try and get you a new job,” he told her.

The gifts come with plenty of political baggage, of course. A champion of right-wing causes, Hannity has been an outspoken critic of President Obama and his healthcare initiatives. He wasn’t ringing up the call center to find out details of his health coverage; he was attempting to prove that the insurance program is dysfunctional and should be abandoned.

Hannity probably won’t miss the money. In 2008, he signed a radio deal that was worth an estimated $100 million over five years.

That’s quite a bit more than Davis makes, although Hannity described her estimated $13-an-hour wage as “pretty decent.”

What do you think of Hannity and his gifts to the Obamacare worker?

USA TODAY

An aging nation that's living longer but with growing rates of obesity, diabetes and other chronic diseases points to an emerging health care crisis, says a report out Tuesday that analyzes seniors' health status state-by-state.

Just two years ago, the first Baby Boomers turned 65, setting into motion a ""tremendous demographic shift in the U.S. population,"" said physician Rhonda Randall, a senior adviser to the not-for-profit United Health Foundation, which released America's Health Rankings Senior Report Tuesday.

The report focuses on 34 measures of senior health, including physical inactivity, obesity, self-reported health status, poverty, drug coverage, hospital re-admission rates and flu vaccinations. The data analyzed is from more than a dozen government agencies and private research groups.

As generations move into retirement, they become greater consumers of health care, Randall said. But those turning 65 today ""are more likely to live longer than their parents and grandparents, and much more likely to live sicker for a longer period of time,"" she said.

Among signs of impending challenges the report cites:

• 1 in 8 Americans (13% or 40.3 million) are 65 or older, and that is projected to grow to 1 in 5 (19.3%, or 72.1) in 2030, the year all members of the Baby Boomer generation will have turned 65, according to Census data. By 2050, seniors will make up 25% of the population. Those 85 and older are projected to increase from 5.8 million in 2010 to 8.7 million in 2030.

• Nearly 8 in 10 seniors are living with at least one chronic health condition; 50% have two or more, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates. About 25% of older Americans are obese; 20% have been diagnosed with diabetes; more than 70% have heart disease; nearly 60% have arthritis, a leading cause of disability.

• Adults 65 and older spend nearly twice as much as those 45 to 64 on health care each year; they spend three to five times more than all adults younger than 65, according to CDC.

If not addressed, the increased burden of chronic disease will not only have severe economic consequences but affect older adults' overall well-being, Randall said. ""This is a really important time in our nation's history for us to take a look at this demographic change and the health and behavior outcomes for this population. If we don't measure it, we won't know what to do about it.""

The report offers ""an important set of messages ... for personal focus, family and community focus, and a heads-up to the providers, and a real heads-up to policy makers,"" said Jennie Chin Hansen, CEO of the American Geriatrics Society and author of one of several commentaries in the report.

Some of the trends are ""very cautionary,"" Hansen added. They highlight ""that we really do have to be thoughtful, strategic and intentional if we are going to insure that people's health and well-being is going to be made better. There's stuff we know, but now there's stuff we have to do. ""

Overall, Minnesota tops the list in senior health, followed by Vermont (2), New Hampshire (3), Massachusetts (4) and Iowa (5).

At the bottom: Mississippi (50), Oklahoma (49), Louisiana (48), West Virginia (47) and Arkansas (46).

Minnesota's top ranking reflects a combination of factors, including a large number of seniors who report being in very good or excellent health, high rates of creditable drug coverage, relatively high availability of home health care workers, as well as a low rate of seniors at risk of going hungry and a low rate of hospitalization for hip fractures, according to the study.

But it notes challenges for Minnesota, as well, including a high percentage of chronic drinking, a low percentage of senior residents with a dedicated health care provider, and low per-person expenditures by the state to assist older adults in poverty.

In bottom-ranked Mississippi, a high percentage of seniors live in poverty and are at risk of going hungry; there is a high rate of premature death; a low percentage of seniors report very good or excellent health and a low rate report annual dental visits. But Mississippi scored well for a low prevalence of chronic drinking and a high rate of flu vaccination.

The senior population in Mississippi is predicted to grow 46% between 2015 and 2030. In Minnesota, the population is expected to grow 54%. Arizona tops that category with an expected increase of 101%, followed by Nevada (89%), Florida (88%), Alaska (70%) and Texas (67%).

Among other trends noted in the report:

• Alaska (21%) has the lowest percentage of seniors with multiple chronic health conditions, followed by Wyoming (22%) and Montana (23%). The highest percentages are in Florida (44%), New Jersey (43%) and Delaware (40%).

• Nationally, 30% of seniors in fair or better health report doing no physical activity or exercise other than their regular job in the last 30 days. Inactivity levels range from a low of 20.5% of senior who report being inactive in Colorado and 21.3% in California to highs of 41.2% in West Virginia and 41.3% in Tennessee.

• Obesity rates among those ages 50 to 64 increased 8% from 1995 to 2010, suggesting that the next generation of seniors will experience higher rates of obesity compared with current seniors. Overall, 25% of adults ages 65 and older are considered obese. The prevalence varies from a low of 17% in Hawaii and 18% in Nevada to highs of 29% in Alaska and 30% in Michigan.

• An average of 9% of adults ages 65 and older live at or below recognized poverty thresholds, which is also associated with higher rates of chronic diseases and shorter life expectancy. Rates range from a low of 5% in Alaska and 6% in Utah to 12% in New Mexico and 14% in Mississippi.

Ted Cruz (R-TX) (L) and Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) wait to speak at the 'Exempt America from Obamacare' rally, on Capitol Hill, September 10, 2013 in Washington, DC.

WASHINGTON -- While Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) was bemoaning the ""defeatist attitude"" of his fellow Republican senators, his close ally Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) acknowledged Obamacare won't be defunded in a bill to keep the federal government open.

The Kentucky Republican stood with Cruz in his all-night speech against Obamacare, but later on Wednesday Paul added his name to those who say the writing is on the wall.

""I'm not saying we would get everything we want. We don't want to fund [Obamacare] at all, but I'm ready to admit we may not get that,"" Paul told reporters shortly after he voted to begin debate on the government funding bill passed by House Republicans last week.

That bill would keep the federal government open beyond Sept. 30, but permanently strips the Affordable Care Act of its funding, as Cruz and his allies have demanded. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) is expected to amend the measure to restore funding for the Affordable Care Act in the course of a subsequent procedural vote that requires a simple majority.

Republicans, with 46 votes, could stop the bill during the procedural motion; but many of them oppose shutting down the federal government, especially since it wouldn't lead to the end of Obamacare, and the GOP is likely to bear the brunt of the blame.

To Cruz, who spoke Wednesday on Rush Limbaugh's radio show, that stance shows that Republicans are ""beaten down.""

""The single biggest surprise about arriving to the Senate is the defeatist attitude here,"" Cruz said.

While Paul joined Cruz in his 21-hour talkathon -- which outlasted Paul's 13-hour talking filibuster earlier this year -- the senator from the Bluegrass State conceded Wednesday afternoon that the Senate should no longer delay sending a revised continuing resolution to the House GOP leaders, who will only have one day to pass the measure in order to avert a government shutdown.

""We've spent a lot of time on this, and it's time to vote,"" Paul said. ""I think the sooner we're done with this, the better chance we have of not having the government shut down.""

""I think it's presumptuous of me to tell the House what to do, but I think the goal of everybody should be to try to do something right and at the same time not shut down the government,"" Paul added.

The Kentucky senator argued that Reid and President Barack Obama are pushing the country to the brink of a shutdown by refusing to compromise on the health care law, and called for a ""a discussion over how we could make the bill less bad.""

""I think if you analyze this situation, this is us saying the bill has many problems. Even one of the authors of the bill says there's problems with the bill,"" Paul said. ""But if they're unwilling to revisit the bill and compromise on anything ... maybe some of you in the media ought to ask ... why are they shutting down the government in order to get everything they want?""

Paul was among nearly a dozen Republican signatories on a letter distributed by Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) in July that called on the conference to oppose any continuing resolution that included funding for Obamacare. In recent weeks, Cruz and Lee have insisted that any vote to advance the House-passed bill is a vote for Obamacare, because it would enable Reid to keep the health care law funded.

Paul was hesitant to share that opinion.

""I don't really want to characterize what I think the vote means,"" he said. ""I think that the Republican caucus has been united in its opposition to Obamacare.""

""All I know is at this time, my conclusion is -- and apparently a lot of people's conclusion is -- we ought to get to the votes,"" Paul added later, as reporters continued to press him on Cruz's strategy. ""If we're going to send something to the House, I think get something over there sooner rather than later. That's always been my opinion.""

He commended Cruz's speech, noting opposition to Obamacare has been a motivating issue for tea party and grassroots activists in the Republican Party.

""I don't think you're finding many people out in the countryside or across the country saying, 'Oh, it's a bad idea to stand up to Obamacare,'"" Paul said. ""What makes it difficult is people really probably don't want to shut down the government, and I don't either ... so it is a difficult situation."""

DR. SANJAY GUPTA (9/22/2013): Some Republicans in Congress are threatening to shut down the government unless the president agrees to strip out funding for Obamacare.

How do you justify a government shutdown?



SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TX (9/23/2013): I believe nothing is hurting the American people more, nothing is hurting the economy more, nothing is damaging jobs more, than Obamacare.

Still, if Ted Cruz's problem with Obamacare is that it's hurting jobs, I'm curious, what would a government shutdown do?



CHRISTINE ROMANS (9/23/2013): Based on the last shutdown in 1995 ... Hundreds of thousands of federal workers sent home without pay. Many, if not most, federal offices and programs would be closed, shut down. During the last shutdown, 200,000 passport applications went unprocessed. Some services to veterans were suspended.

The Washington Monument's fluffer will be furloughed.

(audience laughter)

Why is that... we couldn't have pointed that in the other direction? (more audience laughter) For God's sakes. All right, move on, move on. But I guess....

There's a joke associated with that, but I didn't get to it because I moved on. (Jon facepalms to audience cheering and applause) All right, forget it. Let's go.

But I guess if you really sincerely believe this is a terrible program that Americans will hate, I have to respect your principled stand, Ted Cruz.



SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TX (8/1/2013): The Obama administration's plan is very simple. It is to get as many Americans as possible addicted to the subsidies, addicted to the sugar, because they know the simple fact that in modern times, no major entitlement has ever gone into effect and then been undone.

You know how America is with entitlements, it's like crack to us. You give us one small taste of Social Security, and suddenly we're all sucking the glass tit of not having our old people freeze to death and live off cat food. (wild audience cheering and applause)

So that's it. I don't understand any of this. You're protecting America from this terrible Obamacare plan that once we get a taste of, we'll never want to be without. You only win if the program fails. Obamacare is your Springtime for Hitler. It turns out the Republicans aren't afraid we're all going to get finger-banged by a puppet Uncle Sam. They're afraid we gonna like it! (audience laughter and applause) We'll be right back."

(CNN) —

They are the numbers we’ve all been waiting for and House Republicans have unsuccessfully tried to get out of the Obama administration.

This week, the Department of Health and Human Services will reveal how many people purchased policies on the federal Obamacare exchange website.

Technical failures have plagued HealthCare.gov since its October 1 launch, although officials say it’s slowly getting better.

White House spokesman Jay Carney says enrollment numbers “will be lower than we hoped and we anticipated.”

Democrats losing patience with Obamacare

Just how low and what effect all of those online roadblocks had on enrollment remain to be seen.

But what will the numbers mean about the health of Obamacare?

Q: How many people need to enroll?

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that 24 million people will purchase insurance through an exchange by 2023, but just seven million will enroll during the initial sign-up window ending March 31.

CBO’s estimate includes customers on both state-based and federally run insurance exchanges, but not individuals who enroll in Medicaid.

If that number is spread evenly over the course of the open enrollment period, 1.16 million people would need to purchase insurance each month in order for the administration to be on pace to reach the seven million figure in six months.

But officials both in and out of government are quick to point out that enrollment is unlikely to occur at an even pace.

Pro-Obamacare group raises $27 million for outreach

To make that case, President Barack Obama recently traveled to Massachusetts where then-Gov. Mitt Romney enacted similar health care reforms in 2006.

“Enrollment was extremely slow, within a month only about a hundred people had signed up,” the President told a crowd in Boston in late October, recounting data from the state’s first open-enrollment period. “But then, 2,000 had signed up, and then a few more thousand after that. And by the end of the year, 36,000 people had signed up.”

On CNN the day after the President’s trip, MIT economist Jon Gruber, a former health care adviser to both Romney and Obama, argued that the first month’s numbers aren’t that useful in estimating the pace of enrollment.

“The key deadline here is March 31, that’s when people have to have insurance to avoid the individual mandate,” Gruber said of the deadline for avoiding a financial penalty for not having any health coverage. “That’s still months away.”

A consumer behavior expert said the slow pace of enrollment early could be attributed to buying habits.

Michael McCall, consumer psychology professor at Ithaca College, compared it to paying rent or a mortgage when it’s due, rather than before a bill is received. Until payment is submitted, the door remains open to back out or make changes.

“Once I pay, I’ve kind of made that commitment,” McCall added.

Arguably more important than the overall enrollment number is the diversity of the new customer pool.

The administration is working to ensure that 40% of those on the new exchanges are relatively healthy between 18 and 35.

“Part of the challenge is to make sure that the exchanges are able to attract a broad cross section of people, sick people and healthier young people so that the coverage is affordable,” said Drew Altman, president and CEO of the Kaiser Family Foundation.

An unbalanced insurance pool could cause insurers to increase monthly premiums or pull out of the exchanges altogether in future years.

Clinton: Obama should honor commitments on keeping health plans

What about Medicaid enrollees?

Customers whose income falls below a certain threshold are automatically referred to their state’s Medicaid program. The Affordable Care Act offers subsidies to states to increase Medicaid qualification to 138% of the federal poverty level, and 25 states and the District of Columbia have taken up the federal offer so far.

If your state has opted to expand Medicaid, you’ll likely be referred to your state’s welfare agency if you make less than $15,800 and are seeking coverage as an individual, or $32,500 if you’re seeking it for a family of four.

The CBO estimates that nine million people will enroll in Medicaid and its partner initiative for children, the Children’s Health Insurance Program, by 2014. According to this estimate, that number will increase to 13 million by 2023.

Media report: Fewer than 50,000 signed up for Obamacare

What if my state didn’t expand Medicaid?

The authors of the ACA intended Medicaid expansion to be mandatory, but a Supreme Court decision in 2010 ruled the federal government couldn’t require expansion of a state-run program. This decision led 25 states to opt out.

If you make less than the federal poverty level, you will be referred to your state Medicaid agency to see if you qualify for benefits under the current law, regardless of whether your state has expanded Medicaid or not.

According to a study by the Kaiser Foundation, only four states that didn’t expand Medicaid offer benefits to parents with incomes up to the federal poverty level, and only Wisconsin offers benefits to adults without children.

If your state chose not to expand its Medicaid program, you can still purchase insurance on the exchange, but you might not qualify for a premium subsidy.

Federal subsidies kick in for those with income above 100% of the federal poverty level.

Due to the Supreme Court decision and the structure of the law, a large group of low-income Americans won’t qualify for Medicaid in their state, but will earn less than the federal poverty level, meaning they won’t qualify for any federal subsidies. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, roughly five million people will fall into this Medicaid coverage gap.

What does “enroll” mean, anyway?

Regardless of whether you’re signing up on HealthCare.gov or one of the state-run exchanges, there are several steps in the enrollment process.

You must first create an account and enter in some personal information, including your Social Security number and an estimate of your annual income.

This information is then verified through the federal data hub with various government agencies, such as the Social Security Administration and the Internal Revenue Service.

Then you’ll either be presented with the plans available in your coverage area and an estimate for what those plans will cost after any federal subsidy is factored in, or you’ll be told you qualify for Medicaid and referred to your state’s Medicaid agency.

If you’re eligible to purchase a plan on the exchange, you can compare the plans available to find one that best fits your budget and coverage needs.

Many insurance companies and state-based exchanges don’t classify customers as officially enrolled until they’ve paid their first premium. Others will count people as enrolled once they’ve selected a plan.

A spokeswoman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services confirmed Tuesday that the numbers the government plans to announce will reveal how many consumers have completed an application and selected a plan, not necessarily how many have paid.

Consumers have until December 15 to pay if they want coverage beginning on January 1, or until March 31 if they simply want to avoid paying the penalty for not having insurance.

According to CNN’s tally, at least 54,700 people have paid for insurance on the state-based exchanges, but many more have made it partially through the process, completing an application and selecting a plan.

Various news outlets have reported that fewer than 50,000 people have signed up and paid for new private insurance plans through the federal marketplace, HealthCare.gov. Neither the Department of Health and Human Services nor officials at CMS would confirm those numbers."
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/18/ted-cruz-obamacare-house-republicans_n_3950901.html,2013-09-18 00:00:00,"['Politics Reporter', 'The Huffington Post', 'Senior Politics Reporter']",Ted Cruz Infuriates House GOP By Conceding Defeat On Obamacare Repeal,"WASHINGTON -- House Republicans are fuming at Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) for conceding that the party's efforts to repeal Obamacare aren't going anywhere in the Senate -- and leaving the House to keep fighting over it anyway.

Cruz, a tea party favorite, is one of the most vocal proponents of defunding the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama's health care reform law. He's spent months championing the cause. But on Wednesday, as House Republican leaders unveiled their latest plan for sinking Obamacare -- tying a measure to defund the law to a must-pass resolution that keeps the government running -- Cruz thanked House Republicans for their fight, and said they're on their own.

""[Senate Majority Leader] Harry Reid will no doubt try to strip the defund language from the continuing resolution, and right now he likely has the votes to do so,"" Cruz said in a statement. ""At that point, House Republicans must stand firm, hold their ground, and continue to listen to the American people.""

Aides to top Republicans in the House, where GOP leadership has already been struggling to keep the party together on the measure, were beside themselves. And once granted anonymity, they didn't mince their words.

""We haven't even taken up the bill and Ted Cruz is admitting defeat?"" fumed one senior GOP aide. ""Some people came here to govern and make things better for their constituents. Ted Cruz came here to throw bombs and fundraise off of attacks on fellow Republicans. He's a joke, plain and simple.""

Another aide said Cruz's comment ""exposes how [Senate conservatives] have deliberately misled their constituents and the grassroots for eight weeks. This isn't leadership, it's hypocrisy.""

A request for comment from Cruz's office regarding the dust-up caused by the senator's remarks was not returned.

House Republican leaders have been planning to pass their continuing resolution (with its provision to defund Obamacare) and hand it off to Cruz and others in the Senate, namely Sens. Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Marco Rubio (Fla.), to stage a dramatic fight over the issue, even if it can't pass.

The three senators issued a joint statement on Wednesday praising House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) for his plan to bring the bill to the floor later this week, but none vowed to use every tool possible to carry on the fight in the Senate, such as the use of a filibuster.

House Republicans, who have spent the last few weeks being berated by Cruz on the need to keep a government shutdown on the table in the Obamacare fight, were not impressed.

""House agrees to send #CR to Senate that defunds Obamacare. @SenTedCruz & @SenMikeLee refuse to fight. Wave white flag and surrender,"" tweeted Rep. Sean Duffy (R-Wis.).

""So far Sen Rs are good at getting Facebook likes, and townhalls, not much else. Do something...,"" tweeted Rep. Tim Griffin (R-Ark.).

Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.) also took to Twitter to vent. ""House Republicans are turning words into action to defund #Obamacare. Ball will be in the Senate’s court,"" he wrote.

To be sure, Cruz is correct that the Democratic-led Senate doesn't have the votes to repeal Obamacare, and of course the president would never sign off on such an effort. But conservatives keep pushing votes on the issue because it's popular with their base. Cruz's statement on Wednesday was simply a tactical error: He admitted what his colleagues won't.

Not all Senate Republicans signed up for a fight over Obamacare tied to a government shutdown. Several have gone on record to oppose or criticize the strategy of pushing to defund the law in exchange for keeping the government open. Even in the House, some rank-and-file Republicans like Rep. Tom Cole (Okla.) have been vocal critics of that move.

But House Republican leaders were counting on Cruz to lead the fight in the Senate this time -- not to concede the game before it even began. Cruz's comments simply put the onus back on House Republicans to take the lead on -- and pay the political price for -- a strategy that remains unlikely to work.

Asked to respond to Cruz's statement, Boehner spokesman Michael Steel simply said, ""We trust Republicans in the Senate will put up a fight worthy of the challenge that Obamacare poses."""

SERGIO LIMAWhen funding for Dr. Pedro Hallal’s COVID-19 study was abruptly slashed, deaths from the virus had just surged to grim new peaks in Brazil.The reason? Hallal says the government simply didn’t like what his study was unveiling: that indigenous people are five times as likely to get infected with COVID-19 than other ethnic groups in Brazil. His findings came amid a surge in invasions of indigenous lands by soy farmers, cattle ranchers, and illegal miners egged on by friendly signals from Brazil’s denialist President Jair Bolsonaro.“I’m absolutely certain it was meant to shut me up,” said Hallal, an epidemiologist and professor at the Federal University of Pelotas, told The Daily Beast. “The study was showing results that they didn't want it to show.”Hallal, whose COVID research funding was cut last year, is not alone. Dozens of researchers studying the virus say they have been targeted by fans and allies of Bolsonaro, who has long styled himself as a Trump-like populist opposed to science, mainstream media, and the “corrupt” liberal elite.How Bolsonaro Seized Trump’s Crown as the World’s Worst COVID LeaderResearchers in Brazil claim they have suffered through relentless social media attacks, death threats, funding cuts, and arbitrary investigations over the past year as they seek to better understand the virus ravaging the country. They say these attacks are a thinly-veiled attempt at muzzling them and suppressing their work.Bolsonaro has downplayed the virus as a “fantasy” and “little flu,” railed against lockdowns and—until recently—rejected vaccines. “Brazilians need to be studied. They don’t catch anything. You see the guy jumping in the sewer, diving in. And nothing happens to him,” the president said of the virus last year.Even though COVID has killed 398,000 people in Brazil, the president and his allies have repeatedly questioned its toll and accused governors and mayors of inflating the number of deaths in order to weaken the president politically.“There is this conservative base that casts itself as the opposition to science,” said Pablo Ornelas Rosa, a professor at the University of Vila Velha in Espírito Santo. “If you are pro-science and pro-facts, you are labelled as a leftist, as a communist, as an enemy to the president.”“The health minister freaked out,” recalled Hallal, who was coordinating the study—Brazil’s largest epidemiological analysis of the virus and its spread across the country. The scientist maintains that at a press conference organized to unveil its latest findings, the ministry barred the release of data about the heightened risks to indigenous people. Hallal says he was never told why officials took issue with the findings.A few weeks later, the study—commissioned by a prior health minister who was fired last April after clashing with Bolsonaro—lost its federal funding. Soon, Hallal was being investigated by the federal auditing body after criticizing Bolsonaro in a livestream and his allies were being sidelined in university elections.On social media, the vicious attacks on the scientist poured in, including from Bolsonaro himself. Hallal told The Daily Beast that supporters of the president made threatening phone calls to him and even photographed him on the street with his family.“It was direct persecution, triggered by my stance on the pandemic,” he said. “Instead of correcting its errors, the government attacked those who were uncovering its mistakes.”Attacks have been particularly harsh against those questioning Bolsonaro’s stance on chloroquine, an antimalarial that he—along with Donald Trump—embraced as a “miracle cure” despite no evidence it could combat COVID-19. Bolsonaro quickly got behind the drug and ordered the army to sharply scale up national production. When the president got COVID himself, he took the drug over livestream and boasted that he was improving rapidly.Dr. Marcus Lacerda’s trouble began when he decided to investigate whether the drug really was a “miracle cure” for the novel coronavirus. In the Amazon city of Manaus, the research group he led had used chloroquine for years as part of its malaria research. As infections overwhelmed hospitals in his city last March, Lacerda decided to put his team’s know-how to work by testing the drug’s ability to fight COVID-19.But the team’s clinical study quickly found that chloroquine was not only ineffective against COVID-19, but high doses of the drug could cause severe heart problems in patients infected with the virus. The results caught global attention, spurring scathing critiques of Trump’s support of chloroquine.But, at home in Brazil, Lacerda’s team saw a different response. He says it started with a tweet by the president’s son, who accused the researchers of being a group of “leftists” who were intentionally killing people with high doses of chloroquine just to demonstrate the drug didn't work. This triggered a wave of attacks on social media by the president’s supporters.“People were saying that they knew where I lived, that I had killed people on purpose, that I would pay for this,” said Lacerda, an infectious disease specialist and a researcher at the Carlos Borborema Institute of Clinical Research in Manaus.Lacerda says he received a slew of attacks and death threats over social media. Concerned for the safety of himself and his family, he was forced to walk around with armed bodyguards for two weeks.“It was one of the worst experiences of my life,” he said. “It was this intense climate of fear.”Triggered by complaints from allies of Bolsonaro, state and federal medical bodies as well as public prosecutors opened investigations into Lacerda’s study. He says he spent the better part of last year defending his research in front of lawyers, instead of carrying out studies in a lab.The attacks on Brazilian researchers echo the United States’ own war on science, which intensified during Trump’s tenure as president. Scientists in the U.S. faced over 150 attacks during Trump’s presidency, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists.“Governments on the radical right—like those we saw in the U.S. and here in Brazil—are not prepared for science to show something that contradicts what they are doing,” Lacerda said. “When a study shows something that you don't agree with, you just take down the scientists.”The assault on science has had a profound impact in Brazil. Scientists say that the attacks they have suffered have derailed research or discouraged some to tackle studies linked to the virus. Others have left the country, pushed out by threats or disillusionment.“The sciences are being persecuted right now,” said Rosa, who has studied the behavior of Bolsonaro supporters on WhatsApp and Telegram. “We’re living in a really dark moment. And this has a direct impact on the research and the quality of scientific output.”Meanwhile, Brazil is still grappling with one of the world’s worst outbreaks, with a death toll second only to the United States. In recent weeks, infections have exploded, fuelled by highly-infectious new variants and weak lockdown restrictions. With doses running out, vaccinations have brought little relief.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

http://inplainsight.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/03/28/17459470-has-disability-become-a-de-facto-welfare-program,2013-03-28 00:00:00,"['Barbara Raab', 'Senior Producer', 'Nbc News']",Has disability become a 'de facto welfare program'?,"When President Clinton signed ""welfare reform"" into law in 1996, he promised to end welfare as we know it. Now, some new reporting suggests we've created a new kind of welfare -- only most Americans aren't aware of it.

The number of people who depend on checks from Social Security's disability programs has soared in recent years, according to NPR's series ""Unfit for Work: the Startling Rise of Disability in America."" The reports, which began over the weekend and continue this week, raise the question: How disabled are the recipients, really? As you might imagine, they have touched a nerve.

A quick primer: the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program provides monthly cash assistance to people who are poor and disabled, including families with disabled children. The basic monthly SSI cash benefit is a set amount -- currently $710 for an individual and $1,066 for a couple. The Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) program also provides monthly cash assistance, to disabled people who have worked in jobs covered by Social Security. People who leave the workforce and go on disability also qualify for Medicare.

After six months of investigation, NPR reporter Chana Joffee-Walt concluded that Social Security's disability programs have become ""a de facto welfare program for people without a lot of education or job skills."" In the past three decades, she reports, the number of Americans who are on disability has skyrocketed:

Every month, 14 million people now get a disability check from the government.

The federal government spends more money each year on cash payments for disabled former workers than it spends on food stamps and welfare combined. [...]

[And] story of these programs -- who goes on them, and why, and what happens after that -- is, to a large extent, the story of the U.S. economy. It's the story not only of an aging workforce, but also of a hidden, increasingly expensive safety net.

Joffee-Walt's report takes listeners to Hale County, Ala., where one in four working-age adults is on disability, a local doctor is the go-to-guy for people in pain, and on ""the day government checks come in every month, banks stay open late, Main Street fills up with cars, and anybody looking to unload an old TV or armchair has a yard sale"" because people are relatively flush with cash.

She takes us inside ""the disability industrial complex,"" including one of the private call centers that states pay to scrutinize their welfare rolls, contact as many people as possible who might qualify for federal disability payments, and move them off the state's rolls and into the federal disability system.

The PCG [Public Consulting Group] agents help the potentially disabled fill out the Social Security disability application over the phone. And by help, I mean the agents actually do the filling out. When the potentially disabled don't have the right medical documentation to prove a disability, the agents at PCG help them get it. They call doctors' offices; they get records faxed. If the right medical records do not exist, PCG sets up doctors' appointments and calls applicants the day before to remind them of those appointments.

Joffee-Walt also reports on the 1.3 million kids on SSI, and says that some parents in Hale County told her they want kids who can ""pull a check"" so the family gets extra income. She suggests that some families who are surviving on that check may be holding their kids back from overcoming disabilities because they don't want to lose the money.

Critics call the report riddled with factual errors, devoid of context and ""ill-informed"". NPR's This American Life says it stands by its story.

The essence of the backlash is this: While critics admit the NPR report raises worthwhile questions, they say it does so in a sensational manner, traffics in inaccuracies and myths about Social Security's disability programs, and fails to tell the story about the millions of people these disability programs help. Here's how one critical analysis puts it:

The piece ignored that the recent rise in disability benefits is tied to the recession and higher rates of poverty, that qualifying for benefits is difficult, that SSI encourages employment, and that the current program has significantly reduced poverty among children with disabilities.

Listen to the report, read the criticisms, tell us your thoughts and personal experiences with the Social Security disability programs."

By Caroline Humer

NEW YORK, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Americans hitting roadblocks on the new U.S. government-run healthcare website have been contacting insurers directly and enrolling in plans away from the federal marketplace, representing a lost opportunity for President Barack Obama's landmark reform.

Since its launch on Oct. 1, technical problems have stalled Healthcare.gov, the website meant to help millions of uninsured Americans sign up for coverage as part of the biggest U.S. social program since Medicare plans for the elderly launched in the 1960s.

Nearly a dozen insurance companies offering plans on the exchange who were interviewed by Reuters say they have received at most a trickle of enrollments through the federal marketplace serving 36 states, some of them with errors that require the insurers to separately verify information about applicants.

At the same time, consumer inquiries at insurance company call centers and websites are up, in some case even double the amount of normal traffic. When they hear from potential customers who appear to qualify for government subsidized plans, they take phone numbers, create shopping baskets for the plans they like and send them to Healthcare.gov to verify eligibility.

But if the shoppers do not qualify for a subsidy, insurers say they sell them a plan directly. More often than not, those plans are individual policies that are not available on the government-run exchange.

PHONES RINGING 'OFF THE HOOK'

Health First Health Plans in Florida, one of nine insurers selling individual plans in the state through Healthcare.gov, has sold only a handful of exchange-based plans through the government marketplace.

But its phones have been ringing ""off the hook"" since Oct. 1, said Jason Alford, director of individual and marketplace sales. Many of the sales are for plans that extend coverage from 2013 into 2014 and that do not include many of the government program's most significant benefit requirements.

""We have begun taking a number of off-exchange applications,"" Alford said.

A chain of five Blue Cross Blue Shield insurance plans, including BCBS of Texas and BCBS of Oklahoma, said it is also sending buyers who qualify for subsidies to the exchange, while those who do not qualify for subsidies have been buying off exchange plans more often.

""I'm very hopeful that individuals will come back and purchase the product,"" said Kurt Kossen, vice president of retail at parent company Health Care Service Corp, referring to customers who get information about a plan but do not buy it on the spot.

The move off exchanges is another way in which the Healthcare.gov problems may jeopardize the administration's efforts to sign up as many as 7 million Americans for coverage on the exchanges in their first year, including an estimated 2.7 million young and healthy members needed to make the system work financially.

The administration and the contractors it has hired say they are working around the clock to fix the problems. The government said on Thursday that about 700,000 applications have been submitted so far for coverage through Healthcare.gov and 14 insurance exchanges run by states.

The loss of potential customers could become more critical if the federal exchange is not fixed in time for an expected influx of enrollments by Dec. 15, the last day to sign up and have benefits available on Jan. 1.

Dan Mendelson, Chief Executive Officer at Avalere Health, which has been tracking the exchanges closely, said although he expects the Healthcare.gov problems to be solved, ""There is a void right now and the void is being filled in many cases by insurers engaging directly with patients.""

He said that ""ultimately there will be a modest uptick in the off-exchange products as a result of this.""

WHITE HOUSE PROMISES FIX

White House officials on Wednesday met with chief executives of 12 leading insurance companies, including Aetna Inc, Humana Inc and WellPoint Inc. The administration promised to fix problems with enrollment data sent to the health plans and address issues that have prevented insurers from directly enrolling consumers who are eligible for subsidies.

For some small insurers selling only on the exchange, the technology issues have affected all of their business. Community First Health Plans in San Antonio, Texas said that it was still experiencing technical problems and that the volume of sales was small. Community Health Choice in Houston, Texas said sales from the federal exchange had been slow.

""I see that every day the system is getting a little bit easier,"" said Daisy Morales, vice president of marketing and outreach.

Some insurers are selling 2013 plans that extend into 2014 and do not have all the benefits required by the 2010 Affordable Care Act, commonly called ""Obamacare,"" making them less costly.

As a result, a shift to off-exchange products could signal that more healthy consumers will not be part of the Obamacare exchanges.

In the first year of the exchanges, insurers are reimbursed by the Obamacare risk adjustment program if they enroll very sick people. The more people in the pool, the lower the risk, and in the health insurance market, lower risk has meant more competition and lower premium prices.

""I can't give you a magic number, but insurers need a big enough pool of risk,"" said Jay Angoff, a former official at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services who now works as a lawyer at Mehri & Skalet in Washington DC.

Jefferies & Co analyst David Windley said that a weaker enrollment in Obamacare exchanges, with a final tally of a few million consumers, could mean the risk pool has a higher concentration of sick consumers.

It would mean ""that the healthy ones tried and gave up (on enrollment) and the sick ones were the persistent ones that actually got through the process,"" Windley said.

In 2014, risk adjustment payments would help cover any hit that insurers take because of the sicker population. After that, it could mean higher premiums and therefore more government spending per person on subsidies.

WellPoint Chief Financial Officer Wayne DeVeydt said in an interview that the company, which has the largest presence on exchanges among health insurers, is selling both exchange-based products and off-exchange products from its websites. It sends people eligible for subsidies to Healthcare.gov.

""It messes the timing up a little, just because those off exchange can get in a little bit sooner,"" DeVeydt said. ""It doesn't change the outlook. None of these policies start until Jan. 1 anyway.""

At the same time, WellPoint on Wednesday told investors it would not yet give a forecast for 2014 financial results due to uncertainty over how the Obamacare exchanges will work next year."

To offer the same opportunities to residents in the thirty states that did not create an exchange, however, there will also be an exchange offered by the federal government. The marketing effort for the federal exchange, however, will be woefully underfunded as an intentional product of Republican intransigence. Meanwhile, the state plans are being sold and marketed under names specific to each. Plans offered under the California exchange are being sold through an entity that will be known as Covered California, while Kentuckians will shop for plans from Kynect.

The early years of these exchanges are the most crucial, as Joan McCarter summarized when discussing the irony of Kentuckians signing up for Kynect without realizing that it is a part of the dreaded ""Obamacare"" system:



That's absolutely why Republicans are frantic to try to find a way to stop Obamacare from starting. As the message about its benefits get out, as people sign up and start receiving those benefits, they're going to forget all about being scared of it and they're going to like it. But it's not a slam-dunk, and the public education effort is key because Republican lies have taken hold with plenty of people. Erin Hoven, an outreach worker with Kentucky Voices for Health, and her efforts to do outreach and education on Obamacare faces those lies—repeated regularly by both of the state's Republican senators, Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul—at every turn.

In short, the state-based insurance exchanges will be branded at purely state programs, and the federal exchanges will likely have much slower adoption rates because they are not being marketed at all. The message about the benefits will get out, especially in the states that have set up exchanges and received more generous federal funds to market them. People will benefit, even those who were vociferous opponents of the Affordable Care Act to begin with. But when the messages about those benefits start spreading, will the beneficiaries realized that it is the Affordable Care Act that provides them, or will the branding of the plans make it such that people may subscribe to plans created by the law without realizing they have done so?

Meanwhile, the example of Idaho shows that even people who have experienced the abject failure of the free-market, anti-government methodology they love to espouse will not change their ideological stripes, despite the evidence staring them in the face:



On election night, Bill McCarrel Jr. watched teary-eyed residents crowd into his historic bar, The Gathering Place, after President Obama won a second term. His customers worried aloud about losing access to their guns and having to accept the federal health law that many revile as socialized medicine. Like most people in this fiercely Republican state, McCarrel opposes Obamacare — even though he's uninsured and can't find affordable coverage as a result of his artificial hip and knees. But the former junior high principal is looking forward to shopping in the law's online insurance marketplace, also called an exchange, starting in October to see if he can get a plan he could afford.

It is foreseeable that the Affordable Care Act will be a great success and do wonders to help people get insurance who would have stood no chance of doing so without it, yet the people it helps will not realize that it is the federal government that has helped them, and will experience no change in their perception of the role of government, or realize the failure of conservative free-market fundamentalism. The ultimate irony is what the promoters of Kynect have experienced : the more that people know that these plans they like are actually ""Obamacare,"" the less likely the law is to succeed.

Sometimes, helping people is a thankless job."

SERGIO LIMAWhen funding for Dr. Pedro Hallal’s COVID-19 study was abruptly slashed, deaths from the virus had just surged to grim new peaks in Brazil.The reason? Hallal says the government simply didn’t like what his study was unveiling: that indigenous people are five times as likely to get infected with COVID-19 than other ethnic groups in Brazil. His findings came amid a surge in invasions of indigenous lands by soy farmers, cattle ranchers, and illegal miners egged on by friendly signals from Brazil’s denialist President Jair Bolsonaro.“I’m absolutely certain it was meant to shut me up,” said Hallal, an epidemiologist and professor at the Federal University of Pelotas, told The Daily Beast. “The study was showing results that they didn't want it to show.”Hallal, whose COVID research funding was cut last year, is not alone. Dozens of researchers studying the virus say they have been targeted by fans and allies of Bolsonaro, who has long styled himself as a Trump-like populist opposed to science, mainstream media, and the “corrupt” liberal elite.How Bolsonaro Seized Trump’s Crown as the World’s Worst COVID LeaderResearchers in Brazil claim they have suffered through relentless social media attacks, death threats, funding cuts, and arbitrary investigations over the past year as they seek to better understand the virus ravaging the country. They say these attacks are a thinly-veiled attempt at muzzling them and suppressing their work.Bolsonaro has downplayed the virus as a “fantasy” and “little flu,” railed against lockdowns and—until recently—rejected vaccines. “Brazilians need to be studied. They don’t catch anything. You see the guy jumping in the sewer, diving in. And nothing happens to him,” the president said of the virus last year.Even though COVID has killed 398,000 people in Brazil, the president and his allies have repeatedly questioned its toll and accused governors and mayors of inflating the number of deaths in order to weaken the president politically.“There is this conservative base that casts itself as the opposition to science,” said Pablo Ornelas Rosa, a professor at the University of Vila Velha in Espírito Santo. “If you are pro-science and pro-facts, you are labelled as a leftist, as a communist, as an enemy to the president.”“The health minister freaked out,” recalled Hallal, who was coordinating the study—Brazil’s largest epidemiological analysis of the virus and its spread across the country. The scientist maintains that at a press conference organized to unveil its latest findings, the ministry barred the release of data about the heightened risks to indigenous people. Hallal says he was never told why officials took issue with the findings.A few weeks later, the study—commissioned by a prior health minister who was fired last April after clashing with Bolsonaro—lost its federal funding. Soon, Hallal was being investigated by the federal auditing body after criticizing Bolsonaro in a livestream and his allies were being sidelined in university elections.On social media, the vicious attacks on the scientist poured in, including from Bolsonaro himself. Hallal told The Daily Beast that supporters of the president made threatening phone calls to him and even photographed him on the street with his family.“It was direct persecution, triggered by my stance on the pandemic,” he said. “Instead of correcting its errors, the government attacked those who were uncovering its mistakes.”Attacks have been particularly harsh against those questioning Bolsonaro’s stance on chloroquine, an antimalarial that he—along with Donald Trump—embraced as a “miracle cure” despite no evidence it could combat COVID-19. Bolsonaro quickly got behind the drug and ordered the army to sharply scale up national production. When the president got COVID himself, he took the drug over livestream and boasted that he was improving rapidly.Dr. Marcus Lacerda’s trouble began when he decided to investigate whether the drug really was a “miracle cure” for the novel coronavirus. In the Amazon city of Manaus, the research group he led had used chloroquine for years as part of its malaria research. As infections overwhelmed hospitals in his city last March, Lacerda decided to put his team’s know-how to work by testing the drug’s ability to fight COVID-19.But the team’s clinical study quickly found that chloroquine was not only ineffective against COVID-19, but high doses of the drug could cause severe heart problems in patients infected with the virus. The results caught global attention, spurring scathing critiques of Trump’s support of chloroquine.But, at home in Brazil, Lacerda’s team saw a different response. He says it started with a tweet by the president’s son, who accused the researchers of being a group of “leftists” who were intentionally killing people with high doses of chloroquine just to demonstrate the drug didn't work. This triggered a wave of attacks on social media by the president’s supporters.“People were saying that they knew where I lived, that I had killed people on purpose, that I would pay for this,” said Lacerda, an infectious disease specialist and a researcher at the Carlos Borborema Institute of Clinical Research in Manaus.Lacerda says he received a slew of attacks and death threats over social media. Concerned for the safety of himself and his family, he was forced to walk around with armed bodyguards for two weeks.“It was one of the worst experiences of my life,” he said. “It was this intense climate of fear.”Triggered by complaints from allies of Bolsonaro, state and federal medical bodies as well as public prosecutors opened investigations into Lacerda’s study. He says he spent the better part of last year defending his research in front of lawyers, instead of carrying out studies in a lab.The attacks on Brazilian researchers echo the United States’ own war on science, which intensified during Trump’s tenure as president. Scientists in the U.S. faced over 150 attacks during Trump’s presidency, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists.“Governments on the radical right—like those we saw in the U.S. and here in Brazil—are not prepared for science to show something that contradicts what they are doing,” Lacerda said. “When a study shows something that you don't agree with, you just take down the scientists.”The assault on science has had a profound impact in Brazil. Scientists say that the attacks they have suffered have derailed research or discouraged some to tackle studies linked to the virus. Others have left the country, pushed out by threats or disillusionment.“The sciences are being persecuted right now,” said Rosa, who has studied the behavior of Bolsonaro supporters on WhatsApp and Telegram. “We’re living in a really dark moment. And this has a direct impact on the research and the quality of scientific output.”Meanwhile, Brazil is still grappling with one of the world’s worst outbreaks, with a death toll second only to the United States. In recent weeks, infections have exploded, fuelled by highly-infectious new variants and weak lockdown restrictions. With doses running out, vaccinations have brought little relief.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Hollywood/2013/11/21/russell-simmons-obamacare-saved-millions-already,2013-11-21 00:00:00,['Christian Toto'],"Russell Simmons: ObamaCare Already Saved Thousands, Possibly Millions, of Lives","To the average American, ObamaCare is part web site disaster, part shattered campaign promise writ very, very large.

Millions of Americans have already been forced out of their existing health care policies, a number that may skyrocket in the new year.

Russell Simmons sees it differently.

The hip-hop mogul says ObamaCare is already so successful it’s saved thousands, if not millions of lives.

Yes, we initially wanted single payer, and we had to compromise back in 2009 for the Affordable Care Act. But, it is a damn good piece of legislation that has already saved hundreds of thousands, if not millions of lives. So, let us not give up now.

Simmons blasted the 39 house Democrats who voted in favor of tweaking ObamaCare, but he saved his harshest words for the GOP in toto.

I know where Republicans stand. They have voted 47 times to repeal the Affordable Care Act, so their stance is clear. If you get sick, you’re on your own. If you can’t pay for your medical expenses, declare bankruptcy. If you have a pre-existing condition, they’ll send you a get well card when you’re on your death-bed. Whatever President Obama stands for, they stand for the opposite. Even if it goes against every principle they have advocated for in the past, they would rather destroy our country, than see President Obama pass policy that is good for ALL Americans.

As for the millions who already lost their health care plan thanks to ObamaCare’s arrival, Simmons says they should simply say, “good riddance.” He simply knows better than you. Period."

He Joined Fnc In As A Senior White House Correspondent.']","Cost of ObamaCare subsidies has increased dramatically, critics say","The cost of subsidies for those seeking government aid through ObamaCare has increased dramatically, critics say – even before a single dollar has been collected.

Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah wrote a letter to the administration asking why the president is already requesting 107 percent more than three years ago to pay for subsidies.

""They low-balled everything, and they knew they were not asking for enough money to actually do this,"" John Goodman of the National Center for Policy Analysis said. ""And so now they are coming along saying: 'Oh, we've just discovered we don't have enough money'. They should’ve known that from day one.""

""I don’t think most of America will be shocked that a government project is coming in over budget,"" Jim Capretta of the American Enterprise Institute said. ""It’s the typical story and so yeah it's probably happening in this case as well.""

The remarks followed by days the administration’s announcement it was easing requirements on those seeking government aid through ObamaCare, making it easier to apply for subsidies.

White House spokesman Jay Carney portrayed it as another example of flexibility.

""We have made clear all along when it comes to working with states that we are flexible with the way that they implement the Affordable Care Act,"" he said.

The Department of Health and Human Services quietly announced Friday it was tweaking the rules requiring those seeking federal aid for insurance coverage to prove they actually need the help.

Under the law, those seeking subsidies are supposed to have incomes no higher than 400 percent of the federal poverty line. Further, they can't have access to affordable insurance through their jobs.

The administration looked to the newly created ""exchanges"" -- a blend of federal- and-state run insurance marketplaces -- to verify those facts. Originally, the administration wanted to launch random checks to verify whether applicants got insurance through their jobs, and to individually verify everyone's income level.

But Reuters reports that the new rules released on Friday will give 16 states -- as well as the District of Columbia -- a pass for now on the employer-insurance verification. For those states, which are launching their own exchanges, the federal government will give them until 2015 to start random checks. The exchanges themselves launch at the beginning of 2014.

Last week the administration also announced it was delaying until 2015 a requirement that businesses employing 50 or more workers provide access to insurance.

On ""Fox News Sunday,"" critics and supporters took very different views of the effect of that delay.

""What it's doing to keep employers from bringing on any kind of employee,"" said Republican Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee. ""It's been very damaging. And I think just moving it back a year is not going to undo the uncertainty that people have.""

But Democratic Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island said, ""the vast majority of companies in this category provide health care already and they'll continue to so. But I think given the potential confusion, postponing it, not eliminating it, but postponing it for a year makes sense.""

""They do it because they want to attract the best workers,"" said Ron Pollack of Families USA, a backer of the health care law said. ""And workers are likely to be attracted to a company if you provide good benefits and good wages."""

The president told about 200 of his campaign supporters and health care activists Monday that the administration had promised Americans they could keep their current coverage -- as long as their plans hadn’t changed since ObamaCare was signed into law.

""If you have or had one of these plans before the Affordable Care Act came into law and you really liked that plan, what we said was you could keep it if it hasn't changed since the law's passed,"" Obama said. ""So we wrote into the Affordable Care Act you are grandfathered in on that plan. But if the insurance company changes it, then what we're saying is they have got to change it to a higher standard. They've got to make it better.""

Obama said his health care law is making the insurance market better for everyone, even though millions of Americans who buy individual plans have been receiving cancellation notices. He said the notices ""can be scary for people,"" but added they were often getting ""a very bad deal.""

""The bottom line is -- is that we are making the insurance market better for everybody and that's right thing to do,"" he said.

The president also acknowledged that technical problems with the health care website to shop for insurance are making it tougher for people to find other plans. He said he's ""not happy about it,"" but promised, ""We're going to smooth this thing out.""

At least 3.5 million Americans have been issued cancellations, but the exact number is unclear, The Associated Press reported. In a speech at Boston's Faneuil Hall this past week, Obama said the problem is limited to fewer than 5 percent of Americans ""who've got cut-rate plans that don't offer real financial protection in the event of a serious illness or an accident.""

In the Republican-controlled House, officials say a vote is likely as early as next week on a bill to let insurers continue selling any individual policies that were in effect on Jan. 1, 2013, even if they provide coverage deemed insufficient under Obamacare.

The measure, drafted by Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., and backed by roughly 100 fellow Republicans, would remain in effect throughout 2014, after which the issue would presumably be reviewed.

""Despite the president's repeated promise of 'if you like your plan, you can keep it,' many Americans are now learning the sad reality that their current plan will no longer exist beginning on January 1,"" Upton, chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, said in a statement when he announced his legislation last week.

""This legislation is about providing folks the peace of mind that they will be allowed to keep their current coverage if they so choose.""

While Upton's legislation permits insurers to sell existing coverage plans that would otherwise be banned, Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., introduced legislation during the day to go one step further by requiring it.

Aides told The Associated Press that under her measure, insurance companies would be obliged to continue offering existing paying customers continued coverage under any plans in effect at the end of 2013. No new consumers could enroll.

""A promise was made that if you like your health plan, you can keep it - and I will do everything I can to see that the promise is kept,"" said Landrieu, who is gearing up for what is expected to be a challenging re-election campaign next year.

The White House declined comment on the two bills.

Both measures are designed to cut through a complicated system in which some plans for individuals that fall short of coverage standards are allowed to continue under Obamacare, while others are not.

In eight years’ time, my premiums had more than doubled, and so had my deductible. But the big shock was yet to come. When my renewal letter arrived, I was politely informed to begin remitting $756 instead of $463 – a staggering 63% increase. My health insurance was going to cost more than my house payment! That was my line in the sand. I had told myself that I would drop my insurance if it ever got that expensive.

Before letting go, I did two things. I went to my doctor for a thorough checkup, including a blood test. And I applied for a very-high-deductible plan that would keep my monthly payment in the $400 range. Given that I was still insured, the insurance folks got a copy of the blood test, which they proceeded to search line by line until they found something wrong with me. Out of two pages of data, there was a single thyroid reading was outside of “normal” range (side note: there’s nothing wrong with my thyroid; it was simply their excuse to make me pay that outrageous premium). They’d found their so-called preexisting condition, and denied me access to the new plan with the lower premium. With the help of my doctor, who wrote a letter on my behalf, I appealed.

I still remember where I was when I got the phone call. I had just driven across the country to do forestry work in the Pacific Northwest for three months. It was an utterly miserable July day on the Olympic Peninsula of Washington. Rain was coming down, and all the trees and underbrush were soaking wet. Water was making its way through and around my rain gear. I’m about ten miles from the nearest cell tower, and barely had a signal. My appeal had been denied, said the distant voice. My choice was to pay the $756 premium or do without insurance. I said, “Terminate the policy.”

I stood there in the rain, wondering whether I was a genius or an idiot. Only time would tell.

Fast forward to December 15, 2013. I’m at the healthcare.gov website, making my third attempt to log in. My first effort in early October, and my second try later that month, never got as far as obtaining a username. The same bizarre error message stopped me in my tracks both times. I had to settle for printing an application and mailing it to a center in Kentucky. Six weeks passed, and I heard nothing.

Now, with the deadline approaching, I was ready to try again. First, I browsed the plans. Only two insurance companies were offering plans on the exchange in this part of Georgia, but there are 18 total plans available. I selected a bronze plan offering coverage across state lines, since I travel so much.

With the plan chosen, I began the process of creating an account at healthcare.gov. As I progressed through the various steps, the system even located my paper application. Along the way, I was required to make several decisions. I was asked how much money I expect to earn in 2014. As an independent consultant, I can only guess. The earnings estimate is used to calculate your subsidy, but you are allowed to decrease the size of the subsidy you accept, in case your earnings turn out higher than expected. In my case, the subsidy was going to pay about two-thirds of my $570 monthly premium. I chose to err on the side of caution, selecting a $200 subsidy for a net cost of $370 per month. Once I made those decisions, I was set. In less than an hour, I had been approved for health insurance.

Okay, that was easier than I expected it to be. The next day brought a new mission. My Congressman, Austin Scott (R-GA08), had scheduled a noontime town hall meeting a few miles from my house. In his newsletters, he boasts about having voted to repeal Obamacare more than 40 times.

I had spoken with him once before, a few months after making that momentous decision to stop paying for overpriced health insurance. At that meeting, I reminded him of one of the GOP’s scary talking points prior to the passage of ACA: a government bureaucrat was going to come between you and your doctor. I said to Rep. Scott:



It wasn’t a government bureaucrat that came between me and my doctor; it was an insurance-company bureaucrat.

This time around, I sat in the front row. There were perhaps 50 citizens in attendance, plus staff and local reporters. Scott gave some prepared remarks, and then took questions. The questions had to be submitted in writing on a very small card. A staffer screened them and called out the questions he felt were appropriate. There was no way I could condense what I had to say onto a card, and I really wanted to talk directly with Rep. Scott anyway. I took my chances on being able to talk with him when the meeting ended.

As I began walking towards Rep. Scott, a reporter stopped me. Would I mind saying a few words into the camera, he asked. I told him that I wanted to talk to the Congressman first. I managed to be second in line to speak. He recognized me from the previous time. I was courteous, and as succinct as I could manage. My message was that the website that he had just maligned in his speech was now functioning. I had obtained health insurance for half of the cost of the plan that I dropped two and a half years ago. Rep. Scott admitted that one of his relatives had recently obtained lower-cost coverage, too. But he still thought that Obamacare is a mess and needs to be replaced with something else; and he referred back to the point he’d made in his speech about the five million people whose plans were cancelled, or had become much more expensive.

I answered him thusly:



Okay, you say that there are 5 million who are hurt in some manner by the ACA. What about the 40 or 50 million uninsured citizens, many of whom live in your district, who stand to benefit from the ACA as it is currently written? I’m one of those 50 million. Let’s make the law better instead of repealing it.

I thanked him, and walked over to the reporter who was still patiently waiting.

How many of you would be willing to stand in front of a TV camera with no prepared remarks, being asked questions by a reporter, and having just one take? I, for one, was not eager to do this. But I’d come here on a mission, and suddenly that mission had expanded. I could reach more people than the citizens who had shown up for the town hall.

The resulting two minute broadcast gave me nearly equal billing with my Congressman! The local station must have been looking for “both sides,” and I was the other side. The two quotes from me that aired:

I was able to get an insurance plan and with the tax credit, it's going to be about half of the price that it was going to be two and a half years ago. They've definitely got the website up and running now, and so you can get online and see if there is something out there that works for you.

At first I was not going to link to the broadcast, because my real name is used. Here at Daily Kos, I can hide behind the pseudo-anonymous handle of foresterbob. Last night, after having written most of this diary, I came to the conclusion that my once-again-expanded mission calls for me to make the link available for the world to see. So here it is. Perhaps it will inspire you to take action in some small way. Or maybe even in a big way.

Austin Scott town hall

I have no illusions about changing the way Austin Scott votes. But here in deep-red central Georgia, a few television viewers were able to get a positive message about the Affordable Care Act.

Whether the president will risk signing up while cameras are rolling is still unknown. The risk in the president doing so is that HealthCare.gov crashes on him and in front of the entire world. As recently as Friday, the site collapsed.

Regardless, it certainly can’t hurt for Obama to sign up. Currently, reports show that ObamaCare enrollment is way behind where it needs to be if the program is going to be financially viable.

Moreover, reports on the number of enrollees the White House releases and the media slavishly repeats are inaccurate. You have to pay your first month’s policy in order to be enrolled and insured. Both the White House and the media are reporting those who have only put a health plan in their shopping cart as “enrolled.”

Studies show that the online abandonment rate of items placed in a shopping cart is as high as 65%.

Currently, the media have shown little interest in digging up or demanding the real ObamaCare enrollment numbers.

SERGIO LIMAWhen funding for Dr. Pedro Hallal’s COVID-19 study was abruptly slashed, deaths from the virus had just surged to grim new peaks in Brazil.The reason? Hallal says the government simply didn’t like what his study was unveiling: that indigenous people are five times as likely to get infected with COVID-19 than other ethnic groups in Brazil. His findings came amid a surge in invasions of indigenous lands by soy farmers, cattle ranchers, and illegal miners egged on by friendly signals from Brazil’s denialist President Jair Bolsonaro.“I’m absolutely certain it was meant to shut me up,” said Hallal, an epidemiologist and professor at the Federal University of Pelotas, told The Daily Beast. “The study was showing results that they didn't want it to show.”Hallal, whose COVID research funding was cut last year, is not alone. Dozens of researchers studying the virus say they have been targeted by fans and allies of Bolsonaro, who has long styled himself as a Trump-like populist opposed to science, mainstream media, and the “corrupt” liberal elite.How Bolsonaro Seized Trump’s Crown as the World’s Worst COVID LeaderResearchers in Brazil claim they have suffered through relentless social media attacks, death threats, funding cuts, and arbitrary investigations over the past year as they seek to better understand the virus ravaging the country. They say these attacks are a thinly-veiled attempt at muzzling them and suppressing their work.Bolsonaro has downplayed the virus as a “fantasy” and “little flu,” railed against lockdowns and—until recently—rejected vaccines. “Brazilians need to be studied. They don’t catch anything. You see the guy jumping in the sewer, diving in. And nothing happens to him,” the president said of the virus last year.Even though COVID has killed 398,000 people in Brazil, the president and his allies have repeatedly questioned its toll and accused governors and mayors of inflating the number of deaths in order to weaken the president politically.“There is this conservative base that casts itself as the opposition to science,” said Pablo Ornelas Rosa, a professor at the University of Vila Velha in Espírito Santo. “If you are pro-science and pro-facts, you are labelled as a leftist, as a communist, as an enemy to the president.”“The health minister freaked out,” recalled Hallal, who was coordinating the study—Brazil’s largest epidemiological analysis of the virus and its spread across the country. The scientist maintains that at a press conference organized to unveil its latest findings, the ministry barred the release of data about the heightened risks to indigenous people. Hallal says he was never told why officials took issue with the findings.A few weeks later, the study—commissioned by a prior health minister who was fired last April after clashing with Bolsonaro—lost its federal funding. Soon, Hallal was being investigated by the federal auditing body after criticizing Bolsonaro in a livestream and his allies were being sidelined in university elections.On social media, the vicious attacks on the scientist poured in, including from Bolsonaro himself. Hallal told The Daily Beast that supporters of the president made threatening phone calls to him and even photographed him on the street with his family.“It was direct persecution, triggered by my stance on the pandemic,” he said. “Instead of correcting its errors, the government attacked those who were uncovering its mistakes.”Attacks have been particularly harsh against those questioning Bolsonaro’s stance on chloroquine, an antimalarial that he—along with Donald Trump—embraced as a “miracle cure” despite no evidence it could combat COVID-19. Bolsonaro quickly got behind the drug and ordered the army to sharply scale up national production. When the president got COVID himself, he took the drug over livestream and boasted that he was improving rapidly.Dr. Marcus Lacerda’s trouble began when he decided to investigate whether the drug really was a “miracle cure” for the novel coronavirus. In the Amazon city of Manaus, the research group he led had used chloroquine for years as part of its malaria research. As infections overwhelmed hospitals in his city last March, Lacerda decided to put his team’s know-how to work by testing the drug’s ability to fight COVID-19.But the team’s clinical study quickly found that chloroquine was not only ineffective against COVID-19, but high doses of the drug could cause severe heart problems in patients infected with the virus. The results caught global attention, spurring scathing critiques of Trump’s support of chloroquine.But, at home in Brazil, Lacerda’s team saw a different response. He says it started with a tweet by the president’s son, who accused the researchers of being a group of “leftists” who were intentionally killing people with high doses of chloroquine just to demonstrate the drug didn't work. This triggered a wave of attacks on social media by the president’s supporters.“People were saying that they knew where I lived, that I had killed people on purpose, that I would pay for this,” said Lacerda, an infectious disease specialist and a researcher at the Carlos Borborema Institute of Clinical Research in Manaus.Lacerda says he received a slew of attacks and death threats over social media. Concerned for the safety of himself and his family, he was forced to walk around with armed bodyguards for two weeks.“It was one of the worst experiences of my life,” he said. “It was this intense climate of fear.”Triggered by complaints from allies of Bolsonaro, state and federal medical bodies as well as public prosecutors opened investigations into Lacerda’s study. He says he spent the better part of last year defending his research in front of lawyers, instead of carrying out studies in a lab.The attacks on Brazilian researchers echo the United States’ own war on science, which intensified during Trump’s tenure as president. Scientists in the U.S. faced over 150 attacks during Trump’s presidency, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists.“Governments on the radical right—like those we saw in the U.S. and here in Brazil—are not prepared for science to show something that contradicts what they are doing,” Lacerda said. “When a study shows something that you don't agree with, you just take down the scientists.”The assault on science has had a profound impact in Brazil. Scientists say that the attacks they have suffered have derailed research or discouraged some to tackle studies linked to the virus. Others have left the country, pushed out by threats or disillusionment.“The sciences are being persecuted right now,” said Rosa, who has studied the behavior of Bolsonaro supporters on WhatsApp and Telegram. “We’re living in a really dark moment. And this has a direct impact on the research and the quality of scientific output.”Meanwhile, Brazil is still grappling with one of the world’s worst outbreaks, with a death toll second only to the United States. In recent weeks, infections have exploded, fuelled by highly-infectious new variants and weak lockdown restrictions. With doses running out, vaccinations have brought little relief.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/27/opinion/krugman-the-obamacare-shock.html,2013-05-27 00:00:00,['Paul Krugman'],The Obamacare Shock - The New York Times,"The Affordable Care Act, a k a Obamacare, goes fully into effect at the beginning of next year, and predictions of disaster are being heard far and wide. There will be an administrative “train wreck,” we’re told; consumers will face a terrible shock. Republicans, one hears, are already counting on the law’s troubles to give them a big electoral advantage.

No doubt there will be problems, as there are with any large new government initiative, and in this case, we have the added complication that many Republican governors and legislators are doing all they can to sabotage reform. Yet important new evidence — especially from California, the law’s most important test case — suggests that the real Obamacare shock will be one of unexpected success.

Before I can explain what the news means, I need to make a crucial point: Obamacare is a deeply conservative reform, not in a political sense (although it was originally a Republican proposal) but in terms of leaving most people’s health care unaffected. Americans who receive health insurance from their employers, Medicare or Medicaid — which is to say, the vast majority of those who have any kind of health insurance at all — will see almost no changes when the law goes into effect.

There are, however, millions of Americans who don’t receive insurance either from their employers or from government programs. They can get insurance only by buying it on their own, and many of them are effectively shut out of that market. In some states, like California, insurers reject applicants with past medical problems. In others, like New York, insurers can’t reject applicants, and must offer similar coverage regardless of personal medical history (“community rating”); unfortunately, this leads to a situation in which premiums are very high because only those with current health problems sign up, while healthy people take the risk of going uninsured."

(AP)

In the first three months of her husband’s second term, Michelle Obama has made a splash as fashion icon, entertainer, cover girl. Her “The Evolution of Mom Dancing” video with Jimmy Fallon has racked up more than 15 million views on YouTube, and she’s back on the cover of the sartorial mag Vogue. But if this makes people think she’s settling for “soft power,” avoiding the tough issues — recent moves have shown this isn’t so.

To the first lady’s conventional issues — healthy food, exercise and military families — add violence against youth. On April 10, she will attend a youth violence event in Chicago, moving close to the gun-control debate, one of the year’s most contentious political issues. Obama will urge business and civil leaders in her home town “to invest in expanded opportunities for youth across Chicago’s neighborhoods,” members of her staff said.

This comes a couple of months after she hosted the parents of Chicago teenager Hadiya Pendleton in her box during her husband’s State of the Union speech. Hadiya, 15, was killed in January when a gunman opened fire on her and other teens while they were hanging out at a park in Chicago. (Hadiya’s mom and younger brother have been invited back to the White House for the Easter Egg Roll on Monday.) While Obama is unlikely to talk about gun control, gun violence is a problem in Chicago. Last year, Chicago police recorded more than 2,300 shooting incidents.

The event, which will be hosted by Mayor Rahm Emanuel (D), comes as the first lady — who has always seemed approachable while staying keenly on message — is in the middle of a period of strategic planning. The effort, headed by her communications director, Kristina Schake, will help determine how Obama moves forward in the next four years.

“There’s a group of people who think in the second term, a first lady should step up her game and cultivate a more international profile,” said Emily Bernard, a professor of English and ethnic studies at the University of Vermont who co-authored “Michelle Obama: The First Lady in Photographs.” “I would rather not see her abandon homegrown issues.”

Far from abandoning them, Obama has pressed forward with concrete steps. In February, she announced a program to bring physical activity back to schools, supported by $50 million from Nike. That month, she also penned a Wall Street Journal op-ed calling healthy food a good investment for businesses.

“She’s brought unprecedented interest to the childhood obesity issue,” said Kelly Brownell, director of the Yale Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity. “My hope is that [the dialogue Obama started] will result in significant advances in policy in the second term.”

The “Joining Forces” program, which Obama leads alongside Jill Biden, continues to include visits to military families and warm words of thanks — a nod to Obama’s role as a wartime first lady.

But a few weeks back, she attended a luncheon meeting of the chief executives of the Business Roundtable, where she gave a data-laden speech about the need to for companies to hire veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. (Obama was the second first lady to address the group; Hillary Rodham Clinton became the first during her failed push for the Clinton administration’s health-care reform in the mid-1990s.)

After her speech, UPS, whose chief executive is a member of the Business Roundtable, pledged to hire more than 25,000 veterans over the next five years. Earlier this year, Obama and Biden met with governors at the White House to urge them to ease veterans’ reentry into the workforce by giving them credit for military training and experience.

Obama has often said she favors measurable accomplishments over symbolic impact. Her staff members say her signature efforts — aimed at lowering childhood obesity rates and garnering support for military families — change the culture in the way that her clothing choices have rippled through the fashion industry. Everything she does has a message attached, an aide said, answering critics who have called performances such as the dancing video with Fallon frivolous.

The first lady does not regularly sit down with the reporters who cover her, but she told journalists traveling with her recently that children would remain central to her second-term agenda.

“Kids need to be engaged, not just intellectually. They need more than just to do well on test scores. They need to have something else in life to look forward to,” Obama told the Associated Press in February after an event promoting her “Let’s Move!” program.

Obama’s office has been a place of relative calm in the White House, with few changes after a rocky start four years ago that saw her quickly replace her first chief of staff. Two longtime aides, Director of Policy and Projects Jocelyn Frye and Deputy Communications Director Semonti Stephens, left recently. Their departures were an indication of time served, not unhappiness in the ranks, an aide said. Christina Tchen, who has roots in the West Wing and has known Michelle Obama for more than 20 years, has served as the first lady’s chief of staff since January 2011."
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/27/opinion/the-next-step-in-drug-treatment.html,2013-04-27 00:00:00,['The Editorial Board'],The Next Step in Drug Treatment - The New York Times,"The mandatory-sentencing craze that drove up the prison population tenfold, pushing state corrections costs to bankrupting levels, was rooted in New York’s infamous Rockefeller drug laws. These laws, which mandated lengthy sentences for nonviolent, first-time offenders, were approved 40 years ago next month. They did little to curtail drug use in New York or in other states that mimicked them, while they filled prisons to bursting with nonviolent addicts who would have been more effectively and more cheaply dealt with through treatment programs.

The country is beginning to realize that it cannot enforce or imprison its way out of the addiction problem. But to create broadly accessible and effective treatment strategies for the millions of people who need them, it must abandon the “drug war” approach to addiction that has dominated the national discourse in favor of a policy that treats addiction as a public health issue.

The Affordable Care Act sets the stage for such a transformation by barring insurers from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, including substance dependency. The administration’s new National Drug Control Strategy — described in a lengthy document promoted by the White House this week — calls for, among other things, community-based drug-prevention approaches that fully integrate treatment with the health care system. President Obama’s budget, meanwhile, calls for a $1.4 billion increase in treatment funding.

To its great credit, New York was one of the first states to back away from the policies it helped to create. In 2009, it revised the Rockefeller laws, with the aim of sending more low-level, nonviolent offenders to treatment instead of to prison. That step leaves it in a good position to take advantage of the Affordable Care Act and create a system for treating drug problems that is free of the poor coordination and interagency conflicts. A timely new report issued by the New York Academy of Medicine and the Drug Policy Alliance, an advocacy group, provides a detailed blueprint for how the state could remake its drug treatment delivery system and remove public policy obstacles to timely and accessible treatment."
http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/11/20/1257030/-CBS-poll-Good-news-for-Mitt-Romney-bad-news-for-Ted-Cruz,2013-11-20 00:00:00,"['Backgroundurl Avatar_Large', 'Nickname', 'Joined', 'Created_At', 'Story Count', 'N_Stories', 'Comment Count', 'N_Comments', 'Popular Tags', 'Showtags Popular_Tags']","CBS poll: Good news for Mitt Romney, bad news for Ted Cruz","President Obama's job approval rating has plunged to the lowest of his presidency, according to a new CBS News poll released Wednesday, and Americans' approval of the Affordable Care Act has dropped it's lowest since CBS News started polling on the law.

First, the good news for Mitt Romney Ouch—but not exactly surprising, given that even President Obama admits that the Obamacare rollout hasn't gone smoothly. I'm sure he'd love for those numbers to be higher, but the reality is that until things are turned around, these sorts of approval numbers aren't going to look good—nor should they. That's why the most important thing the administration can do is to make the policy work.

And that brings me to the second key finding in the poll, which has some bad news for Ted Cruz:



Just seven percent of Americans think the Affordable Care Act is working well and should be kept in place as it is. Far more, 48 percent, think there are some good things in the law, but changes are needed to make it work better, and another 43 percent think the law needs to be repealed entirely.

So even though Obamacare now is pretty much at its lowest point ever, a clear majority opposes the Ted Cruz position, which is repealing it altogether. Moreover, support for repeal isn't exactly skyrocketing, despite all the problems of the past six weeks: that 43 percent figure is just 4 points higher than the 39 percent who supported repeal in CBS's July survey

It's tempting to look at that 7 percent number as a very bad sign, but even the president doesn't take the position that the law is working perfectly and doesn't need changes. Like most Americans, Obama and the Democratic Party want Obamacare to work. On the other hand, Cruz—and pretty much the entire GOP—want it to fail. For them, it's repeal or bust. Changes to make it work better are off the table. If things get worse between now and November 2014, that position might work out for them, but if the program continues to improve, so will attitudes towards it, and Republicans will find themselves even more out of step with the public."

http://news.yahoo.com/health-care-divides-republican-senate-rivals-152131025--election.html,,[],Health care divides some Republican Senate rivals,"ATLANTA (AP) — Republicans see the 2014 midterm elections as a chance to capitalize on voter frustration with the problem-plagued health care overhaul, but the GOP first must settle a slate of Senate primaries where conservatives are arguing over the best way to oppose President Barack Obama's signature law.

In intraparty skirmishes from Georgia to Nebraska, the GOP's most strident candidates and activists are insisting on a no-holds-barred approach. They accuse fellow Republicans — including several incumbent senators — of being too soft in their opposition to the Affordable Care Act and to the president in general.

The outcomes will help determine just how conservative the Senate Republican caucus will be during Obama's final two years. And they could influence which party controls the chamber, with Democrats hoping that the most uncompromising Republican standard-bearers will emerge from the primaries and fare as poorly in general elections as their counterparts did in several 2012 Senate races. Republicans need to gain six seats for a majority.

Republican Rep. Jack Kingston of Georgia, who wants to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Saxby Chambliss, stepped into the rift recently when he seemed to scold much of his party during an interview on a conservative talk radio show.

""A lot of conservatives say, 'Nah, just step back and let this thing fall to pieces on its own,"" Kingston said. ""Well, I don't think that's always the responsible thing to do.""

Rep. Paul Broun, one of Kingston's rivals in a crowded primary field, pounced immediately, declaring in an Internet ad, ""I don't want to fix Obamacare, I want to get rid of it."" Conservative commentators hammered Kingston with headlines like ""Kingston has surrendered on Obamacare.""

In Tennessee, state Rep. Joe Carr blasted Sen. Lamar Alexander for serving as a key GOP negotiator in the deal to end the partial government shutdown that resulted from House Republicans' efforts to deny funding for the health care law. Alexander subsequently described himself as a ""conservative problem solver,"" a characterization that Carr says ""typifies how out of touch he is.""

Kentucky businessman Matt Bevin is using a similar line of attack in trying to unseat Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, as is Mississippi state Sen. Chris McDaniel in his primary challenge to Sen. Thad Cochran. Carr, Bevin and McDaniel all say they'd be more like freshmen Sens. Mike Lee of Utah and Ted Cruz of Texas, tea party favorites who pushed the defunding strategy and vexed their longer-serving colleagues.

In Nebraska and Louisiana, Republican candidates who say they oppose the health care law have had to defend their past positions on health care.

National Republicans settled on Rep. Bill Cassidy as their best shot to beat Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La. But retired Air Force Colonel Rob Maness notes that Cassidy, as a state senator and a physician in the state's public hospital system, pushed health care policies similar to those in the Affordable Care Act.

""He has to defend his entire record, regardless of how he's voted in Washington,"" said Maness, a GOP candidate who hopes to unseat Landrieu with tea party support.

Midland University President Ben Sasse, one of several Republicans running in Nebraska for retiring Sen. Mike Johanns' seat, says he opposes the health care law but has had to explain previous speeches and writings in which he was less absolute, at one point calling the act ""an important first step"" in overhauling American health care.

""This goes right to the bigger fight between the ideologues and the pragmatists,"" said Republican strategist Todd Rehm of Georgia, who isn't affiliated with any of the eight GOP candidates for Chambliss' seat. Candidates who want to capture the divided Republican electorate, he said, ""see that you can't compromise on any of it. ... The moment you start to sound like you're open to any compromise, you've sold out the ideologues.""

Indeed, Alexander, McConnell, Kingston and Cassidy all voted against the Affordable Care Act in 2010 and for symbolic repeal proposals since then. Some in the GOP leadership say the intraparty struggle is only about tactics, not the bottom line. Carr insists that's exactly the point.

""Their presumption is that tactics don't matter because the outcome would be the same,"" he said. ""But it wouldn't. There wasn't a single Republican vote that passed the Affordable Care Act, whether we're talking establishment, tea party, moderate, conservative, whatever. ... So if it's so bad — and it is — the question is why did establishment Republicans not fight to defund it?""

Leaders of national conservative groups, which have been key players in recent Senate elections, say the distinction is an important consideration as they decide endorsements.

""I would say that any candidate who is a vocal opponent of that (defunding) strategy would certainly cause us hesitation,"" said Easton Randall of FreedomWorks political action committee. ""The burden is on them to explain what they would do differently to achieve a goal we all claim to share.""

So far, FreedomWorks has endorsed McDaniel over Cochran in Mississippi and Nebraska state Treasurer Shane Osborn over Sasse. The group is watching several other races.

The Senate Conservatives Fund, founded by former Sen. Jim DeMint of South Carolina, split with FreedomWorks in Nebraska, siding with Sasse. But the fund endorsed Maness in Louisiana, Bevin in Kentucky and McDaniel in Mississippi, among others. DeMint now runs the Heritage Foundation, whose political arm also is monitoring several other races.

Those groups' recent record is mixed. Democrats are hoping for a repeat of 2010 and 2012 races where the far right groups backed less-viable candidates who lost general elections in Colorado, Nevada, Delaware and Indiana. But the same groups also helped elect Lee, Cruz and Marco Rubio in the presidential swing state of Florida.

At FreedomWorks, PAC treasurer and policy chief Dean Clancy dismissed any notion that his efforts would hurt the party.

""Republicans make a mistake when they try to waffle on these issues or sound like Democrat-lite,"" he said.

In a conference call with reporters and in a statement issued after the meeting, they said they told the president they would not reach any consensus on what states should do. They said they warned the president that his proposal would amount to “different rules for different policies and might result in higher premiums for consumers without addressing underlying concern of gaps in coverage.”

Jim Donelon, president of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and the Louisiana insurance commissioner, said in a statement that members of his organization, which represents state insurance commissioners, “have been working to ensure that plans are compliant with the new rules.”

He added, “These proposed changes are creating a level of uncertainty that we must work together to alleviate.”"

She Has Previously Served As The Post'S Bureau Chief In Shanghai"", 'San Francisco', 'As A Correspondent In Baghdad.']",AIDS advocates say drug coverage in some marketplace plans is inadequate,"The nation’s new health-care law says insurers can’t turn anyone away, even people who are sick. But some companies, patient advocates say, have found a way to discourage the chronically ill from enrolling in their plans: offer drug coverage too skimpy for those with expensive conditions.

Some plans sold on the online insurance exchanges, for instance, don’t cover key medications for HIV, or they require patients to pay as much as 50 percent of the cost per prescription in co-insurance — sometimes more than $1,000 a month.

“The fear is that they are putting discriminatory plan designs into place to try to deter certain people from enrolling by not covering the medications they need, or putting policies in place that make them jump through hoops to get care,” said John Peller, vice president of policy for the AIDS Foundation of Chicago.

As the details of the benefits offered by the new health-care plans become clear, patients with cancer, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and autoimmune diseases also are raising concerns, said Marc Boutin, executive vice president of the National Health Council, a coalition of advocacy groups for the chronically ill.

“The easiest way [for insurers] to identify a core group of people that is going to cost you a lot of money is to look at the medicines they need and the easiest way to make your plan less appealing is to put limitations on these products,” Boutin said.

Insurers say that such accusations are unfounded, and that the drug coverage is more than adequate, with many plans exceeding the minimum levels required by the Affordable Care Act. But they acknowledge that to keep premiums low, they must restrict the use of some costly drugs if there are alternatives. And they say that when high-priced medications must be used, it’s reasonable to expect patients to pick up more of the cost.

Robert Zirkelbach, a spokesman for American’s Health Insurance Plans, an industry group, said the exchange plans are designed “to try to give consumers better value for their health-care dollars.”

Joanne Peters, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services, said that the new health-care law will give many consumers access to the medicines they need for the first time but that if a plan doesn’t cover a particular drug, patients can ask insurers for an exception. She said the government is asking the companies to respond to such requests within three days.

The health-care law has been celebrated by people with serious illnesses, some of whom have been unable until now to obtain coverage. Starting Jan. 1, insurers must take all comers and are barred from imposing lifetime limits on reimbursements. For those who purchase on the marketplace, annual out-of-pocket costs will be limited to $6,350 for individuals and $12,700 for families. (The Obama administration granted a one-year grace period for some group plans to implement the new limit.)

But people who expected the new plans to provide pharmaceutical coverage comparable with that of employer-sponsored plans have been disappointed. In recent years, employers have compelled workers to pick up a growing share of the costs, especially for brand-name drugs. But insurers selling policies on the exchanges have pared their drug benefits significantly more, according to health advocates, patients and industry analysts. The plans are curbing their lists of covered drugs and limiting quantities, requiring prior authorizations and insisting on “fail first” or “step therapy” protocols that compel doctors to prescribe a certain drug first before moving on to another — even if it’s not the physician’s and patient’s drug of choice.

Paul Prince, 52, a former information technology manager from Houston, said he was surprised that some of the health plans in the new federal marketplace wouldn’t pay for one or more of his HIV medications. The policy that seemed to provide the best coverage, he said, would cover only about two-thirds of his monthly $2,400 drug tab, leaving him responsible for $840.

“There was no way I could pay that,” said Prince, who is studying to become a teacher after being laid off from his previous job and losing his insurance.

Prince receives help with buying his HIV medications from the government AIDS Drug Assistance Program for low-income people. But he worries about how he’s going to pay for his drugs when he goes back to work.

“I’m hoping the insurance companies will work this out by then, or else I will be in real trouble,” he said.

And there are fears that the government assistance programs, as well as those sponsored by foundations and drug companies, might be trimmed or eliminated on the premise that most Americans will have insurance — not taking into account that the coverage still will leave them with large bills for drugs.

The success of the health-care law hinges in large part on insurers being able to attract enough healthy people to help subsidize enrollees who are sick. Just 5 percent of the nation’s population — those with the most complex, chronic conditions — accounts for nearly half of all of U.S. health-care spending, according to the National Institute for Health Care Management, a research group funded by insurers. If insurers end up with a surplus of sick people, the result could be financially disastrous.

In the past, insurance companies could reject applicants who were sick — or had risk factors for becoming sick — or charge them higher premiums. The Affordable Care Act did away with that and left insurers with only a few ways to try to balance costs and risk. It allows them to charge more by age group (but the oldest group can be asked to pay only three times more than the youngest) and place of residence and if someone smokes.

But what is considered discriminatory in the design of drug benefits is less clear in the law and regulations issued by the Department of Health and Human Services.

The health-care law includes mechanisms to reimburse insurers for a portion of the costs for people with very high medical costs and to help carriers whose expenses may exceed the premiums they collect. But these are temporary measures, and insurers have complained that they are insufficient. HHS has said it is looking for ways to provide additional assistance if claims greatly exceed projections.

A new analysis of health plans sold in the federal exchange — which covers 36 states — and 14 state exchanges found that the benefits tend to be skimpier than in most other private insurance in the United States, with drug benefits a particular weak spot. The analysis, by Avalere Health, a health-care consulting company, was based on a sample of 600 insurance plans.

It showed that among “silver” plans — the second-cheapest of four levels of coverage in the exchanges, and the level on which federal subsidies are based — patients are required to pay a higher share of their drug costs than is typical among those who receive insurance through their jobs.

People who rely on extremely expensive drugs could encounter big bills right away. Patients whose medications cost at least $15,000 per month could face out-of-pocket costs of $1,000 to about $6,000 the first month they use their insurance, Avalere found. The analysis is based on the silver plans of the five states running their own marketplaces that have set their own benefits standards.

Dan Mendelson, Avalere’s chief executive, predicted that employers may soon adapt some of the benefit designs in the exchanges’ health plans. “We are already seeing interest,” he said, because they are less expensive for companies, shifting more of the expense to patients.

Daniel Kantor, a neurologist in Florida, said he has serious concerns about patients with multiple sclerosis who have purchased insurance through the exchanges, because some plans don’t cover widely used drugs. In addition, he said, some require doctors to prescribe a specified medicine before they cover others, which could compel people to take drugs more toxic to them, even though they are all similarly priced.

“2014 is going to be a scary year. People are going to have to stop taking medicines they are already stable on because of this,” said Kantor, the immediate past president of the Southern MS Consortium, a group of doctors, social workers and advocates who work with patients with the condition.

Insurers, he said, are hoping “that if they make it inconvenient for people with MS to get treatment, they will leave their rolls.”

Perhaps the most politically sensitive issue related to drug coverage involves people with HIV.

In an October letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, a coalition of AIDS groups voiced concern about the lack of coverage for a single-tablet regimen, in which three to four HIV medications are combined into one pill. Studies have shown that the tablets improve adherence to drug regimens and, as a result, reduce hospitalizations and enable people with HIV to stay healthier.

In reviewing health plans nationwide, the coalition found that at least 47 did not cover the single-tablet-regimen pills and other standard frontline treatments for HIV.

Robert Greenwald, director of the Center for Health Law and Policy Innovation at Harvard University, said some insurers are reconsidering their decisions and may begin covering the drug.

A spokeswoman for Aetna — which initially left the single-tablet regimen off the formulary, or list of medicine covered, for its exchange plans in at least eight states — has decided to add two of the three commonly used single-tablet regimens to all its plans. WellPoint BlueCross BlueShield said it will add one to its list of covered drugs in the 14 states where it has plans.

In Houston, three of the seven plans offered don’t cover single-tablet regimens and three others cover them only with very high coinsurance payments — as much as $1,200 a month — leaving what patients say is only one reasonable choice of carrier for those with HIV.

“We never expected these drugs to be completely left off some formularies,” said Randall Ellis, vice president of public affairs at Legacy Community Health Services, which treats 2,700 patients with HIV/AIDS. “It’s causing a lot of anxiety and confusion.”

Three years after President Obama’s landmark law was passed, the state unveiled the first details Thursday on what many Californians can expect to pay for coverage from 13 health plans offering policies in the state’s exchange, in which as many as 5 million people will shop for coverage next year.

Developments in California are being watched carefully around the country as an important indicator of whether the healthcare law can deliver on its promise to expand health coverage at an affordable price. Many Republicans, insurance executives and other critics of the law have been warning that consumers are in for a shock next year when insurance companies raise rates to comply with the law’s many new requirements.

Supporters were upbeat after an initial look at the proposed premiums, while critics remain unimpressed.

“These rates are way below the worst-case gloom-and-doom scenarios we have heard,” said Peter Lee, executive director of Covered California, the state agency implementing the healthcare law. “But let’s be clear, some consumers will have prices that go up. There may be some sticker shock.”

The new government-run market is aimed at many of the state’s uninsured and at Californians who already purchase their own health insurance. The majority of Californians receive health coverage from their employers and are not among those targeted for enrollment.

The health plans selected by the state will sell uniform benefits, each offering four broad categories of coverage called Platinum, Gold, Silver and Bronze.

Platinum policies will offer the most comprehensive benefits and carry the highest prices, followed by Gold, Silver and Bronze. The Bronze package will have the lowest premiums, but people would be on the hook for a greater share of their medical bills. The rates revealed Thursday still must be reviewed by state regulators.

Within each of those four benefit categories, plans will have the same co-pays, deductibles and limits on out-of-pocket medical expenses.

As a result, consumers will be able to compare insurance prices in their regions more easily, once these rates are finalized by July.

Consumers shopping in the exchange will have three to six health insurance plans to choose from in each of the state’s 19 regions.

In the south Los Angeles County region, for instance, rates for a 40-year-old purchasing a Silver plan ranged from $242 a month through Health Net Inc. to $325 a month through Kaiser Permanente. Overall, Los Angeles County had the lowest premiums statewide for the Silver plans.

The average premium for individual plans sold through EHealthInsurance in California last year was $177 a month. Covered California said the average premium for the three lowest Silver plans statewide was $321 a month, albeit for more comprehensive benefits.

Overall, state officials said they can’t estimate yet how much rates will rise on average. Blue Shield of California, one of the winning bidders in the exchange, said its existing individual policyholders would pay about 13% more, on average, for coverage in the state marketplace.

These rates “came in below what people legitimately expected them to be,” said Paul Markovich, Blue Shield’s chief executive.

Comparing the proposed rates for next year with current premiums is difficult, officials and experts agree, because the healthcare law mandates next year’s plans to offer richer benefits and to limit consumers’ out-of-pocket expenses.

Democrats in Washington were quick to hold up California’s announcement as a sign that the federal healthcare law is working and bringing a healthy dose of competition to a dysfunctional insurance market in which millions of people have been denied coverage because of their medical history or subjected to punishing rate hikes year after year.

Most Republican-led states have resisted the healthcare law and declined to set up their own state exchanges. Instead, they have opted for the federal government to step in.

Starting in January, most Americans must have health insurance or pay a penalty under the federal law.

Some industry experts said California’s outlook on rates remains far too optimistic in light of the hefty increases some consumers will see.

“California has no right to declare victory on rates,” said Robert Laszewski, a healthcare consultant in Virginia. He said the sample premiums released by Covered California were about 50% higher than rates for the most commonly sold health plans in the individual market primarily because of increased benefit requirements. “If rates come in higher, it speaks to the sustainability of the Affordable Care Act.”

Federal premium subsidies will ease the bite on many people’s wallets. In California, individuals earning less than about $16,000 a year will qualify for an expansion of Medi-Cal, the state’s Medicaid program for the poor. Above that threshold, individuals making less than $46,000 a year and families earning below $94,000 annually will qualify for federal subsidies.

One of the bigger risks is that high premiums turn off healthier, middle-income households that aren’t eligible for that federal assistance and have to pay the full premium. Rates could skyrocket if the exchange fails to enroll enough of those people to offset the higher costs of sicker, poorer policyholders.

Katharine King, 59 and a self-employed concert and event producer in Santa Monica, already pays $497 a month for her individual health insurance from Anthem Blue Cross. She wouldn’t qualify for federal premium help based on her income. Using the state’s online calculator, which doesn’t yet reflect the final rates, her premiums could shoot up to nearly $600 a month next year.

“The Affordable Care Act is still not all that affordable unless you qualify for a federal subsidy, which I will not,” King said. “It will likely be another case of the middle class kind of getting screwed.”

Alfredo Ceron, 44, an uninsured painter in Los Angeles, has less to worry about with these rates. He said he earns about $100 a day when he has work, which means the federal government would pick up most of the tab for him and his two adult children who still live at home.

“I’d like to get my family covered,” he said while waiting in line at a recent downtown festival to get more information about the new insurance options.

The 13 health plans selected by the state include all four of California’s largest insurance companies. They are Kaiser Permanente, Anthem Blue Cross, Blue Shield and Health Net.

The other nine health plans selected were smaller regional players and insurers that have traditionally served lower-income and Medi-Cal patients. They are Alameda Alliance for Health, Chinese Community Health Plan, Contra Costa Health Services, L.A. Care Health Plan, Molina Healthcare, Sharp Health Plan, Valley Health Plan, Ventura County Health Care Plan and Western Health Advantage.

In Los Angeles County, which was divided into two regions, six companies will compete for policyholders. They are Anthem Blue Cross, Blue Shield, Health Net, Kaiser Permanente, L.A. Care and Molina.

California Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones said he was troubled by the lack of choice in some markets. “There are only three statewide health insurers selling in Covered California,” Jones said, “which means less statewide competition than we’d hoped to see in the new marketplace.”

Shortly after 8 p.m., Cruz announced he would begin reading ""bedtime stories"" to his two young daughters . . . Then he read the Dr. Seuss classic, ""Green Eggs and Ham,"" in its entirety, noting that it was one of his favorite children's books.

This is an odd choice of a book for Senator Cruz to read in that its message actually supports the position of the Democrats that the Affordable Care Act (otherwise known as Obamacare) should be allowed to go into effect as scheduled.

In the story Green Eggs and Ham, the narrator starts by telling the reader how he does not like Green Eggs and Ham under any circumstance. A lot of the book contains lists of circumstances under which the narrator would not eat Green Eggs and Ham. For example:



I do not like them

in a house.

I do not like them

with a mouse.

I do not like them

here or there.

I do not like them

anywhere.

I do not like green eggs and ham.

I do not like them, Sam-I-am.

Then the narrator, after much urging by Sam-I-Am, eats the green eggs and ham to prove Sam-I-Am wrong. However, much to the narrator's surprise, he actually likes Green Eggs and Ham.



Say!

I like green eggs and ham!

I do!! I like them, Sam-I-am!

And I would eat them in a boat!

And I would eat them with a goat...

And I will eat them in the rain.

And in the dark. And on a train.

And in a car. And in a tree.

They are so good so good you see!

The narrator then goes on to actually thank Sam-I-Am for encouraging him to try the Green Eggs and Ham.



I do so like

green eggs and ham!

Thank you!

Thank you,

Sam-I-am

Senator Cruz-Obamacare is like Green Eggs and Ham. Like the narrator in the story, some people have come to the conclusion (after hearing a lot of right wing propaganda) that they won't like Obamacare even though they have never tried it. A lot of their opposition is based on their fear of trying something different from what they are used to. However, like the narrator in the story, once the American people try Obamacare, I think that they will like it. And like the narrator in the story who thanks Sam-I-Am for forcing him to try the green eggs and ham, I think that the American People will ultimately thank President Obama and the Democrats for Obamacare."

Hackett, who ran the business for five years, says the store was hampered by the weak local economy, a new chain grocery store down the street and a bank that said it couldn’t lend to him anymore. He also blames President Obama. David Walter Banks

Tom Hackett’s life in the meat business was nearly gone by 4 p.m. on Thursday. What remained behind yards and yards of polished glass were a few scattered remnants of his final inventory — a couple of flank steaks, some shrimp, a lonely half a pound of bologna.

Hackett stood behind the case and lamented that in a few hours he would be closing the store he has run for five years. The weak local economy killed it, he said, and so did the new chain grocery store down the street and the bank that said it couldn’t lend to him anymore. But the biggest culprit, he said, was a man in Washington whose name Hackett could not bring himself to speak.

“I’m going to go hide for two years,” he said, until “he” — President Obama — is on his way out. “It’s sad. People are hurting. There’s no reason for it to be happening, other than what he’s doing.”

If you want to understand the congressional Republicans who have forced confrontations with Obama on the “fiscal cliff,” the government shutdown and the debt ceiling — and whether those lawmakers might feel encouraged to force more confrontations in the future — you need to understand the economic struggles of the Republicans’ home districts.

People in those districts are poorer and more likely to be unemployed than in the nation at large. They have focused their anger about their economic circumstances on Obama, and they want someone, anyone, to make him improve things for them. This is why Hackett praises his congressman, Tom Graves, for voting against the plan to end the budget impasse with Obama that produced the shutdown. “I think he’s great,” he said of Graves. “Somebody’s got to stand up to him.”

View Graphic On average, the economy in the districts hard-line Republicans represent is worse than it is in the nation at large.

Forty-five House Republicans have most consistently pushed their caucus to brinkmanship over the past several years, according to a Washington Post analysis of voting patterns.

On average, the economy in the districts those Republicans represent is significantly worse than it is in the nation at large.

The median income in those districts last year was 7 percent lower than the national median, according to the Census Bureau. The unemployment rate averaged 10 percent. That was almost two percentage points higher than the national rate, and two percentage points higher than the overall rate in the states that contain each district.

The epicenter of that economic distress lies in the Deep South. Four of the congressional districts are in North Georgia. A dozen others are close by in Alabama, Tennessee, Florida, and North and South Carolina. Nearly all of them ended 2012 with jobless rates in the double digits.

The Rome metro area has fewer jobs today than it did when the recession ended in 2009. The unemployment rate was 10 percent last year, and it has fallen this year, to 8.8 percent in August, only because so many people have given up looking for work.

The city of 36,000 sits a little more than an hour northwest of Atlanta, near the Alabama and Tennessee borders. It doesn’t look depressed. Construction crews are building big-box stores on the highway into town, and on a recent night, several restaurants in the historic downtown were nearly full for dinner.

But economic statistics show that the metro area hasn’t recouped any of the more than 3,000 jobs it lost during the recession, on net. In interviews across town, workers, executives and small-business owners blame that struggle largely on Obama. Many of them say the Dodd-Frank financial regulations put a chill on local bank lending — and they say it was the president who pushed for the legislation.

And it would be difficult to overstate the outrage expressed about the president’s signature health-care law, the Affordable Care Act.

“There is a lot of frustration over the way the government’s acting” when it comes to the economy, said Roger F. Smith, the chief executive of River City Bank in Rome, one of several people in town who contrasted Obama’s performance in office with the economic success they experienced under President Bill Clinton. “There’s a lack of confidence in the leadership. That starts with the president. It certainly hampers the ability to recover.”

Hackett, 58, called Obama’s entire agenda anti-business: “It’s like, ‘What can we do to kill the economy?’ ” It was his final day of selling to customers at the specialty meat shop he opened in 2008 as a hobby, catering to grilling enthusiasts like himself who want higher-end steaks than the big grocery stores sell.

When the shop opened, Hackett was still primarily a real estate developer, siting and building homes in subdivisions around Rome and Floyd County. He lost that business in the housing crash, and his retirement nest egg with it, and was left with his store to support him. He worked there with his wife, Tippy, and a few employees, including an in-house butcher. Sales were okay at first but began trickling off over the past two years as consumers tightened up in the increasingly weak recovery.

Then, Hackett said, his bank pulled back on lending, citing new federal regulations. Over the summer, he and Tippy dropped their health-care coverage after their insurer raised rates, something the Hacketts blame on the federal health-care law. The opening of a Publix grocery store peeled off more precious customers, and last week, the Hacketts sent an e-mail to customers saying they were shutting down. They made the front page of the Rome News-Tribune.

On their final afternoon, the Hacketts marked all the meat in the case down by $2 a pound. They consoled loyal customers, one of whom cried at the news. They said they aren’t sure what they’ll do for money, but they are quitting the entre­pre­neur­ship game, at least until he-who-shall-not-be-named leaves office.

In a back room, their butcher, soon to be laid off, rubbed water over his chopping block, slowly and carefully, wiping the blood away one last time.

Around town, there is plenty of worry that things are about to get worse because of Washington. On Thursday evening, a dozen small-business owners gathered under the pink flourescent lights of a college auditorium to brace themselves for the effects the health-care law could have on their firms.

A pair of lawyers, one from Atlanta and one from Chattanooga, Tenn., walked attendees through an array of PowerPoint slides centered on the legislation’s requirements — and building to what the lawyers called the “pay or play” question: Should owners of firms large enough to fall under the law’s mandates to provide health insurance to their workers comply with it, or should they refuse and pay fines?

The lawyers raised several options, mostly about how to avoid the mandates of the law: cutting back all workers to part time, for instance, or hiring mostly independent contractors. They also noted that such steps could carry legal problems. “Maybe you want to offer coverage,” one of them allowed. “That’s okay.” But then he suggested ways to do it that would still shield the business from federal requirements about what type of coverage to offer.

The next morning, one un­insured produce worker sorted apples into boxes for one of the last times. Donald Rizer, 58, wore a plaid shirt, blue jeans and gloves, and complained of the aching shoulder that he said keeps him from working more than 20 hours a week.

Soon he’ll be out of work. Rizer’s employer, Todd Beam, is shutting down the wholesale produce business his father started 35 years ago. Beam blamed the move on a freeze on bank lending — which he said his bank attributed to the new financial regulations — and on a weak economy, for which he blamed Obama. (There’s also the matter of a crucial school lunch supply contract, which Beam lost to a lower-bidding firm from Atlanta). He was set to lay off three workers and go back to his previous job, driving a commercial truck.

Rizer did not have a new job lined up. He had come down to Rome after leaving a carpet factory several years ago. He needs shoulder surgery but can’t afford insurance. And because of a quirk in the health-care law, and the fact that Georgia declined to expand Medicaid coverage for low-income people like him, Rizer can’t qualify for a subsidy to buy coverage on his own.

When he visited the federal health insurance exchange Web site, he found the cheapest policy available to him cost $200 a month — one quarter of his current salary. “Obama,” he said, “he thinks that he’s helping things, but he ain’t.”

He fished out a bruised green apple and tossed it aside. Only a few boxes were left."

In no particular order:

1. The Vitter amendment. Concocted by David Vitter (R-La.), this majestically cynical measure is based on the common misconception that members of Congress and their staffs are “exempted” from the Affordable Care Act. It would prohibit the government from paying for any part of the health insurance for federal legislators or their staff.

The facts of the “exemption” are these: During the 2010 debate over the ACA, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) mischievously inserted an amendment requiring that members of Congress and their staffs get their insurance from the insurance exchanges to be set up under Obamacare. They thus became the only employees of a large employer in the country required to buy their coverage from the exchanges -- in almost every other case, big employers provide worker insurance themselves.

Like other big employers, the government customarily covered about 70% to 75% of their premium costs. But there isn’t a provision in the ACA for employer contributions to exchange-provided policies, which are designed largely for individuals who don’t get coverage through their jobs. Accordingly, the federal Office of Personnel Management issued a special ruling allowing the government to continue its usual share of employee premiums.

Vitter’s amendment is directed at the soft-minded people who think there’s something unusual or untoward about this. He undoubtedly knows the truth. The measure would impose a significant pay cut on congressional staffers, especially lower-paid workers who will have trouble making up the lost employer contributions from their own pockets. What species of person screws his own employees this way? A “Vitter,” apparently.

2. The Lankford bill. The “Government Shutdown Prevention Act” introduced by Rep. James Lankford (R-Okla.) in March, this bill would keep the government open at existing spending levels if Congress failed to pass a budget by the end of the fiscal year. But it would impose a 1% spending cut after 120 days without a budget, and additional 1% cuts every 90 days thereafter.

It’s a classic poison pill, and it’s the U.S. economy that would get poisoned. It obviously does nothing to incentivize an intransigent minority in Congress to come to grips with economic or political reality, and isn’t that exactly where we are now?

In fact, it’s a formula for the slow strangulation of economic growth, which is the problem the economy faces already, thanks to the mindlessly destructive sequester. What will it take for Congress to finally realize that economic growth is the one sure remedy for shrinking the budget deficit and the federal debt, and that efforts to cut government spending in a period of low growth only makes the economy worse?

3. Ryan’s unconscionable “conscience” clause. Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), who has a mysterious reputation for economic smarts in Washington, has reportedly now floated the idea of conditioning an end to the fiscal stalemate by inserting a “conscience” clause into the Affordable Care Act. That’s a provision that would allow employers and insurers to refuse to provide birth control coverage to their workers or policyholders on religious or moral grounds. This is nothing but a sop to the religious far right, some of the same people who got us into the standoff to begin with. It’s a battle from the 19th century, and one would think we moved past that.

4. The return of starving the seniors. Another idea from the Ryan shop. This proposal would require cuts to Social Security and Medicare as a condition for raising the debt ceiling. Ryan has been shopping this idea for more than two years now, and it’s been thoroughly repudiated -- most recently by the voters in the 2012 election, when Ryan and his running mate, Mitt Romney, were solidly thumped. There’s something fundamentally immoral about trying to balance the federal budget on the backs of the neediest and most elderly members of society.

What’s worse about all these ludicrous ideas isn’t their particular stupidity, of course. It’s that they evade the point that the Republican Party has long since abandoned its rationale for the shutdown and the threat to the debt limit in the first place -- rolling back Obamacare. That’s no longer even on the table. What’s happening in Washington right now is an infantile exercise in face-saving. To have to list the four stupidest ideas for ending the shutdown just shows how hopelessly stupid the shutdown is."

In the early afternoon, many visitors were greeted with a message saying the site had a lot of visitors and asked people to wait. By about 2 pm, the site appeared to be operating normally and users were directed to log in or create an account.

Earlier in the day, applicants to healthcare.gov found a message saying that the system was down for scheduled maintenance. Visitors were advised to try again later or enter their email address to receive notice when the site is working again.

The exchange's tech team encountered an error during routine maintenance on Thursday night, said Joanne Peters, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services. Repairs began at 10 a.m. Friday and were estimated to take two to three hours.

The outage came shortly before President Obama was set to hold a news conference before leaving for vacation.

And it came at a very inopportune time for the rollout of Obamacare. Americans in the states using the federal exchange have until the end of Monday to pick a plan on healthcare.gov to be eligible for coverage beginning Jan. 1.

The administration has said that those who encounter problems signing up can qualify for a special enrollment period, but it has not provided details on how it would work.

As 2013 draws to a close, administration officials are scrambling to smooth over remaining Obamacare problems.

Late Thursday, the White House announced that individual policy holders who received termination notices could qualify for a hardship exemption and buy catastrophic plans on the exchanges. And, after pressure from the administration, insurers announced applicants could pay their first month's premiums as late as Jan. 10 and receive coverage retroactive to Jan. 1.

Obama was not the only politician fudging the truth. Most Democrat lawmakers repeated this claim on the campaign trail and in meetings with constituents. If Obama apologized, they should as well, as they are equally culpable.

Breitbart News has compiled a list of the Top 10 Senate Democrats who should follow Obama’s lead and apologize to the American public. These particular lawmakers either went all-in on the false claim for partisan reasons or were in a position to know that millions of Americans would not be able to keep their health insurance.

If a reader interprets this list as a guide for whom to call in Congress, so be it.

10. SEN. MARY LANDRIEU (D-LA): “If you like the insurance that you have, you’ll be able to keep it.” (MSNBC’s Hardball, 12/16/09)

Mary Landrieu, like all Senate Democrats, provided the deciding vote on passing ObamaCare. After 3 years, it is hard to remember all the parliamentary tricks the Democrats used to pass a bill that almost none of them had read. Landrieu, who is up for reelection next year, lied on TV. She should apologize.

9. SEN. KAY HAGAN (D-NC): “We need to support the private insurance industry so that people who have insurance they’re happy with can keep it while also providing a backstop option for people without access to affordable coverage.” (“Republicans Vent As Other Compromise Plans Get Aired,” National Journal’s Congress Daily, 6/18/09)

160,000 residents of North Carolina has lost their health coverage. Sen. Hagan has been most aggressive in trying to separate herself from ObamaCare. No wonder, since even a Democrat poll has found her now in a statistical tie with any of her possible Republican challengers. In September, Hagan held a 12-17 point lead. She is up for reelection next year and should apologize.

8. SEN. MARK BEGICH (D-AK): “If you got a doctor now, you got a medical professional you want, you get to keep that. If you have an insurance program or a health care policy you want of ideas, make sure you keep it. That you can keep who you want.”

Begich won his Senate seat in 2008, after DOJ staffers trumped up false charges against the sitting GOP Senator Ted Stevens. Begich is running for reelection in Alaska, without the Obama wave and without a mythical DOJ investigation. He should apologize.

7. SEN. MICHAEL BENNET (D-CO): “We should begin with a basic principle: if you have coverage and you like it, you can keep it. If you have your doctor, and you like him or her, you should be able to keep them as well. We will not take that choice away from you.”

Sen. Bennet heads to DSCC, the party arm to elect Democrats to the US Senate. He will have an outsized role in races across the country. He said his position on ObamaCare was based on a “basic principle.” He should apologize.

6. SEN. PATTY MURRAY (D-WA): “Again, if you like what you have, you will be able to keep it. Let me say this again: If you like what you have, when our legislation is passed and signed by the President, you will be able to keep it.” (Sen. Murray, Congressional Record, S.6400, 6/10/09)

Let me say this again, as a senior member, and now Chair of the Budget Committee, Sen. Murray must have been in a position to know that these claims were false. She won her first race for Senate campaigning as a “soccer mom” in “tennis shoes.” Insert your own joke. 290,000 residents of Washington have lost their health insurance. She should apologize.

5. SEN. TOM HARKIN (D-IA): “One of the things we put in the health care bill when we designed it was the protection for consumers to keep the plan they have if they like it; thus, the term ‘grandfathered plans.’ If you have a plan you like –existing policies–you can keep them. …we said, if you like a plan, you get to keep it, and you can grandfather it in.” (Sen. Harkin, Congressional Record, S.7675-6, 9/29/10)

Sen. Harkin has long been a slippery politician. As Chair of the Health Committee in the Senate, Harkin would have had more intimate knowledge of ObamaCare than most other lawmakers. His yowler here is he tries to claim that the “put in” language to ensure people could keep the plan they like. That is a sin of commission. Harkin, who is retiring, should absolutely apologize.

4. SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): “If you like your insurance, you keep it.” (U.S. Senate, Finance Committee, Bill Mark-Up, 9/24/09)

Schumer, who was in a position to know the inner-workings of the law seems to have lied. Asking him for an apology, though, is like asking Anthony Weiner to become modestly self-aware. Still, he should apologize.

3. SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL): “This bill before us on the Senate floor makes it clear that if you have an insurance policy that you like, you can keep it. If you like the doctor that you’re currently doing business with, you can continue to use that doctor.” (Sen. Durbin, Teleconference, 12/4/09)

Durbin is the Number 2 Democrat in the Senate, amazingly. He seems preternaturally disposed to obscuring the truth. He actually said the legislation “makes it clear” that you can keep your insurance. He either can’t read legislation or he was intentionally misleading the public. In any event, he should apologize.

2.SEN. HARRY REID (D-NV):”In fact, one of our core principles is that if you like the health care you have, you can keep it.” (Sen. Reid, Congressional Record, S.8642, 8/3/09)

Core principles, apparently, aren’t what they used to be. Sen. Reid emptied out the parliamentary cupboard to get ObamaCare passed. As Majority Leader, he had to have a keen understanding of what was in the bill and what the consequences would be. The White House, at the time, was aware of the fact that many Americans would lose their health insurance. Surely, Sen. Reid was privy to the same information. He should apologize.

And, the #1 Senate Democrat who should apologize…

1. SEN. MAX BAUCUS (D-MT): “That is why one of the central promises of health care reform has been and is: If you like what you have, you can keep it. That is critically important. If a person has a plan, and he or she likes it, he or she can keep it.” (Sen. Baucus, Congressional Record, S.7676, 9/29/10)

Sen. Baucus wrote most of the bill that became ObamaCare. He has been steeped in health care policy for decades. He was in a position to know, and had to know, that the “central promise” that people could keep their current health care coverage was a lie.

He should apologize, but unfortunately, he has chosen to retire rather than face the voters. I can only hope he does not go softly into the night."
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/07/opinion/krugman-the-spite-club.html,2013-06-07 00:00:00,['Paul Krugman'],The Spite Club - The New York Times,"House Republicans have voted 37 times to repeal ObamaRomneyCare — the Affordable Care Act, which creates a national health insurance system similar to the one Massachusetts has had since 2006. Nonetheless, almost all of the act will go fully into effect at the beginning of next year.

There is, however, one form of obstruction still available to the G.O.P. Last year’s Supreme Court decision upholding the law’s constitutionality also gave states the right to opt out of one piece of the plan, a federally financed expansion of Medicaid. Sure enough, a number of Republican-dominated states seem set to reject Medicaid expansion, at least at first.

And why would they do this? They won’t save money. On the contrary, they will hurt their own budgets and damage their own economies. Nor will Medicaid rejectionism serve any clear political purpose. As I’ll explain later, it will probably hurt Republicans for years to come.

No, the only way to understand the refusal to expand Medicaid is as an act of sheer spite. And the cost of that spite won’t just come in the form of lost dollars; it will also come in the form of gratuitous hardship for some of our most vulnerable citizens."

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) for conceding that the party's efforts to repeal Obamacare aren't going anywhere in the Senate -- and leaving the House to keep fighting over it anyway.

Cruz, a tea party favorite, is one of the most vocal proponents of defunding the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama's health care reform law. He's spent months championing the cause. But on Wednesday, as House Republican leaders unveiled their latest plan for sinking Obamacare -- tying a measure to defund the law to a must-pass resolution that keeps the government running -- Cruz thanked House Republicans for their fight, and said they're on their own.

""[Senate Majority Leader] Harry Reid will no doubt try to strip the defund language from the continuing resolution, and right now he likely has the votes to do so,"" Cruz said in a statement. ""At that point, House Republicans must stand firm, hold their ground, and continue to listen to the American people.""

Aides to top Republicans in the House, where GOP leadership has already been struggling to keep the party together on the measure, were beside themselves. And once granted anonymity, they didn't mince their words.

""We haven't even taken up the bill and Ted Cruz is admitting defeat?"" fumed one senior GOP aide. ""Some people came here to govern and make things better for their constituents. Ted Cruz came here to throw bombs and fundraise off of attacks on fellow Republicans. He's a joke, plain and simple.""

Another aide said Cruz's comment ""exposes how [Senate conservatives] have deliberately misled their constituents and the grassroots for eight weeks. This isn't leadership, it's hypocrisy.""

A request for comment from Cruz's office regarding the dust-up caused by the senator's remarks was not returned.

House Republican leaders have been planning to pass their continuing resolution (with its provision to defund Obamacare) and hand it off to Cruz and others in the Senate, namely Sens. Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Marco Rubio (Fla.), to stage a dramatic fight over the issue, even if it can't pass.

The three senators issued a joint statement on Wednesday praising House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) for his plan to bring the bill to the floor later this week, but none vowed to use every tool possible to carry on the fight in the Senate, such as the use of a filibuster.

House Republicans, who have spent the last few weeks being berated by Cruz on the need to keep a government shutdown on the table in the Obamacare fight, were not impressed.

""House agrees to send #CR to Senate that defunds Obamacare. @SenTedCruz & @SenMikeLee refuse to fight. Wave white flag and surrender,"" tweeted Rep. Sean Duffy (R-Wis.).

""So far Sen Rs are good at getting Facebook likes, and townhalls, not much else. Do something...,"" tweeted Rep. Tim Griffin (R-Ark.).

Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.) also took to Twitter to vent. ""House Republicans are turning words into action to defund #Obamacare. Ball will be in the Senate’s court,"" he wrote.

To be sure, Cruz is correct that the Democratic-led Senate doesn't have the votes to repeal Obamacare, and of course the president would never sign off on such an effort. But conservatives keep pushing votes on the issue because it's popular with their base. Cruz's statement on Wednesday was simply a tactical error: He admitted what his colleagues won't.

Not all Senate Republicans signed up for a fight over Obamacare tied to a government shutdown. Several have gone on record to oppose or criticize the strategy of pushing to defund the law in exchange for keeping the government open. Even in the House, some rank-and-file Republicans like Rep. Tom Cole (Okla.) have been vocal critics of that move.

But House Republican leaders were counting on Cruz to lead the fight in the Senate this time -- not to concede the game before it even began. Cruz's comments simply put the onus back on House Republicans to take the lead on -- and pay the political price for -- a strategy that remains unlikely to work.

Asked to respond to Cruz's statement, Boehner spokesman Michael Steel simply said, ""We trust Republicans in the Senate will put up a fight worthy of the challenge that Obamacare poses."""

Koop%2C a pediatric surgeon%2C had a conservative reputation

He is remembered for his 1986 report on AIDS

He also made his mark in the fight against smoking

C. Everett Koop, the former surgeon general who brought frank talk about AIDS into U.S. homes, has died at his home in Hanover, N.H., officials at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth said Monday. He was 96.

Koop, a pediatric surgeon with a conservative reputation and a distinctive beard, served from 1982 to 1989 during the Reagan administration and the early months of the administration of George H.W. Bush.

""He was a historic figure,"" who became surgeon general the year the AIDS pandemic began and played a pivotal role in educating Americans about it, says Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease.

""Dr. Koop will be remembered for his colossal contributions to the health and well-being of patients and communities in the U.S. and around the world,"" said a statement released by Chip Souba, dean of the Geisel School of Medicine and Joseph O'Donnell, senior scholar at the C. Everett Koop Institute. ""As one of our country's greatest surgeons general, he effectively promoted health and the prevention of disease, thereby improving millions of lives in our nation and across the globe.""

Koop may best remembered for his official 1986 report on AIDS – a plain-spoken 36-page document that talked about the way AIDS spread (through sex, needles and blood), the ways it did not spread (through casual contact in homes, schools and workplaces) and how people could protect themselves.

The report advocated condom use for the sexually active and sex education for schoolchildren, pleasantly surprising liberals and upsetting many of Koop's former supporters. An eight-page version was mailed to every American household in 1988.

The brochure came in a sealed packet with the warning that ""some of the issues involved in this brochure may not be things you are used to discussing openly.""

In interviews and speeches, Koop always stressed that sexual abstinence and monogamy were the best protection against AIDS, but that medical experts had a duty to tell people who did not choose those paths how they could stay healthy.

""My position on AIDS was dictated by scientific integrity and Christian compassion,"" Koop wrote in his 1991 biography, Koop: The Memoirs of America's Family Doctor.

Koop also made his mark in the fight against smoking, with another 1986 report that alerted the public to the dangers of second-hand smoke – setting the stage for today's widespread prohibitions against smoking in public places.

At one point, Koop was the second-most recognized public official in the United States, after President Reagan, says Alexandra Lord, a former Public Health Service historian and author of Condom Nation: The US Government's Sex Education Campaign from World War I to the Internet. He was one of the most high-profile surgeons general, before or since, she says -- though she says people under age 35 or so may not know his name today.

In his time, ""Koop was very effective,"" so much so that he made some subsequent administrations ""very nervous"" about the potential power of the men and women occupying the office, Lord says.

Charles Everett Koop was born in Brooklyn on Oct. 14, 1916. He briefly played football at Dartmouth College, where he acquired his lifelong nickname ""Chick,"" according to a biography posted online by the National Library of Medicine. An early fascination with medicine eventually led him to Cornell University Medical College. In 1945, he became first surgeon in chief at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, a position he held until his appointment as surgeon general.

His nomination for that position was opposed by groups who feared he would use the office to promote his anti-abortion views – which he said were developed during a career saving newborns with life-threatening birth defects. But Koop avoided pronouncements on abortion during his tenure.

After he left office, he became one of the first high-profile doctors to establish a presence online. His website, DrKoop.com, was launched in 1997 and was intended to provide reliable health information to the public, he said. But Koop and his backers faced criticism over ties with companies advertising on the site. Like many Internet efforts of the era, it failed, going bankrupt in 2001.

Koop remained active, though, heading his C. Everett Koop Institute at Dartmouth in New Hampshire. At a news conference in Washington, D.C., in 2010, when he was 94, he spoke from a wheelchair and told reporters that he was ""very, very deaf"" and legally blind, the Washington Post reported.

But he still had the strength to warn that AIDS was becoming a ""forgotten epidemic."" Although 56,000 Americans were still getting infected each year, ""simply put, HIV is no longer on the public's radar screen,"" he said.

At a time when AIDS was new, though, and the nation needed someone to give it the facts straight up, Koop filled the bill, says Woodie Kessel, a former assistant surgeon general who was a longtime friend and a Koop Institute fellow. ""Every time there's a new threat to our well-being, it takes somebody to calm our fears... He worked to address those fears with facts, with science and with great compassion.""

Fauci, who also became friends with Koop and worked with him on his AIDS report, says: ""He was an amazing champion of treating it as a disease, not as a stigma. He understood it was a public health disaster in the making. ... I remember he would say, 'Tony, you do the science, I'll do the education for the public.'""

Surgeon General Regina Benjamin said in a statement that when she took office, in 2010, ""Dr. Koop sat down with me on what would become the first of numerous occasions to offer guidance and support. We often prayed together.""

Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius called Koop ""a fearless public servant.""

""People who suggest that there's anything unusual about the delaying of a deadline in the implementation of a complex and comprehensive law are deliberately sticking their heads in the sand or are just willfully ignorant about past precedent,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters at a daily briefing. ""It's not serious.""

The administration announced last week that it would delay for one year the enforcement of penalties for larger employers who fail to provide health insurance for their workers, saying that businesses need more time to meet the overhaul’s requirements.

The announcement prompted outcry from Republicans – who have long tried to repeal or gut the 2010 law –who say that the delay proves that Obama’s administration will cherry-pick pieces of laws that it wants to execute while ignoring the rest.

But the grumbles haven’t been entirely limited to the GOP.

Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin, a Democrat, was quoted Wednesday in the New York Times questioning whether Obama could choose to delay the implementation of the so-called “employer mandate” without congressional approval.

“This was the law. How can they change the law?” he asked."

2012 GOP presidential nominee says Obama%27s assertions threaten %27foundation%27 of 2nd term

Romney said states would have had more flexibility on health care if he were elected president

Mass. Gov. Deval Patrick offered counterpoint to Romney on %27Meet the Press%27

WASHINGTON — Mitt Romney accused President Obama on Sunday of lying to Americans about whether they could keep their health insurance, suggesting the Affordable Care Act is undermining his former rival's second White House term.

In an appearance Sunday on NBC's Meet the Press, the 2012 GOP presidential nominee criticized Obama's repeated assertion while the legislation was being debated in Congress that people would get to keep their health care plan.

""He wasn't telling the truth,"" Romney said. ""I think that fundamental dishonesty really puts in peril the foundation of his whole second term.""

The Obama administration has stressed in recent days that people who lose their health care coverage — because their existing plan does not meet minimum standards under the federal law — will be able to get better insurance coverage as required by the Affordable Care Act.

Romney also rejected comparisons Obama has made between problems with the national law and its dysfunctional website, HealthCare.gov, and the Massachusetts plan and its initial enrollment challenges. If he won the 2012 election, Romney said, he would have given states more flexibility.

""My own plan was to say to each state, you've got a requirement to move to a point where all your people are insured and you cover pre-existing conditions,"" he said on NBC. ""We're going to give you flexbility from the federal government level to help you be able to do so.""

As he did throughout the presidential campaign, current Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick rebuffed Romney's claims in his own interview on Meet the Press. Patrick, a close Obama friend who is not running for re-election next year, said Romney himself had noted that the Massachusetts health law would be a model for the rest of the country.

Patrick said only a ""small number"" of people are receiving cancellation notices about their health insurance. ""If you have the kind of health care that disappears when you need it the most, the Affordable Care Act says that has to end,"" the governor said.

As for HealthCare.gov's myriad technical issues, Patrick described the website as a ""convenience"" that when working will allow consumers to comparison shop among insurance plans. ""That's why it is urgent that the president get it fixed,"" he said.

Sunday's interview was a follow-up to Romney's critique of Obama and the Affordable Care Act that the former Massachusetts governor posted on Facebook last week. That statement was a pre-emptive strike on Obama's speech in Boston, in which the president argued that the Massachusetts law had similar problems before state residents embraced it fully.

The Massachusetts health care law was perceived as an early problem for Romney in his presidential bid last year — something that he would have had to explain lest it became a defining issue in the GOP primary. In a speech in May 2011 at the University of Michigan Medical Center, Romney sought to defuse comparisons between the Massachusetts law and the Affordable Care Act calling the Bay State version ""a state solution to a state problem.""

SERGIO LIMAWhen funding for Dr. Pedro Hallal’s COVID-19 study was abruptly slashed, deaths from the virus had just surged to grim new peaks in Brazil.The reason? Hallal says the government simply didn’t like what his study was unveiling: that indigenous people are five times as likely to get infected with COVID-19 than other ethnic groups in Brazil. His findings came amid a surge in invasions of indigenous lands by soy farmers, cattle ranchers, and illegal miners egged on by friendly signals from Brazil’s denialist President Jair Bolsonaro.“I’m absolutely certain it was meant to shut me up,” said Hallal, an epidemiologist and professor at the Federal University of Pelotas, told The Daily Beast. “The study was showing results that they didn't want it to show.”Hallal, whose COVID research funding was cut last year, is not alone. Dozens of researchers studying the virus say they have been targeted by fans and allies of Bolsonaro, who has long styled himself as a Trump-like populist opposed to science, mainstream media, and the “corrupt” liberal elite.How Bolsonaro Seized Trump’s Crown as the World’s Worst COVID LeaderResearchers in Brazil claim they have suffered through relentless social media attacks, death threats, funding cuts, and arbitrary investigations over the past year as they seek to better understand the virus ravaging the country. They say these attacks are a thinly-veiled attempt at muzzling them and suppressing their work.Bolsonaro has downplayed the virus as a “fantasy” and “little flu,” railed against lockdowns and—until recently—rejected vaccines. “Brazilians need to be studied. They don’t catch anything. You see the guy jumping in the sewer, diving in. And nothing happens to him,” the president said of the virus last year.Even though COVID has killed 398,000 people in Brazil, the president and his allies have repeatedly questioned its toll and accused governors and mayors of inflating the number of deaths in order to weaken the president politically.“There is this conservative base that casts itself as the opposition to science,” said Pablo Ornelas Rosa, a professor at the University of Vila Velha in Espírito Santo. “If you are pro-science and pro-facts, you are labelled as a leftist, as a communist, as an enemy to the president.”“The health minister freaked out,” recalled Hallal, who was coordinating the study—Brazil’s largest epidemiological analysis of the virus and its spread across the country. The scientist maintains that at a press conference organized to unveil its latest findings, the ministry barred the release of data about the heightened risks to indigenous people. Hallal says he was never told why officials took issue with the findings.A few weeks later, the study—commissioned by a prior health minister who was fired last April after clashing with Bolsonaro—lost its federal funding. Soon, Hallal was being investigated by the federal auditing body after criticizing Bolsonaro in a livestream and his allies were being sidelined in university elections.On social media, the vicious attacks on the scientist poured in, including from Bolsonaro himself. Hallal told The Daily Beast that supporters of the president made threatening phone calls to him and even photographed him on the street with his family.“It was direct persecution, triggered by my stance on the pandemic,” he said. “Instead of correcting its errors, the government attacked those who were uncovering its mistakes.”Attacks have been particularly harsh against those questioning Bolsonaro’s stance on chloroquine, an antimalarial that he—along with Donald Trump—embraced as a “miracle cure” despite no evidence it could combat COVID-19. Bolsonaro quickly got behind the drug and ordered the army to sharply scale up national production. When the president got COVID himself, he took the drug over livestream and boasted that he was improving rapidly.Dr. Marcus Lacerda’s trouble began when he decided to investigate whether the drug really was a “miracle cure” for the novel coronavirus. In the Amazon city of Manaus, the research group he led had used chloroquine for years as part of its malaria research. As infections overwhelmed hospitals in his city last March, Lacerda decided to put his team’s know-how to work by testing the drug’s ability to fight COVID-19.But the team’s clinical study quickly found that chloroquine was not only ineffective against COVID-19, but high doses of the drug could cause severe heart problems in patients infected with the virus. The results caught global attention, spurring scathing critiques of Trump’s support of chloroquine.But, at home in Brazil, Lacerda’s team saw a different response. He says it started with a tweet by the president’s son, who accused the researchers of being a group of “leftists” who were intentionally killing people with high doses of chloroquine just to demonstrate the drug didn't work. This triggered a wave of attacks on social media by the president’s supporters.“People were saying that they knew where I lived, that I had killed people on purpose, that I would pay for this,” said Lacerda, an infectious disease specialist and a researcher at the Carlos Borborema Institute of Clinical Research in Manaus.Lacerda says he received a slew of attacks and death threats over social media. Concerned for the safety of himself and his family, he was forced to walk around with armed bodyguards for two weeks.“It was one of the worst experiences of my life,” he said. “It was this intense climate of fear.”Triggered by complaints from allies of Bolsonaro, state and federal medical bodies as well as public prosecutors opened investigations into Lacerda’s study. He says he spent the better part of last year defending his research in front of lawyers, instead of carrying out studies in a lab.The attacks on Brazilian researchers echo the United States’ own war on science, which intensified during Trump’s tenure as president. Scientists in the U.S. faced over 150 attacks during Trump’s presidency, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists.“Governments on the radical right—like those we saw in the U.S. and here in Brazil—are not prepared for science to show something that contradicts what they are doing,” Lacerda said. “When a study shows something that you don't agree with, you just take down the scientists.”The assault on science has had a profound impact in Brazil. Scientists say that the attacks they have suffered have derailed research or discouraged some to tackle studies linked to the virus. Others have left the country, pushed out by threats or disillusionment.“The sciences are being persecuted right now,” said Rosa, who has studied the behavior of Bolsonaro supporters on WhatsApp and Telegram. “We’re living in a really dark moment. And this has a direct impact on the research and the quality of scientific output.”Meanwhile, Brazil is still grappling with one of the world’s worst outbreaks, with a death toll second only to the United States. In recent weeks, infections have exploded, fuelled by highly-infectious new variants and weak lockdown restrictions. With doses running out, vaccinations have brought little relief.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

A federal judge in the District of Columbia will hear oral arguments on Tuesday in one of several cases brought by states including Indiana and Oklahoma, along with business owners and individual consumers, who say that the law does not grant the Internal Revenue Service authority to provide tax credits or subsidies to people who buy insurance through the federal exchange.

At the same time, the House Judiciary Committee will convene a hearing to examine whether Mr. Obama is “rewriting his own law” by using his executive powers to alter it or delay certain provisions. The panel also will examine the legal theory behind the subsidy cases: that the I.R.S., and by extension, Mr. Obama, ignored the will of Congress, which explicitly allowed tax credits and subsidies only for those buying coverage through state exchanges.

“We have agencies under this administration having an attitude that they can fix a statute, that they can improve upon a statute, that they can look at a statute’s clear language and disregard it,” Scott Pruitt, the Oklahoma attorney general, who is bringing one of the cases, said in an interview Monday. “The president himself has said on more than one occasion, ‘I can’t wait on Congress.’ In our system of government, he has to.”"

The Las Vegas Sun reports that during an appearance on “Nevada Week In Review, Reid answered, “Yes. Yes. Absolutely, yes,” when asked if “the country would have to have a health care system that abandoned insurance as the means of accessing it.”

The idea of introducing a single-payer national health care system to the United States, or even just a public option, sent lawmakers into a tizzy back in 2009, when Reid was negotiating the health care bill.

“We had a real good run at the public option … don’t think we didn’t have a tremendous number of people who wanted a single-payer system,” Reid said on the PBS program, recalling how then-Sen. Joe Lieberman’s opposition to the idea of a public option made them abandon the notion and start from scratch.

Reid also said that ObamaCare was “a step in the right direction” and that America has to “work our way past” insurance-based health care.

“Single-payer” is a deceptive term that means “socialized medicine.” Insurance companies are put out of business and the government takes over as the sole payer of all health care costs.

This also means that the government decides on how much will be reimbursed for services and which procedures are paid for and which ones are not. These policies frequently result in what is known as health care rationing and “death panels.” If certain procedures are not covered or adequately reimbursed, doctors will not perform them (except for the very rich who can pay out of pocket).

Lousy reimbursements, government red tape, and the lack of flexibility and innovation that comes in a free market tend to drive health care professionals to professions that the government does not exert full control over. Fewer doctors equals health-care rationing and the long waits for vital procedures that are common in countries currently under a single-payer system.

The first services usually axed by death panels staffed with a handful of bureaucrats are the costly and uncertain experimental procedures that sometimes fail many times before leading to a breakthrough, as well as expensive, life-saving operations on the ill, handicapped, and elderly.

Some Democrats, most notably Howard Dean, are already pushing back against the “death panels” that are already a part of ObamaCare.

He says they must be doing it for purely political reasons. That sound you hear is the fire alarm going off in the White House.

Shortly after the Affordable Care Act (ACA, or Obamacare) was signed into law on Mar. 23, 2010, the administration announced that the massive Title VIII of the law–the CLASS Act that would set up a national system of elderly case–would never be implemented, because the Obama administration cannot find any way either to implement the system or to pay for it.

Over the past three years, the Obama administration has been issuing “waivers” for various ACA requirements regarding how much companies must pay out in health care benefits to employees, because many low-wage employers like McDonald’s couldn’t meet those requirements, and would have to cancel all health care benefits for those employees. (It should also be noted that the “waivers” are unlawful, because the ACA imposes that requirement on employers and does not allow the government to waive them.)

A year ago, the Supreme Court struck down as a violation of the Tenth Amendment the mandatory expansion of Medicaid in all 50 states, making it entirely optional. The White House started scrambling when half the states in the nation refused to go along with this unaffordable and unmanageable expansion of government health care.

Also a year ago, the IRS issued a new regulation saying that the massive subsidies that taxpayers would have to pay on health care policies purchased from state-run government exchanges in all 50 states would also apply to policies purchased on an exchange run by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, because it became clear that many states would not participate in that government-run model either. (In fact, 34 states have refused to set up exchanges, and the IRS’s regulation is being challenged in court as illegal.)

Then two weeks ago, the Treasury Department announced that for the first year it is in effect (2014), the IRS would not enforce the Employer Mandate requiring large employers to provide healthcare to employees. The system was ready to implode and deprive millions of Americans of both health care and work hours (forcing many employers to cut hours to 29/week for full-time employees), and the IRS could not develop an effective reporting or enforcement system. (Like the “waivers” above, this too is illegal.)

And just this week, HHS announced that the massive state exchange system may be put off a year as well. It was supposed to start on Oct. 1, 2013, and is having so many severe problems that it too cannot start when the ACA says it must.

Yet with all that, Obama says that the ACA is working great, and those who deny it must have sinister political motives. (Set aside the fact that now some of the ACA’s biggest critics are major unions like AFL-CIO and the Teamsters, normally Obama’s biggest allies and without whose zealous support the ACA would never have passed Congress.)

It’s like George Orwell’s 1984. The government literally could say 2+2=5, and no one would call them on it. If a conservative leader said such things, the media would call for his head. But when a liberal does it, they ignore it. (Or if you’re MSNBC, you applaud his “courage” and might offer him a TV show to anchor.)

If any private citizen said such things, we’d have a one-word label for him: “liar.” But most people in this country rightly show great respect for the institution of the presidency that we don’t use such terms (unless they’re committed liberals and the president happens to be a conservative Republican–in which case you can call him anything you want). Instead, we say he’s “got his facts wrong” or he’s using “fuzzy math,” or some other such softer statement.

So using such a word would be disrespectful, and we won’t do it here. But if the smoke detectors go off at the White House, there’s no need to call the fire department. The smoke is because President Obama’s pants are on fire.

Pollak'],Abortion vs. IRS: Parties Race to Ignite the 2014 Base,"On Wednesday, as Tea Party activists rallied against the IRS and the Senate immigration bill on Capitol Hill, President Barack Obama’s campaign-turned-lobbying arm, Organizing for Action (OfA), emailed a warning about “threats on women’s health” in Congress. It urged its members to sign a petition against a “terrifying” decision the GOP “to stand between a woman and her doctor when it comes to her health care decisions.”

Meanwhile, for the past several weeks, Republicans have sent fundraising pitches to their donors expressing indignation over the IRS scandal, in which the agency targeted conservative groups on the basis of their names and views for additional, and excessive, scrutiny. They are seeking to capitalize on grass-roots outrage–outrage that is often equally directed at Republican leadership–as they ramp up campaign efforts for 2014.

The OfA email about abortion is a re-hash of the 2012 presidential campaign’s “war on women” theme–and is aided, once again, by the mainstream media’s eagerness to focus on conservative gaffes, to the exclusion of mistakes by the president or members of his party. In addition to the abortion issue, Democrats are seizing on controversy over sexual assault in the military to signal to female voters that they are fighting for them.

The abortion issue has, in fact, gained new poignancy–though not in a way that favors the pro-choice side. The trial and conviction of Dr. Kermit Gosnell for the gruesome murders of babies delivered at his abortion clinic was ignored by the mainstream media but inspired pro-life activists to press for legislation limiting abortions past 20 weeks–the bill that inspired the OfA email but which, curiously, it does not describe.

Democrats are clearly worried about a midterm lull–which is why they have not only found it necessary to re-ignite old issues, but to share, selectively, in conservative outrage. As the IRS scandal has unfolded, for example, Democrats have strained to argue that “progressive” and liberal non-profits were also “targeted” by the IRS. Some Democrats have also split openly with the White House over the NSA and Prism scandals.

Meanwhile, Republicans are buoyed by a sense that frustration at the Obama administration scandals will help bring millions of conservative voters back to the polls after many apparently sat out the 2012 contest. The redistricting that followed the 2010 elections will also help ensure the party holds the House. But the race for the Senate has pit the GOP establishment against the base, as have issues like immigration reform.

In that context, the IRS scandal represents a rare point of unity, which is why even those Republicans busily defending the NSA’s surveillance programs against the party’s resurgent libertarian wing are citing the IRS scandal as a legitimate grievance. The full extent of the IRS abuses is unknown, and questions remain about who ordered the targeting, and why. Yet the issue has already become part of the 2014 election lexicon.

Midterm elections typically have lower turnout than presidential elections, which is why the 2014 effort by both sides will be aimed at motivating their party’s base voters. Republicans already have a wide variety of new conservative grievances to harness; Democrats are, thus far, returning to themes that have worked in the past. In the thick of the fight, the actual issues at the core of these debates risk being hijacked or obscured."

(JEWEL SAMAD/AFP/GETTY IMAGES)

The Obama administration has postponed one of the fundamental provisions of the health-care reform law, responding to mounting concerns from business owners who would have been required to start providing health coverage to their employees next year.

On Tuesday evening, Treasury Department officials announced the government would not penalize businesses that fail to provide health insurance next year, delaying what is known as the “employer mandate” component of the law until 2015. Starting then, firms with more than 50 employees will be required to provide at least a minimum level coverage to their workers or pay a steep fine to the federal government.

Officials made the decision to push the requirement back after fielding a flood of complaints from business owners about its implementation.

“We have heard concerns about the complexity of the requirements and the need for more time to implement them effectively,” Mark Mazur, assistant secretary for tax policy, wrote in a blog post announcing the postponement, later adding that the administration plans to use the additional time to “consider ways to simplify the new reporting requirements” for business owners.

The newly delayed mandate has been a major point of contention for small business owners and lobbyists since it was approved as part of the Affordable Care Act in 2010. Many warned that it would cause administrative nightmares for small employers and discourage those near the cutline from expanding beyond 50 workers.

Meanwhile, some firms have started scaling back their payrolls to get underneath the cap.

“Small companies have told us they are confused by the law and are simply finding it difficult to comply with, no matter when it goes into effect,” Rep. Sam Graves, chairman of the House Small Business Committee, said in an email to The Washington Post. “Instead of providing relief for businesses, this simply kicks the can down the road.”

A White House official said the added time would help small business owners adapt to the changes, arguing that the law will still drive down prices for coverage on Main Street.

“This allows employers the time to . . . make any necessary adaptations to their health benefits while staying the course toward making health coverage more affordable and accessible for their workers,” Valerie Jarrett, an adviser to Obama, wrote in a blog post on Tuesday.

This latest delay is the most consequential in a series of setbacks for the president’s signature law, which has shown signs of fragility as the initial deadline for full implementation approaches at the end of the year.

In April, the administration announced it would delay for one year a key cost-cutting feature of the law’s new small business health insurance marketplaces. Initially, the exchanges were supposed to allow employers to choose different plans for different workers; now, for the first year, they must select only one plan from a single carrier for their entire business.

More recently, the Government Accountability Office announced that federal and state officials have fallen well behind schedule setting up the marketplaces, which are scheduled to open for enrollment in October.

“This is simply the latest evidence that implementation of this terrible law is going to be difficult if not impossible, and the burden is going to fall on the people who create American jobs,” Amanda Austin, director of federal public policy at the National Federation of Independent Business, said in a statement.

The NFIB, a small business lobbying group, has pushed back against the health care law since it was making its way through Congress, later spearheading an effort to repeal the legislation that ended at the hands of the Supreme Court. The group has since focused on repealing some of the provisions it considers most detrimental to businesses on Main Street, including the employer mandate and a new tax on insurers.

Instead of delayed, Austin argued the mandate should be eliminated altogether.

“Temporary relief is small consolation,” she said. “We need a permanent fix to this provision to provide long term relief for small employers.”

Jan Brewer, Obamacare Foe","FILE - In this Jan. 10, 2013 photo, Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, R, speaks from her office at the Capitol in Phoenix. Brewer will give the State of the State address on Monday, Jan. 14, 2013. Democrats will be looking for ways to try to influence spending and can point to a $1 billion surplus in the current budget.

Arizona will participate in the expansion of Medicaid, Gov. Jan Brewer said Monday in her State of the State address, making her the third Republican governor to agree to one of the key components of President Barack Obama's health care reform.

Brewer said that if she did not accept the Medicaid funds for Arizona, other states could claim those federal dollars and create jobs that otherwise would be created in Arizona. Fellow Republican governors Susana Martinez of New Mexico and Brian Sandoval of Nevada also plan to expand Medicaid to anyone who earns up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level, which is currently $14,856 for an individual.

But 10 other Republican governors have already decided not to participate. The Supreme Court's 2012 ruling that affirmed Obama's health care law allows states to refuse to take part in the Medicaid expansion.

Although Brewer has been a consistent opponent of Obamacare, she acknowledged Monday that the law is now an unavoidable reality and that Arizona would be worse off turning down the federal dollars that will come with broadening Medicaid.

""Try as we might, the law was upheld by the United States Supreme Court,"" Brewer said. ""The Affordable Care Act is not going anywhere, at least not for the time being.""

The Arizona governor said the federal funding would help pay for some individuals already covered by the state's Medicaid program and provide some protection for the state's rural hospitals.

While Arizona is moving ahead with the expansion of Medicaid, Brewer declined to take part in another key aspect of Obamacare. In November, she notified the Obama administration that Arizona would not establish a state-run health insurance exchange. These exchanges will be the gateways for individuals and small businesses to comparison shop for health benefits and to learn whether they qualify for financial assistance or Medicaid coverage. Arizona is one of 25 states in which the federal government will have to set up the insurance exchange.

In announcing her decision to lawmakers in Phoenix, Brewer emphasized her continued concern that the federal government may cut back on its share of financing the Medicaid expansion and said she would put plans in place to protect the state's budget. Under Obamacare, the federal government will pay the full cost of covering newly eligible individuals from 2014 to 2016, and then will scale back funding to 90 percent by 2022.

""As I weighed this decision, I was troubled that a future president and Congress would reduce matching rates,"" Brewer said. ""Together with my team, I have crafted a plan that addresses both of those concerns and safeguards Arizona.""

Brewer's plan includes what she described as a ""circuit breaker,"" which would automatically shrink the state's Medicaid program in the event that the federal government were to decrease funding.

""I will not allow Obamacare to become a bait and switch,"" she said.

Brewer placed her decision on Medicaid in the context of the main economic development theme of her speech. She told lawmakers that she did not want to forfeit the federal funds to other states that have agreed to expansion, singling out such neighboring states as California and Colorado. She said that the Medicaid expansion, which she described as ""just slightly beyond"" what voters had previously approved, would insert $2 billion into the Arizona economy.

She also promoted Arizona's Medicaid expansion plan as ""the gold standard"" for the nation.

Brewer continued to emphasize her opposition to the Affordable Care Act but told legislators that the state could not oppose the federal government on all aspects of the health care law.

""We cannot wag our finger at the federal government,"" Brewer said, reminding lawmakers of her famous meeting on an airport tarmac with President Obama last year. ""Trust me, I tried that once.""

Arizona House Minority Leader Chad Campbell (D-Phoenix) told The Huffington Post that Democrats are ""encouraged"" by Brewer's decision. He said that the party still plans to look at the details of her Medicaid plan, but that what the governor outlined in her address was a good step for the state.

Brewer and Campbell, a potential 2014 gubernatorial candidate, have had a frosty relationship over the past two years. Noting that the Medicaid expansion was pushed by the state's business community, along with Democrats and moderate Republicans, Campbell said he hopes that the governor is willing to work with them in a ""constructive fashion"" to pass the plan through the GOP-controlled legislature, which has been led by Tea Party loyalists.

""The only people opposed to this is the ideological far right and the Tea Party,"" Campbell said. ""This is about economic development for the state. Rejecting this will destroy the hospital system."""

If there were problems, the president predicted, they would be “glitches.”

And he said, “If you like the plan you have, you can keep it.”

Such claims have come back to haunt the president and his allies less than a month into the launch of the online insurance marketplaces at the heart of his healthcare legislation. With the federal website hobbled by bad design and thousands of policyholders receiving cancellation notices, Obama’s promises are not being met — prompting charges of deception from some Republicans and concessions from some allies that elements of the law were oversold.

The fallout is only the latest chapter in this White House’s three-year struggle to sell the public on the Affordable Care Act, which could come to define the president’s legacy. Since signing it into law, the president has variously defended it, promoted it, simplified it and hyped it. But polling shows he has never fully sold, nor educated, the public on the vast new government healthcare program.

Publicly, the White House continued Tuesday to defend the president’s pre-launch salesmanship.

“The purpose here wasn’t to do anything beyond encourage people to make themselves aware of the options available to them,” White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said.

Behind closed doors, some officials who worked on the rollout say they wish they’d left themselves a little wiggle room. They could have done more to play up ways to sign up other than through the website, such as the call centers, said one official, requesting anonymity to discuss the planning process.

After taking heat from allies for not finding a crisp way to explain the complex law, the White House tried to boil it down to its simplest elements, the official said, and some nuance was inevitably lost.

The first administration official to testify before Congress on the matter apologized Tuesday, saying, “the website has not worked as well as it should.”

“This initial experience has not lived up to our expectations or the expectations of the American people, and it is not acceptable,” Marilyn Tavenner, the head of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, told the House Ways and Means Committee.

Tavenner’s agency oversaw the development of the site, intended to link consumers with affordable private health insurance plans that meet standards outlined in the 2010 law. Tavenner vowed that the site would be running smoothly by the end of November, in time for consumers to enroll before the new year.

But for the first time since the Oct. 1 launch, criticism of the administration moved well beyond the website’s technical troubles. Hundreds of thousands of people who buy insurance on the individual market have received notices that their policies will be canceled or amended — and their premiums on new policies could rise.

The notices are a result of provisions in the law that created new minimum requirements for health insurance coverage sold in the individual market. Under the Affordable Care Act, policies sold or renewed after Jan. 1 must cover maternity care and mental health. They cannot deny coverage because of preexisting conditions, or charge higher premiums based on gender. Plans that don’t meet such standards are grandfathered in — but only if they were bought before the law was signed in March 2010 and have not changed since that time.

For experts, these adjustments were a long-expected outcome of the law’s attempt to regulate a market that some argue offered shoddy coverage and kept premiums low by discriminating against sick people. Roughly 5% of the population — or about 15 million people — buy plans on the individual market.

“It was always expected that once the clock struck midnight on Dec. 31, that the rules of the game in the individual insurance market would change, and that meant that policies sold under the old rules could no longer be offered,” said Larry Levitt, a senior vice president and health policy expert at the Kaiser Family Foundation.

Although experts on the law expected the changes for that slice of Americans, the White House and the president continued to insist otherwise.

In June 2012, the president made that his first point in comments on the Supreme Court’s decision affirming the law. “First, if you’re one of the more than 250 million Americans who already have health insurance, you will keep your health insurance — this law will only make it more secure and more affordable,” he said.

Critics pounced on the comments Tuesday, accusing the White House and administration officials of deceiving the public about the law.

Rep. Aaron Schock (R-Ill.) grilled Tavenner on the issue.

“The whitehouse.gov website says, if you want to keep the health insurance that you’ve got, you can keep it, and now they’re being told they can’t. That’s a lie,” the Illinois Republican said.

The White House noted that the vast majority of insured people, who get insurance through their employer or through Medicare or Medicaid, will not see any changes to their plans. Officials also argued that insurers have some leeway in how and when they alter the plans to meet the new standards. Many are offering new policies and also informing consumers that they may be eligible for subsidies through healthcare.gov.

“They want to keep these people enrolled,” said Robert Zirkelbach, spokesman for America’s Health Insurance Plans, an industry group.

Still, the issue is likely to continue, particularly as the website troubles keep the White House from countering the criticism with signs of successful enrollment on a large scale.

And Democratic allies acknowledged that the president could be more careful with his pitch.

The president’s statement about keeping insurance was “not precise enough,” House Minority Whip Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) told reporters Tuesday.

“I don’t think the message was wrong. I think the message was accurate. It was not precise enough … [it] should have been caveated with ‘assuming you have a policy that in fact does do what the bill is designed to do.’”

Sen. Joe Manchin, a frequent Democratic critic of the law, said the administration’s “don’t worry” mantra has worn thin: “Well, people back in West Virginia are worried now.”

Many have been accusing President Obama of breaking his promise: ""If you like it you can keep it."" The president ill-advisedly decided to ""apologize"" in an interview with MSNBC’s Chuck Todd.

On Thursday the president gave an extensive news conference. Republicans may have been caught flat-footed judging from the less-than-inflammatory rhetoric that followed. Maybe they thought the president would have to resort to legislation that they would be able to politicize and block.

The fix the president has instituted is rather ingenious. More importantly it immediately ensured that Congress, the insurance companies, and the American citizens absorb responsibility for the solution.

The president said, ""Insurers can extend current plans that otherwise would be canceled into 2014 and Americans whose plans have been canceled can choose to re-enroll in the same kind of plan."" He then said, ""This fix won't solve every problem for every person, but it's going to help a lot of people. Doing more would require work with Congress.""

The president’s fix allows insurance companies to extend the cancelled policies even if they do not conform to the Affordable Care Act for one year. The insurance companies cannot enroll new customers into the substandard policies. The insurance companies are also required to inform the purchasers of these substandard policies that they may qualify for federal subsidies only through the exchanges. They must disclose that these policies do not have the consumer protections that all new insurance policies must have. They must also inform them that they may qualify for Medicaid,

President Clinton was the master of triangulation. Unfortunately while he seemed to win at triangulation, the poor and the middle class usually became its victim (e.g., Glass-Steagall, welfare reform, supply side economics). This move by President Obama if allowed to go through is how a masterful triangulation should be effected.

More on the president and the insurance companies below the fold."

Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., and Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., introduced bills permitting insurers to reinstate plans that fall short of the coverage requirement under ObamaCare after insurance companies began sending out millions of cancellation letters, often citing the new health care law as the reason.

House Republicans intend to vote as early as next week on Upton's legislation. Senate Democrats spoke dismissively of the proposals, signaling they have no intention of permitting a vote on the issue that marks the latest challenge confronting supporters of the law.

Upton's legislation permits insurers to sell existing coverage plans that would otherwise be banned under the law, while Landrieu's proposal goes one step further by requiring it.

At the White House, press secretary Jay Carney refused repeatedly to state a position on the proposals, saying he hadn't ""reviewed or seen an examination internally"" on any of them.

Shifting the focus away from what Obama has said repeatedly, Carney said, ""The world back to which many critics want us to go, is a world in which insurers have that power to say that, you know, your relative, who has a pre-existing condition either has no chance of getting coverage or is going to be charged so much that he or she can't afford it.""

Obama pledged in mid-2009: ""If you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor, period"" and ""If you like your health care plan, you'll be able to keep your health care plan, period. No one will take it away, no matter what.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said Democrats had voted unanimously against similar proposals in the past and were having ""foxhole conversions.""

""I think what will be really interesting to see in the Senate is the number of Democrats in very red states who are up in '14 and what they start demanding ... in terms of adjustments to this law,"" he said.

Meanwhile, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius was preparing to return to Capitol Hill on Wednesday for a fresh interrogation on the law, this time from senators with growing concerns about the insurance cancellation notices and the problem-plagued HealthCare.gov website.

Sebelius was due to face questions Wednesday from the Senate Finance Committee, whose chairman, Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., was a chief author of the 2010 law and remains a vocal defender. Yet in a measure of its troubled rollout, even he has concerns about the problem-plagued HealthCare.gov website and the potential security risks it poses for consumers' private information.

""I want it all to work, and security is one factor, one component. It has to be secure,"" Baucus told reporters Tuesday.

At a hearing of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, on Tuesday, Marilyn Tavenner, who runs the agency most directly involved in implementing the health care law, said that nearly 700,000 applications have been submitted at federal and state marketplaces in the law's first month of operation. She said technicians are making improvements that have already made the website faster.

She encouraged consumers to log onto the site and check it out, and said the administration had estimated that enrollments will total 800,000 by the end of November.

At the same time, she repeatedly refused to tell inquiring Republicans how many enrollments have taken place to date, saying that information would be made available at mid-month.

The REAL reason Republicans hate healthcare.gov,"Oh sure, there are plenty of stories circulating now - like Joan's FP post today - about people finally being able to get quality, affordable health insurance because of the Affordable Care Act. But that's only half the story.

After I was successfully enrolled (which by the way only took half an hour for myself, my wife, and my three offspring), I was almost instantly given the news that I qualify for coverage! Yay! followed by a page of other news about the new law. I've been keenly interested so I was already aware of most of that information.

The one exceptional item - the thing that I am convinced has Republicans foaming at the mouth - was buried at the end of that page.

Here's an actual screenshot from my session:

Do you see it? Do you understand why the Republicans have been so anxious to ""kill the bill?"" Pronouncing the website a train wreck, trying to keep people away?

Here, let me make it a little easier to see:

Still can't see it? Let me zoom in real close:

Right there, on that page, is everything the Republicans hate: a program designed to help people of modest means, run by the government - AND giving those same people an opportunity to exercise their franchise.

If there really was a left-wing conspiracy funded by George Soros, I'd put in an expense request to get the list of people who had created an account on healthcare.gov, and around October 1, 2014 I'd mail them each a postcard with a very simple message:

You know that health plan that you signed up for last year? Democrats made that happen. Not a single Republican voted for it. In fact Republicans did everything they could to keep it from happening. Remember that when you vote.

Demonstrating that government(when the right people are in charge) - and then telling the people that same government just helped that they can do something togovernment working? No wonder the Republicans are in a frenzy.

UPDATE 1:51pm EST (scoop won't let me use the update feature)

Reclist? thanks everyone! (first time)

As a follow-up - as noted in the comments, just because people can register to vote does not necessarily mean they will exercise that right - either by habit, or because of obstacles Republicans are trying to put in the way. In either case, the answer is the same: stay engaged. Don't agonize, organize!

UPDATE 2 10:00am 11-Dec-2013 (scoop apparently doesn't like my Chrome installation, either)

First, let me apologize for leaving out the VA/Tricare option from the poll. ""Tricare for all"" would be an excellent improvement to our health care delivery system.

Several commenters noted that the ACA would be saving their families a lot of money starting next year. Others pointed out that due to the increased competition, their employer-sponsored plans were going to be MUCH cheaper, saving the company and employees thousands of dollars.

By coincidence (and I don't believe in coincidence), I got an email this morning from Families USA, an advocacy group that has been pushing for better healthcare for all Americans. They have set up a website and a Facebook campaign to make it easier to share these kinds of success stories. So if you have one to tell, please do!

The vote was 261 to 157, with 39 Democrats bucking their party leadership and the White House to vote in favor of the bill. Hours after the vote, Mr. Obama and top aides met for over an hour with insurance executives after industry leaders complained Thursday that they had been blindsided by a White House reversal on canceled policies. The president described the meeting as a “brainstorming” session about how to ensure changes to the health care law go smoothly.

The insurance representatives, from more than a dozen companies, said they would work with the administration to protect the financial viability of the new marketplaces, but did not say how. Afterward, Karen Ignagni, the president of America’s Health Insurance Plans, a trade group, said it was a “very productive” meeting, but would not go into detail.

The legislation approved by the House would go further than the fix announced on Thursday by Mr. Obama, who said he would temporarily waive some requirements of the law and allow insurers to renew “current policies for current enrollees” for a year."

In some ways, the delays that persisted Wednesday were good news for President Barack Obama and supporters of his signature domestic policy achievement because the holdups showed what appeared to be exceptionally high interest in the overhauled insurance system. But if the glitches aren't fixed quickly, they could dampen enthusiasm for the law at the same time Republicans are using it as a rallying cry to keep most of the federal government closed.

""It was worse today than it was yesterday,"" Denise Rathman of Des Moines said after she tried for a second day to log onto the Iowa site.

Rathman has insurance through Dec. 31 but said she is eager to sign up for a policy because of her psoriatic arthritis, which has caused her to be denied insurance in the past.

David Berge, a pastor with two young children in Shoreview, Minn., tried unsuccessfully at least 10 times to create an online account on the state-run site MNsure. His high-deductible plan expires at the end of the year.

""I'm anxious to see what the insurance is going to look like for my family at the beginning of the year,"" Berge said. ""That's a big unknown right now. I want to figure that out as soon as possible so we can begin planning.""

In California, home to 15 percent of the nation's uninsured, officials pulled the enrollment portion of the Covered California site down overnight for emergency upgrades. It was restored midmorning Wednesday, and 7,770 people had started applications by then, spokesman Roy Kennedy said.

California is one of a handful of mostly Democratic states that opted to set up their own exchanges rather than let the federal government do it for them. In the 36 states being operated by the federal Department of Health and Human Services, consumer patience was still being tested.

Story continues

Agency spokeswoman Joanne Peters said many Americans successfully enrolled on the first day, but she declined to put a number on it. She said the delays were due to ""overwhelming interest"" and high volume.

It's not as if nobody warned them. Just three months ago, the congressional Government Accountability Office said a smooth and timely rollout could not be guaranteed because the online system was still getting finishing touches and had not been fully tested.

The Obama administration shrugged off the evaluation.

The bumpy debut has the hallmarks of a technology project that may have rushed to meet the Oct. 1 deadline, said Bill Curtis, chief scientist at CAST, a software quality analysis firm, and director of the Consortium for IT Software Quality, which develops standards.

""When you are in a rush, you typically make a lot of mistakes and you don't have time to test them all out,"" he said.

High volume can also expose software flaws that were not detected in testing, Curtis said, like the recurring problem consumers encountered trying to set up accounts on the federal site. Drop-down menus that were supposed to provide security questions did not work.

The department issued survival tips for aggravated consumers after 4.7 million unique visitors logged in to the healthcare.gov website on Tuesday. As new health insurance markets went live around the country, the federal call center also received 190,000 calls.

In suburban Cleveland, Sharon Schorr finally gave up on the federal exchange website after eight hours of failed clicks.

""It almost reminded me of going online and trying to buy Springsteen tickets,"" said Schorr, a self-employed accountant who works for her husband's recruiting firm in Orange, Ohio.

Others simply resorted to old-fashioned pen and paper.

Luis Veloz, a college student in Dallas, was so eager to have insurance that he had already mailed in a paper application by Tuesday night. He is hoping to avoid racking up major bills like his parents, who incurred $250,000 in debt when his father had a heart attack.

""It's an exciting moment because my family has never had preventative care,"" Veloz said.

Workers at the Florida Association of Community Health Centers printed out applications ahead of time.

""We don't care about the politics. This is about people so we were trying to make it easy for the patients,"" President and CEO Andy Behrman said.

Connecticut Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, a Democrat, said the law also known as Obamacare was working well because his state embraced the health reform law early on instead of fighting it. The state processed 373 applications for coverage by the end of Wednesday.

""Because we took the time and effort to be ready, to handle the calls, to have our ducks in a row if you will, we are in far better shape than those states and governors that have turned their back on this historic program and historic offering,"" Malloy said.

The Obama administration hopes to sign up 7 million people during the first year. Using an expansion of Medicaid or government-subsidized plans, the White House would eventually like to cover at least half of the nearly 50 million Americans who are uninsured.

Many states expect people to sign up closer to the Dec. 15 deadline to enroll for coverage starting Jan. 1. Most customers will need to pay the first month's premium when they do, which could lead them to put off choosing, said Bob Dickes, director of sales and marketing for the nonprofit insurer Oregon's Health CO-OP.

""I expect people to shop and see what's out there,"" Dickes said.

Customers have until the end of March to sign up to avoid tax penalties.

Under the law, health insurance companies can no longer deny coverage to someone with a pre-existing medical condition and cannot impose lifetime caps on coverage. They also must cover a list of essential services, ranging from mental health treatment to maternity care.

The Texas megachurch is linked to at least 21 cases of measles and has been trying to contain the outbreak by hosting vaccination clinics, officials said. LM Otero / AP

An outbreak of measles among unimmunized members of a Texas megachurch is fueling new health worries about pockets of vaccine-wary parents -- just as more than 50 million public school kids head back to class across the nation.

More possible measles cases are being reviewed in Tarrant County, Texas, where at least 21 people have been sickened this month at the Eagle Mountain International Church, whose ministers have been critical of vaccination. Local officials say several more cases of infections with fever and rash have been reported, but not confirmed.

“It’s concerning. It’s something we jump on,” said Russell Jones, a Texas state epidemiologist who’s been tracking the situation. “It could get into the schools.”

Public health officials say that the northeast Texas outbreak is just the latest in a small but growing number of places -- think San Diego, Calif., Boone and Hamilton counties, Ind., and, most recently, Brooklyn, N.Y. -- where vaccine resistance has sickened children and put the wider community at risk for potentially deadly infectious diseases.

“The rate of change has sort of accelerated,” said Dr. Saad Omer, an infectious disease epidemiologist at Emory University in Atlanta who studies clusters of vaccine exemptions in public schools.

“Tarrant County was not on my radar,” he added.

He’s more familiar with places such as Marin County, Calif., where rates of new kindergarteners excused from mandatory shots nearly doubled from 4.2 percent in 2005 to 7.8 percent at the start of last year, county figures show. There, at the small New Village School in Sausalito, 74 percent of entering kindergarteners said no to vaccinations.

“Like-minded people end up creating pockets of non-vaccinated or under-vaccinated communities,” explained Dr. Ari Brown, an Austin, Texas, pediatrician and spokeswoman for the American Academy of Pediatrics. “They kind of seek each other out because they have similar philosophies.”

But vaccine critics say that distrust of the drugs -- and of the public health community that pushes them -- is behind rising rates of vaccine rejection across the country.

“These are pharmaceutical products that carry a risk of death or injury that can vary according to the individuals,” said Barbara Loe Fisher, co-founder and president of the National Vaccine Information Center in Vienna, Va.

Critics object to vaccines because of fears about safety, worries about the effects of injecting young children with dozens of doses of vaccines by age 6 and worries about possible links with other diseases, including autism, a theory that has been repeatedly debunked.

Public health officials, however, say there’s no question that the risk of vaccination is far outweighed by the benefit of immunization. Risks of vaccine side effects or failure are possible but rare, and they’re much lower than the risks associated with disease, said Omer.

In the decade before the measles vaccine was introduced in 1963, between 3 million and 4 million people in the U.S. were infected each year, 48,000 were hospitalized and 400 to 500 died. Another 1,000 developed chronic disabilities, CDC says.

Domestic cases of the disease were considered eradicated in 2000, but outbreaks continue because of imported infections brought back by travelers from areas where measles remains common.

The Texas megachurch outbreak was sparked by a non-vaccinated visitor who was infected in Indonesia and then returned to expose unvaccinated church members, staffers -- and children in a day care center. In the wider community, more than 98 percent of kids are immunized and less than 1 percent are exempt, county officials say. But the congregation of unvaccinated people allowed the disease to catch hold.

“When you hang out with other people who don’t vaccinate, you’re hanging out in the wrong herd,” said Brown, a reference to herd immunity, the necessary level of protection that keeps a disease from spreading within a community.

Church leaders, including Kenneth Copeland and his daughter, Terri Pearsons, senior pastor at Eagle Mountain, have advocated faith-healing and questioned vaccines in the past. After the outbreak began in mid-August, Pearsons has urged church members to get vaccinated and held immunization clinics.

When more than 10 percent of a certain community opts out of vaccinations, it leaves others at risk, particularly those too vulnerable for immunization, or those for whom a vaccine doesn’t work or wears off.

For some diseases, such as mumps, herd immunity can drop to as low as about 75 percent and still offer wider protection. But other diseases, such as the highly contagious measles or pertussis, known as whooping cough, require collective immunity of up to 94 percent to keep everyone safe, according to the CDC.

To be clear, the vast majority of U.S. parents do vaccinate their kids, latest federal health statistics show. Nationwide, only about 1.8 percent of the more than 4.2 million kindergarteners who entered public school last fall were exempted from laws that require that they get shots to protect against what once were the deadliest diseases of childhood: measles, mumps, rubella, polio. (Homeschooled children aren’t included in the count.)

But exemption rates also vary widely among states, from 0.6 percent in Alabama to 4 percent in Alaska and Colorado and 6.4 percent in Oregon, which leads the nation, CDC figures show.

Rates are highest in the 20 states that allow for exemptions based not only on medical and religious grounds, but also on “personal beliefs.” And within those states they can vary even more. In Oregon, at least four counties have double-digit exemption rates ranging from 12.6 percent in Curry County to 15.2 percent in Wallowa County.

In states where it has been easy to obtain exemptions -- with a simple signature, for instance -- rates of exemption have risen sharply, according to a 2012 study by Omer and colleagues. Between 2005 and 2011, the non-medical exemption rate in 13 “easy” states rose to 3.3 percent, an average annual increase of 13 percent, he found.

Some states are trying to change that trend, making it more difficult to obtain exemptions. In Washington state, where kindergarten exemption rates peaked at 7.6 percent in 2008, public health officials changed the school paperwork two years ago, separating the vaccine record from the exemption form, said Dr. Ed Marcuse, a professor of pediatrics and epidemiology at the University of Washington.

“At the same time we did that, we changed the law. In order to be exempt, you had to be counseled about vaccine-preventable diseases,” he said. The child's physician has to sign a form proving that the counseling took place.

The point was not to ""simply put in hassles,” Marcuse said, pointing out that some states require notarization of exemption forms. “We wanted very much to be certain that parents made as thoughtful and well-informed a decision as possible.""

The effort appears to be paying off. Kindergarten exemption rates fell from 6.2 percent in 2010 to 4.6 percent in 2012 after the initiative, state records show. Now, Oregon and California have passed similar laws bolstering requirements for exemption.

The goal, Marcuse said, is to enact policies that balance the inherent conflict in the vaccine debate between private choice and public good.

“It’s not so simple as ‘Let’s wipe out these pockets of resistance,'” said Marcuse. “Let’s help people make decisions that are both in their personal interest and in the interest of the community.”

SERGIO LIMAWhen funding for Dr. Pedro Hallal’s COVID-19 study was abruptly slashed, deaths from the virus had just surged to grim new peaks in Brazil.The reason? Hallal says the government simply didn’t like what his study was unveiling: that indigenous people are five times as likely to get infected with COVID-19 than other ethnic groups in Brazil. His findings came amid a surge in invasions of indigenous lands by soy farmers, cattle ranchers, and illegal miners egged on by friendly signals from Brazil’s denialist President Jair Bolsonaro.“I’m absolutely certain it was meant to shut me up,” said Hallal, an epidemiologist and professor at the Federal University of Pelotas, told The Daily Beast. “The study was showing results that they didn't want it to show.”Hallal, whose COVID research funding was cut last year, is not alone. Dozens of researchers studying the virus say they have been targeted by fans and allies of Bolsonaro, who has long styled himself as a Trump-like populist opposed to science, mainstream media, and the “corrupt” liberal elite.How Bolsonaro Seized Trump’s Crown as the World’s Worst COVID LeaderResearchers in Brazil claim they have suffered through relentless social media attacks, death threats, funding cuts, and arbitrary investigations over the past year as they seek to better understand the virus ravaging the country. They say these attacks are a thinly-veiled attempt at muzzling them and suppressing their work.Bolsonaro has downplayed the virus as a “fantasy” and “little flu,” railed against lockdowns and—until recently—rejected vaccines. “Brazilians need to be studied. They don’t catch anything. You see the guy jumping in the sewer, diving in. And nothing happens to him,” the president said of the virus last year.Even though COVID has killed 398,000 people in Brazil, the president and his allies have repeatedly questioned its toll and accused governors and mayors of inflating the number of deaths in order to weaken the president politically.“There is this conservative base that casts itself as the opposition to science,” said Pablo Ornelas Rosa, a professor at the University of Vila Velha in Espírito Santo. “If you are pro-science and pro-facts, you are labelled as a leftist, as a communist, as an enemy to the president.”“The health minister freaked out,” recalled Hallal, who was coordinating the study—Brazil’s largest epidemiological analysis of the virus and its spread across the country. The scientist maintains that at a press conference organized to unveil its latest findings, the ministry barred the release of data about the heightened risks to indigenous people. Hallal says he was never told why officials took issue with the findings.A few weeks later, the study—commissioned by a prior health minister who was fired last April after clashing with Bolsonaro—lost its federal funding. Soon, Hallal was being investigated by the federal auditing body after criticizing Bolsonaro in a livestream and his allies were being sidelined in university elections.On social media, the vicious attacks on the scientist poured in, including from Bolsonaro himself. Hallal told The Daily Beast that supporters of the president made threatening phone calls to him and even photographed him on the street with his family.“It was direct persecution, triggered by my stance on the pandemic,” he said. “Instead of correcting its errors, the government attacked those who were uncovering its mistakes.”Attacks have been particularly harsh against those questioning Bolsonaro’s stance on chloroquine, an antimalarial that he—along with Donald Trump—embraced as a “miracle cure” despite no evidence it could combat COVID-19. Bolsonaro quickly got behind the drug and ordered the army to sharply scale up national production. When the president got COVID himself, he took the drug over livestream and boasted that he was improving rapidly.Dr. Marcus Lacerda’s trouble began when he decided to investigate whether the drug really was a “miracle cure” for the novel coronavirus. In the Amazon city of Manaus, the research group he led had used chloroquine for years as part of its malaria research. As infections overwhelmed hospitals in his city last March, Lacerda decided to put his team’s know-how to work by testing the drug’s ability to fight COVID-19.But the team’s clinical study quickly found that chloroquine was not only ineffective against COVID-19, but high doses of the drug could cause severe heart problems in patients infected with the virus. The results caught global attention, spurring scathing critiques of Trump’s support of chloroquine.But, at home in Brazil, Lacerda’s team saw a different response. He says it started with a tweet by the president’s son, who accused the researchers of being a group of “leftists” who were intentionally killing people with high doses of chloroquine just to demonstrate the drug didn't work. This triggered a wave of attacks on social media by the president’s supporters.“People were saying that they knew where I lived, that I had killed people on purpose, that I would pay for this,” said Lacerda, an infectious disease specialist and a researcher at the Carlos Borborema Institute of Clinical Research in Manaus.Lacerda says he received a slew of attacks and death threats over social media. Concerned for the safety of himself and his family, he was forced to walk around with armed bodyguards for two weeks.“It was one of the worst experiences of my life,” he said. “It was this intense climate of fear.”Triggered by complaints from allies of Bolsonaro, state and federal medical bodies as well as public prosecutors opened investigations into Lacerda’s study. He says he spent the better part of last year defending his research in front of lawyers, instead of carrying out studies in a lab.The attacks on Brazilian researchers echo the United States’ own war on science, which intensified during Trump’s tenure as president. Scientists in the U.S. faced over 150 attacks during Trump’s presidency, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists.“Governments on the radical right—like those we saw in the U.S. and here in Brazil—are not prepared for science to show something that contradicts what they are doing,” Lacerda said. “When a study shows something that you don't agree with, you just take down the scientists.”The assault on science has had a profound impact in Brazil. Scientists say that the attacks they have suffered have derailed research or discouraged some to tackle studies linked to the virus. Others have left the country, pushed out by threats or disillusionment.“The sciences are being persecuted right now,” said Rosa, who has studied the behavior of Bolsonaro supporters on WhatsApp and Telegram. “We’re living in a really dark moment. And this has a direct impact on the research and the quality of scientific output.”Meanwhile, Brazil is still grappling with one of the world’s worst outbreaks, with a death toll second only to the United States. In recent weeks, infections have exploded, fuelled by highly-infectious new variants and weak lockdown restrictions. With doses running out, vaccinations have brought little relief.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/05/obamacare-enrollment_n_4384820.html,2013-12-05 00:00:00,['Senior Reporter'],Nasty Surprise May Await People Who Thought They Enrolled In Obamacare,"Unresolved technical problems on HealthCare.gov could lead to a rude surprise at the doctor's office next month for patients who think they successfully used the website to sign up for health insurance. They may find they're not insured after all.

HealthCare.gov, the federal online portal for health-insurance shopping in more than 30 states, has improved after more than a month of intense fixes, and enrollment is accelerating. But insurance companies are still getting information on their would-be customers that is garbled and incomplete, and in some cases they are getting no information at all. President Barack Obama's administration is scrambling to repair the faulty system, but scant time remains until the Dec. 23 deadline for consumers to choose a health plan that will be in place Jan. 1.

The result could be an untold number of consumers remaining uninsured despite completing the enrollment process -- another embarrassing chapter in the rollout of the Affordable Care Act, Obama's signature health care reform law.

The Obama administration insists the enrollment glitches will be fixed in time to prevent any troubles next month, but won't disclose the extent of the problem. Nor will it guarantee that any patients who fall victim to these problems won't be exposed to medical bills if they get sick or injured.

""I doubt very seriously the insurance company or the government is going to say, 'Oh, don't worry, We'll take care of it.' I think that's going to fall solely on the patient,"" said Reid Blackwelder, a doctor in Kingsport, Tenn., who is president of the American Academy of Family Physicians. ""I wouldn't count on anybody else jumping in and bailing everybody out.""

In an unusual joint press release on Wednesday, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the largest national trade groups for insurers, America's Health Insurance Plans and the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, emphasized their collaboration in addressing the problem. “Ensuring that all Americans who need coverage are properly enrolled is a top priority for all of us. We are working together closely to resolve back-end issues between health plans and HealthCare.gov,"" the statement said. ""We will report on our progress.”

Insurance companies could smooth over difficulties during the first month of new coverage by paying the expenses of people who believed they were enrolled. But that would subject the companies to potentially big costs for patients who get expensive services without having yet paid a premium, or who may not be their customers at all.

Moreover, insurers may be reluctant to bear the brunt of another technical failure after having already shouldered responsibility for fixing other Obamacare problems.

""You'd be counting on the goodwill of the insurance company. I'm not sure how long that's going to last,"" said Leslie Norwalk, who was a senior official at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under President George W. Bush and is now strategic counsel at Epstein Becker Green in Washington.

Patients who show up at a doctor's office, hospital, pharmacy or elsewhere without insurance cards in hand will have to rely on the kindness of those providers, Timothy Jost, a professor at Washington & Lee University School of Law in Lexington, Va., wrote in an email.

""It is likely that there will be problems, probably a lot of them, with confirming coverage, but providers are used to dealing with insurer screw-ups and hopefully will be patient,"" Jost wrote.

HealthCare.gov users who go through the enrollment process to the end are prompted to connect with their new health insurance provider to make payments, which are due Dec. 31 for coverage that begins in January. Consumers who don't take action or believe they can wait for a bill from their insurance company could find themselves in the lurch next month, especially if the company has no record of their enrollment because of the technical problems.

The White House says it is incumbent on individuals to double-check that they have coverage.

""If consumers are not sure if they are enrolled, they should call our customer call center or the insurer of their choice so that they can be sure they’re covered by Jan. 1,"" White House press secretary Jay Carney said Monday. The administration is reaching out by telephone and email to consumers who have begun or submitted applications via HealthCare.gov, in order to advise them of the steps they must take to confirm their enrollments.

Insurance companies receive daily uploads of data about new enrollees. Despite progress since Obamacare marketplaces launched on Oct. 1, as many as one-third of enrollments submitted through the federal system contain errors, The Washington Post reported on Monday.

The administration says that error rate isn't accurate, but won't reveal how many of the submissions -- called 834 forms -- are incorrect. The White House maintains that most of the problems have already been fixed and that the rest will be resolved in time to prevent hardships next month.

The George W. Bush administration faced a similar dilemma in January 2006, when the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit launched. Enrollees across the country visited drugstores only to find their benefits weren't in place.

""That was a point of crisis because every one of those became a story,"" said Michael Leavitt, who was Bush's secretary of Health and Human Services at the time.

A frenzied effort to guarantee patients' access to medications followed, while the Bush administration worked to correct the technical bugs, said Leavitt, now chairman of Salt Lake City-based Leavitt Partners, a consulting firm that has advised states on ACA implementation. ""It became our problem with the system, not the consumer's problem,"" Leavitt said.

The Obama administration likewise needs to protect patients, Leavitt said.

""The federal government caused this, and they're the ones who are going to have to take responsibility for it,"" he said. ""There's an obligation to make certain that people have not been seriously disadvantaged in their health by this.""

Unlike during the Medicare Part D snafu, the Obama administration has no funding stream to tap to pay for medical expenses incurred by patients who encounter problems. Nevertheless, Leavitt predicted his successor, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, would take unilateral action to avoid a backlash, as the administration has on previous occasions.

""The secretary of health does not lack authority in this situation,"" he said. ""I can't tell you the exact authority with which she would act, but you just look at the number of things they've already deferred and the way they've found flexibility, they're going find the authority.""

SERGIO LIMAWhen funding for Dr. Pedro Hallal’s COVID-19 study was abruptly slashed, deaths from the virus had just surged to grim new peaks in Brazil.The reason? Hallal says the government simply didn’t like what his study was unveiling: that indigenous people are five times as likely to get infected with COVID-19 than other ethnic groups in Brazil. His findings came amid a surge in invasions of indigenous lands by soy farmers, cattle ranchers, and illegal miners egged on by friendly signals from Brazil’s denialist President Jair Bolsonaro.“I’m absolutely certain it was meant to shut me up,” said Hallal, an epidemiologist and professor at the Federal University of Pelotas, told The Daily Beast. “The study was showing results that they didn't want it to show.”Hallal, whose COVID research funding was cut last year, is not alone. Dozens of researchers studying the virus say they have been targeted by fans and allies of Bolsonaro, who has long styled himself as a Trump-like populist opposed to science, mainstream media, and the “corrupt” liberal elite.How Bolsonaro Seized Trump’s Crown as the World’s Worst COVID LeaderResearchers in Brazil claim they have suffered through relentless social media attacks, death threats, funding cuts, and arbitrary investigations over the past year as they seek to better understand the virus ravaging the country. They say these attacks are a thinly-veiled attempt at muzzling them and suppressing their work.Bolsonaro has downplayed the virus as a “fantasy” and “little flu,” railed against lockdowns and—until recently—rejected vaccines. “Brazilians need to be studied. They don’t catch anything. You see the guy jumping in the sewer, diving in. And nothing happens to him,” the president said of the virus last year.Even though COVID has killed 398,000 people in Brazil, the president and his allies have repeatedly questioned its toll and accused governors and mayors of inflating the number of deaths in order to weaken the president politically.“There is this conservative base that casts itself as the opposition to science,” said Pablo Ornelas Rosa, a professor at the University of Vila Velha in Espírito Santo. “If you are pro-science and pro-facts, you are labelled as a leftist, as a communist, as an enemy to the president.”“The health minister freaked out,” recalled Hallal, who was coordinating the study—Brazil’s largest epidemiological analysis of the virus and its spread across the country. The scientist maintains that at a press conference organized to unveil its latest findings, the ministry barred the release of data about the heightened risks to indigenous people. Hallal says he was never told why officials took issue with the findings.A few weeks later, the study—commissioned by a prior health minister who was fired last April after clashing with Bolsonaro—lost its federal funding. Soon, Hallal was being investigated by the federal auditing body after criticizing Bolsonaro in a livestream and his allies were being sidelined in university elections.On social media, the vicious attacks on the scientist poured in, including from Bolsonaro himself. Hallal told The Daily Beast that supporters of the president made threatening phone calls to him and even photographed him on the street with his family.“It was direct persecution, triggered by my stance on the pandemic,” he said. “Instead of correcting its errors, the government attacked those who were uncovering its mistakes.”Attacks have been particularly harsh against those questioning Bolsonaro’s stance on chloroquine, an antimalarial that he—along with Donald Trump—embraced as a “miracle cure” despite no evidence it could combat COVID-19. Bolsonaro quickly got behind the drug and ordered the army to sharply scale up national production. When the president got COVID himself, he took the drug over livestream and boasted that he was improving rapidly.Dr. Marcus Lacerda’s trouble began when he decided to investigate whether the drug really was a “miracle cure” for the novel coronavirus. In the Amazon city of Manaus, the research group he led had used chloroquine for years as part of its malaria research. As infections overwhelmed hospitals in his city last March, Lacerda decided to put his team’s know-how to work by testing the drug’s ability to fight COVID-19.But the team’s clinical study quickly found that chloroquine was not only ineffective against COVID-19, but high doses of the drug could cause severe heart problems in patients infected with the virus.

This triggered a wave of attacks on social media by the president’s supporters.“People were saying that they knew where I lived, that I had killed people on purpose, that I would pay for this,” said Lacerda, an infectious disease specialist and a researcher at the Carlos Borborema Institute of Clinical Research in Manaus.Lacerda says he received a slew of attacks and death threats over social media. Concerned for the safety of himself and his family, he was forced to walk around with armed bodyguards for two weeks.“It was one of the worst experiences of my life,” he said. “It was this intense climate of fear.”Triggered by complaints from allies of Bolsonaro, state and federal medical bodies as well as public prosecutors opened investigations into Lacerda’s study. He says he spent the better part of last year defending his research in front of lawyers, instead of carrying out studies in a lab.The attacks on Brazilian researchers echo the United States’ own war on science, which intensified during Trump’s tenure as president. Scientists in the U.S. faced over 150 attacks during Trump’s presidency, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists.“Governments on the radical right—like those we saw in the U.S. and here in Brazil—are not prepared for science to show something that contradicts what they are doing,” Lacerda said. “When a study shows something that you don't agree with, you just take down the scientists.”The assault on science has had a profound impact in Brazil.

But this begs some big questions: Can he pull it off? And, what does it mean for you?

Here’s what you need to know about the roll-back of private insurance cancellations and the new state of Obamacare:

First off, can President Obama really do this?

It seems he can. It’s not that he’s changed anything in the law. It’s more a case of saying his government won’t enforce it, kind of like what his administration did when it gave employers an extra year to provide health insurance for workers last July.

What Obama's decision does do is kick the cancellation decision back to state insurance commissioners and the insurance companies themselves. “It was a blame-shifting exercise,” says Dr. Scott Gottleib, a health policy expert at the American Enterprise Institute.



Can I get my policy back if it was canceled?

That’s complicated. It’s not so easy for an insurance company to reinstate policies it was planning to discontinue, because the firm must plan premiums and budget for expenses far in advance. Florida Blue said it would reinstate canceled plans, and Florida’s insurance commissioner, Kevin McCarty, said he’s working with any companies that wanted to go that route. A lot is up to state insurance commissioners — something that gives cover to both the White House and to the insurance companies.

Obama said most people won’t want to, anyway, and he urged anyone who’s had an individual policy canceled to look at what’s available at HealthCare.gov before looking to reinstate the old policy.

What if everyone who got canceled decides to ask for their old policies back? Will this mess everything up?

Insurers and actuaries — the people who calculate insurance risk — think it could. “The NAIC (National Association of Insurance Commissioners) has been clear from the beginning that allowing insurers to have different rules for different policies would be detrimental to the overall market and result in higher premiums,” says Louisiana's insurance commissioner, Jim Donelon, president of the NAIC.

“This decision continues different rules for different policies and threatens to undermine the new market, and may lead to higher premiums and market disruptions in 2014 and beyond.”

And the American Academy of Actuaries said in a letter sent to Congress that the decision could mess up what are called risk pools — basically, the idea that you need healthy people in any group of insurance policies to pay premiums and offset the costs of sick people.

They said people who have lower medical costs would want to stay in bare-bones plans that are being canceled by insurance companies, because they have lower premiums than the new plans that are required to cover more.



But Gottlieb says this isn’t necessarily true. He thinks some sick people who use a lot of different providers and therefore want to be able to choose from extensive networks of doctors will be the ones most likely to want to keep their old plans. “The Obamacare plans, they constrain the network,” he says. “Most Americans are willing to give up benefits for a wider network.”

If there's a mix of sick and well people choosing to reinstate plans, the effects might be negligible.

Will my premiums go up?

Not this year for policies already issued. Rates have already been set for 2014. They could go up in 2015.

So will this decision mess up the whole Affordable Care Act?

Almost certainly not.



Ceci Connolly, managing director of PwC's Health Research Institute, says it’s all very confusing but notes that Obama’s decision really doesn’t affect a large majority of Americans. “We are talking about a small universe of people,” she says. Only about 11 million people have policies on the individual market, she says, adding: “They typically turn over. They are not the same 11 million from year to year.""

It does mean there will be a few unpleasant weeks for the health-care industry and for government. “Between now and December 15, an awful lot has to happen,“ she says. “Not only fixing a website but now many more people trying to decipher complicated decisions and insurance companies having to make a decision that is going to impact their business in a very short period of time. I don’t know that it’s going to be a very happy Thanksgiving for people working on health care.”

Oh, yeah, what about that website? Am I ever going to be able to get on?

Remember, if you already have insurance — and 85 percent of Americans do — you don’t have to worry about any of this. The HealthCare.Gov website was set up to help people who don’t have insurance, either through an employer, Medicare or Medicaid or federal government benefits.

But if you have been waiting to get on, the Health and Human Services Department says keep trying.

And you may have to try more than once, even now, after six weeks of repair work.

“I think it is not possible for me to guarantee that 100 percent of the people 100 percent of the time going on this website will have a perfectly seamless, smooth experience,” Obama said this week. “We’re going to have to continue to improve it even after November 30th, December 1st. But the majority of people who use it will be able to see it operate the way it was supposed to.”

Can't I just call one of the call centers or file a paper application with one of those trained experts?

You can, but your application still has to go through the website at some point, even if you're not the one sitting there pushing the buttons.

Wearing T-shirts that said “Survivors of the Abortion Holocaust,” they demanded that the museum include an exhibit on what they called the “American genocide” of legal abortion, and fanned out to scatter cards with pictures of bloody “late-term abortion victims.”

They then moved outside to picket with a banner calling Albuquerque “America’s Auschwitz.”

Albuquerque has become the latest flash point in the abortion wars, with Operation Rescue, the militant group based in Kansas, calling it the “late-term abortion capital of the country.” This is because a private clinic, Southwestern Women’s Options, is one of only a few nationwide that offers abortions after the sixth month of pregnancy.

A pitched political battle is now under way. After failed attempts in the Democratic-controlled Legislature, abortion opponents have collected enough signatures to hold a referendum over whether to make Albuquerque the first city in the country to ban abortions at 20 weeks after conception, just as a dozen states have done."

He said he saw the hit job Sean Hannity did where he paraded 3 families into his studio. It turned out Obamacare would save two families almost 60% on their insurance and had no effect on the other.

He then discussed NBC’s David Gregory’s incompetence. Mitt Romney told Gregory that each state should craft policies to ensure all citizens are insured and pre-existing conditions are covered. That is exactly what Obamacare does. Gregory did not respond with that fact.

GOPAC’s David Avella saw the media coverage from the GOP’s alternate state of reality. In his mind the media did not report the millions of Americans being hurt by Obamacare. In his mind insurance rates are doubling and tripling. These statements of course are provably false.

Avella also complained about a middle aged man having to have a policy that includes maternity care. Anthony Weiner came back forcefully to illustrate the stupidity of his position. Anthony Weiner reminded him that people buy cars with hooks for baby carriers even though most would not use it. He said, “We do all kinds of things to make things better for all consumers that not every consumer gets.”

Anthony Weiner reminded Avella that currently every one with insurance pays for the uninsured right now in an inefficient manner, emergency rooms. He then reminded Avella that the private health insurance market is the substance of Obamacare. “That’s your idea”, he said.

Anthony Weiner is a very good debater. He is good at making his point very expressively. It is a shame he could not convert that very well read rhetoric into substantive action during his time in the House Of Representatives.

USATODAY

My physicians talked about three key areas. One%2C more government control of our lives.

Another was higher costs for well off to pay for the less-well off.

And the orchestrated rationing of health care.

I've been biting my tongue on the subject for months, but since President Obama has invited all kinds of people, from bartenders to radio talk-show hosts, to spread the word about Obamacare, I'd like to join the chorus.

He was speaking at a ""youth summit,"" so maybe I'm presumptuous. I don't have a radio audience and can't host a bar-room happy hour — and I will definitely sound a little off-key. But while the president, in a disingenuous attempt at ""rebranding"" Obamacare, wants people to put lipstick on a pig, I'd prefer to talk about how Americans are coming to terms with the unadorned pig.

More to the point, I'd like to ask some questions:

Why are we being flooded with stories of people expressing surprise about the costs associated with Obamacare enrollment or purchasing individual plans that conform to the law's requirements? Don't tell me it's because you believed Obama when he made all those promises about blah, blah, blah. If you believed anything he said, shame on you.

I didn't believe him because at least four years ago I started asking my doctors — primary care and specialists — what they thought Obama's vision of health care reform would lead to. (This was more helpful than asking the American Medical Association, which endorsed Obamacare.) My docs talked mostly about three issues: the orchestrated rationing of health care, much more intervention by the government in health care decisions and higher costs for people like me. A couple of them predicted a coming doctor shortage, but that seemed self-serving.

Next questions:

Am I the only person in America who ever discussed with his doctors what was coming down the road? Why the shock and awe now that it's being rolled out? Why the fury over such short-term distractions as faulty websites and extended enrollment deadlines? Those are spear carriers at the opera. The headliners here are the transforming elements of Obamacare that my doctors suggested, and which will tell you all you need to know:

More government control of our lives. This is always a bad idea, and especially when it dictates your choices on something as personal as your relationship with your doctor and other health care professionals. The fact is, when Obamacare was being debated in Congress in late 2009, polls showed that as many as 86% of Americans were satisfied with their own health care plans, even as a majority supported helping those who didn't have access to health insurance.

Redistribution of income. It's defensible in theory for the well-off to pay more to prop up the less-well-off, but it would have been cheaper, I'd bet, for taxpayers to just buy basic health care for those who have none. But that, of course, would deny Obama his goal of having the government control everyone's health care with a ridiculous list of mandates.

But that, of course, would deny Obama his goal of having the government control everyone's health care with a ridiculous list of mandates. Rationing. This is where many critics of Obamacare and I will probably part company. The truth is, rationing is inevitable under any scheme. It's also a reasonable option when it involves medical professionals and families — not the government — making decisions about end-of-life care. The further truth is that retired Baby Boomers are going to bankrupt Medicare if some form of rationing isn't employed in treating the terminally ill and the extreme elderly in the last six months or so of their lives.

If you accept these arguments, you might also agree with me that the news media could have done a better job of covering this drama. They should have been on red alert when then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi famously said in 2010 that ""we have to pass the (Obamacare) bill so you can find out what's in it."" That was an invitation to scrutinize every single word of the law and the thousands of pages of regulations it has spawned, and to seek out expert opinion on what their impact would be.

Alas, that didn't happen. Even so, there's no excuse for anyone with a doctor and an ounce of curiosity being shocked at what's unfolding before our eyes.

Washington (CNN) – A few months after turning 50 years old, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie secretly underwent lap-band surgery in February for the sake of his wife and kids, a source close to the governor confirmed to CNN.

Christie told the New York Post, which first reported the story early Tuesday morning, that the invasive procedure came after his family and friends urged him to start improving his health.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

""I've struggled with this issue for 20 years,"" he said. ""For me, this is about turning 50 and looking at my children and wanting to be there for them.""

Christie had the 40 minute long surgery on Saturday, February 16, a source close to Christie tells CNN Chief Washington Correspondent Jake Tapper, and was back to work by the following Tuesday.

His concerns over the ""minimally invasive procedure,"" according to the source, were allayed by the fact that Dr. George Fielding would be operating on him. Fielding has done the procedure many times and even had the surgery himself, the source told Tapper, anchor of CNN's ""The Lead.""

Although Christie has lost some weight, the source told Tapper, the governor is ""not doing any victory laps"" and knows this is just the beginning of the weight loss process.

In an interview with the Post, Christie says his surgery was solely for his children and wife, but almost anything the Republican governor does is seen through the lens of a possible presidential run in 2016. Christie, in an interview with the Post, attempted to squash any speculation.

""It's so much more important than that,"" Christie said. ""I know it sounds crazy to say that running for president is minor, but in the grand scheme of things, it was looking at Mary Pat and the kids and going, 'I have to do this for them, even if I don't give a crap about myself.'""

A ""tight circle"" of top staff knew about the procedure, a source close to the governor told CNN Chief Political Analyst Gloria Borger.

""They were the right people; he had to make sure a small circle knew. But it was mostly family who knew,"" the source said, adding the the catalyst was Christie's 50th birthday.

""He had been thinking about it for a while, and working on it (weight loss)"" through diet and exercise, the source said. And while the source can't discount the presidential considerations entirely, the source added ""this was more about his kids and his family.""

Are there any potential downsides?

""Everyone will be watching"" as every pound does (or does not) come off, the source said. The upside is that it ""humanizes him.""

""(The) struggle is something he can talk about,"" the source added, also noting that when Christie attended the George W. Bush Presidential Center dedication ceremony last month, some noticed he had shed some pounds.

OPINION: Congrats Gov. Christie: You saved your life

Christie's weight has been an issue of fodder for comedians and journalists alike, but primarily because the governor is regularly self-deprecating about the issue.

Earlier this year, while comedian David Letterman was offering a lengthy apology to the governor for all of the weight jokes he had made on his late night comedy show, Christie played along by reaching into his pocket and grabbing a donut.

""I didn't know this was going to take so long,"" Christie said to the laughing audience. He continued to joke about his weight during the interview, telling Letterman that he is ""basically the healthiest fat guy you've ever seen in your life.""

In response to the bit, a former White House doctor told CNN National Political Correspondent Jim Acosta that she ""winced"" at the routine and questioned whether Christie's weight would hold him back on a presidential run.

""I'm worried he may have a heart attack. I'm worried he may have a stroke,"" former White House physician Connie Mariano, M.D. said in the interview. ""It's almost a like a time bomb waiting to happen unless he addresses those issues before running for office.""

Mariano, who served nine years as a doctor in the White House medical unit said Christie's obesity would certainly become an issue should he run for the presidency in 2016. She warned a future President Christie could suffer from potentially deadly complications from diabetes, sleep apnea, and heart disease.

In response, Christie said unless Mariano has given him a physical exam, ""she should shut up.""

""The idea that somehow, you know, I don't care about this – of course I care about it. And I am making the best effort I can,"" Christie said at a press conference before he had the surgery in February.

""In terms of people in the state being concerned about whether or not it prevents me from being able to do my job effectively, I think they've seen the results of that,"" Christie said.

Christie's weight was in issue in his 2009 run for governor, when he defeated Democratic incumbent Jon Corzine. Christie's girth was portrayed unflatteringly in campaign ads by Corzine's campaign. But Christie's weight has not been an issue as he runs this year for re-election to a second term. A Quinnipiac University poll of New Jersey voters conducted in March indicated that 68% of Garden State voters were comfortable with an overweight candidate, with just 17% holding reservations.

Lap-band surgery entails a doctor fitting a band around the stomach in order to make the organ smaller. It helps people lose weight because as someone eats, the smaller stomach feels fuller faster, thereby cutting down on the amount of food someone consumes. As the lap-band recipient loses weight, doctors can add saline to the band to shrink the stomach even more.

The surgery is considered a less dangerous alternative to gastric bypass, where a doctor shrinks the size of a stomach by dividing the stomach into two using staples.

In July 2012, Christie told ABC that gastric bypass was ""too risky"" of a surgery for him.

9/18/2013: SEAN HANNITY: The groundwork has been set for a monumental showdown on Capitol Hill, and it all comes down to a very simple formula. Either Democrats vote to defund the train wreck that is Obamacare, or they will risk shutting down the federal government. JOHN BOEHNER: This week the House will pass a CR that ... defunds Obamacare. REP. MICHELE BACHMANN, R-MN: Can you see the smile on my face? I am so happy because I think we're getting to a consensus now with the Republicans. ... I think that we can take a victory lap.

(balloons drop as Stephen twerks with Death to the tune of ""Blurred Lines"")

(audience cheering)

Maybe.

Because there are still a few wrinkles to iron out before this brave act of extortion takes effect.



CAROL COSTELLO (9/19/2013): You know that these things probably won't pass the Democratically-controlled Senate, and the President would veto it even if it did. KIRSTEN POWERS (9/18/2013): They're putting something in there that is absolutely a non-starter. ... This is like saying we can pass a budget if you can prove there's life on Mars.

And folks, when it comes to stopping Obamacare, there is no time to lose because the stool sample is about to hit the fan.



BILL HEMMER (9/17/2013): Two weeks from today, the first Americans can start signing up for the exchanges under Obamacare. That's the first of October.

And folks, worse than the cost or the bureaucrats or the death panels, the most dangerous thing about Obamacare is that people might like it.

As conservative writer Byron York recently Yorked:



BYRON YORK (7/11/2013): The White House knows that once those payments begin, repealing Obamacare will no longer be an abstract question of removing legislation not yet in effect. Instead, it will be a very real matter of taking money away from people. It's very, very hard to do that.

The key to implementing the President's plan are the so-called Obamacare Navigators. Now, what does an Obamacare Navigator do?



CHRIS HAYES (9/13/2013): So, you're asking what does an Obamacare Navigator do?

CHRIS HAYES (9/17/2013): They ""help low-income, uninsured residents sign up for the state's expanded insurance program"".

9/15/2013: YOLANDA FERNANDEZ, NBC8 ANCHOR: Tension over how to implement the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, appears to be surfacing again in Florida. This time, it has to do with the so-called Navigators, who are supposed to help people wade through the system to sign up for health coverage. ... The Florida Department of Health is saying that those Navigators can't operate inside county health department offices. LAUREN MAYK, NBC8 REPORTER: The State Department of Health put out a notice, saying Navigators couldn't ""conduct activities on the grounds of the health departments"".

FLORIDA ATTORNEY GENERAL PAM BONDI (8/16/2013): These Navigators will have our consumers throughout the country's most personal and private information. Tax return information. Social Security information. And our biggest fear, of course, is identity theft.

That makes sense. You can only ask for the material that will inform you about the program if you know about the program enough to ask for the material. (audience applause) Then, you just have to fill out the Möbius form.

Hopefully, folks, hopefully, one of these plans will kill Obamacare. If not, I guess Republicans can just vote to repeal it again. And yes, I know they've already tried that 41 times. But you know what they say. If at first you don't succeed, try try try try try try try try try try try try try try try try try try try try try try try try try try try try try try try try try try try try try try try try try try again.

USA TODAY

Senate set to vote on spending bill Wednesday

Sens. Cruz and Lee want to use blocking tactics to stop vote

Key Senate Republicans say they oppose delaying vote on the spending bill

WASHINGTON — Sen. Ted Cruz's marathon talking protest of President Obama's health care law continued Wednesday morning, as the Senate headed toward a procedural vote on a bill that would continue its funding.

Cruz began his talkathon Tuesday afternoon, vowing to speak on the Senate floor ""until I am no longer able to stand."" Technically under Senate rules, Cruz's tactic is not a filibuster because the Texas Republican cannot prevent the Senate from having a scheduled procedural vote later Wednesday.

Shortly before 7 a.m. ET, Cruz passed Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis., who spoke on the Senate floor for 16 hours, 12 minutes in 1981 to protest raising the nation's debt limit. In terms of time spent controlling the floor, Cruz has passed such legendary Senate talkers as Robert Byrd, Alfonse D'Amato and Huey Long as he brought attention to Obama's signature domestic achievement.

GOP Sens. Mike Lee of Utah and Marco Rubio of Florida both arrived in the Senate chamber before dawn Wednesday to ask questions of Cruz, so he didn't have to speak the whole time.

Overnight, Cruz filled time by talking about the Revolutionary War, the battle against the Nazis, reading tweets from supporters and even reciting Dr. Seuss' Green Eggs and Ham.

Cruz also shared ""words of wisdom"" from the reality TV show Duck Dynasty and quoted much of country music singer Toby Keith's song Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue.

Cruz took a moment to embrace the ""wacko bird"" label Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., used to refer to him and other conservative Republicans back in March.

""If it reflects a fidelity to the Constitution, a fidelity to liberty, a willingness to fight, to defend the principles this country was founded on,"" then Cruz said he and his colleagues were ""very proud wacko birds.""

The conservative-driven effort to defund Obamacare on a stopgap spending bill now under debate in Congress has raised the threat of a government shutdown Oct. 1.

Cruz and Lee have led the defund effort despite criticism from Senate Republicans who view their tactics as short-sighted because there is no chance of passage up against a Democratic-led Senate and Obama's veto pen.

Lee took the floor to denounce the Affordable Care Act as a first step toward a government-run health care system, ""funded, operated and administered entirely from Washington, D.C.""

Lee referred to the Supreme Court ruling that declared Obamacare to be constitutional as a ""lawless act"" and ""something that we should be ashamed of as Americans.""

In one exchange, Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., pointed to Obama's re-election as the electorate's word on the health care law. Cruz said Obama was a ""far more talented candidate"" than Mitt Romney and didn't see the 2012 election as a referendum on the health care law.

Despite the Republican senators' efforts, the chamber is on track to clear a key procedural hurdle Wednesday to ultimately advance a stopgap spending bill that leaves intact Obama's health care law.

""Filibusters stop people from voting, and we are going to vote tomorrow,"" said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., on Tuesday. Cruz took to the Senate floor at 2:41 p.m., but under Senate rules Reid will be able to hold a procedural vote to take up the stopgap spending bill around noon Wednesday no matter how long Cruz intends to speak.

Adam Jentleson, a spokesman for Reid, posted on Twitter that Cruz and Reid had pre-negotiated the terms of Cruz's floor time.

The House-passed spending bill under debate in the Senate maintains the current annual $986 billion funding levels across the federal government through Dec. 15 but includes a provision to defund the Affordable Care Act. The Senate's vote on Wednesday would essentially clear the way for a final up-or-down vote by the weekend, but Reid is going to strip out the language eliminating spending for the health care law, which is why Cruz and his allies are using blocking tactics.

Senate Democrats also intend to change the time period of the stopgap spending bill to Nov. 15, in order to nudge lawmakers closer toward passing the annual spending bills instead of relying on stopgap measures. ""The best way to stop lurching on this crisis to the next crisis is to get back into funding our government the way the Founding Fathers set it out, through the appropriations process,"" Reid said.

Senate Appropriations Chairwoman Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., said she will be seeking a longer-term resolution to the dozen fiscal year spending bills that remain unfinished. Democrats are also seeking ways to use the annual spending bills to turn off unpopular, across-the-board spending cuts known as the sequester for up to two years.

The majority of Senate Republicans have said they oppose Cruz's tactics on the stopgap spending bill, in part because of fears of political repercussions for being blamed for a government shutdown, which will occur Oct. 1 if Congress doesn't pass it.

The chamber's top two Republicans, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Senate Minority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, said Monday that they will not vote with Cruz on Wednesday, a clear signal that there are the 60 votes necessary to move forward with the debate on the spending bill.

""We'd all be hard-pressed to explain why we were opposed to a bill we were in favor of,"" McConnell said Tuesday, noting that the vote Wednesday will allow debate on a bill that includes the defund language since Reid has not had the opportunity to strip it out yet.

However, Republicans continue to unanimously oppose Obamacare as a matter of policy, which begins open enrollment on Oct. 1, and are seeking other avenues to dismantle the law.

For example, House Republicans are working to approve a legislative package tied to a debt-ceiling vote increase expected next month that would delay implementation for one year in exchange for suspending the nation's borrowing limit through next year.

Obama has maintained that he will not negotiate on the debt ceiling because of the potentially sweeping economic repercussions that could arise from the United States defaulting on its debt payments.

She chooses to forgo coverage for one simple reason: “I never get sick.”

Despite her reluctance, Sargsyan is exactly the type of person insurance plans, states and the federal government are counting on to make health reform work.



As the clock ticks toward the 2014 launch of the Affordable Care Act, health leaders across the nation are embarking on a tough task: persuading young adults like Sargsyan to enroll. Their participation will be critical to balance out older, sicker patients more likely to sign up for health insurance as soon as they are able.

The success of the healthcare law “depends on reaching everyone who is uninsured, but particularly young people who may feel like they don’t need insurance,” said Larry Levitt, a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation. Convincing them to spend money on insurance, he said, will be a “marketing challenge.”

Getting young adults on board will require changing cultural norms, Levitt said. “For kids in their 20s … following convention isn’t their first instinct,” he said.

The federal law allows young adults to stay on their parents’ policies until they are 26. About 425,000 people in California have taken advantage of the new benefit, officials say, leading to savings for them and their families when they go to the emergency room.

Still, more than 2 million Californians ages 19 to 34 are uninsured, according to the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research.

Beginning in 2014, nearly everyone will be required to have insurance or face a fine — $95 or 1% of their household income in the first year. Many young adults who are not covered through work or their parents may be eligible for Medicaid or the new state-based insurance market places known as exchanges.

Health officials worry that the fine, which increases over time, isn’t high enough to convince people to sign up for coverage. “The penalty itself will not convince a young person, or any other person,” said Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for Covered California, the state’s exchange. “Young people will need to understand the risks of not having health insurance.”

Osvaldo Lopez, 24, of El Sereno said he understands the risks because he plays soccer and worries about getting injured. But Lopez, a student who works part time, said he can’t afford it. After graduation, he hopes to get a law enforcement job that provides insurance so he won’t have to pay for his own.

Another student, Zach Gaul, 19, said he was thankful to still be covered under his parents’ plan, even though he has to pay them a portion of his paycheck for the coverage.

“I do reckless things all the time,” he said, listing recent activities: skateboarding, bike riding, drinking, racing cars, jumping off a waterfall. “If I get hurt, I’d like to be able to afford getting airlifted out.”

Covered California is developing media messages that are “a little edgier” and specifically target young adults, Hidalgo said. The state plans to use a financial security argument, telling young people that insurance can protect them from going broke if they are hospitalized after a car accident, a broken bone or an illness.

“This will have its challenges, kind of like talking to your kids when you are trying to advise them of the right thing to do,” Hidalgo said.

Last week, the state released its rates for health insurance under the exchange. While costs vary based on age and income, young adults with low or middle incomes are likely to receive substantial subsidies — for premiums, deductibles and co-pays. For example, a 21-year-old who earns about $16,000 would pay about $45 each month for the mid-level plan. State officials point out that costs could rise in subsequent years if not enough healthy people enroll.

In an effort to educate and enroll young adults across the state, Covered California also awarded millions of dollars in grants to the University of California, Cal State L.A. and the Los Angeles Unified School District.

Many Cal State students are young, low-income and minority and probably eligible for Medi-Cal or subsidized health coverage, said Walter Zelman, chairman of the public health department at Cal State LA. Zelman, who is overseeing a $1.25-million grant, said he plans to hire graduate students at most of the Cal State campuses to lead the way on outreach. The campuses will also conduct training, hold forums and enroll as many students as possible, he said.

“Not only is this a needy population and a deserving population, but it is a population that is relatively easy to reach,” he said.

The Young Invincibles, a policy and advocacy organization, has also started a campaign and a mobile app to raise awareness about health coverage. The organization’s California director, Tamika Butler, said the group was focusing on both enrollment and education. And staff, who are young adults themselves, are telling other young people that insurance can give them financial peace of mind as well as help them get preventive and mental healthcare.

Butler said young people who learn about the benefits of insurance can spread that knowledge to friends and family. “Young people are a gateway to not just get insured themselves, but to get other community members insured,” she said.

Bianca Gonzalez, 23, said she and her family have long been uninsured and rely on herbal remedies whenever they get sick. Gonzalez, who lives in Eagle Rock, said she never thought much about insurance because she didn’t think they qualified for anything affordable. But after learning about Medi-Cal in a health policy class at Cal State L.A., Gonzalez said she realized her family may be eligible in 2014.

“It’s awesome,” she said. “If I need to go to a doctor … I will be able to go and get service without worrying about how I am gonna pay for it.”

Sargsyan, meanwhile, hasn’t seen a doctor in five years. Even though she recognizes that health plans need people like her, she doesn’t want to pay a costly monthly premium. Unless she finds a job by 2014 that offers inexpensive insurance, Sargsyan said she will probably just pay the penalty.

“God forbid something happens,” she said. “Until then, I’m living healthy and happy.”

On one side, Republicans — both the base and the political leadership — have decided that health reform is already a failure; that conviction is actually helping the leadership rein in some of the crazies, by telling them that now is the time to wait and let the political payoff from Obamacare’s collapse fall into their laps.

On the other side, Democrats see a law that got off to a terrible start but is getting rapidly better.

Which is right? There’s data showing a sharp rise in enrollments, but there are continuing problems with the back end, and then there are dueling anecdotes. It would be hard to assess all this objectively even if political passions weren’t running so high.

But one group has a strong incentive to be objective — and also has a much better perspective on what’s really going on than any lay observer. Namely, the insurance industry. So the shoe we’ve all been waiting to see drop — or not — was the surge of advertising urging people buying insurance through the exchanges to buy from me, me, me.

That shoe has just dropped, with $500 million of advertising spending now in the pipeline. Insurers think this is going to work.

Now, some people will see this as bad news. Obamacare is just going to add to insurer profits! And it will indeed make money for the likes of Aetna and Wellpoint. In an ideal world, this wouldn’t be happening: single payer would clearly have been a better system. But it wasn’t going to happen. This was the health reform we could get — and when it works, as the big money now believes it will, it’s going to make a huge, positive difference to millions of lives."

In a ruling released Thursday, U.S. District Court Judge Edward Korman directed the FDA to make levonorgestrel-based contraceptives available over the counter, and without a prescription. The ruling overturns a 2011 decision by Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius requiring that girls under age 17 obtain a prescription for the Plan B One-Step contraceptive or its equivalents

In his strongly worded ruling, Korman called Sebelius’ decision “politically motivated, scientifically unjustified and contrary to agency precedent.” No serious health risks have been associated with the drug’s use among adults and children, Korman wrote, and even the FDA acknowledged that the drug’s “safety and efficacy in the pediatric population have been established.”

The ruling comes in response to a lawsuit filed by the Center for Reproductive Rights, which argued that restrictions placed on the drug imposed unreasonable delays for women of all ages. While the drugs are available to women 17 and older without a prescription, the requirements created confusion and pharmacists kept them behind counters so that they were not available outside regular business hours.

“Today science has finally prevailed over politics,” Nancy Northrup, president and chief executive of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in a statement. “This landmark court decision has struck a huge blow to the deep-seated discrimination that has for too long denied women access to a full range of safe and effective birth control methods.”

Korman ordered that the drugs be made available without limits within 30 days.

Allison Price, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Justice, said the government was “reviewing the appellate options and expects to act promptly.”

Emergency contraception must be taken within five days of unprotected sex to be effective, and it will not work if a woman is already pregnant.

According to the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, nearly half of all pregnancies that occur in the U.S. each year are unintended. The average age for first-time sex is 17, and roughly 750,000 pregnancies will occur among 15- to 19-year olds each year.

Those are the odds they give for a government shutdown.

An alternative to the shutdown would be a proposed delay of the individual mandate, the most painful part of Obamacare, which may seem like a Republican victory but on closer inspection would be a win for President Obama and Democrats.

Historians — or commentators, in the meantime — might view either of these possible outcomes as yet another “Putinesca” victory for the president: Saved by the enemy.

Just as Russian President Vladimir Putin emerged at the brink of the U.S. bombing of Syria to orchestrate an alternative solution, Republicans may have provided a rip cord for Obama.

Postponement of the individual mandate is part of the GOP bargaining package on raising the debt ceiling. Delay it for a year, say Republican leaders, and they’ll raise the debt limit for a year to keep the government operating.

At least one Democrat, Joe Manchin, has conceded that this would be a pretty good idea since the health-care overhaul obviously isn’t ready. The many flaws have been fully vetted for months, though new ones continue to reveal themselves as we approach the insurance-exchange shopping spree scheduled to begin in a few days.

Latest to the fraying Affordable (now “Adorable”) Care Act is a technological glitch in online applications for small businesses. It isn’t ready yet and will be delayed.

What is ready, and adorable, is a sampler of new ads aimed at children who are still fretful about the new plan. Oh, wait, no. The ads, featuring baby ducks and kittens — purring and feeling ducky about Obamacare — are aimed at adults. They’re certifiably cute, but one can’t escape the thought that the federal government has skipped all pretense at treating Americans as adults. Naptime, anyone?

To be fair, Sen. Ted Cruz read Dr. Seuss’s “Green Eggs and Ham” to his children during his 21-hour un-filibuster. The muse whispers: “Ted Cruz would send Ronald Reagan back to the Democratic Party.”

Here’s the problem for Republicans, which will not be news to those with a view of the long game. The short game is to stall Obamacare, but to what end ultimately? Until Republicans can seize the Senate in 2014 and the White House in 2016, at which point they can repeal the whole thing?

Skinny chance, that.

More likely, whether the government shuts down or, should Tinker Bell suddenly materialize and persuade Obama to cave and postpone his personal dream act, Republicans will be viewed by a greater majority than previously as having no talent for leadership.

And if the debt ceiling isn’t raised and the United States defaults, threatening our full faith and credit around the world and sending countries looking favorably for other currencies, not to mention the financial fallout here, then blame will fall at the feet of the Republican Party. No surprise there.

Now consider the alternative scenario: Suppose Republicans succeed in getting the individual mandate delayed for a year — right up to the 2014 midterm elections. Bravo, right? Not necessarily. If voters don’t have to experience the uncertainty and discomfort of being forced to buy insurance in an unwieldy, dysfunctional system — all the while noticing that millions are still without coverage — who benefits?

Surely not the Republicans, who, on the one hand, can be blamed for depriving insurance coverage to those poor sick kittens and ducklings. On the other, they accrue no benefit from having prevented the pain of implementing Obamacare.

Republicans lose either way, but they may lose biggest if they win.

Alternatives to present circumstances do not abound. Republicans have drawn their line in the sand. Democrats have drawn theirs. Obama says no negotiating over the debt ceiling, period.

There is one alternative that is both perhaps best for the country and hardest for Obama. He could relent not to Republicans but to the greater good. He could delay full implementation past the 2014 elections, which would accomplish two things: One, he could iron out the wrinkles that are now apparent. Two, Democrats would get to slide through another election cycle without the most visibly painful part of Obamacare — the individual mandate.

What, really, does Obama have to lose? Only face, the pain of which passes. What he would gain is the legacy that escapes so many these days — proof that he is a leader who does the right thing, even if it hurts his pride just a little.

Republicans, who will have banished themselves to wander a while longer in the desert, may have drawn a line too far.

“It is not a negotiation if I show up at your house and say give me everything inside or I'm going to burn it down.”

And

“The Republicans have provided a laundry list of essentially ransom demands.”

And

“What we're not for is negotiating with people with a bomb strapped to their chest.”

That’s some take-no-prisoners stuff, only days before Americans can sign up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act and the government might shut down if congressional Republicans and the White House can’t agree on a spending plan for fiscal 2014 by Tuesday.

The strategy is not without risks, like alienating good-faith skeptics about the law. But Democrats say it serves multiple purposes. It rallies the troops ahead of the 2014 elections (midterm elections are generally thought of as decided by the parties’ core or “base” supporters). It also turns signing up for Obamacare into a blow against some of liberals' favorite targets. And it aims to transform the discussion about Obamacare from a philosophical dispute about the government’s role in health care into a fight over benefits. If that sounds almost like an effort to turn Obamacare from a battleground into a popular entitlement, well, here’s another part of Obama’s message on Thursday at Prince George’s Community College just outside Washington:

“Medicare and Social Security faced the same kind of criticism. Before Medicare came into law, one Republican warned that ‘one of these days, you and I are going to spend our sunset years telling our children and our children’s children what it once was like in America when men were free,” Obama said. “That was Ronald Reagan. And eventually, Ronald Reagan came around to Medicare and thought it was pretty good, and actually helped make it better.”

Story continues

On the possible government shutdown, it’s even simpler: Democrats say they're sure that the public will blame Republicans.

When it comes to Obamacare, the president said Thursday, “There are parts of the bill that some folks don't like. “

What kinds of folks? Here’s how Obama broke it down:

The rich

“To help pay for the program, the wealthiest Americans, families that make more than $250,000 a year, will have to pay a little bit more. Extremely costly health insurance plans will no longer qualify for unlimited tax breaks.”

Freeloaders

“When uninsured people who can afford to get health insurance don't, and then they get sick or they get hit by a car and they show up at the emergency room, who do you think pays for that? You do, in the form of higher premiums because the hospitals, they got to get their money back somehow. So if they're treating somebody who doesn't have health insurance, they jack up premiums for everybody who does have health insurance. It's like a hidden tax of a thousand dollars per family every year whose got health insurance. So we're saying, well, that's not fair. If you can afford to get health insurance, don't dump the costs on us.""

Fox News watchers

“We need you to spread the word. But you don't have to take my word for it. If you've talked to somebody who said, well, I don't know, I was watching Fox News, and they said this was horrible [the transcript records “laughter, boos”] and you can say, ‘you know what? Don't take my word for it. Go on the website. See for yourself what the prices are. See for yourself what the choices are. Then make up your own mind. Just make — that's all I'm asking. Make up your own mind.’”

The Koch Brothers (though he did not name them)

“Some of the tea party's biggest donors, some of the wealthiest men in America, are funding a cynical ad campaign trying to convince young people not to buy health care at all. I mean, think about it. These are billionaires several times over. You know they've got good health care.”

“But they are actually spending money, on television, trying to convince young people that if you've got the choice between getting affordable health care or going without health care, you should choose not having any health care. Now, do you think if you get sick or you get hurt and you get stuck with a massive bill, these same folks — they're going to help you out? Are they going to pay for your health care?”

GOP extremists

“One congressman said that 'Obamacare' is the most dangerous piece of legislation ever passed. Ever in the history of America, this is the most dangerous piece of legislation. Providing, creating a marketplace so people can buy group insurance plans, the most dangerous ever.”

More extremists

“You had a state representative somewhere say that it's as destructive to personal and individual liberty as the Fugitive Slave Act. Think about that. Affordable health care is worse than a law that lets slave-owners get their runaway slaves back. I mean, these are quotes. I'm not making this stuff up.”

(He isn’t making this one up, anyway. Here’s Republican New Hampshire state representative Bill O’Brien on Aug. 1: “What is Obamacare? It is a law as destructive to personal and individual liberty as the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, that allowed slave-owners to come to New Hampshire and seize African-Americans and use the federal courts to take them back to ... slave states.”)

""The closer we get, the more desperate they get,"" Obama said. ""All this would be funny if it wasn’t so crazy.""



It might be tempting to view this ugly debate as the latest exhibit in the case against Obama's 2008 campaign promise to drain the fever swamps of nasty political rhetoric.



But here's the thing about presidential candidates who promise to ""change the tone"" in Washington:

If they mean it, they’re naïve. Republicans are hardly blameless in the escalation of Washington rhetoric since Obama took office. And even presidents can’t change their opponents’ tone, after all.

If they don’t mean it, oh, right, they’re politicians."

The Las Vegas Sun reports that during an appearance on “Nevada Week In Review, Reid answered, “Yes. Yes. Absolutely, yes,” when asked if “the country would have to have a health care system that abandoned insurance as the means of accessing it.”

The idea of introducing a single-payer national health care system to the United States, or even just a public option, sent lawmakers into a tizzy back in 2009, when Reid was negotiating the health care bill.

“We had a real good run at the public option … don’t think we didn’t have a tremendous number of people who wanted a single-payer system,” Reid said on the PBS program, recalling how then-Sen. Joe Lieberman’s opposition to the idea of a public option made them abandon the notion and start from scratch.

Reid also said that ObamaCare was “a step in the right direction” and that America has to “work our way past” insurance-based health care.

“Single-payer” is a deceptive term that means “socialized medicine.” Insurance companies are put out of business and the government takes over as the sole payer of all health care costs.

This also means that the government decides on how much will be reimbursed for services and which procedures are paid for and which ones are not. These policies frequently result in what is known as health care rationing and “death panels.” If certain procedures are not covered or adequately reimbursed, doctors will not perform them (except for the very rich who can pay out of pocket).

Lousy reimbursements, government red tape, and the lack of flexibility and innovation that comes in a free market tend to drive health care professionals to professions that the government does not exert full control over. Fewer doctors equals health-care rationing and the long waits for vital procedures that are common in countries currently under a single-payer system.

The first services usually axed by death panels staffed with a handful of bureaucrats are the costly and uncertain experimental procedures that sometimes fail many times before leading to a breakthrough, as well as expensive, life-saving operations on the ill, handicapped, and elderly.

Some Democrats, most notably Howard Dean, are already pushing back against the “death panels” that are already a part of ObamaCare.

Zients, a multimillionaire entrepreneur and management consultant, joined the Obama White House in 2009 with a mandate to streamline the federal bureaucracy. A year later, he issued a prescient warning.

The government “largely has missed out” on the information technology revolution, Mr. Zients said in a 2010 internal memo. “I.T. projects too often cost hundreds of millions of dollars more than they should, take years longer than necessary to deploy and deliver technologies that are obsolete by the time they are completed,” he wrote.

These days, Mr. Zients is witnessing that ineptitude up close as the emergency fix-it man charged with righting HealthCare.gov, the bungled online marketplace for medical insurance. He is to become President Obama’s top economic adviser in January, but first he is leading the so-called tech surge to haul HealthCare.gov into the 21st century. Ignoring friends who told him not to get mixed up in the website fiasco, Mr. Zients (pronounced ZYE-ents) promises it will run “smoothly for the vast majority of users” by the end of November — a schedule considered highly optimistic.

Mr. Obama’s reputation, and the electoral fortunes of Democrats, could hinge on the work of Mr. Zients, a man who has no hands-on technology experience — although he has advised health care companies on business practices. In the universe of experts who might have been called in for rescue work, Democrats close to the administration say, there were others perhaps more qualified than Mr. Zients, but he was the best of those Mr. Obama and an insular White House were comfortable with."

The Obama administration may be in hot water over its jammed-up health insurance websites, but the federal government did plan for some trouble, paying for thousands of specially trained guides called navigators to help people negotiate the treacherous waters of health insurance.

But, three weeks into the most important phase of health reform, these experts aren't faring much better than average civilians in getting the sites to work. And it's not just the federal website -- some state-run sites are struggling just as badly.

""Can we just see if it works?"" Amine Ashkar pleads as he tries to sign up for health insurance at the Community Clinic, Inc. in Wheaton Md. on Wednesday afternoon. ""We can try,"" answers Martha Lopez, a former insurance agent who's helping people enroll.

The screen gets stuck as she tries to set up an account for Ashkar, a 32-year-old bus driver who's looking for a better deal on his insurance.

Lopez and her team of fellow navigators employed through the nonprofit clinic have been unable to complete a single enrollment online.

""Why don't we try next week?"" Lopez asks Ashkar. It's not the first time Lopez has sent a client away. The day before she thought she got one couple signed up before the website fizzled. “I told them to call back in 10 to 12 days.""

The main goal of the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was to help get health insurance to the estimated 47 million Americans who don’t have it, either by extending Medicaid or by giving them access to commercial, private insurance sold through health insurance marketplaces called exchanges.



Customers must sign up by Dec. 15 in order to get care that begins Jan. 1. But people have until March 31 to enroll for insurance that starts in 2014.

Still, consumers trying to enroll on their own online have been complaining loudly about how difficult it is. But even the pros are having trouble.

""The IT system is so messed up at the moment,"" says Wendy Korrick, who leads the team of in-person navigators working through the clinic's network.

The federal government promised easy, Expedia-style websites where people were supposed to be able to sign up in a single online session, pick a plan, find a premium, figure out if they could get a subsidy. That's what Ashkar is hoping for. He has health insurance through the state, but he estimates he pays $250 a month for a plan that covers himself, his wife and his two children, and he has heard he might do better with a federally subsidized plan.

But the federally run sites in 34 states have been balky at best. Website signups have been almost as bad in some of the states running their own exchanges, too.



On Monday, President Barack Obama admitted the sites weren’t working as planned and promised to fix them. In the meantime, Obama advised people to use call centers and get in-person help from navigators and non-certified workers called helpers at community clinics nationwide. But for some, that's a dead end for now.



The navigators and helpers go through 30 hours of training and take a federally administered test. They receive instruction on privacy, and must promise to stay free of conflicts of interest.



The administration awarded $67 million last August to train and pay navigators around the country. Maryland gave $24 million in grant funds to six organizations like Community Clinic, Inc., to get the word out about the exchanges, encourage and help people enroll. The state has trained about 5,000 people total, including navigators, insurance brokers and social workers, to help people sign up.

Across the Potomac River in Virginia, there are far fewer navigators. Virginia opted to let the federal government run its exchange, and much of the work has fallen to non-profit groups.

After complaints by Republicans that navigators might not have enough training, or might have access to personal information, states including Utah, Nevada and Georgia passed law calling for stricter certification and licensing.



At Healthworks, a system of community health centers in Virginia, trained navigators have been able to get a few people signed up on the federal website. But navigators there have also turned to paper, says Carol Jameson, associate CEO for the clinics.

""We were going to wait until the website was up,"" Jameson says. ""Then, when that wasn't happening, we decided to mail the applications in.""



The team at Community Clinic, Inc., a network of low-cost medical clinics, has talked with 1,300 people so far, Korrick estimated.



But not a single one has made it through the entire enrollment process online. Maryland’s website, modeled on the federal website, keeps breaking down.

One woman got angry at the delays, says Apoorva Srivastata, who’s assigned to a clinic in nearby Takoma Park, Md. “She was, like, ‘I have given up hope,’” Srivastata says. “She had taken public transport to get there, and she had her kids with her. I told her not to give up and that she has time.”

Srivastata will call the woman when she is sure the website will work.

Alexandra Dixon, who spends her days at a folding table with a laptop computer inside one downtown Silver Spring clinic, has calmed some impatient customers, too. “I had one gentleman who got pretty upset,” she says.

Maryland’s case hasn’t been a total failure. The Maryland Health Benefit Exchange says that as of last week, 2,300 households used the website to sign up for health insurance. About 260,000 have visited the website; Maryland has 800,000 residents without health insurance.



But it compares poorly to, for instance, the state of Washington, which says more than 35,000 people have successfully signed up on its online exchange.

For the time being, the navigators are telling people about the health care law and their options. Srivastata says she makes her “elevator pitches” whenever the clinic’s waiting room fills up with patients, most of them recent immigrants from Latin America or Ethiopia.

“I say, ‘Do you know about the new health care law?’ and they are all blank,” she says. “I’d say 90 percent of people are at point zero.”

Asking people about the Affordable Care Act usually get a shrug, says Dixon. “But if you say Obamacare, they say “yeah, oh, yeah, Obamacare,” she says.

She remains hopeful. “It’s better than it was last week and I fully expect for it to get better next week,” Dixon says, nodding. In the meantime, she’s telling people to make appointments for two weeks from now.

Critics in Congress say they believe the Obama administration knew about the problems and didn’t tell anyone. On Thursday, the Republican-controlled House Energy and Commerce Committee will hold a hearing on the technical problems and has summoned executives from several of the software contractors who helped build the federal exchange.

The vote was 261 to 157, with 39 Democrats bucking their party leadership and the White House to vote in favor of the bill. Hours after the vote, Mr. Obama and top aides met for over an hour with insurance executives after industry leaders complained Thursday that they had been blindsided by a White House reversal on canceled policies. The president described the meeting as a “brainstorming” session about how to ensure changes to the health care law go smoothly.

The insurance representatives, from more than a dozen companies, said they would work with the administration to protect the financial viability of the new marketplaces, but did not say how. Afterward, Karen Ignagni, the president of America’s Health Insurance Plans, a trade group, said it was a “very productive” meeting, but would not go into detail.

The legislation approved by the House would go further than the fix announced on Thursday by Mr. Obama, who said he would temporarily waive some requirements of the law and allow insurers to renew “current policies for current enrollees” for a year."

But lately the state’s Republican governor has confounded many and angered others by moving decidedly leftward, proposing a Medicaid expansion under Obama’s healthcare overhaul — financed by a new tax — and tempering her tone as Washington debates the combustible issue of immigration reform.

For longtime observers, it is a fitting close to a lengthy political career that has defied easy pigeonholing — if, in fact, the end is near. Contrary to the overwhelming weight of legal opinion and even the counsel of some of her own advisors, Brewer has refused to publicly rule out a run for reelection in 2014, despite Arizona’s voter-passed term-limits law.

(As the next in line, then-Secretary of State Brewer became governor when Democrat Janet Napolitano left office in January 2009 to join Obama’s Cabinet. Brewer won reelection in 2010 and suggests she might be eligible to run again because her first term was less than four years.)

Brewer may be recalibrating as the tea party’s influence wanes and Latinos gain political strength. Or she could have an eye on her legacy as she quietly prepares to leave public life after more than 30 years in office. Either way, her moves have proved Brewer to be a far less predictable politician than the caricature — accidental governor, ditzy ideologue — would have it.

“Where people were kind of chuckling and mumbling about her first year, she walks into a room now and there is genuine regard and applause,” said Jason Rose, a Republican strategist who has never been a part of Brewer’s circle. “That says a lot about her resilience.”

Others are less kind. The conservative world has rung with denunciations since Brewer announced her support for expanding Medicaid, the federal-state healthcare program for the poor and a frequent target of Republicans. A “spectacular flip-flop,” sniped the Wall Street Journal editorial page. “Opportunistic,” tutted National Review.

Brewer declined to be interviewed. But the governor has repeatedly said her decision, dropped as a bombshell in last month’s State of the State address, was grounded in sound fiscal policy.

“I’ve never been a supporter of the Affordable Care Act,” Brewer said at a Yuma press conference, part of a statewide tour to sell her Medicaid plan to a hostile GOP-run Legislature. In fact, Arizona was one of the states that sued to overturn Obama’s healthcare law. Having lost in the Supreme Court, she suggested, it was time to move on.

“Our decision is about whether we will take the action that most benefits Arizona families and businesses,” Brewer said. With $1.6 billion in federal funding, the state could provide health insurance for an additional 240,000 residents and continue insuring 50,000 childless adults, according to the governor’s office. Arizona would pay for its share through new fees on hospitals, which stand to gain from the increased number of insured patients.

Healthcare for the poor, and especially for the mentally ill, has been a career-long interest of Brewer, who has an adult son hospitalized due to mental illness. A Medicare expansion would restore some of the cuts she made — painfully and regretfully, Brewer said — to balance the state budget during the Great Recession.

“I don’t think she’s as far right as people have painted her,” said Earl de Berg, whose Rocky Mountain Poll has surveyed Arizona opinion for more than 40 years. “I think this demonstrates her more moderate conservatism.”

Brewer’s latest move is not the first time she has broken with party orthodoxy or angered keepers of the conservative flame. In 2010, she championed a temporary penny sales-tax increase to avoid sharp cuts in education and other services. Voters approved the measure, but last year rejected an attempt to make the tax hike permanent. (Brewer opposed the extension.)

Many believe a desire to appease conservatives led Brewer to sign Senate Bill 1070, the controversial crackdown on illegal immigration that raised fears of racial profiling and led to another Supreme Court case. Advisors deny that and insist she would have won reelection even if she hadn’t signed the immigration bill, most of which was blocked by the justices.

Regardless, there is no doubt she benefited from her decision, which turned Brewer overnight into a political celebrity and national tea party favorite. She solidified her folk status by wagging a finger at the president during a heated Arizona tarmac exchange, after he challenged her published account of an earlier meeting on immigration.

Those same moves made Brewer a scourge in the Latino community and a favorite target of liberals, who mocked her malapropisms, a disastrous 2010 debate performance — which included a 10-second brain freeze — and some of Brewer’s more alarmist rhetoric, including an assertion, later recanted, that headless border-crime victims were turning up in the Arizona desert.

Since then Brewer’s rhetoric has grown more measured, as passions surrounding illegal immigration have cooled somewhat. The border is more secure. The state economy has picked up. The champion of SB 1070, former state Senate President Russell Pearce, was recalled in November 2011 and lost badly when he tried to regain his seat last year.

“Even the wacko wing of the party is a little sensitive about fighting battles that’ll put the Democrats back in power in 10 years,” said Mike Hellon, a former state GOP chairman.

Advertisement

Last week, Brewer took a helicopter tour of the border and renewed her call for “more boots on the ground.” She has done nothing, however, to undermine a bipartisan effort, including Arizona’s two Republican senators, to negotiate an immigration overhaul more lenient than her enforcement-only approach.

While other Republicans are proceeding with plans to run for governor in 2014, the incumbent is keeping quiet about her intentions and any political motivations. It is not the first time Brewer has kept Arizonans guessing, and probably won’t be the last.

(CNN) —

The deal ending the shutdown may not have put a dent in Obamacare, but the battle over implementing the health coverage law is not over.

CNN Fact Check: Obamacare

One venue that Republicans are turning to for leverage, starting next week: oversight hearings, beginning with some tough questions about why the rollout of the website for enrolling in health care exchanges is having so many problems.

“The American people deserve to know what caused this mess,” said Rep. Fred Upton, R-Michigan, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. “Delays and technical failures have reached epidemic proportions.”

Obama: Website glitches unacceptable

Upton has already asked officials from the Department of Health and Human Services to brief his committee on the problems at a hearing scheduled for next Thursday. He also is asking them to turn over records of their communications with website contractors about the preparations for the site’s launch, and the problems people have had trying to use it.

Logging into Healthcare.gov tough for some early registrants

Additionally, the chair of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Rep. Darrell Issa, last week wrote to Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius demanding information about the rollout problems. Joining him was Sen. Lamar Alexander, ranking Republican on the Senate committee on health, education, labor and pensions.

HHS official: Sebelius not available to testify Thursday

One issue has been the ability to log in to healthcare.gov. A senior administration official told CNN some users, especially those who signed up “early on,” have been having trouble logging in, but the administration is working on a fix. There also was conflicting word on whether some passwords were deleted if they were created in the first week or so after the launch.

Sebelius concedes there have been implementation difficulties.

“I’ll be the first to tell you that the website launch was rockier than we would have liked,” she told an audience in Cincinnati on Wednesday, during her tour to promote Obamacare. But, she told CNN affiliate WLWT, “There are constant improvements under way, so that we are getting people in much more quickly.”

Nevertheless, a couple of Republicans have called on Sebelius to resign.

“Enough is enough,” said Sen. Pat Roberts, who has called for her to step down in spite of being a longtime friend of her family. “Secretary Sebelius has had three and a half years to launch Obamacare, and she has failed.”

Rep. John Fleming of Louisiana tells CNN he is working to collect signatures calling for Sebelius to leave.

White House spokesman Jay Carney pushed back on Tuesday.

“The secretary does have the full confidence of the president,” he told reporters. And when he was asked Thursday who would be held accountable for the problems with the website, Carney replied, “The people who are responsible for making it work are hard at work, fixing the problems that need to be fixed.”

He focused instead on the benefits the uninsured Americans are now entitled to.

“The result will be millions of Americans who have insurance who did not have it before. That’s the goal. And the goal is not about the website. The goal is that the American people who have been shut out of affordable health care options in the past have those options available to them.”

But former White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, while not naming names, said of the website on MSNBC, “when they get it fixed, I hope they fire some people that were in charge.”

Gibbs: Fire those who botched website

Public attention may have been focused more on the shutdown fight this month than the problems with enrolling in the exchanges. But with the shutdown ended, part of the emerging Republican message is that the problems with the Obamacare website reflect broader problems with the law overall.

“I think this is emblematic of how problematic this is going to be in the future,” said Fleming. At a minimum, the implementation of the individual mandate, requiring people to get health care, should be delayed, he said.

But a spokeswoman for Sebelius said the online enrollment process is proceeding.

“While traffic is down somewhat from its peak on day one, it remains high as Americans continue to seek to learn more about their new coverage options,” said spokeswoman Joanne Peters.

How many have signed up for health care? Well, it depends"
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/09/opinion/krugman-the-wonk-gap.html,2013-09-09 00:00:00,['Paul Krugman'],The Wonk Gap - The New York Times,"On Saturday, Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming delivered the weekly Republican address. He ignored Syria, presumably because his party is deeply conflicted on the issue. (For the record, so am I.) Instead, he demanded repeal of the Affordable Care Act. “The health care law,” he declared, “has proven to be unpopular, unworkable and unaffordable,” and he predicted “sticker shock” in the months ahead.

So, another week, another denunciation of Obamacare. Who cares? But Mr. Barrasso’s remarks were actually interesting, although not in the way he intended. You see, all the recent news on health costs has been good. So Mr. Barrasso is predicting sticker shock precisely when serious fears of such a shock are fading fast. Why would he do that?

Well, one likely answer is that he hasn’t heard any of the good news. Think about it: Who would tell him?

My guess, in other words, was that Mr. Barrasso was inadvertently illustrating the widening “wonk gap” — the G.O.P.’s near-complete lack of expertise on anything substantive. Health care is the most prominent example, but the dumbing down extends across the spectrum, from budget issues to national security to poll analysis. Remember, Mitt Romney and much of his party went into Election Day expecting victory."

USA TODAY

Decision a victory for pro-choice proponents

But what%27s OK in Oklahoma is not in Texas

Issue of early-pregnancy abortion won%27t go away

WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court won't consider Oklahoma's appeal seeking to reinstate its law banning medical abortions, such as those performed with the drug RU-486.

The decision comes after Oklahoma's Supreme Court said the law, which would restrict the use of several abortion-inducing drugs to their labels, effectively bans all medical abortions.

That apparently was enough for the justices to leave alone the lower court's decision striking down the law. But similar controversies in other states, including neighboring Texas, make it possible another case will reach the high court eventually.

A federal appeals court ruled last week that a Texas anti-abortion law banning most medical abortions and requiring doctors who provide abortions to get local hospital admitting privileges could take effect, even while the state challenges a district court judge's ruling against the hospital provision. That means many doctors in Texas are blocked from prescribing medical abortions in the first seven weeks of pregnancy.

Abortion rights proponents asked the Supreme Court Monday to block the provision requiring hospital privileges while the legal battle continues. Justice Antonin Scalia demanded a response from the state by Nov. 12.

The prospect of a Supreme Court case on abortion had energized both sides in the debate. The Oklahoma case on RU-486 and two other drugs could have been the most important abortion case since 1992, when the justices upheld the right to abortion but approved several state restrictions. A later decision striking down so-called ""partial-birth"" abortions only affected a small number performed much later in pregnancy.

Other state abortion laws that could reach the high court before too long include those banning abortions after 20 weeks in Arizona and Idaho, as well as restrictions on abortion clinics and requirements that ultrasound tests be performed first.

The justices will hear one related case in January — a challenge by abortion opponents to a Massachusetts law that creates a 35-foot buffer zone around abortion clinics.

The stricken Oklahoma law that justices refused to consider is similar to others in states that have sought to further restrict the right to abortion. It allowed three abortion-related drugs to be used only in the ways their FDA-approved labels specify. Doctors, however, routinely follow other protocols that combine drugs and enable patients to take them at home.

In addition to the Texas law, which makes exceptions for the life and health of the woman, a similar ban on off-label uses for abortion-inducing drugs has been upheld in Ohio."

This to us is something that we're not going to give up on, because we're not going to give up on destroying the health care system for the American people.

Thanks Paul. Now, tell us something we didn't already know.
