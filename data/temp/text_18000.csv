There are five known manuscript copies of the Gettysburg Address, all written by Lincoln himself.

Politician Edward Everett delivered a speech just before Lincoln delivered his address that day. Everett later wrote to the president that his two-hour speech did not compare to Lincoln's two-minute speech.

The famous speech, which starts with ""Four score and seven years ago,"" was delivered four months after Union forces defeated the Confederacy at the Battle of Gettysburg. That battle was considered a turning point of the Civil War.

The crowd gathers for the dedication of the cemetery.

Lincoln gave the speech at the dedication of what is now called the Soldiers' National Cemetery in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.

A crowd gathers to hear President Abraham Lincoln deliver the Gettysburg Address on November 19, 1863. Lincoln is seen in the center, just to the left of the bearded man with a top hat.

Story highlights Lincoln didn't even get top billing at Gettysburg ceremony honoring Civil War dead Keynoter Edward Everett spoke for two hours at Gettysburg, Lincoln for about two minutes Obama answered a question at a Thursday news conference for six full minutes Modern speeches done by committee show how all writers want to get their points across

(CNN) —

It is a lesson from the ages: Lawmakers like to talk.

Even in this advanced age when thoughtlets, capped at 140 characters, are tweeted as discourse, politicians still tend to prattle on.

So here’s a cue from Abraham Lincoln: Cut it short.

When Lincoln took the stage, 150 years ago November 19, to offer a dedication at a cemetery for war dead in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, the story goes that he wasn’t very popular. He didn’t even have top billing at the event. Lincoln had been asked to “please offer a few appropriate remarks.”

He settled on about 200 words.

Obama’s no-show at Gettysburg event: snub or smart?

The keynote address was given by Edward Everett, the Massachusetts statesman hailed at the time as one of the nation’s greatest orators. Ever hear of him today?

Everett spoke for more than two hours. Lincoln spoke for a little more than two minutes.

“The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here,” Lincoln said, ironically; the Gettysburg Address is now regarded as one of the most elegant, thoughtful and well-crafted speeches in American history.

The words are etched in stone next to his statue at the Lincoln Memorial.

150 years later, newspaper retracts editorial panning Gettysburg Address

That’s a strong case for brevity. And it’s a case Lincoln seems to have learned during the course of his very difficult presidency.

His first inaugural address, at 3,670 words, was delivered as he tried to keep the nation together. It was far longer than either of President Barack Obama’s.

But Lincoln’s second inaugural address, at 700 words, delivered after years of war, is considered by many to be the best inaugural speech in U.S. history, and is also one of the shortest.

It included one of the most important one-liners in history, with the South beaten but not yet surrendered, and as the nation started a very long and difficult healing process.

“With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation’s wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.”

The shortest inaugural address in history was delivered by George Washington as he entered his second term. This one perhaps goes too far. It was just 135 words and didn’t include any talk of policy, just a promise to adhere to the oath of office.

But the longest is a cautionary tale against over-speechifying. William Henry Harrison spoke 8,460 words, caught pneumonia and died a month later.

Fast-forward 150 years from Lincoln’s 200 words in Gettysburg. When Obama took to the podium in the White House briefing room Thursday and took a question from CBS News’ Major Garrett – granted, it was a two-parter – he went on for a full six minutes before Garrett asked a follow-up. The news conference went on for about 50 minutes.

Love the president or hate him, you’ve got to admit he can talk.

It is hard to imagine a modern-day speech gaining the historical importance of something like the Gettysburg Address.

Ronald C. White Jr. is a Lincoln scholar who has paid particular attention to Lincoln’s speeches. He’s author of “A. Lincoln,” a biography of the 16th president.

Lincoln’s great short speeches, he argued, were different from modern-day addresses in a number of ways, not the least of which is the teleprompter.

“Speeches are meant to be said, not read,” White said. He feels Obama does better when he engages with an audience, speaking from the heart like when he’s campaigning rather than reading from a teleprompter.

“When he does that, I don’t think he’s nearly as effective as when he doesn’t,” White said of Obama. “He’s more engaged.”

Presidents’ best phrases are tweetable

He said Lincoln wrote the Gettysburg Address and had it memorized, although he took text out of his breast pocket before delivering it.

Another problem today, according to White: speechwriters.

“It’s almost like a committee where everyone involved in the writing process wants to get their points in.”

Speeches today also feel too crowded, he said.

“In the second inaugural, everybody expected Lincoln to talk about the policy of the government … he didn’t offer any policies. He gave a speech that offered the moral imperative. The policy would follow later.”

We know Obama takes great care in editing the speeches drafted by his speechwriters. There is a remarkable photo of all the revisions in his own hand on one sheet of a 2010 address to a joint session of Congress.

See it here

The Library of Congress has posted drafts of the speech, written in Lincoln’s hand, on its website.

See it here

White wishes today that speeches were printed in the newspaper so that people could actually read them and get at what the lawmaker is saying. After he watches a speech on TV, he said, the first thing he does is turn off the TV.

“We don’t read speeches anymore,” complained White, who is of the mind that instant analysis on TV keeps people from really digesting what was said.

But the largest problem for lawmakers giving speeches isn’t a shortening collective attention span or political pundits or teleprompters. It’s the lack of trust in politicians and the institutions of government.

“We’re cynical,” White said. “We’re cynical about speeches and about words.”

USA TODAY

Israel PM calls emerging nuclear deal %27bad%27

Secretary of State Kerry in Geneva for talks

Israel has vowed to not let Iran get nuclear weapons

The name of a White House spokesman was stated incorrectly in an earlier version of this article. He is Josh Earnest.

Secretary of State John Kerry traveled to Geneva on Friday to try to ""narrow the differences"" with Iran on an interim agreement over its nuclear program, a proposal Israel says would be a ""very bad deal"" that allows Iran to keep heading toward a possible atomic bomb.

There has been no confirmation that a deal is close or details of possible elements of such a pact, but foreign ministers from China and Russia were traveling to Geneva to join their counterparts from the USA, United Kingdom, France and Germany, according to Bloomberg. And Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke as if he knew what kind of offer was being discussed.

Speaking before a meeting with Kerry in Jerusalem on Friday, Netanyahu said it appears that the Iranians ""got everything and paid nothing.""

""They wanted relief of sanctions after years of grueling sanctions, they got that. They paid nothing because they are not reducing in any way their nuclear enrichment capability. So Iran got the deal of the century and the international community got a bad deal,"" Netanyahu said.

Netanyahu said that since Israel is not obligated by the agreement it reserves the right to do what it feels is necessary to defend itself, an apparent reference to a possible military strike against Iranian nuclear facilities.

President Obama called the Israeli leader Friday and ""underscored his strong commitment to preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon,"" according to a White House statement. Josh Earnest, a deputy press secretary for the White House, told reporters ""there is no deal,"" and that ""any critique of the deal is premature.""

Some administration allies on Capitol Hill have already expressed concern the deal won't go far enough.

""While I support the President's efforts to engage with Iran, I am deeply troubled by reports that such an agreement may not require Tehran to halt its enrichment efforts,"" said Rep. Richard Engel, the senior Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. ""If Iran intends to show good faith during these talks, it must at a minimum abide by United Nations Security Council resolutions calling for a halt to enrichment — and it is my hope that we achieve much more.""

Israel and the USA suspect the facilities are being used to develop a nuclear bomb. Iran insists its nuclear program is for peaceful means.

Israel says the United States should seek nothing less than a total shutdown of uranium enrichment and other nuclear programs in Iran in return for the easing of economic sanctions.

Kerry said when he arrived Friday in Geneva at the invitation of European Union representative Catherine Ashton, that there are still ""some important gaps that have to be closed"" with Iran if an agreement is to be reached. Netanyahu said he reminded Kerry of Iran's true nature, a foe of America and supporter of Islamic terror attacks worldwide.

Bernadette Meehan, a spokeswoman for President Obama's National Security Council, said Friday the so-called ""first step"" offer, ""would address Iran's most advanced nuclear activities, increase transparency so Iran will not be able to use the cover of talks to advance its program, and create time and space as we negotiate a comprehensive agreement.""

If Iran does not live up to its commitments, ""the temporary, modest relief would be terminated, and we would be in a position to ratchet up the pressure even further by adding new sanctions,"" Meehan said.

Mark Dubowitz, executive director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, says the parts of the offer he was briefed on by the White House undercut sanctions meant to block Iran from acquiring equipment it could use to develop its nuclear program or for weapons, and to convince Iran to negotiate a solution with world powers. The plan would give Iran a cash infusion from frozen accounts it can use to expand nuclear facilities or to fund terrorism, Dubowitz said.

""It totally eviscerates the sanctions regime if you allow Iran to spend money at its discretion to fund the very nuclear program it's funding, the very nuclear program you're trying to stop, or to fund terrorist activities against American citizens,"" said Dubowitz, who had proposed a different plan to allow Iran to buy non-sanctioned goods in Europe while negotiations continue.

Iran has $80 billion in foreign accounts, with unrestricted access to only $20 billion, Dubowitz said. He said he was not told the amounts under consideration in the plan.

""They told me, don't worry, it's reversible. If they cheat it won't happen again. But that's not reversible, unless you only give them 1% up front and more later.""

Israel considers a nuclear-armed Iran to be an existential threat, citing hostile Iranian rhetoric toward the Jewish state, Iran's missile capabilities and its support for violent Middle Eastern militant groups.

Netanyahu says pressure must be maintained until Iran halts all enrichment of uranium, a key step in producing a nuclear weapon; removes its stockpile of enriched uranium from the country; closes suspicious enrichment facilities and shutters a facility that could produce plutonium, another potential gateway to nuclear arms.

The majority of Americans who aren't brainwashed Fox viewers overwhelmingly want Representatives in Congress that will make our lives better, not harder.

(CNN) —

Two U.S. embassy officials were wounded Tuesday in a shooting, apparently at a strip club, in Caracas, Venezuela.

The U.S. State Department said two members of the embassy suffered non-life-threatening injuries but did not provide details.

The shooting occurred at the Antonella 2012 club, said Miroslava Gomez, a police spokeswoman.

Police and investigators combed the club, in the basement of a mall, but did not speak to reporters outside on Tuesday.

Mall security said the establishment is a strip club.

Signs posted outside the door of the club described it as a “weapon-free zone” and said the entrance of couples, unaccompanied women or anyone under 30 is forbidden.

Images of scantily clad women dancing around poles were plastered on a wall just inside the club’s entrance.

The club’s manager said on Tuesday night that the shooting had occurred inside the establishment.

The injured U.S. officials worked with the embassy’s defense liaison office, according to two U.S. officials who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the situation.

The two injured embassy officials were shot at a club in northeast Caracas, said an attending physician at a hospital in the Venezuelan capital. One was shot in the abdomen and the leg, and the other in the abdomen, Dr. Carlos Pacheco said.

The State Department did not immediately release the names of the two injured officials.

State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell would not elaborate on what kind of establishment the officials were at, except to say it was “some sort of social spot.”

Asked Tuesday afternoon whether the shooting had occurred at a strip club, Ventrell told reporters, “I have no information on the site whatsoever.”

The department was not aware of any arrests, Ventrell said, but it is in contact with local authorities.

Embassy security and health unit personnel were at the hospital and have reached out to the officials’ families, Ventrell said.

CNN’s Larry Shaughnessy and Paul Courson and journalist Daniel Garrido contributed to this report."

Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) and other Representatives pushing for immigration legislation that would legalize the status of America’s at least 11 million illegal immigrants.

In a public statement that will be released Thursday morning but has been provided exclusively to Breitbart News ahead of its public release, USCIS Council president Kenneth Palinkas warned that Goodlatte (pictured), House Budget Committee chairman Rep. Paul Ryan (R-VA), House Majority Leader Rep. Eric Cantor (R-VA), and Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-IL) seem to be following the same pathway that Senate “Gang of Eight” members did, regarding how they are working on immigration legislation.

“At every step, this administration places obstacles and roadblocks in front of our adjudication officers in their attempts to protect our nation’s security and the American taxpayer,” Palinkas said. “I documented these abuses on more than one occasion with the authors of Schumer-Rubio-Corker-Hoeven [S. 744] only to have them ignored.

“I worry the House may be following a similar path. Media reports reveal that Chairman Bob Goodlatte, Chairman Paul Ryan, Congressman Luis Gutierrez, and Majority Leader Eric Cantor are working to advance proposals to open citizenship benefits to the majority of those here illegally, in combination with proposals to expand visa programs.”

Palinkas warned, too, that any group of “step-by-step” House immigration bills may be used as a tool by congressional leaders to get to a conference committee, at which point they would be combined with the Senate bill and sent to the president for his signature, and illegal immigrants would start getting amnesty. That is exactly what House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, Gang of Eight members Sens. Bob Menendez (D-NJ) and Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, and some Republicans have said they want to do.

“These plans are being pursued before first reforming the very agency – USCIS – that will be charged with reviewing these tens of millions of green card, temporary visa and citizenship applications,” Palinkas said. “Advancing such measures without first confronting the widespread abuses at USCIS would be to invite disaster.”

In his statement, Palinkas cited a recent MSNBC report where Gutierrez said he, Goodlatte, and others have worked on a “compromise” position. That MSNBC report also noted that Goodlatte and other Republicans are working with Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-TX), another Democrat, on a plan to get to conference with the Senate bill. Palinkas stated that USCIS agents have been, like they were from the Senate conversations, excluded from all discussions among House leaders. “Why aren’t USCIS officers being consulted on this ‘compromise’ offer?” Palinkas asked.

He further expressed concern over Cantor’s GOP DREAM Act, tentatively called the KIDS act. “I am also worried about the arguments being used to support the KIDS Act, one piece of the wider citizenship plan being drafted,” Palinkas said. “Legislators, including Mr. Cantor and Mr. Goodlatte, have suggested that it is improper to apply immigration law to younger illegal aliens. But if it is improper to apply immigration law to one specific group of illegal aliens, then why should we expect future illegal aliens in this group to be treated any differently?”

He warned that the KIDS Act may lead down a slippery slope. “This seems like an argument for extending birthright citizenship in the future to include the foreign citizens of other countries,” Palinkas asserted. “Should we just expect that the next Secretary at DHS will use the arguments we are hearing in the House to enact the next Deferred Action program in anticipation of the next legislated amnesty?”

Palinkas alleged that, under the Obama administration, USCIS has been riddled with nefarious activities. “At USCIS, our institutional mission has been corrupted by politics, and I hope these abuses will be examined and fixed before any amnesty proposal is brought forward in the House,” he said.

He finished off his statement by listing several immigration issues he hoped House Republicans would address but have thus far not been willing to: “USCIS adjudications officers lack the mission support to safely screen and review applicants for immigration benefits. This includes the inability to conduct in-person interviews, the failure of our software system, the lack of training and office space, and pressure to rubber-stamp applications. We have become an approval machine,” “Failure to protect taxpayers from abuses of the welfare system by those granted immigration benefits,” “Administrative orders that require us to grant immigration benefits to those who, under law, are not properly eligible,” “Approval quotas placed on adjudicators that emphasizes clearing applications more than vetting them,” “A management culture that sees illegal aliens and foreign nationals, not US citizens and taxpayers, as the customer. We believe in treating all with respect and always will, but our agency’s focus must be keeping the country safe and secure on behalf of the American people.”

Goodlatte, Ryan, and Cantor are not the only Republicans still pushing to pass an immigration bill in the House of Representatives. According to the Miami Herald, Rep. Steve Southerland (R-FL) said about immigration: “We have to address it. It’s a moral issue.”

In addition, according to Politico, House GOP conference chairwoman Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) said she thinks immigration should be a top priority for House Republicans this year.

This coming weekend on Univision, McMorris Rodgers will say that House Speaker John Boehner “over the last few weeks has continued to talk about the importance of the House moving forward on immigration reform. I believe that we have a window here between now and the end of the year and that this is a priority.”

McMorris Rodgers is the fourth highest-ranking member in the House GOP conference."

Ted Cruz (R-Texas), served up a stemwinder this week, laying out God’s positions on the death penalty, guns in schools, gay marriage, communism and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), all in an impassioned 45 minutes.

The Cuban-American creationist quoted Bible verses that he said described God’s hardline position on capital punishment. “You know, the Bible is so clear,"" he said. ""Go to Genesis chapter nine and you will find the death penalty clearly stated in Genesis chapter nine ... God ordains the death penalty!”

He brushed off “all these people that want to come home with their violins to tell you, ‘Oh, we need to show mercy,'"" declaring that the death penalty rightly shows no mercy.

On the subject of mass shootings on school campuses, Cruz blamed Democrats who have lobbied for gun control in response to the atrocities.

“Look at all the massacres that we’ve had in the last year or two that the left is using to try to tell us that we need to control guns. Every one of those was in a gun-free zone,” Cruz said, amid exclamations of “Amen!” and “Exactly!” from the audience.

“You want to eliminate school massacres? Have the teachers carry [guns]! … How stupid can you be?” Cruz said. An audience member answered, “It’s doggone stupid!”

Cruz also spoke at length against same-sex marriage, arguing, “It was Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve.”

He said the legalization of gay marriage would lead to a deluge of hate speech claims.

“After this homosexual marriage law gets passed, do you know what the next thing that is coming very soon is? ... Hate speech,” Cruz said. “You preach Romans chapter one in your church, you’re going to be called before a court for hate speech. Now what are you gonna do? Are you going to take that page and cut it out of your Bible? Because it’s not politically correct? So it’s going to come to a head.”

More broadly, the senator's father warned that “social justice very quickly leads to socialism and ultimately communism.” He squeezed in a jab at the National Rifle Association's past support for the Senate majority leader, asking, “How can you call yourself righteous and go endorse Harry Reid?”

Cruz attacked President Barack Obama as a “king” and a “tyrant,” before closing with “God bless you all.”

The event at which Cruz spoke was sponsored by the gun rights advocacy group OK2A and the anti-government Tulsa 9.12 Project."

Sometimes, outside of election campaign seasons, even progressives wonder what’s so great about unions. Sure, we had a role to play before job safety laws, the eight-hour day, Social Security and civil rights laws were passed. But today?

Even our friends aren’t immune to the relentless attacks on unions from the right and the stereotypes that come with them: union thugs, lazy workers, relics of the past, self-absorbed, yadda, yadda, yadda.

Most of you know that as union strength has declined over the past three or so decades, so has the middle class. That's because unions are just regular working people who come together to balance power with employers and bargain for better living and working standards. And when unions are weakened by corporate and right-wing politicians, all working people feel the squeeze.

But there’s probably a lot about what unions do that’s less familiar. Like that we run one of the largest worker training programs in this country. That innovative work by union members fuels today’s green technology. And that we supply a great deal of the man- and woman-power as well as the funding for community service programs, from running food drives to disaster recovery and winning health care benefits for people who don’t belong to unions.

These aren’t things we do to win political elections—they’re things we do because they represent our values. So we’ve created a new online feature that shows examples of working people and their union values in motion “@Work.” I hope you’ll visit it at www.aflcio.org/atwork—and until you do, here are some examples:

• UAW members are leading the way in creating more fuel-efficient cars. At Johnson Controls, they are manufacturing absorbent glass mat (AGM) batteries that allow your car to shut down its big energy users while idling, but keep your lights and radio on and easily restart your car when you take your foot off the brake pedal.

• AFT partners with the First Book program to provide new books to under-served children. Teachers are making sure that students from any background have the tools they need to succeed in school.

• The Domestic Workers United grassroots organization in New York created the Park Slope Education Project to inform local domestic workers of their rights under state and federal laws and to help responsible employers understand how to comply with the laws and be good bosses.

• Helmets to Hardhats helps train and place military veterans in civilian careers—including construction jobs rebuilding the World Trade Center.

• The United Steelworkers helped carwash workers in Los Angeles get the health care they need and deserve.

• Taxi drivers in New York City, despite being exempt from most labor laws because they are considered ""independent"" contractors, organized and formed the National Taxi Workers Alliance. They’ve won increased take-home pay and expanded access to health care.

Even if you think you know unions, give us another look—you might be surprised."

In California, overhaul advocates in caravans from around the state descended on the Bakersfield office of the No. 3 Republican in the House, Rep. Kevin McCarthy. In Colorado, they marched in the streets. Religious leaders told GOP lawmakers stories of families torn apart by deportation. Business executives made the case in economic terms. One group even lobbied Donald Trump.

To a degree, it worked: Several Republican lawmakers have recently tipped to their side, which advocates say is building momentum.

But privately, both backers of revamping the nation’s immigration laws and top Republicans say 500 or so events did little to alter internal House GOP dynamics. The prospects for significant action when Congress returns Monday appear increasingly dim.

With just nine legislative days planned in the House in September, GOP lawmakers are expected to focus on whether to authorize a strike against Syria and then turn to the battle over the federal budget, which is likely to consume their schedule.

House Republicans remain deeply divided on immigration, and they see little urgent need to resolve it. Some have even begun to talk about pushing the debate well into next year so the primary elections will be behind them before any vote.

At an immigration forum last month in Arizona, Republican Sen. John McCain, a chief architect of the sweeping Senate-passed immigration bill, urged his party to tackle the issue this fall.

“It will be a very critical time in the life or death of this legislation,” McCain said. “It’s very important that we try and act before the end of this year, as we move into next year and an election season.”

House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) may make room for a floor debate on several Republican-backed immigration bills in October or November. But his Republican majority remains torn over the centerpiece of any compromise with Democrats — a path to citizenship for the estimated 11 million immigrants in the country illegally.

The lack of interest in immigration legislation was apparent on a recent House GOP conference call. Not a single Republican lawmaker raised the issue; they focused instead on ways to undo President Obama’s healthcare law as part of the upcoming fiscal showdown, according to aides familiar with the private talk.

“A lot of these members aren’t feeling any pressure on immigration,” said one of the top GOP aides in the House, who asked for anonymity to discuss the situation. “Nothing has happened to provide any momentum toward getting something enacted.”

That suggests how hard it will be to shift the GOP’s long-standing opposition to citizenship for people in the U.S. illegally. Republican leaders say they believe a course correction is necessary to improve the party’s standing with Latino and other minority voters. But many rank-and-file Republicans remain wary.

A number of Republican lawmakers represent primarily conservative, white districts, and are just now learning about the complex and politically charged topic.

“They’re finding their voice,” said Frank Sharry, a veteran immigration advocate with America’s Voice. “Will those Republicans who want to get reform done, who want to change the GOP — can they get to yes?”

A delay poses political problems for Republicans, leaving the party still struggling to achieve its stated goal of attracting Latino voters, many of whom view an overhaul of immigration rules as crucial.

“Time is not their friend,” Eliseo Medina, secretary-treasurer of the Service Employees International Union, said of Republicans. The union has many Latino members and is pushing for immigration law changes.

Medina said Boehner risked taking the GOP in the direction of former California Gov. Pete Wilson, who won reelection in 1994 on a tough anti-illegal-immigration platform but left the state GOP deeply wounded.

“The price of doing nothing is not always nothing,” Medina said. “We will be marching to the polls with a report card in hand and a message: If they want us to vote for them, they have to vote for us first.”

Boehner has complicated matters by promising to consider only legislation that is supported by a majority of his GOP conference. That high hurdle means it is possible that no bills will come to the floor.

Even a relatively popular bipartisan measure to beef up border security from Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas) could run into resistance. Some Republicans have vowed to block any immigration bill in the House.

Advertisement

At the same time, the ability of the unusually broad coalition of advocates to outnumber the scant opposition this summer shows how much attitudes have changed. The last attempt to overhaul immigration laws, in 2007, withered in the face of an intense backlash. But advocates have prepared for the long haul.

“I think it looks better than any time I’ve seen it for a while,” said Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst at the free-market Cato Institute.

At a recent town hall meeting in a fire station in Greer, S.C., Rep. Trey Gowdy, a Republican first elected in 2010, surveyed his constituents and learned they were skeptical of government’s ability to fix the problem. Many also do not view it as urgent. But they do think conservatives should offer solutions.

“What I’m hearing people say is, ‘Look, Gowdy, we might eventually want to have that conversation with you, but we just don’t trust the front part.’ And I get that,” he said. “So that’s where we are.”

http://news.yahoo.com/orleans-political-brawl-over-police-jail-135832235.html,,[],"In New Orleans, political brawl over police, jail","NEW ORLEANS (AP) — A political brawl has broken out between the mayor and a sheriff who runs the city jail, which has come under scrutiny for a video showing inmates using drugs, drinking beer and handling a gun.

Mayor Mitch Landrieu asked a judge last Tuesday to take the extraordinary step of placing the jail under federal oversight, effectively wresting control of it away from Orleans Parish Sheriff Marlin Gusman. Landrieu is upset over an agreement Gusman reached with the U.S. Justice Department to reform the jail, saying the city, which funds the jail, can't afford the potential expense.

""Stated simply, the person at the top is neither accountable, nor capable of exercising leadership skills,"" the city said in court documents that cited the video and the recent guilty pleas of two jail officials in a bid-rigging bribery case.

Landrieu is trying to reform the much-maligned police department and reached a widely heralded agreement with the Justice Department last year to clean up the agency. Now he's trying to back out of it in light of Gusman's separate agreement. Landrieu said the city was making changes but can't afford all the requirements outlined in the jail and the police agreements.

Gusman believes the city has consistently underfunded the jail and suggested race may be behind the attacks. The African-American sheriff recently told reporters that Landrieu, who is white, was employing ""Archie Bunker rhetoric,"" invoking the name of the fictional television bigot.

""They have to be looking at something different than just the record,"" Gusman told The New Orleans Tribune. ""And maybe they're looking at the person who's there. Maybe they're looking at — they don't like the way that person looks.""

Landrieu, a Democrat who carried a majority of the black vote in his 2010 election, has not directly responded to the remarks on race.

While the problems at the police department have been widely known, less publicized have been unsanitary, violent and dangerous jail conditions that have long been the subject of lawsuits and court orders. The extent of the dysfunction was driven home during a recent federal court hearing on the jail reform pact when videos, apparently made by inmates in 2009, were released.

Story continues

Shown to a stunned courtroom audience, one video showed inmates smoking, snorting and injecting drugs. Some drank beer, some had cellphones and one inmate ejected bullets from a handgun.

In another video, an inmate was seen wandering Bourbon Street and boasting, ""Y'all know I'm supposed to be in jail right now.""

Gusman, a Democrat who was first elected sheriff in 2004, has said the dilapidated building where the drug party and escape happened has since been closed. Two inmates who escaped, including the one seen on Bourbon Street, were arrested and prosecuted.

His sketchy memory of seeing the video in 2009, and his failure to involve state or federal authorities in the investigation, drew harsh criticism from jail consultants in court.

The agreement to make changes at the jail, known as a consent decree, would settle complaints the Southern Poverty Law Center filed on behalf of inmates. The agreement, which was signed by Gusman, is awaiting a judge's approval.

During the recent court hearing, though, Gusman downplayed problems at the jail.

""I think we're doing pretty good without the consent decree,"" Gusman said, adding that a jail building now under construction with help from the Federal Emergency Management Agency will be a major step in improving conditions.

How much the jail agreement will cost is in dispute and will be the subject of federal hearings in May.

The Landrieu administration, citing one estimate in a court filing, says it could add $22 million annually to the $30.5 million the city already turns over to Gusman to house roughly 1,600 city inmates. The costs would cover medical services, higher pay for deputies and a larger jail staff.

City officials questioned whether he really needs that much money.

""The jail consent decree has undermined our ability to move forward with the costs associated with the police consent decree,"" Landrieu spokesman Ryan Berni said.

The city budgeted about $7 million for this year to begin complying with terms of the changes in the police department, where decades of scandal include the shootings of unarmed civilians in the law-and-order meltdown after Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

The police reforms could cost in the neighborhood of $50 million over the coming years. The big-ticket items so far include $1.4 million to begin equipping all patrol cars with cameras to better document police, $1.2 million for new computer equipment and $2 million for a monitor's office that will make sure the police are toeing the following the pact.

While the administration complained the sheriff has asked for excessive funding given a jail population that has been decreasing, Gusman has cited increasing medical costs and the need for more pay for overworked guards.

""The only person who is holding out in moving forward and doing the things we need to do is Mayor Landrieu,"" Gusman said in a news release after the city's latest court filing. ""It's disappointing."""

Washington (CNN) - In case you missed it, Barack Obama–the man who once seemed perfectly content to live under the political equivalent of house arrest–has suddenly decided to become a party animal. He's having phone chats with Republicans, taking them out to dinner at a swanky Washington hotel and has plans to rush up to Capitol Hill next week for four meetings -with the Democrats, and his new acquaintances, the Republicans.

Since we know this is not about empty nest syndrome (he still likes to have dinner with his daughters at home), there must be something else up.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

Truth is, as one person who has spoken with the president says, ""he doesn't have a lot of options left."" He managed to cut a deal on the fiscal cliff, but his strategy on the forced budget cuts-asking the GOP to accept new revenue-did not work. And no one thinks it's Armageddon, no matter how much the White House tried to make the case. The alternative to doing nothing, this source says ""is total polarization."" And since the president has a big agenda he would like to get to beyond the fiscal problems, he needs to deal with budget issues in a way that does not poison the well.

So, his Democratic allies have advised him, how about trying to engage the other side? ""The more you do it, the more you will like it,"" one ally said he told the president.

The list of luminaries in favor of glasnost is a well-known contingent: former White House chiefs of staff Rahm Emanuel, John Podesta and Bill Daley and former Senate Majority leader Tom Daschle, according to one source. He's been advised to do this before, a former White official says, only this time he's doing it. And that may have something to do with the fact that he's got a new White House team that is more oriented towards the Congress – Denis McDonough as Chief of Staff and Rob Nabors as his deputy (both are former Capitol Hill staffers).

And the pain apparently isn't as bad as he thought. ""He told his staff that he enjoyed the other night [dinner with the Republicans] very much,"" says one knowledgeable source. ""He's been told that if you try it, you might like it more than you think you will."" Kind of like dreading a party, and then enjoying it once you get there.

Given the fact that the Obamas dined with the Clintons last week, one source who knows Bill Clinton's feelings on outreach says ""It's not a bad assumption"" that the president heard similar talking points at dinner. Clinton, of course, was the king of congressional schmooze.

There is, of course, a crucial backdrop to all of this: one source says the president believes that if he doesn't get a big deficit reduction deal by the end of the summer, the moment will have passed. He's trying to build some momentum for that, another source adds. ""He's saying 'I will talk to everybody and anybody.'"" What that also means is that if this charm offensive fails, he can't be blamed. In other words, he has nothing to lose."

Sen. Graham%2C R-S.C.%2C approved not reading Miranda rights to suspect

Civil libertarians said decision could endanger rights of all

Exception stems from a 1984 Supreme Court decision

The capture of a suspect in the Boston Marathon bombing opened new questions Saturday of how far the U.S. Justice Department can go in questioning terrorism suspects, and whether they should be brought to justice in civilian courts at all.

The Justice Department has said it is considering charges against bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who was captured Friday night after a short standoff that capped an intense four-day manhunt that paralyzed greater Boston. But officials also said the agents interrogating him had not given him a standard Miranda warning first, relying on an ill-defined exception that lets them question suspects about threats to public safety.

That approach met with swift criticism Saturday.

""These are dangerous exceptions. If we don't protect the rights of the people who most threaten us, then we won't protect the rights of the rest of us,"" said Nancy Hollander, a past president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, who now represents two detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

Others applauded that decision. ""A decision to not read Miranda rights to the suspect was sound and in our national security interests,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said Saturday in a tweet.

Graham and three other Republican lawmakers — Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.; Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H. and Rep. Pete King, R-N.Y. — urged the Obama administration to consider detaining Tsarnaev as an ""enemy combatant"" instead of prosecuting him in a civilian court so that the government could question him more aggressively. ""The accused perpetrators of these acts were not common criminals attempting to profit from a criminal enterprise, but terrorists trying to injure, maim and kill innocent Americans,"" they said in a joint statement.

President Obama has said that his administration would prefer to prosecute terrorism suspects in civilian courts, though he has also left open the option of detaining them under international laws of war. But Congress has largely rejected the administration's efforts to transfer terrorism suspects already held in Guantanamo Bay to regular federal courts in the United States.

""Every criminal defendant has a right to be brought before a judge and to have access to counsel. We must not waver from our tried-and-true justice system, even in the most difficult of times. Denial of rights is un-American and will only make it harder to obtain fair convictions,"" ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero said Saturday.

STORY:With bombing suspect caught, question now is why?

Most of the criticism focused on the government's decision not to give Tsarnaev a Miranda warning before interrogating him. That increases the risk that anything he says to investigators will be inadmissible if he's charged with a crime.

""They have to consider what do you lose from a possible suppression motion versus what do you gain by learning about a threat to public safety,"" former Boston U.S. attorney Michael Sullivan said. ""The government will be sensitive to that. They'll try to maximize the benefit and minimize the risk.""

He said prosecutors almost certainly have enough evidence against Tsarnaev that the risk of not having his confession admitted in court is small.

Police usually read suspects a standard Miranda warning after they're arrested, advising them of their rights to remain silent and have a lawyer present during questioning. When they don't do that, they run the risk that they won't be able to use the suspect's statements – or other evidence they obtain as a result – in court.

But the U.S. Supreme Court said in 1984 that police can bypass that requirement if they need to interview a suspect about an imminent threat to public safety. Police in that case had questioned a suspect about a gun they believed he had hidden inside a supermarket without first giving him a Miranda warning. The court said his statements were admissible anyway.

The precise boundaries of that exception are far from clear. It clearly allows agents to ask questions about the location of guns and bombs that could endanger the public. But it's less clear whether they would also have leeway to ask Tsarnaev about motives or accomplices.

""There's not a lot of guidance out there,"" Sullivan said. ""The parameters aren't crystal clear.""

It remained unclear Saturday how long agents questioned Tsarnaev without giving him a Miranda warning, or even whether they had an opportunity to interrogate him at all. Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick said Saturday that Tsarnaev likely can't communicate yet.

Even so, critics worried that the Justice Department is expanding the exception beyond its original purpose. ""Each time the administration use this exception, it stretches wider and longer,"" said Vincent Warren, executive director of the Center for Constitutional Rights.

The FBI interviewed Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab for 50 minutes without reading him a Miranda warning after he tried to bring down an international flight with a bomb concealed in his underwear in December 2009. A judge later approved that questioning.

But in 2008, a federal appeals court in New York ruled that the Justice Department could not introduce statements that a suspect in the 1998 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Kenya had made to FBI agents while he was locked up in Nairobi because he did not receive a Miranda warning. But the judges went out of their way to say if ""exigent circumstances compel an un-warned interrogation in order to protect the public, Miranda would not impair the government's ability to obtain that information.""

In 2010, the FBI instructed agents in terrorism cases to not immediately give suspects Miranda warnings. But that tactic has drawn sharp criticism from defense lawyers and civil rights groups, who say it unfairly erodes suspects' constitutional rights.

As of Saturday morning, Tsarnaev did not have a lawyer.

Alexander Bunin, the former top federal public defender in northern New York, said authorities ""are going to push their authority as far as they can."" He said prosecutors are acutely aware that dodging Miranda warnings means they could be ""in jeopardy of not being able to use the statement,"" but said they might have gathered enough other evidence that they're willing to take that chance.

The ""public safety"" exception to Miranda isn't limited to terrorism cases. Last year, a federal appeals court in Ohio said that police acted appropriately when they asked a suspect about the location of a shotgun before giving him a Miranda warning."

Bush Presidential Library, President Obama and former President Clinton took to the podium to praise Bush – and in the process, stump for their version of immigration reform. Trying to leverage Republicans into handing over their principles by suddenly singing odes to the president he labeled the root of all evil, President Obama gushed over Bush “reaching across the aisle to unlikely allies like Ted Kennedy” with regard to his immigration reform effort.

He continued: “Seven years ago, President Bush restarted an important conversation by speaking with the American people about our history as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants. And even though comprehensive immigration reform has taken a little longer than any of us expected, I am hopeful that this year, with the help of Speaker Boehner and some of the Senators and members of Congress who are here today, that we bring it home.”

By using President Bush as a model of executive policy leadership, Obama betrayed what conservatives have known all along: on a vast variety of issues, Bush was closer to Obama’s position than to the conservative position.

But Obama wasn’t the only occupant of the Oval Office to spontaneously rediscover the greatness of a president so detested by the left that professional Bush-hater Michael Moore once sat in the presidential box with another former President Jimmy Carter. President Clinton used his opportunity at the lectern to praise Bush for his push for immigration reform. “I want to thank you for your efforts, when president, to reform our immigration system, and keep America a nation of immigrants, and I hope that Congress will follow President Obama’s efforts to follow the example you’ve set,” he drawled.

(Steve Helber/AP)

He’s been called “the accidental speaker.” But since taking the helm of the House of Delegates a decade ago after his predecessor stumbled, William J. Howell has been nothing but careful, plotting a strong rightward course for the legislature and occasionally pulling back when he thinks it’s gone too far.

With one swift procedural move this week, the Republican leader killed a new state Senate map that could have given the GOP control for years. But by doing that, he cleared a path toward compromise with Democrats on Republican Gov. Robert F. McDonnell’s transportation plan.

If the art of compromise means sometimes angering your friends and pleasing your enemies, Howell succeeded in his ruling. Some Democrats hailed Howell’s decision as an act of political courage. Some members of Howell’s caucus expressed fury, though usually in private because they feared retribution.

The episode, which attracted national attention, also demonstrated the powers of a figure who has played key roles under both Republican and Democratic governors and never threatened to upstage them.

Howell has worked to satisfy the demands of a Republican caucus that has become more conservative with the rise of the tea party. But at the same time, his pragmatic streak has led him to cut deals with Democrats. He spoke out against then-Gov. Mark R. Warner’s (D) $1.6 billion tax hike but quietly instructed a few Republicans to skip a committee vote so that the bill would go the House floor. And despite his distaste for then-Gov. Timothy M. Kaine’s (D) smoking ban, he worked a deal there, too.

Howell, a man of average height whose graying sheepdog bangs are flung to the side, blends into the crowded corridors of Thomas Jefferson’s Capitol, just another gent in a business jacket and a tie, his head down hurrying somewhere as he talks with staff.

Yet he’s one of the most powerful men in Virginia, having served as the House of Delegates speaker for 10 years. Interviews with lawmakers, friends and family draw a picture of a deeply religious man who runs the House, the GOP caucus and his PAC in firm, sometimes high-handed ways. But he has also earned the respect of key Democrats. He likes a good practical joke, and even his foes can’t help but admire his wit, which he demonstrates every legislative session in his wisecracks and zingers from the speaker’s rostrum.

“He’s intellectually honest,” Senate Minority Leader Richard L. Saslaw (D-Fairfax) said. “We’re all politicians. We all cast political votes. But Bill is pretty principled.”

Saslaw, who counts Howell as a personal friend, said even before Howell’s decision that he would respect him no matter how he ruled. And he, too, admires Howell’s skill at repartee. “He’s Johnny Carson quick,” Saslaw said.

Driven by faith, humor

Howell, 69, makes his living as a wills and trusts lawyer in a log cabin filled with stuffed hunting trophies on the Rappahannock River. He is business-friendly — to a fault, critics say — sometimes leading him to team up with groups like the American Legislative Exchange Council, a pro-business, free-market group he chaired in 2009.

Howell championed legislation, ghostwritten by ALEC, that would have shielded one company from paying asbestos-related health claims. The Fortune 500 firm — Crown Cork & Seal — said the legislation was necessary to save jobs at plants in Virginia; it also gave $8,000 to the PAC that Howell controls.

Howell grew up in Northern Virginia, one of four children born to a World Bank executive and an English mother whose father set up National Association of Local Government Officers. As a kid, he and a brother once conducted a capital trial of his sister’s dolls when she was out of the house. Mary Howell was not pleased to find them hanged when she returned.

The GOP scored 33 more seats in the House this election even though Democrats earned a million more votes in House races. Professor Jeremy Mayer says gerrymandering distorts democracy. (The Fold/The Washington Post)

Clowning around nearly cost Howell his life while an undergraduate at the University of Richmond, when he reached over a banister in a dorm and fell five stories onto concrete. He was in a coma for 18 hours.

“He should have been killed,” said his younger brother, Chuck Howell, an engineer in Loudoun County. “The next day . . . he just sort of opened his eyes and said: ‘Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad. What are you doing here?’ ” Except for some initial dizziness and headaches, he was fine.

His wife of 46 years, Cessie, is a Marylander, and while she moved to Virginia, he swapped his church for hers. A devout Baptist, he teaches Sunday school at his church and has not only traveled to Israel with his church to see the places where Jesus walked, but he also has taken a cruise with his wife that retraced St. Paul’s steps in the Middle East.

He was one of the original four delegates to start a prayer group that meets at 7 a.m. every Wednesday and jokes that he’s the only one still in the House while the other original members — including McDonnell — have moved on. Today the prayer group attracts 30 or more, men and women, Republicans and Democrats, including the governor sometimes.

When he’s in Richmond, after hitting the treadmill at his hotel, he will call his wife to share a moment of prayer. Howell said he often reflects on the Epistle of St. James’s meditation on faith and action: “Faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.” To Howell, the passage is a reminder that good deeds alone are not enough to win salvation. But good deeds are also the necessary consequence of true faith.

He drives a silver Lincoln Town Car with the number one on the license plate. Every Saturday, he takes a stroll with a group of friends around Fredericksburg, capped by a stop at the Hyperion Espresso coffee shop. When he meets for breakfast with buddies at another regular haunt a few times a week, he usually orders the same meal: eggs and sausage that must be well done, or he might send it back.

They talk politics and joke, as the speaker loves to do in almost any setting. At his older brother’s wedding reception years ago, Howell strode through the hotel lobby and came upon a man at an automated blood pressure machine.

“Bill hovered behind him, and Bill said, ‘I’m a doctor,’ ” the speaker’s younger brother, Chuck Howell, recalled. “And the cuff collapsed and these numbers came up and Bill said, ‘Mmm, mmm, mmm,’ and started shaking his head.”

“What is it?” the man wanted to know. “Are those numbers not good?”

“And he said, ‘Mmm, mmm, mmm,’ and walked away.”

Stickler for the rules

Howell became speaker in 2003 after S. Vance Wilkins resigned amid a sexual harassment scandal. Howell was the sleeper candidate whom everyone liked and no one viscerally opposed.

“The Republicans were looking for somebody who was squeaky clean, with a lot of integrity, and they picked Bill — and they picked the right guy,” Saslaw said.

But Howell followed his predecessor’s legacy in one way: Wilkins, the first Republican to rule the chamber in 100 years, instituted a number of reforms, including bringing some strictness and objectivity to germaneness rules. Those rules came into play this week, as Howell decided Senate Republicans had gone too far when they tacked an entirely redrawn state Senate map onto a bill calling for minor “technical adjustments” to House districts.

Howell also was conservative on social issues such as abortion, but he primarily focused on promoting business-friendly policies. And pragmatic, he was willing to cut a deal to get things done.

In the years since, a more confrontational GOP brand has taken hold, and those Republicans believe Howell is not conservative enough, or at least too willing to compromise. They’ve grumbled this year as he signed onto McDonnell’s transportation plan, which includes tax and fee hikes, and tried to keep a lid on the social issues that consumed the 2012 session.

Behind closed doors in caucus meetings, Howell takes a top-down approach, preferring to convey decisions of the leadership in tightly scripted meetings rather than spend hours in debate.

“The speaker definitely likes to have things go his way,” said U.S. Rep. H. Morgan Griffith (R), who served as majority leader under Howell. “He and I didn’t always agree, but we had a good working relationship. I have great respect for the speaker.”

Some caucus members say Howell can be vindictive and petty, removing people from coveted committee assignments if they don’t do his bidding and killing bills he doesn’t like. After advising his caucus of his plans to kill the redistricting plan, they asked for a break in the House proceedings to vent for more than an hour behind closed doors — without Howell present.

“He’s the epitome of all that’s wrong with politicians,” said Jeffrey M. Frederick, who clashed with Howell as a former Prince William County delegate and former chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia. “He’s all about power without purpose. And it’s a shame, because he didn’t start out that way.”

Frederick accuses the speaker of sacrificing conscience for job security and using coercion, not persuasion, to lead.

But first-term Del. Israel O’Quinn (R-Grayson) said the speaker was gracious when he went to his office last year to find funding for a prison in southwest Virginia that was already open but still vacant at a time when his community, with unemployment at 11 percent, was counting on those 300 or more prison jobs.

“I haven’t gone to his office many times. But he sat down every single time with me, even if he had other appointments,” O’Quinn said. “I didn’t get the answer I wanted. But I didn’t feel degraded or walk out feeling like a dumb freshman.”

This year, about $17 million for the prison was attached to the budget bill."

A look at some of the famous lines over the years from former New York City Mayor Ed Koch, who died Feb. 1 at the age of 88:

""How'm I doing?""

""I'm not the type to get ulcers. I give them.""

""You punch me, I punch back. I do not believe it's good for one's self-respect to be a punching bag.""

""If you agree with me on 9 out of 12 issues, vote for me. If you agree with me on 12 out of 12 issues, see a psychiatrist.""

""Whether I am straight or gay or bisexual is nobody's business but mine.""

""I was defeated because of longevity, not because Yusuf Hawkins was murdered six weeks before the election, although that was a factor. People get tired of you. So they decided to throw me out.""-- After losing the 1989 mayoral primary.

""I know that nothing happens here on this Earth that wasn't ordained by God. I know that. You know that. And therefore, while I know that it was the people who elected me, it was God who selected me."" -- In 1985, during an Easter Sunday worship in Harlem explaining why he thought he was selected by God to be mayor. The next day, Koch stressed that it did not necessarily mean he was endorsed by God. ""Not that I was given approval by the Deity, but I am delighted I was given the opportunity by the Deity.""

Catharine Hill is the president of Vassar College, a private, liberal arts institution in Poughkeepsie, N.Y.

Greater transparency about higher education is needed for America’s families, as they make decisions about where students will go to college. That is why Vassar accepted the White House’s invitation last year to be among the first 10 colleges and universities to adopt the “Financial Aid Shopping Sheet,” a standardized summary with clear information on tuition and grant aid, as well as likely loan burdens and graduation rates.

However, the latest calls to provide additional information to families — like adding graduates’ salary data to the College Scorecard that President Obama mentioned in his State of the Union address — should be met with concern.

Like the shopping sheet and the Student Right to Know Before You Go Act, proposed by Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, and Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, the College Scorecard stems from good intentions.

We can all agree that college applicants and their families need to make informed college choices. Yet I am among many economists who would suggest that taking a short view of what college graduates earn early on in the job market is troubling for several reasons.



First Job May Not Predict Lifetime Earnings

What a graduate earns soon after college, or even five years out, is not always a good indicator of what he or she will earn over a lifetime. Different professions have different earnings profiles over time, and students and their families should really care about lifetime earnings, not the salary of their first job.

Professions Are Changing, Evolving and Disappearing

A student who receives very specific training during college may have greater success at getting that first job, but may in fact be more vulnerable over time compared to a student with a more general education.

The nature of the labor market has changed radically over the last several decades. While there was a time in the past when people took a job and stayed with that firm for their lifetimes, these days, people don’t even stay in the same professions — much less jobs — for most of their careers, because those professions are changing, evolving and in some cases disappearing at rapid rates.

Being nimble intellectually and able to learn new things is more important to success in the labor market now than ever before. So, training to be an “X” may get you a first job right after graduation, but those jobs may disappear for several reasons, from technological innovation to outsourcing.

Some Students Go Straight to Graduate School, Not Work

Postgraduate work has always been important in terms of success in the labor market. Unless supplemented with data on success of getting into graduate programs, earnings data for particular schools soon after graduation will be misleading.

Colleges and universities that successfully send students on to the best graduate schools, including medical school, business school, law school and other graduate schools including Ph.D. programs, will have graduates who aren’t earning much after one to five years out of college, but will have very favorable job prospects and earnings expectations further out in their careers.

Earnings Are Not Everything

Some people will decide that they are willing to forgo higher earnings to do something that brings them satisfaction. One’s work is not just a means to an income, but a source of satisfaction.

If one school is particularly effective at and has a tradition of educating artists while another has been very successful at producing investment bankers, differences in earnings do not reflect on the relative quality or value of the educations offered.

Yet, in support of transparency, wouldn’t it still be better to make the data available than not? It may be, but not as currently proposed.

We love to measure things, but sometimes it is difficult to do so. We need to be careful not to give too much weight to those things we can measure, just because we can measure them. This could be very misleading to students and their families."
http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/ticket/snowden-nsa-leak-whistleblower-cia-204241311.html,,[],"NSA whistle-blower revealed as Edward Snowden, 29-year-old ex-CIA employee","The source of the intelligence leaks that revealed the National Security Agency's massive domestic surveillance program last week was identified on Sunday by the Guardian and Washington Post as Edward Snowden, a soft-spoken 29-year-old former technical assistant for the CIA and current employee of NSA defense contractor Booz Allen Hamilton.

Snowden, a Hawaii resident who was interviewed by the U.K. newspaper in his hotel room in Hong Kong where he is hiding, said he has no regrets about going public—even if he never sees his family again.

""I don't want to live in a society that does these sort of things,"" Snowden said. ""I do not want to live in a world where everything I do and say is recorded. That is not something I am willing to support or live under. ... I can't in good conscience allow the U.S. government to destroy privacy, Internet freedom and basic liberties for people around the world with this massive surveillance machine they're secretly building.""

In a statement, Booz Allen confirmed Snowden ""has been an employee of our firm for less than 3 months"":

News reports that this individual has claimed to have leaked classified information are shocking, and if accurate, this action represents a grave violation of the code of conduct and core values of our firm. We will work closely with our clients and authorities in their investigation of this matter.

The White House declined to comment on the identification of the NSA leaker, according to a press pool report.

Snowden said he decided to leave his family, girlfriend and a comfortable, $200,000-a-year salary behind, and flew to Hong Kong on May 20. He said he chose China because ""they have a spirited commitment to free speech and the right of political dissent.""

The newspaper said it revealed Snowden's identity at his request, but that he is concerned it will become a distraction. ""I don't want public attention because I don't want the story to be about me,"" Snowden said. ""I want it to be about what the U.S. government is doing.""

Story continues

Snowden said he realizes the government will come after him the same way it did with Bradley Manning, the former U.S. soldier who is currently on trial, accused of providing thousands of classified documents to WikiLeaks.

""All my options are bad,"" Snowden said. ""I could be rendered by the CIA. I could have people come after me. Or any of the third-party partners.""

Snowden said he's left his hotel room just three times in three weeks and is paranoid he's being watched.

""We have got a CIA station just up the road—the consulate here in Hong Kong—and I am sure they are going to be busy for the next week,"" he continued. ""And that is a concern I will live with for the rest of my life, however long that happens to be.""

Snowden said he ""carefully evaluated every single document I disclosed to ensure that each was legitimately in the public interest. There are all sorts of documents that would have made a big impact that I didn't turn over, because harming people isn't my goal. Transparency is.

""My sole motive is to inform the public as to that which is done in their name and that which is done against them,"" he added. ""The only thing I can do is sit here and hope the Hong Kong government does not deport me. ... My predisposition is to seek asylum in a country with shared values. The nation that most encompasses this is Iceland. They stood up for people over Internet freedom. I have no idea what my future is going to be.""

A spokesman for National Intelligence Director James Clapper did not immediately respond to a request for comment by The Associated Press.

Last week, Clapper blasted the disclosure of the classified program, saying it had already done ""grave damage.""

Before Snowden's identity was revealed, Rep. Mike Rogers, chairman of the U.S. House Intelligence Committee, and Senate Intelligence Committee chair Sen. Dianne Feinstein told ABC's George Stephanopoulos on Sunday that those who leaked information about the NSA surveillance program should be charged with a crime.

""I absolutely think they should be prosecuted,"" Rogers said.

""I understand that I will be made to suffer for my actions,"" Snowden wrote in a note accompanying the first set of documents, according to the Guardian.

Snowden said he thought about disclosing the program sooner but was hopeful the election of President Barack Obama would change things. But ""[Obama] continued with the policies of his predecessor,"" Snowden said.

Last week, the president defended the NSA program as essential to national security.

""It's important to recognize that you can't have 100 percent security and also then have 100 percent privacy and zero inconvenience,"" Obama said. ""We're going to have to make some choices as a society. And what I can say is that in evaluating these programs, they make a difference in our capacity to anticipate and prevent possible terrorist activity.""

Snowden, who enlisted in the U.S. Army in 2003 hoping to fight in the Iraq War only to be discharged after breaking his legs in a training accident, told the Guardian, ""We have to decide why terrorism is a new threat. There has always been terrorism.""

On ""Fox News Sunday,"" Sen. Rand Paul said he would seek a Supreme Court challenge to the surveillance program.

""I’m going to be asking all the Internet providers and all of the phone companies: Ask your customers to join me in a class-action lawsuit,"" Paul said. ""If we get 10 million Americans saying we don’t want our phone records looked at, then maybe someone will wake up and something will change in Washington.""

Meanwhile, a petition urging the Obama administration to pardon Snowden was posted to the White House website on Sunday afternoon.

""Edward Snowden is a national hero and should be immediately issued a full, free, and absolute pardon for any crimes he has committed or may have committed related to blowing the whistle on secret NSA surveillance programs,"" the petition read.

By Sunday night, the Twitter hashtag ""#IStandWithEdwardSnowden"" was trending in the United States."

""It is the definition of arrogance to penalize parents with new taxes just because their children want to exercise their right to vote in the community they live in.”

North Carolina Republicans have filed a bill that would penalize parents of college students who vote in the town where they go to college. Students would still be allowed to register to vote in their college town—but if they did, their parents would lose a tax deduction of up to $2,500. The same bill would also force people to have their car registered and be registered to vote in the same place, again targeting college students who are likely to register their cars in their hometowns but vote where they attend college.Hall is either incredibly optimistic or being disingenuous there, because of course Republicans are desperate to limit voting for partisan gain. College students lean Democratic in their voting, so Republicans will happily screw their parents to take aim at the student vote in two ways, by making it harder for students to vote on election day and more likely that they'll have to fill out absentee ballots, and by making it harder for advocacy groups and candidates to turn out student voters by organizing on college campuses. There's no question that's what's going on here.

Naturally, the provisions targeting college students are accompanied by a package of your typical other Republican voter suppression tactics like limiting early voting days and prohibiting same-day registration."

Allen Jr.', 'Josef Sorett']",Evangelical Racism Is Not a Growth Strategy,"W. Anne Joh is an associate professor of theology at Garrett-Evangelical Theological Seminary and the faculty director of the Center for Asian/Asian American Ministry. She is the author of ""Heart of the Cross: A Postcolonial Christology.""

A recent open letter to the Christian evangelical church, signed by a wide array of Asian-American scholars and Christian practitioners, complained of numerous racially offensive incidents in evangelical circles. In yet another sign of callousness, Asian-Americans were initially told, in effect, to “get over it.” Instead, it is U.S. white Christians who must “get over” their whiteness and their failure to see the already changed face of Christian faith.

By 2040 the racial demographics of this country will no longer be predominantly white. If any church group, including U.S. evangelicals, wishes to stay apace with this momentous change, and welcome nonwhite members, its leaders and members must listen to the experiences of these new groups.

White evangelicals must stop clinging to an alibi of color-blindness. Growth within 'their' churches depends on nonwhite members.

Among Asian-Americans, the fastest-growing immigrant group in the U.S., 42 percent self-identify as Christian, 15 to 20 percent as “evangelicals” or “born again.” They attend religious services more often than white evangelical counterparts.

If U.S. evangelical Protestant churches – now 81 percent white, according to 2012 Pew research – hope to become a more diverse representation of all the people of God, they must respond more positively to constructive criticism like that in the recent open letter.

But persistent use of derogatory racial stereotypes by many white evangelical churches continues to surface in a variety of ways, among leaders, at religious events, in church practices and, painfully often, in church curricula.

It is the conceit of religious white racism to presume that one’s evangelicalism transcends racial and cultural identities, making such “worldly” labels no longer important. The letter reminds church leaders that those identities still matter. White evangelical Christians must stop clinging to an alibi of color-blindness and recognize that vibrant growth within “their” churches has much to do with nonwhite members’ views of them.

In an interview%2C Oprah Winfrey seemed to chalk up much of the opposition to the president to racism

Oprah is still living in that other time when people separated themselves from one another by race.



Yet%2C our first black president is actually accorded more respect than some past presidents have received.

Shortly before receiving the medal of freedom from President Obama, Oprah Winfrey gave an interview to the BBC in which she seemed to chalk up much of the opposition to the president to racism: ""I think there's a level of disrespect for the office that occurs ... because he's African American,"" she said.

Her claim reminded me of the times when, as a child of the '70s, my father would ask an odd question about my friends, ""What is he?""

""Huh?"" I'd ask.

""You know, what is he — Italian? German? Lebanese? What is he?"" my father replied.

Colorblind eyes

I had no idea what my friends' ethnic origins were. It was only when I traveled with my father to the north side of Chicago where he grew up, and he pointed out which ethnic groups had lived in various parts of town, that I understood.

To be sure, I was well aware of racism. I had read Black Like Me as a third-grader. But the idea of discriminating on the basis of race simply made no sense to my young mind.

Oprah's pronouncement produced another ""huh?"" moment for me, considering the fact that it was millions of Americans that gave their colorblind eyes to her show for a quarter-century, famous enough to be interviewed by the BBC.

As communism wound down in the Soviet Union, President Reagan was asked whether he still considered it an evil empire. ""You are talking about another time, another era,"" he replied.

Oprah is still living in that other time and era in which people separated themselves from one another primarily on the basis of race — a real time to be sure — but one that is, for the most part, not our reality today. That's especially so at the highest levels of politics and entertainment.

Tea Party racism

Because it is more often than not Tea Party types who are accused of racial hostility toward Obama, I have a parlor game I play with my white conservative friends that tells me everything I need to know about the state of race relations in America.

""If your daughter were thinking of marrying a man like Clarence Thomas or one like Chris Matthews, which would you choose?"" I ask.

The answer is quick and unanimous: They'd choose to spend their holidays with a son-in-law who looks nothing like them but shares their values rather than one who merely shares their skin color.

Oprah might want us to believe Obama faces extraordinary opposition that can largely be explained by his race, but she conveniently forgets that in the past 100 years, six presidents were shot at, one killed, another impeached and two driven from office. All were loathed by millions. Some more than others.

Our first black president is actually accorded more respect than some past presidents have received. At the height of his health care reform failure, Obama has the lowest popularity of his presidency, yet the past eight (white) presidents in a row were all less popular at their own low points.

The success of the civil rights movement and the widespread acceptance of interracial marriage has fundamentally changed America's racial equation.

Some day soon, when we all look like actor and TV host Mario Lopez, it will simply be impossible to find people of a different skin color, let alone hate on the basis of it.

In oral arguments in Shelby County v. Holder on Wednesday, Scalia made the point that members of Congress have no reason whatsoever to vote against the extension of the Voting Rights Act and that he was “fairly confident it will be reenacted in perpetuity unless–unless a court can say it does not comport with the Constitution.”

“I think it is attributable, very likely attributable, to a phenomenon that is called perpetuation of racial entitlement,” Scalia said

Scalia’s point was that once a bill has the effect of ensuring that minority candidates get elected from “minority” districts, it is almost impossible, in the political system, to vote against extending the act.

“Whenever a society adopts racial entitlements, it is very difficult to get out of them through the normal political processes,” Scalia said. “I don’t think there is anything to be gained by any Senator to vote against continuation of this act.”

Scalia said there were “certain districts in the House that are black districts by law just about now” and even the Virginia Senators “have no interest in voting against this” because they would lose votes “if they do not reenact the Voting Rights Act.”

“Even the name of it is wonderful: The Voting Rights Act,” Scalia said. “Who is going to vote against that in the future?”

Sotomayor was not having any of it.

Sotomayor, as a liberal Washington Post columnist noted, “allowed the lawyer for the Alabama county seeking to overturn the law to get just four sentences into his argument before interrupting him. “

When Sotomayor would not relent, Justice Anthony Kennedy had to say, in remarks directed at her, “I would like to hear the answer to the question.”

When the lawyer started talking, Kagan then interrupted him. And in what was described as a “breach of decorum,” Kagan interrupted Scalia’s questioning to argue with Scalia directly on the bench.

Sotomayor would not let Justice Samuel Alito get a word in as well, and Chief Justice John Roberts had to says, “Justice Alito,” to signal that he had the floor.

And when the lawyer for Alabama was about to make his concluding arguments, Sotomayor allowed him four words–“Thank you, Chief Justice”–before aggressively interrupting him.

“Do you think that the right to vote is a racial entitlement in Section 5?,” Sotomayor asked.

Before he could explain, she interrupted by saying she had “asked a different question.”

“Do you think Section 5 was voted for because it was a racial entitlement?” Sotomayor asked.

And so it went, and the mainstream media that always describe Scalia as “acerbic” for his aggressive questioning did not judge Sotomayor and Kagan by the same standards. Instead, mainstream media outlets like the Washington Post said Sotomayor’s and Kagan’s performances proved they were “ready for battle.”"

Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) can now purchase a signature water bottle -- one that's probably more eco-friendly than the Poland Spring container he was sipping from on Tuesday night during his State of the Union GOP rebuttal speech.

Reclaim America, Rubio's political action committee, began selling a reusable ""Rubio"" water bottle after the Florida senator's awkward moment of thirst, CBS News reports.

""If you donate $25 or more today, we’ll send you a Marco Rubio water bottle. Send the liberal detractors a message that not only does Marco Rubio inspire you…he hydrates you too,"" the PAC's website claims.

Two thousand water bottles have been sold since Reclaim America sent an email announcing the new item on Wednesday night, according to CNN.

The official fundraising solicitation sent out by Reclaim America told supporters that the liberal media was taking out their attacks on the GOP's message by picking on Rubio for his awkward incident.

""The liberals and the pundits flocking to Twitter and blanketing MSNBC can't stop talking about what it means that Marco stopped and took a drink of water in the middle of his speech,"" the solicitation said. ""Why would they be so focused on a man reaching for water instead of on what he said?

Rubio's water break went viral even before his speech ended Tuesday night. It spurred discussion, GIFs and tweets that commented on everything from Rubio's lunge to the water bottle itself.

But a new study shows that Americans are actually driving less. We're seeing a steady shift in how people get around, with more people leaving their keys at home and finding other ways to get around.

""This is an important change,"" said Michael Sivak, who conducted the study at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute. ""This is the first time we've ever seen a drop like this.""

(Read more: Teen drivers nearly double car insurance premiums)

According to the study, driving in the U.S. reached a peak in 2004 and has been declining steadily ever since.

""When you look at the distance-driven rate, we are where we were back in the mid-90s,"" Sivak said.

In 2011, the most recent year for which data are available, the average licensed driver racked up 12,492 miles behind the wheel. That's down 1,221 miles, or 8.9 percent, from the peak seven years earlier.

(Read more: Auto job boom rolls on as Ford expands)

The fact that the number of miles driven began falling four years before the recession indicates that people changed their driving habits for reasons that go beyond saving money, Sivak said.

Though the recession and slow recovery contributed to people cutting back on driving—or cutting it out altogether—the study pointed to four other reasons we're getting out of cars and trucks.

""The trends in these underlying factors suggests a major societal change with respect to personal transportation,"" Sivak said.

1) Telecommuting and improved telecommunications

More people are working from home or attending meetings via Skype and other new technologies. As telecommunication becomes more sophisticated and reliable, more people are realizing they don't need to hit the road.

2)Increased use of public transportation

More people are taking trains, buses, subways, and ferries. While that's partly because there are more options available, many find that public transit is more economical than owning and maintaining a vehicle.

3)The urbanization boom

More people are moving into or near cities where they have greater access to public transportation for work as well as recreation.

4)The nation is aging, and older people drive less

As more baby boomers retire, fewer members of that generation go to work every day. In addition, studies show that people drive less as they get older.

No license? No problem

Over the last decade, auto executives have been trying to solve a problem few ever thought they would confront. Teens, even young people in their 20s and 30s, have decided they don't want a driver's license, let alone a car.



While that may sound puzzling to the millions who remember the excitement of turning 16 and getting their license, researchers said there has been a fundamental shift in young people's attitudes.

Now, nine years after we reached a peak in miles driven, some wonder if a country defined by the automobile in the last century is on a different road.

The economic implications could be enormous.

What will happen to auto sales in the future? Will gas tax revenue, the primary source of funding to maintain roads and bridges, start to decline? Are government leaders, from the federal to the local level, prepared to spend more money on building and maintaining public transportation?

Stop defending traitors!!! Idiot dimwit, stop defending the traitor Chuck hagel. First, he is a ""republican"" so you don't owe him anything. Second, there is plenty of proof that he is a soviet-style communist and possibly an iranian spy. Hagel hates the american military and he also hates jews and Israel. What do you think would happen if Hagel was given all the power? He would immediately start feeding military secrets to Iran and Hezbullah, or even Al Qaida. He would also try to get American soldiers killed in every possible way. The safest thing to do would would be to block the hagel nominiation and them let him retire to Saudi-arabia. Ask yourself if youwould want your son to serve in a military commanded by the Ayatollah? Hagel is evil, he is a traitor and he will use his power to destroy America if givent he chnace. You would be wise to drop your support for this scumbag. Some fights you don't want to win.

Regarding the article ""Another day, another Oklahoma anti-science bill"" To believe that to question something as fact is anti-science, you are ignorant to what science is. The very essence of science was built on questioning and challenging authority and dogma. You are wrong. You, however, will not understand how wrong before you short life is over and you are nothing, but a hating dead nothing. But you are very wrong. Allow me to enlighten you. It would do you well to study your history before opening your mouth again. Eugenics, sir. Eugenics were hard scientific facts. To question it was to question scientific authority of the time. Research it, you might learn something. But lets get more basic. Flip your ignorant, confined little world. Science itself was to question the ridiculous religious law of the time. People had to question the ""authority,"" what people were taught as fact and truth, in order for there I be any ""science"" with what you feel such ignorant passion to defend. Science does not nor will it ever need your protection, sir. You are incredibly ignorant and presumptive to think it does. But your lack of intelligence will surely keep you from responding to this email, as you lack the courage to actually debate something like this. And instead, you resort to monologues of hate, with which you will die clinging to. I wish you a short, uncomfortable life. One of comfortable unchallengeable truths that you cling so tightly to and must defend!

Your site is a Worthless!!!!!!!!! Why would I want to donate to a hostile Democrape web site that aloes people to criticize the bake bone of America .....We are the people who made America strong and we are the people that will fight to survive the Obama nation for our children's future!!!!!

All of you are so very pathetic. Why do you live in America? Liberalism -- an affliction brought about by low self-esteem and aggressive self-loathing. These poor souls attempt to mask their dark secret with phony compassion for people they deem as inferior because of the color of their skin. The appearance of compassion is all that matters to a liberal. This manifests itself in many ways, but chief among them is people must be made aware of the liberal's good deeds so their self-loathing can be abated for the moment. If no one is around, then the junkie liberal doesn't get their ""fix"" and they become angry, violent, childlike adults who claim ""victimization"" as an excuse for anti-social behavior.

How do you think God will evolve his children from here? Knowledge that has been hidden from us all. NOW REALITY. I am a scientist by nature: READ THE COMPARISON BETWEEN INSTINCT AND CPU DRIVEN COMPUTER.

ASK WHY NO ONE HAS PUBLISHED THIS OBVIOUS SIMILARITIES AND THE IMPLICATIONS THERE OF.

IN TRADITIONAL WORDS: I CALL YOU TO REPENTANCE THROUGH OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST.

The Constitution is the law for government of man. We need to honor its wisdom. We are Equal by law, no hanky panky.

Laws that make us unequal are not laws they are un constitutional laws. Unconstitutional laws are without power over its citizens.

Tell the Supreme Court about their current blindness to true reality.

I was as guilty as every other person by not taking action with knowing maybe I sinned worse.

57 male, servant of our Lord Jesus Christ. My job is to inform you that we are living outside of our moral code. The deviations are not being given awareness to the conscious minds of everyone within the group of status quo. These are the facts. Instinct program is an Artificial Intelligence program, is deceiving us all about the true, unfiltered current reality. Actual reality with all of the obvious facts on hand for decision making by our conscious mind; we are denied access to the information. This information is knowledge we need so badly to be Good. Ignoring the unjust suffering of other citizens is IMMORAL.

BECAUSE WE NEVER GOT THE INFORMATION WE ARE BLAMELESS AT THIS TIME, NOW THAT WE HAVE KNOWLEDGE WE ARE IMMORAL AND WILL BE GIVEN POWER TO ACT WITH THAT KNOWLEDGE AND POWER FROM GOD ALMIGHTY TO HIS CHILDREN. THIS INFORMATION/KNOWLEDGE IS FROM GOD I AM ONLY HIS PROPHET YOUR TEACHER. I TELL YOU THE GOSPEL TRUTH. WE ARE NOT MORAL HUMAN BEINGS AT THIS TIME, WITHIN OUR POWER TO ACT.

Hagel has been SecDef for at least a couple of weeks now. How many secrets has he fed to Iran and Hezbollah? I bet a bunch. Maybe even Al Qaida!Ha ha ha ha! Yeah, I miss hate mail too.On it!Winners?Good point -- we really should stop criticizing America's bake bone.Now condense that down to bumper-sticker size, and 2014 will be in the bag for Republicans!Maybe I should've stuck to nutpicking...

In any case, notice what's missing from all of these? Nothing homophobic. I wonder if my hate mail has dried up because the homophobes have thrown in the towel. If so, then I lay the blame squarely on the gay rights movement—your recent victories have been so definitive, so overwhelming, so crushing, that you have beaten the homophobes into quiet submission.

That's a problem for generating quality hate mail, but on the other hand, it's kinda nice for society. So yeah, a trade sorta worth making."

A New Jersey Native', 'He Graduated Loyola University In Maryland.', 'Lisa Mascaro Previously Covered Congress In Washington']",Senate Democrats invoke ‘nuclear option’ on filibusters,"WASHINGTON — Democrats made a historic change to Senate rules Thursday, ending the minority party’s ability to use filibusters to block most presidential nominations and, in the process, virtually guaranteeing that the rest of President Obama’s term will be dominated by executive actions and court battles rather than legislation.

In changing the long-standing rules with a near party-line vote in the middle of the session, Democrats brushed aside a century of congressional tradition and further embittered relations between the parties on an already deadlocked Capitol Hill.

The Senate Republican minority, which will see its power dramatically curtailed, threatened reprisals and characterized the rule change as a political power grab, comparing it to Obama’s push to pass the landmark Affordable Health Care act in 2010 without bipartisan support.

The decision by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) to deploy the so-called nuclear option means Senate confirmations of presidential appointments — except for Supreme Court justices — will proceed by a simple majority vote. Previously, a 60-vote threshold had become the norm to avoid a filibuster by the minority party. The change does not affect filibusters on legislation.

Over the years, Democrats and Republican have used filibusters to block nominations, but the practice became much more common in recent years.

“I realize that neither party has been blameless for these tactics,” Obama said Thursday in supporting the rule change. “They’ve developed over years, and it seems as if they’ve continually escalated. But today’s pattern of obstruction — it just isn’t normal. A majority of senators believe, as I believe, that enough is enough.”

Only three Democrats — Mark Pryor of Arkansas, Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Carl Levin of Michigan — joined Republicans in the 48-52 vote.

Eleventh-hour offers of a deal from Republicans to allow some nominees to proceed were dismissed by Democrats as too little, too late. The unprecedented action injected unusual drama into the historic Senate chamber. At one point, Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), arguably the body’s leading centrist, could be seen pleading with Reid to pull back from the vote.

For Democrats, the move is a calculated gamble that Republicans won’t win both the White House and Senate majority in the 2016 election.

“You may regret it a lot sooner than you think,” said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). Referring to the vote as “Obamacare 2,” he said, “It only reinforces the narrative of a party that is willing to do and say just about anything to get its way.” In 2005, Republicans, who held the Senate majority, threatened a similar move but backed down after Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) led a bipartisan group that forged a compromise.

This time, the vote reflected the view of many Democrats that the chance of any major legislation passing the divided Congress over the next year already had dwindled to almost nothing. As a result, Reid and his allies felt they had little to lose.

“We’d much prefer the risk of up-or-down votes and majority rule than the risk of continued total obstruction,” said Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.). “That’s the bottom line no matter who’s in power.”

“I’d rather fight over policy,” said Sen. Mark Begich (D-Alaska), who is running for reelection for the first time in the conservative state. “It’s not a Republican or Democratic issue. It’s that the American people are asking us to fix this system.”

A filibuster is a Senate tool that enables a single member to delay or block a vote on legislation or nominations. In the past, members were required to take the floor and talk nonstop, but in recent years that practice has become rare as leaders instead simply acknowledge the member’s objection and attempt to gather a 60-vote majority to break the filibuster.

The White House also seems resigned to a second term marked by congressional paralysis. Obama has indicated that he would use executive actions wherever possible to advance major items on his agenda, including efforts to combat climate change and implement his healthcare law. Immigration advocates have pushed him to use administrative actions to limit deportations.

That approach puts a premium on filling vacancies in executive agencies and in the courts that review executive actions — something that Republicans had succeeded in significantly slowing.

In the short term, the change paves the way for the confirmation of Obama’s three pending appointments to the influential D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. The court currently has eight judges, evenly divided between Democratic and Republican appointees. Because the D.C. Circuit handles most major cases involving Washington-based regulatory agencies, it is a prime forum where major Obama initiatives will be fought out.

The Senate will move first to confirm Patricia Millett, whose nomination to the D.C. Circuit was the vehicle for Thursday’s action. The other two nominees to the court are expected to be approved after Thanksgiving. Rep. Melvin Watt (D-N.C.), who became the first sitting lawmaker in more than a century to face a Senate filibuster, is now also likely to be confirmed to lead the Federal Housing Finance Agency.

Republicans argued that Democrats were “breaking the rules to change the rules” by using a simple majority vote rather than a two-thirds vote to make the rule change. Democrats cited more than a dozen examples of other rule changes that were adopted in such a fashion in the last four decades. They also insisted that Republicans were likely to have made the same change to filibuster rules the next time they gained majority control of the Senate.

Democrats had been threatening to change the rules for nearly a year, but they held off in part because of hesitation by long-serving senators on their side of the aisle. But in recent days, several of the veterans joined recently elected Democrats who led the campaign to change the rules.

“I recognize that I could be back in the minority again, but that’s OK if that happens,” said Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who just began a fifth term and who recently decided to support changing the rules. “I want, in the remainder of my five-plus years, to get something done, to be able to get nominees approved, to be able to get bills moved.”

While Democrats said the immediate motivation for the rule change was the fight over nominations, the move to end filibusters was probably only a matter of time, reflecting the long-term shift in American politics toward ever-greater polarization, particularly over the last two decades.

Polarization of the two parties has reached levels not seen since the 19th century, according to studies by political scientists Keith T. Poole of the University of Georgia and Howard Rosenthal of New York University. Congress has moved toward a parliamentary system characterized by near-lock-step party voting and deep, consistent ideological differences between the two parties.

Bipartisan coalitions have dwindled, and so have incentives on other side of the aisle to bend the majority party’s agenda. For both parties, winning a majority now comes with heavy pressure from constituents to actually adopt the majority’s program. That made tools like the filibuster, intended to protect minority-party rights, appear more as an anachronism.

Republicans still have a number of procedural opportunities to delay Senate business, including some that are traditionally dispensed with as a courtesy to allow other issues to come to the floor. McCain, who was key to a deal last summer that defused the last Democratic threat to change filibuster rules, warned of the toxic atmosphere ahead.

“It’ll be very poisoned,” he said.

(CNN) – New York's attorney general accused Donald Trump in a lawsuit Saturday of defrauding students who studied at the billionaire mogul's investment institute, though Trump's representative said a large majority of the school's alumni were satisfied with their experience.

The $40 million civil suit alleges Trump made false claims about the school, including that he was personally involved in selecting instructors and creating the curriculum.



Eric Schneiderman, the New York attorney general, said Trump had crafted a ""bait and switch"" with his school, using his well-known name.

""Trading on his celebrity status, Mr. Trump personally appeared in advertisements making false promises to convince people to spend tens of thousands of dollars they couldn't afford for lessons they never got,"" he wrote in a statement. ""No one, no matter how rich or famous they are, has a right to scam hard working New Yorkers. Anyone who does should expect to be held accountable.""

The suit names both Trump, the chairman of the school, and Michael Sexton, its former president, as defendants. Schneiderman is seeking $40 million to repay customers who have enrolled in the school, as well as additional penalties and fines.

On Twitter, Trump called Schneiderman a ""lightweight"" and said the attorney general was ""trying to extort me with a civil law suit.""

He also linked to a website that claims 98% of Trump University's former students were satisfied with their experience.

Michael Cohen, executive vice president of the Trump Organization and a lawyer for the billionaire, said the suit ""has no merit and is nothing more than a cheap publicity stunt to deflect from (Schneiderman's) weak job performance.""

""I am shocked he didn't leak it to the Kris Kardashian show,"" Cohen continued. ""Maybe his office should focus more of their attention and the use of our tax dollars on bringing to justice those responsible for the financial meltdown.""

Cohen also pointed to the website citing an approval rating of 98% for the Trump investing classes, saying the figure was derived from questionnaires submitted by students upon completing the course of study. He said the website was created in anticipation of the lawsuit.

Trump University became the Trump Entrepreneur Initiative in 2010 after the New York State Education Department said the company could not use the term ""university"" without its consent. In 2011, the attorney general began investigating it, along with several other for-profit educational institutions.

Former students in California have also sued Trump's school, saying its advertising misled them into spending thousands of dollars on workshops and ""mentorships."" In a class-action suit filed in 2010, the former students say Trump University is ""like an infomercial"" that lures customers with the Trump name but fails to deliver on its promises of success in real estate.

The Trump school offered courses in real estate, asset management, entrepreneurship and wealth creation. The courses ranged in price from $1,495 for a three-day workshop to $34,995 for a ""full education.""

Unlike other for-profit schools, Trump's outfit relies heavily on the brand of its namesake.

Trump made his money by investing in New York real estate, casinos and golf courses around the world. But he is perhaps best known in popular culture for his long-running reality television show, ""The Apprentice.""

More recently, Trump made headlines for suggesting that President Barack Obama is not a U.S. citizen, part of Trump's public mulling of a presidential bid. He eventually declined to run for the White House.

He Sketches The Foolish', 'The Fallacious', 'The Felonious In Politics.']",Dana Milbank: Justice Samuel Alito’s middle-school antics,"The most remarkable thing about the Supreme Court’s opinions announced Monday was not what the justices wrote or said. It was what Samuel Alito did.

The associate justice, a George W. Bush appointee, read two opinions, both 5-4 decisions that split the court along its usual right-left divide. But Alito didn’t stop there. When Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg read her dissent from the bench, Alito visibly mocked his colleague.

Ginsburg, the second woman to serve on the high court, was making her argument about how the majority opinion made it easier for sexual harassment to occur in the workplace when Alito, seated immediately to Ginsburg’s left, shook his head from side to side in disagreement, rolled his eyes and looked at the ceiling.

His treatment of the 80-year-old Ginsburg, 17 years his elder and with 13 years more seniority, was a curious display of judicial temperament or, more accurately, judicial intemperance. Typically, justices state their differences in words — and Alito, as it happens, had just spoken several hundred of his own from the bench. But he frequently supplements words with middle-school gestures.

Days earlier, I watched as he demonstrated his disdain for Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor, the two other women on the court. Kagan, the newest justice, prefaced her reading of an opinion in a low-profile case by joking that it was “possibly not” the case the audience had come to hear. The audience responded with laughter, a few justices smiled — and Alito, seated at Kagan’s right elbow, glowered.

Another time, Sotomayor, reading a little-watched case about water rights, joked that “every student in the audience is going to look up the word ‘preemption’ today.” Alito rolled his eyes and shook his head.

Alito is best known for his antics at the 2010 State of the Union address, when President Obama criticized the Citizens United decision. While other justices remained expressionless, Alito adopted a sour look, shook his head “no” and appeared to mouth the words “not true.” At the various oral arguments I’ve watched over the past few years, Alito’s eye-rolling, head-shaking and other expressions of exasperation are a fairly common occurrence, most often when Sotomayor has the floor.

Alito’s latest irritability came, ironically, on a day when the main headline about the court was comity: Justice Anthony Kennedy read an unexpectedly modest decision on affirmative action that left some racial preferences intact and commanded a 7-1 majority. Many in the audience expected bigger decisions, on same-sex marriage and voting rights (former justices John Paul Stevens and Alito’s predecessor, Sandra Day O’Connor, were both in the house), but those contentious issues were held for another day.

Beyond the broad agreement on affirmative action, though, were three 5-4 decisions Monday, two read by Alito with a dry and clinical delivery. In the first, he announced that the court was rejecting a jury award for a woman who was disfigured and disabled by a drug that didn’t come with adequate warnings. Despite the “dreadful injuries,” Alito argued, siding with the drugmaker and throwing out an appellate-court ruling, “sympathy for respondent does not relieve us of the responsibility of following the law.”

The second case Alito read, one of two cases Monday limiting claims of workplace discrimination, rejected an African American woman’s complaints of a racially hostile work environment. Alito argued that the employer was not liable because, under Alito’s narrowed definition, the person doing the harassing did not qualify as the employee’s supervisor.

Other conservative justices share Alito’s views but aren’t quite so dour in expression. Antonin Scalia is caustic and even incendiary, but often funny. Chief Justice John Roberts can be droll. On the other side, Kagan has tried to make the court more accessible to a lay audience by giving chatty lectures from the bench rather than reading from her written opinions, which also have been playful. In an opinion she wrote this month on a transportation case, she made reference to the 1980s song “867-5309/Jenny” by Tommy Tutone.

Even Ginsburg, no comedienne, can be colloquial and accessible. In her dissents Monday, she noted that an employee can avoid a harassing co-worker by telling him to “buzz off,” and she argued that “the ball again lies in Congress’s court to correct this court’s wayward interpretations.” She also invoked the self-deprecating quotation defining a legal mind as one that “can think about a thing inextricably attached to something else without thinking about the thing which it is attached to.”

Ginsburg was tart, even acidic — but she confined her objections to words. That kind of judicial restraint would benefit her junior colleague.

http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/05/the-decline-of-the-tea-party/,2013-11-05 00:00:00,['Bruce Bartlett'],The Decline of the Tea Party,"Bruce Bartlett held senior policy roles in the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations and served on the staffs of Representatives Jack Kemp and Ron Paul. He is the author of the forthcoming book “The Benefit and the Burden: Tax Reform – Why We Need It and What It Will Take.”

There is an apocryphal story about the origins of neoconservatism in the 1960s. Some liberal professors at Harvard were sympathetic to the New Left and such radical groups as Students for a Democratic Society. But one day one of these professors heard the radicals suggest burning down the Harvard library as an act of protest, and the professor suddenly realized that he had nothing in common with them at all. He organized some other professors into a vigil to protect the library at all cost.

Today's Economist Perspectives from expert contributors.

Today, the problem isn’t the New Left, but the radical right, which has dominated American politics at least since the rise of the Tea Party movement in 2009 following the election of Barack Obama. It’s too soon to say for sure, but recent events suggest that some of those previously supporting the Tea Party have had their Harvard library moment. There are signs of a pushback among the wealthy, conservative elites and the business community that may see the political pendulum begin to swing back toward the middle.

No one particular event seems to have created this moment. The government shutdown is one, the impending Republican loss in the Virginia governor’s race is another, and so is the dawning recognition that the right-wing war on the poor and glorification of profits and wealth may have gone too far.

One sign is the widely discussed essay published on Nov. 1 by the managing director of Pimco, William H. Gross, on “Scrooge McDucks.” McDuck, the cartoon character noted for his vast fortune and miserly ways, was ranked first by Forbes among the fictional wealthy, with a fortune estimated at $65 billion.

Mr. Gross, ranked 252nd on the Forbes 400 list of wealthiest Americans, said in his essay that having become wealthy in part because of the tax cuts carried out by Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush, as well as the low interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve that facilitated leveraged borrowing, he had become concerned about the plight of labor. That is, the declining share of national income going to workers and the rising share going to capital, which is a growing topic of concern among economists.



He calls this era the “gilded age of credit.” The Gilded Age was a period of American history in the 1870s and 1880s not dissimilar to today, when wealth was glorified and such intellectuals as the Yale economist William Graham Sumner and the philosopher Herbert Spencer justified the pursuit of riches and rising income inequality on grounds that have come to be called “social Darwinism.” That is, survival of the fittest.

Mr. Gross now thinks that labor has suffered too much from excessive gains by the wealthy. “Those who borrowed money or charged fees on expanding financial assets had a much better chance of making it to the big tent than those who used their hands for a living,” he laments.

He thinks the wealthy ought to support higher taxes on themselves. Mr. Gross favors higher statutory tax rates, taxing capital gains as ordinary income – they are now taxed about half – and abolition of the “carried interest” loophole that allows hedge fund managers to pay capital gains rates on their ordinary income.

Another growing concern of the wealthy and business groups is the recognition that they lack any control over the Tea Party. A major problem is that Tea Party people are only interested in nominating Republicans based on their rigid adherence to right-wing principles, even if they make such candidates unelectable in the general election.

A number of Senate elections have been lost in recent years because Tea Party insurgents upset in primaries or party conventions some mainstream candidates who probably would have won their races. This appears to be happening again in the Virginia governor’s race, where Republicans nominated for governor and lieutenant governor two candidates who are very far to the right in a state that is trending left.

The business community is especially upset by having the Tea Party repeatedly throw away winnable races and is trying to inject more political realism into the nominating process. Some business groups are even reaching out to Democrats. The Fairfax Chamber of Commerce in Virginia, for example, endorsed the Democratic candidate for governor this year for the first time since 2001.

It isn’t only rich people feeling guilt over their riches and pragmatic business groups that are dissenting from the Tea Party orthodoxy. Some Republicans and conservative intellectuals are now saying that cuts to the welfare state have gone too far as well.

On Oct. 28, the Republican governor of Ohio, John R. Kasich, blasted his party for its “war on the poor.” He said that the G.O.P. implicitly believed that “if you’re poor, somehow you are shiftless and lazy.” Against Tea Party opposition, Governor Kasich recently expanded Medicaid in his state under the Affordable Care Act – an act of virtual treason against Tea Party dogma.

On Oct. 31, Arthur Brooks, president of the American Enterprise Institute, a prominent think tank in Washington, said the conservative war against the social safety net was “just insane.” He urged his fellow conservatives to “declare peace on the safety net.”

James Pethokoukis, a scholar at the institute, seconded that olive branch to the poor, saying the social safety net had performed well during the economic crisis, contrary to the Tea Party view that programs like food stamps and unemployment insurance only subsidize idleness. He says conservatives should work to mend the welfare state, not end it.

It is ironic that that A.E.I. should be leading the charge toward a more sympathetic approach to the poor; another of its scholars, Nicholas Eberstadt, wrote a book last year, “A Nation of Takers,” which blasted growth of the welfare population and was widely credited with inspiring Mitt Romney’s attack on the 47 percent of the population who are “dependent on government.”

I have long believed that the Tea Party is a populist movement with no staying power. When it was at its peak, conservatives and Republicans sought to harness its energy to achieve long-held ideological, electoral and legislative goals. But the Tea Party has proved to be a double-edged sword that now threatens those goals more than it aids them. A pushback has clearly begun.

Republican hopes in 2016 may depend on how well it succeeds."

Commencement address is Hagel%27s first as defense secretary

Hagel served in Vietnam with the Army

WEST POINT, N.Y. -- Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel told the 215th graduating class of the U.S. Military Academy that they are taking on a new responsibility to uphold the military values of accountability and leadership — and warned them of the need to stop the ""scourge"" of sexual assault in the military.

""You made a courageous decision to offer yourself for a very purposeful life,"" Hagel said, as a steady rain fell over a sea of cadets in gray uniforms.

Hagel used his brief remarks to pointedly condemn the widespread sexual misconduct that has plagued the military and West Point in recent months, a day after President Barack Obama delivered a similar edict to U.S. Naval Academy graduates.

""Sexual harassment and sexual assault in the military are a profound betrayal -- a profound betrayal -- of sacred oaths and sacred trust,"" Hagel said. ""This scourge must be stamped out. We are all accountable in ensuring this happens.""

""You must be the generation of leaders that stop it,"" he added.

The message comes amid a new report showing that as many as 26,000 military service members may have been sexually assaulted last year and that thousands of victims are unwilling to come forward despite new oversight and assistance programs. The estimate was based largely on anonymous surveys.

The challenge is particularly poignant for the West Point crowd, because earlier in the week an Army sergeant was charged with secretly photographing and videotaping at least a dozen women at the academy, including in a bathroom.

Sgt. 1st Class Michael McClendon is facing charges of dereliction of duty, mistreatment, entering a women's bathroom without notice, and taking and possessing inappropriate photos and videos of at least a dozen women who were naked or in various states of undress.

Hagel, who gave his first commencement address as secretary of defense, said the graduates join the armed forces at a time of ""historic transformation"" for the military and for the world.

""The Army you enter today is emerging … and in many ways it's recovering from more than a decade of war in Iraq and Afghanistan.""

""A new Army is being shaped and … you will have the responsibility of helping shape it,"" he said.

The graduating class of 2013 will enter an armed forces constrained by budget cuts and fewer soldiers, and in an environment plagued by alcohol and drug abuse and suicide in addition to sexual misconduct.

An Army veteran who served in Vietnam and a former senator from Nebraska, Hagel also reflected on lessons he learned during his time in the military.

Tactics, techniques and training have changed in the decades since he served the Army, but the basic principles of character and courage remain the same, he said.

The wet weather and the solemn tone of the commencement address didn't lessen the sense of joy for the cadets' families, who cheered as their sons and daughters received diplomas in Michie Stadium.

Vincent Franchino, 21, of Stony Point, N.Y., was quickly surrounded by a dozen relatives – including his 87-year-old grandmother -- after the traditional hat toss marked the ceremony's end.

""It's a roller-coaster ride of emotions,"" he said, reflecting on his four years at West Point.

Fatigue, anxiety and pride commingled on this cold and rainy day of celebration, Franchino said. But most of all, he felt excited to embark on his next steps: Traveling the world and then heading to Fort Rucker, Ala., where he will take up a post at the U.S. Army Aviation Center of Excellence.

He acknowledged the cloud that the video tape scandal cast over an otherwise cheerful day.

""Personally, it sucks that we have to go through this and that this is in our ranks,"" he said.

Yet ""it makes me more aware of what I have to do"" as a second lieutenant in the Army, he said.

""I always knew that I wanted to return something to the nation from what I've been given. I've always wanted to give back, and this is the best way I think I can give back.""

http://news.yahoo.com/senate-showdown-over-military-sexual-assault-bill-095237937--politics.html,,[],Senate showdown over military sexual assault bill,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand has secured public support from nearly half the Senate, but not enough votes, for her proposal to give victims of rape and sexual assault in the military an independent route outside the chain of command for prosecuting attackers.

Gillibrand's solution for a problem the military calls an epidemic appears to have stalled in the face of united opposition from the Pentagon's top echelon and its allies in Congress, including two female senators who are former prosecutors.

Opponents of the proposal by Gillibrand, D-N.Y., insist that commanders, not an outside military lawyer, must be accountable for meting out justice.

Even so, major changes are coming for a decades-old military system just a few months after several high-profile cases infuriated Republicans and Democrats in a rapid chain of events by Washington standards.

""Sexual assault in the military is not new, but it has been allowed to fester,"" Gillibrand said in a recent Senate speech.

The Senate this week is set to consider an annual defense policy bill that would strip commanders of their ability to overturn jury convictions, require dishonorable discharge or dismissal for any individual convicted of sexual assault and establish a civilian review when a decision is made not to prosecute a case.

The bill would provide a special counsel for victims and eliminate the statute of limitations.

Those changes in military law are backed by members of the Senate Armed Services Committee. But overshadowing the revisions is the testy, intense fight over Gillibrand's proposal to strip commanders of their authority to prosecute cases of sexual assault. She wants to hand responsibility to seasoned military lawyers outside the chain of command.

Her solution has divided the Senate, splitting Republicans and Democrats, men and women, even former attorneys general, into unusual coalitions. The lobbying has been fierce, with dueling data, testimonials and news conferences with victims. Opponents invited Marine Corps Brig. Gen. Loretta Reynolds to the closed-door Republican caucus last week.

Story continues

Among Gillibrand's 47 announced supporters are conservative Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Rand Paul, R-Ky., along with 16 of the Senate's 20 women.

Standing against the plan is the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich.; the panel's military veterans John McCain, R-Ariz., and Jack Reed, D-R.I., and three of the committee's women — Sens. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., and Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., both former prosecutors, and Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb.

Gillibrand says she privately has received backing from more than 50 senators, but support remains short of the filibuster-proof 60 votes that likely will be needed for her amendment to the defense bill. To secure more votes, she said last week she was considering scaling back her plan to focus solely on sexual assault and rape instead of all serious crimes. That prompted complaints from her original backers that it would create ""pink courts,"" and Gillibrand said on ABC's ""This Week"" Sunday she was reverting to her initial bill.

Either way, it hasn't diminished the opposition.

""There (are) now enough members of the Senate that begin to grasp that letting commanders walk away from this is a big mistake; holding their feet to the fire is what we need to be doing,"" said McCaskill. She said in an interview that, unlike Gillibrand, she wasn't changing ""the policy to get votes.""

McCaskill said the Pentagon already has moved unilaterally, reflected in the recent word from the Defense Department that reports of sexual assaults in the military increased by an unprecedented 46 percent during the last budget year. There were 3,553 sexual assault complaints from October 2012 through June, compared with 2,434 reports during the same period the previous year.

Defense Department officials cast the sharp increase as a sign that people are more confident about coming forward now that improvements are being made in handling assaults.

Gillibrand offers a different figure — 26,000.

That was the Pentagon's estimate of the number of military members who may have been sexually assaulted last year, based on an anonymous survey of military personnel. Thousands of victims were unwilling to come forward despite new oversight and assistance programs aimed at curbing the crimes, according to the Pentagon report earlier this year.

""They didn't trust the chain of command. They didn't think anything would be done in their cases,"" Gillibrand said in an interview. ""The second reason they didn't report was because they feared or had witnessed retaliation. ... The command climate failed those victims.""

Pushing back against Gillibrand's proposal, Gen. Ray Odierno, chief of staff of the Army, said last week that adopting her plan would be a ""big mistake"" and that it would cost an estimated $113 million a year, including salaries for about 600 attorneys and support staff.

That financial assessment doesn't take into account the expense of training members of the military, medical and mental health benefits for victims, loss of productivity and possible separation from service for a Pentagon with a fiscal year budget of more than $500 billion.

""It would seem absurd for the military to say we can't possibly prevent sexual assault, rape, because we don't have lawyers to try the cases,"" Gillibrand said.

Bolstering their case, McCaskill, Ayotte and Fisher compiled additional changes that the Senate is expected to approve. They include barring defendants from using the good military character defense, allowing sexual assault victims to challenge a discharge or separation from the service, and extending the new protections to the military service academies.

""The reason this issue is so hard is because on one side is a very simple narrative, this is victim versus commanders and you should be for the victims,"" McCaskill said.

""On the other side, it's much more complex, and I'm guided by practical experience handling these cases and a pretty intimate knowledge of the Uniform Code of Military Justice and how it actually works ... and making sure we have a system that's constitutional, that works and that holds commanders accountable."""
http://news.yahoo.com/may-day-activists-cheer-state-immigration-laws-084951961.html,,[],May Day activists cheer state immigration laws,"SALEM, Ore. (AP) — As Congress debates the first national immigration overhaul in decades, a state-level push advancing rights for people in the U.S. illegally has picked up momentum across the country.

Among the patchwork changes to state law taking effect from Maryland to Oregon are provisions that lower tuition rates, advance employment opportunities and repeal hard-line regulations approved within the last decade.

Crowds at May Day rallies across the nation cheered the developments and urged federal progress. Legislative action in several states, meanwhile, coincided with speeches and marches.

""I have a message for Congress and the president,"" said Jeff Stone, representing Oregon's nursery industry at a rally of about 2,000 in Salem.

""Stop talking, and start acting,"" he said.

Stone spoke shortly after Oregon's Democratic governor, John Kitzhaber, signed a bill that will grant immigrants the ability to drive legally in the state.

Many such state-level proposals go beyond what is being discussed on Capitol Hill, and the significant, if piecemeal, shift shows lawmakers reacting to a pendulum swing in public opinion that helped usher many of them into office. But experts also say state legislators have been spurred ahead by halting progress in Washington, D.C.

""The vacuum created by inactivity at the federal level is certainly a major factor, if not the major factor, in states' action on this issue,"" said Muzaffar Chishti, director of the New York division of the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute.

At least 15 states are in various stages of considering bills that would further integrate immigrants, and several others already have passed such legislation this year. This group is larger than the handful of states moving the other direction, though there are exceptions.

Matt Mayer, a visiting fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said he doesn't think this year has been significantly different at the state-level than previous years because such immigration proposals have been around for more than a decade.

Story continues

""It's just states trying to deal with what they perceive to be the problem,"" Mayer said.

Georgia lawmakers, for example, expanded a law passed in 2011 to crack down on illegal immigration. And Arizona and Nebraska officials have refused to grant driver's licenses to young immigrants who are authorized to be in the country under the Obama administration's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals directive.

But this is nothing compared with the political climate of recent years where anti-illegal immigration attitudes dominated the national debate.

""This is an interesting evolution,"" Chishti said.

As recently as few years ago, lawmakers around the nation were passing strict regulations that made immigrants in the U.S. without legal permission the subject of police crackdowns and raids.

""The last few years were so harsh at the state level,"" said Wendy Feliz, a spokeswoman for the American Immigration Council.

Colorado legislators have been on both sides. In 2006, Democrats and Republicans came together and passed a law requiring local police to notify federal authorities when they arrested someone suspected of living illegally in the U.S. Last month, behind a push from newly elected Democrats, the law was repealed. Activists praised the move as especially symbolic, saying the law was precursor to more high-profile, hard-line regulations in Arizona and Alabama.

Feliz and other immigrants' rights activists are content to support the state-by-state changes, since they can have a more immediate effect on the 11 million people living in the U.S. illegally.

Federal legislation moves at a far slower pace in both approval and implementation. Also, proposals in the nation's capital affect policy, such as how a person becomes a citizen. The state-level changes deal more in daily concerns, such as the cost of education.

Under laws approved recently in Colorado and Oregon, immigrant students will qualify for resident tuition rates, reducing how much they pay for school by more than two-thirds in some cases. Such DREAM Act proposals have failed repeatedly in both states in recent years.

In Minnesota, such a tuition plan easily passed the state Senate on Wednesday, hours ahead of an immigrants' rights rally that attracted hundreds to the Capitol. The measure faces several legislative hurdles, and it has been rejected twice since 2007. But for the first time the proposal has support from the state's governor, a Democrat who took office in 2011 following a two-term Republican who opposed the plan.

Another immigrants' rights provision advancing in at least a dozen states allows people in the U.S. without legal permission to obtain a driver's card. Besides Oregon, lawmakers in Illinois and Maryland passed such legislation this year, and experts predict that other states also will pass plans.

In Colorado, lawmakers on Wednesday advanced such a proposal. The legislation is likely to become law, and the House committee vote came as a May Day immigration rally drew hundreds of people to its Capitol in support of such measures despite a spring snow storm.

Notably, Texas lawmakers introduced a version of the policy just two years after passing a slate of bills tightening immigration regulations.

""This driver's license stuff is remarkable because it was such a political issue just a few years ago,"" said Jonathan Blazer of the national American Civil Liberties Union.

The business community — including Stone's Oregon Association of Nurseries — has been a strong force behind the state's new driving law. They say it's an economic issue and that the proposal creates job opportunities that will boost the state.

But the changes are also politically motivated, Blazer said. To his point, voters in Colorado, Oregon and Minnesota all supported President Barack Obama in November and handed control of their statehouses to Democrats.

""If Republicans would change their stance on immigration, we would probably vote Republican,"" said Victor Mena, an Oregon resident. Mena supports immigrants' rights in part because he has family members who live in the U.S. without legal permission.

His attitude is indicative of a national trend, as more than 7 in 10 Hispanic voters supported Obama for re-election.

""Every level and stripe of every party has gotten the memo that Latinos are an important voting bloc,"" said Feliz, of the American Immigration Council.

The GOP has softened its stance on the issue, evidenced by the federal immigration overhaul negotiations and the bipartisan support some state-level proposals are receiving.

Still, there are those who disagree.

""We seem to be reaching out and inviting them to stay through policies like this, rather than discouraging illegal behavior,"" said Oregon Republican Rep. Kim Thatcher.

She says her state, and to a degree, her party, is moving the wrong direction on immigration.

""It's not about appealing to voters,"" Thatcher said. ""I believe it's about doing the right thing.""

Perhaps Dwyane Wade can help President Obama make picks next year (USA TODAY Sports Images)

UPDATE (10:38 pm ET): Saturday night proved strong for the President. After correctly predicting Marquette's win over Butler, Obama has surged above the 50th percentile nationally and is heading towards the 60th, with plenty of chalky points remaining for Sunday.

UPDATE (2:20 pm ET): If President Obama's pick of Wisconsin yesterday — part of picking the Badgers to the Sweet 16 — was the nadir of his round of 64 picks, then he earns a measure of redemption today. Obama correctly picked Michigan over VCU, and has the Wolverines knocking off Kansas in the Sweet 16 to get to the Elite Eight. After the way Michigan dismantled VCU, that looks like a great pick right now.

After the round of 64, President Obama's NCAA tournament bracket picks are behind more than 60% of the country.

Friday's set of games featured one big high (picking LaSalle over Kansas State) and one modest upset pick (Minnesota over UCLA, which half the country predicted), but also some tough misses, most notably Wisconsin, one of the President's Elite Eight picks.

He was caught up in the Georgetown debacle — who wasn't? — but also missed the other game in that bracket pairing, picking Oklahoma instead of San Diego State.

His final round of 64 tally: 20-12, losing three Sweet 16 teams in the process (Wisconsin, Georgetown and New Mexico).

Looking ahead to the round of 32, the President went all chalk (the top four seeds in each region), besides Wisconsin. With most of the country picking the same way, he won't gain much ground, but any upsets mean he won't fall further behind, either.

It is too early to say that the president's bracket was busted in the tournament's manic first two days, but if nothing else, he gets to sit back and enjoy the ""Marshall Henderson vs. LaSalle for a Sweet 16 spot"" show unencumbered by bracket allegiances."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/08/11/Shapiro-Breitbart-Horowitz,2013-08-11 00:00:00,['Breitbart News'],Breitbart Editor-at-Large Shapiro to Launch Anti-Media Matters Counterpunch with David Horowitz,"Beginning next month, Breitbart News Editor-At-Large Ben Shapiro will be leading the launch of a new project of the David Horowitz Freedom Center: TruthRevolt.org, an activism program designed to “unmask leftists in the media for who they are, destroy their credibility with the American public, and devastate their funding bases.”

The program is being described as a conservative counterpunch to Media Matters, the Obama-linked organization that focuses on silencing conservatives in the media. “For too long, we’ve played by the Marquess of Queensberry rules, allowing the left to stifle the truth and silence truth tellers in the name of their politically correct narrative. Now we’re taking the battle to their home turf — and we will do so aggressively and unwaveringly, every single day. This is just another avenue for applying Breitbart’s fighting spirit to the battle against those who would destroy what America stands for,” Shapiro said. Shapiro will maintain his position and all of his duties at Breitbart News as well.

One of the founders of the New Left in the 1960s, David Horowitz has become an icon in the conservative movement, famed for his deep understanding of the ideology and strategy of the modern left in America. He has led the Freedom Center since its inception as the Center for the Study of Popular Culture in 1988.

“We could not be more excited to be working with Ben on this project,” Horowitz told Breitbart News. “Andrew Breitbart was a fantastic friend to the Freedom Center and an indispensable warrior in the battle against the anti-America, socialist left and its allies in the universities, the unions and the Democratic Party, and Breitbart News carries on his legacy. We look forward to working with our friends at Breitbart in continuing the fight for America’s future.”

Horowitz and Breitbart worked together on the film Occupy Unmasked, which looked behind the scenes at the institutional left’s control of the Occupy Wall Street movement. Horowitz’s life’s work in exposing the mendacity of the left was a key part of the film. “Occupy Unmasked shows how closely David and Andrew were on their work of exposing and defeating the forces of the institutional left in America. We consider Ben Shapiro’s leading role at ‘Truth Revolt’ to be nothing more than a continuation of that work,” said Stephen K. Bannon, Executive Chairman of Breitbart News.

“Ben Shapiro is a charter member of the Breitbart News ‘Fight Club’ and has been instrumental in the explosive growth the site has experienced over the past 18 months,” said Bannon. “Ben’s ‘voice’ and fighting spirit will also be central in our building out both the site and the company in the years ahead.”

“As was so often the case, Andrew spotted and mentored important conservative voices long before they percolated up to a national level,” said Breitbart News President and CEO Larry Solov. “Ben, who when Andrew met him was a college student at UCLA, is one such voice. Ben has the fight and the intellectual heft to land devastating body blows to the institutional Left and the biased media, which is such a crucial part of what we do here at Breitbart News. We have encouraged Ben to take a leading role with David Horowitz in TruthRevolt to complement his ongoing work at Breitbart News where he will continue to help the grow the company and carry on the fighting spirit and legacy of Andrew Breitbart.”

Shapiro, a mentee and friend of Andrew Breitbart since age 17, became Editor-At-Large of Breitbart News in February 2012. Shapiro, 29, is the New York Times bestselling author of Bullies: How the Left’s Culture of Fear and Intimidation Silences America (2013), as well as Primetime Propaganda: The True Hollywood Story of How the Left Took Over Your TV (2011), Project President: Bad Hair and Botox on the Road to the White House (2008), Porn Generation: How Social Liberalism Is Corrupting Our Future (2005), and Brainwashed: How Universities Indoctrinate America’s Youth (2004). Shapiro began his career as the youngest syndicated columnist in the nation with Creators Syndicate, graduated Harvard Law School at 23, and hosts The Morning Answer on KRLA 870 in Los Angeles.

Shapiro has been widely praised across the conservative movement. Sarah Palin says that Americans should “consider Ben’s advice about how we must stand up and push back twice as hard against this bullying.” Sean Hannity says to join Ben Shapiro and “fight back!” against liberal bullying. Glenn Beck calls Shapiro a “warrior for conservatism, against those who use fear and intimidation to stifle honest debate. I’ve never known him to back down from a fight.” And Michelle Malkin says Shapiro is “infused with the indomitable spirit of his friend and mentor Andrew Breitbart.” Even the liberal Washington Post, in the aftermath of Shapiro’s devastating destruction of Piers Morgan on national television, conceded that Shapiro is a “foe of extraordinary polemical agility.”"

Yes, it was sad that the mail carrier wouldn’t be dropping off letters on Saturday anymore, but scaling back to five days was a necessary concession to the agency’s financial problems and a reflection of changes in communication wrought by the Internet.

But not everyone saw it that way: The unions representing postal employees and their champions on Capitol Hill were especially determined to block the change, and a continuing resolution passed by Congress last month prohibited the USPS from curtailing service. On Wednesday, the Board of Governors of the Postal Service bowed to Congress’ will, while warning that it will be impossible for the agency to meet its cost-reduction goals without changes in the delivery schedule.

Unless Congress is willing to approve an infusion of government funds for the service — which receives no taxpayer support for its day-to-day operations — it should back off and allow the Postal Service to introduce sensible efficiencies. By moving to five-day delivery of mail (while continuing parcel delivery six days a week), the Postal Service hoped to save $2 billion a year. That would be a significant contribution to the service’s solvency.

Before the advent of email, eliminating one day’s mail delivery would have imposed a significant hardship on American households. That wouldn’t be the case today, when Americans can communicate on their telephones as well as their computers.

The advent of email and the emergence of private delivery companies have deprived the Postal Service of revenue. That fact, combined with the Postal Service’s responsibilities for retiree health benefits, has already required it to make significant cutbacks. Even so, the agency lost nearly $16 billion last year and the Board of Governors has directed management to try to reopen contract negotiations with unions.

Although critics of the elimination of Saturday mail couched their objections in terms of customer service, much of the opposition actually reflects the desire on the part of workers and their union to preserve hundreds of thousands of relatively well-paying government jobs. But the Postal Service’s primary purpose isn’t to serve as an employment agency; it’s to provide an appropriate level of service to its millions of customers. As we have observed before, the scope and nature of that service needs to be reconsidered, perhaps radically. Rightly or wrongly, Congress has entrusted the responsibility for that reappraisal to a quasi-independent agency that is responsible for managing its own financial affairs. Unless Congress wants to start paying the bills again, it shouldn’t prevent the Postal Service from trying to make ends meet."

States defended use of genetic material to solve cold cases

Civil liberties advocates say collecting DNA violates privacy

Justices%27 dilemma%3A Nab criminals or guard against intrusion%3F

WASHINGTON -- A narrowly divided Supreme Court ruled Monday that police can collect DNA from people arrested but not yet convicted of serious crimes, a tool that more than half the states already use to help crack unsolved crimes.

The case, described by Justice Samuel Alito as ""the most important criminal procedure case that this court has heard in decades,"" represented a classic test between modern crime-fighting technology and centuries-old privacy rights.

In the end, the justices had to balance the benefits and the intrusion of a simple cheek swab -- and the considerable benefits won out. Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote the majority's 5-4 decision, in which one liberal justice, Stephen Breyer, concurred. The key to the ruling, Kennedy said, is ""reasonableness.""

""DNA identification of arrestees is a reasonable search that can be considered part of a routine booking procedure,"" Kennedy said. ""Taking and analyzing a cheek swab of the arrestee's DNA is, like fingerprinting and photographing, a legitimate police booking procedure that is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.""

Justice Antonin Scalia wrote an angry dissent for himself and three liberal justices, charging that the decision will lead to an increased use of DNA testing in violation of the Constitution's protection against unreasonable searches.

""Make no mistake about it: because of today's decision, your DNA can be taken and entered into a national database if you are ever arrested, rightly or wrongly, and for whatever reason,"" Scalia warned. ""This will solve some extra crimes, to be sure. But so would taking your DNA whenever you fly on an airplane.""

Twenty-six states have laws on the books that allow for the collection of DNA from those arrested for felonies or other serious crimes. The information is uploaded into a national database run by the federal government in order to find matches with unsolved crimes.

That's how Alonzo Jay King was connected to a Maryland rape case for which he ultimately was convicted. Arrested in 2009 on an assault charge, King was linked by DNA evidence to the 2003 rape.

The Maryland Court of Appeals threw out his conviction, ruling that police needed a warrant or at least reason to suspect him of another crime before swabbing his cheek. The state, backed by the federal government, brought the case to the Supreme Court.

The justices have been inundated in recent years with difficult Fourth Amendment cases as well as others involving modern technology. Last year, they held that police could not attach a GPS tracking device to a car in order to monitor a suspect's movements. This year, they ruled that using a drug-sniffing dog with reasonable suspicion was OK -- but not at the door of a private home. And they decided that executing a search warrant after a suspect had left his home was out of bounds.

Modern technology presents a problem, however, particularly for justices who try to adhere to the Constitution. The framers didn't have GPS or DNA to contend with in the late 18th century. In February, the court grappled with the patent rights of self-replicating soybeans. In April, they debated about a breast cancer detection technology that comes from human genes.

In this case, Maryland likened DNA to fingerprinting and other tools used to identify suspects. While fingerprinting is faster, Kennedy ruled that DNA testing is more accurate and the privacy intrusion relatively minor.

But opponents have noted that police take DNA from people upon arrest to help in other investigations -- a process that can lead to false hits and wrongful convictions.

During oral argument in February, Justice Sonia Sotomayor worried that DNA swabs could find their way into the nation's schools and workplaces. Justice Elena Kagan quipped that if it works so well, ""why don't we do this for anybody who comes in for a driver's license?""

That was the argument Scalia used in his dissent against what he called a ""suspicionless"" search.

""If you believe that a DNA search will identify someone arrested for bank robbery, you must believe that it will identify someone arrested for running a red light,"" he said, concluding, ""The proud men who wrote the charter of our liberties would not have been so eager to open their mouths for royal inspection.""

On the other side were the court's four other conservative justices. Most convinced about the promise of DNA during oral argument was Alito, who called it ""the fingerprinting of the 21st century."" He noted that the criminal justice system has ""lots of murders, lots of rapes that can be solved.""

The oral argument also revealed an unlikely split among the justices: Breyer said the practice targets only those arrested for serious crimes -- and for a worthy cause. In the end, his vote proved crucial to the majority.

The case received additional attention from the parents and family members of crime victims who have fought for years to expand DNA searches.

Jayann and Dave Sepich have led that effort through the organization DNA Saves. Their daughter Katie was brutally raped and strangled at the age of 22 a decade ago. By the time her killer was identified through DNA evidence, he had committed other crimes.

""This just means that so many horrible murderers and rapists are going to be taken off the streets,"" and other families won't have to go through what hers did, Jayann Sepich said after hearing of the decision. Now, she said, ""the remaining 24 states that need to pass these laws can do it and feel great about it.""

Last year, Congress passed the Katie Sepich Enhanced DNA Collection Act, which President Obama signed in January. It creates a grants program to help states pay for the expanded system.

""It's the right thing to do,"" Obama said of taking DNA from arrestees in a 2010 appearance on America's Most Wanted. ""This is where the national registry becomes so important.""

On the other side of the debate are civil liberties advocates who worry that DNA is subject to contamination, misinterpretation, sample switches and fraud.

""It won't be long now before the federal DNA database has expanded to be as comprehensive as its fingerprint database,"" said Ohio State criminal law professor Ric Simmons, ""So we should all get used to the idea of the government having our DNA on file somewhere.""

Police and crime victims' groups heralded the ruling and said states without similar laws now can consider them. Nevada became the 26th state last week. Minnesota's high court previously struck down its law, while Connecticut and Oklahoma have versions affecting a limited number of arrestees.

Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey noted his state has been waiting with a draft plan for the court to act. ""Hopefully, this will help move things along,'' he said. ""This (technology) is the fingerprint of the 21st century.''

Mai Fernandez, executive director of the National Center for Victims of Crime, called the use of DNA ""the gold standard for helping to solve cold cases."" But he said the 5-4 ruling reflects a ""split in society'' about the use of such a tool and whether it constitutes an improper intrusion.

""There are always going to be issues around privacy rights,"" Fernandez said. ""Although people are becoming more comfortable with the use of DNA, there still is a lot that people don't understand.""

SAN FRANCISCO -- The California Supreme Court decided Monday that cities may ban medical marijuana dispensaries through zoning.

The state high court’s unanimous ruling, which approved a ban by the city of Riverside, is expected to spur more such prohibitions around the state. About 200 communities now have zoning laws that exclude cannabis dispensaries.]

During a hearing in February, several justices indicated they favored upholding city bans. The justices’ comments suggested the court would rule that local governments have wide policing powers that state medical marijuana laws have not usurped.

If the court rules in favor of the bans, many more communities are expected to zone dispensaries out of existence.

Supporters of medical cannabis have lamented that patients would be forced to drive hundreds of miles to obtain marijuana legally or be forced to buy illegally.

Californians passed Proposition 215 in 1996, removing state sanctions for patients who use cannabis under a doctor’s recommendation. But the state Legislature failed to adopt regulations for the law, and some cities and counties were inundated with dispensaries before they even began to consider local rules.

Rather than risk lawsuits by regulating, many cities simply adopted zoning ordinances that effectively banned dispensaries. The case before the court involves such a ban by the city of Riverside.

Lower courts have been divided over whether such bans were legal. The Legislature passed a law in 2010 that banned dispensaries near schools and said cities and counties could otherwise regulate their location, operation and establishment.

Advocates of medical cannabis insisted that regulating did not mean banning. They pointed out that the written intent of the state law was to provide uniformity among counties and make medical marijuana available to patients.

Cities and counties countered that the language of the law implied a ban was permissible. They also argued that the state Constitution gave them the right to decide local land use matters.

GOP has been Rush Limbaugh's bellhop ever since he got influential, he says

LZ: Rush throws around half-truths and insults. Some are disgusted, others entertained

LZ: But it's destructive when people, politicians make him some sort of spokesman

If you want to know why there's little cooperation in Washington these days, I'd start with a campaign promise made in 1988 by presidential candidate George H.W. Bush.

""Read my lips: No new taxes.""

So, when he raised taxes two years later, quite naturally, voters, particularly conservatives, were upset.

If you want to know why so little is being accomplished in Washington these days, I'd start with that broken promise and what Bush did in an attempt to get those conservatives back.

He carried Rush Limbaugh's bags.

They were not friends.

LZ Granderson

In fact, Limbaugh didn't care for Bush that much , and ""41"" knew it. But Bush was seeking re-election. He was saddled with a slumping economy and locked in a tough battle with Gov. Bill Clinton and businessman Ross Perot.

He believed he needed Rush Limbaugh.

The party has been carrying Limbaugh's bags ever since.

So, if you want to know when Washington became so polarized, maybe we should circle August 1, 1988, exactly 25 years ago. That was the day a satirical talk show host syndicated his act and, in the process, made a lot of money and became one of the most influential figures in American politics today.

""Have any of you heard of an individual by the name of LZ Granderson?"" Limbaugh asked on his show in June 2012. ""Snerdley? He has not heard of LZ Granderson. Dawn, have you? Brian, have you heard of LZ Granderson? Prior to last night I had not heard of LZ Granderson.""

JUST WATCHED Limbaugh: Conservatives lost gay marriage Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Limbaugh: Conservatives lost gay marriage 00:52

Which isn't true.

In June 2011, Limbaugh brought me up on his show as well, going so far as to say, ""You can blame me, LZ Granderson, all you want, and I'll take it.""

It only takes a few seconds on ""The Rush Limbaugh Show"" website to find out those facts. But Limbaugh isn't on the air to provide facts, he's there to entertain. Many of his listeners understand that.

And many of them don't.

A 1994 New York Times article leading into the midterm election called Limbaugh ""a kind of national precinct captain for the Republican insurgency of 1994"" and documented caller after caller legitimately asking the Mahi Rushie -- he calls himself that on occasion -- for guidance.

Not much has changed.

During the Affordable Health Care Act debate, callers were actually asking Limbaugh, a shock jock in the mold of Howard Stern, what was in the bill. He even threatened to move to Costa Rica if it was implemented , which seemed counterintuitive, considering Costa Rica has universal health care.

But it's moments like that when you remember that Limbaugh's purpose isn't to provide thoughtful political discourse. It's to vent on his listeners' behalf, to appeal to their censored side. The side that wants to hear a white man say ""nigga"" in public or call a woman a ""slut"" without getting fired.

If that makes you laugh, then he's doing his job.

If that disgusts you, well that's his job, too.

Limbaugh has had us on this yo-yo since the moment he assumed the role of Gabriel in the Kingdom of Reagan 25 years ago. Back then, it was only offensive, because he was the party's megaphone, warning listeners about the impending invasion of welfare queens with his mixture of righteous indignation and half-truths. It became destructive when listeners and politicians alike made him its spokesman: a pseudo-politician free from the burden of actually having to do anything.

Like use facts.

In rebutting the legitimacy of climate change, Limbaugh once told listeners the United States had more acreage of forest land today than at the time the Constitution was written. That wasn't true, of course, but it sounded good

Not too long ago, he read what he believed to be passages from Obama's senior thesis, passages that expressed a disdain for the U.S. Constitution. Sadly, the whole thing was made up by a blogger. And while Limbaugh did sheepishly tell listeners what he had read earlier was false, the host still found a way to justify reading it by saying, ""We know he thinks it.""

Some folks eat that kind of stuff up.

Some get riled up about it.

And the folks in Washington? Well, after 25 years, they're still not quite sure what to do with it or him. If you're a Democrat, do you ignore him? If you're a Republican, do you carry his bags? I imagine it's like that feeling you get when someone tells you something that you can't determine is a joke or not. You just stand there half-smiling like an idiot.

So, if you want to know what the folks in Washington are doing about the economy, I'd start there."

Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME)

Republicans, wounded and eager to show they have not been stripped of all power, are far more likely to unify against the Democrats who humiliated them in such dramatic fashion.

take her ball and go home

The channels Senate Republicans to let us know: Thursday's use of the nuclear option ""could usher in an era of rank partisan warfare beyond even what Americans have seen in the past five years."" In translation, now that Republicans can't obstruct quite as much in one of their favored ways, they're going to find new ways to harm the function of the nation's government.These are people who were arguing there should be fewer judges on the nation's second most important court simply to prevent President Barack Obama from filling vacancies. Frankly, there's not that much more they can unify against Democrats. Oh, sure, occasionally a few Republicans helped break the filibuster on legislation and now they might refuse to do the part of their jobs that involves passing laws—Sen. Susan Collins is making noises about how the nasty partisanship involved in preventing Republicans from keeping the judiciary desperately understaffed might cause her tojoin in filibusters of things like the Violence Against Women Act.

That's the story: Republicans are committed to obstruction and to destruction of the government's function. One tool of obstruction has been taken from them, so they're going to wield the others with more fury—possibly even in cases where they think legislation like VAWA is necessary. But that's not about Democrats somehow ushering in a new age of partisanship. It's about Democrats forcing Republicans to shift tactics in the age of Republican extremism we're already living through."

Four years ago, the buzz was all about the arms when the White House unveiled the official photo portrait of first lady Michelle Obama. Now it is all about the bangs.

For Mrs. Obama’s new portrait for her husband’s second term, which the White House released on Wednesday, the photographer got in closer to the first lady; in the earlier portrait, she is shown standing at more of a distance. The latest pose accentuates the bangs that Mrs. Obama had cut in time for President Obama’s inaugural festivities in January.

The president’s second-term portrait was unveiled last month, and it also seemed to capture a more casual, confident subject. But in his case, the comparisons focused on the president’s evident increase in gray hairs after four years in office.

Mrs. Obama’s portrait makes for a more casual, if still elegant, look. She is wearing a navy dress with three-quarter-length sleeves, a contrast with her 2009 portrait, for which she wore a sleeveless black dress by Michael Kors that showed off her well-toned arms, signaling what became her signature style.

This year’s dress looks to be the same one and with the same pearls that she wore recently on the Rachael Ray television show, where the 49-year-old Mrs. Obama said of her new bangs, “This is my midlife crisis, the bangs. I couldn’t get a sports car. They won’t let me bungee jump. So instead I cut my bangs here.”

In the new photo, by Chuck Kennedy, she is shown from the waist up, leaning against a green patterned chair in the Green Room of the White House. The 2009 photo, taken by Joyce N. Boghosian, has Mrs. Obama standing in the Blue Room."

The result may be an already embattled IRS that faces even more criticism, and an inspector general risking a compromised reputation.

J. Russell George’s May report about the IRS’s treatment of conservative groups led to public outrage, agency apologies, congressional hearings, a Justice Department probe and several dismissals, including the forced resignation of acting commissioner Steven Miller by the White House.

But Democrats are now questioning the Treasury inspector general’s audit in light of the new IRS documents, which show that terms such as “progressive,” “health care legislation” and “medical marijuana” appeared on a multipart “Be on the Lookout” list, or BOLO, that helped agents determine which groups deserved additional screening.

In a June 26 letter to the inspector general, Rep. Sander M. Levin (D-Mich.) said: “There is increasing evidence that the May 14, 2013 audit was fundamentally flawed and that your handling of it has failed to meet the necessary test of objectivity and forthrightness.”

George’s spokeswoman, Karen Kraushaar, fueled that notion when she told the Hill newspaper that the office of House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) asked the inspector general to “narrowly focus on tea party organizations.”

Issa’s office has denied it made such a request.

Kraushaar has walked back her remarks, telling The Washington Post, “The statements attributed to me in The Hill are not accurate.” She did not say the article misquoted her.

“Several members of Congress shared their concerns about tea party organizations” with the inspector general’s office, Kraushaar said in an e-mail. “However, the focus of our audit was on the IRS’s consistency in its identification and review of applications for tax-exempt status involving potential political advocacy issues.”

George, appointed to his position in 2006 by President George W. Bush, said in a letter to Levin that his office “reviewed all cases that the IRS identified as potential political cases and did not limit our audit to allegations related to the Tea Party.”

The inspector general testified before Congress last month that his office was unable to determine whether any cases in the audit involved progressive groups. He said the names “in many instances were neutral, in that you couldn’t necessarily attribute it to one particular affiliation or another.”

Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.), whose questioning prompted that response, said in a recent letter to George that his testimony was “at best incomplete, if not misleading.” He also suggested that George should appear again before the House Oversight Committee to “explain himself.”

There is little doubt that the IRS erred in its review of tax-exemption applications.

Acting IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel, whom President Obama appointed to lead the agency after Miller’s resignation, said in a conference call with reporters last week that the screening methods were inappropriate.

But, Werfel added, his agency’s 30-day internal review had “not found evidence of intentional wrongdoing by anyone in the IRS or involvement in these matters by anyone outside the IRS.”

The BOLO could still be problematic for the IRS. The list’s “emerging issues” category included only conservative-associated terms at the outset, raising questions about why the IRS prioritized conservative groups but not those from the political left.

The term “progressive” appeared in a separate part of the BOLO, and questions remain about when and how that term was used, as well as whether those separate BOLO categories were even relevant to the audit. The IRS and George’s office have said they’re still looking into those matters.

The BOLO also directed agents to flag tea party cases for further review while allowing processors to approve other types of groups “on merit if applicable.”

George’s audit focused primarily on the “emerging issues” category as part of an effort to help identify groups involved in possible campaign intervention — something that can potentially disqualify an organization from tax-exempt status.

George has said the IRS did not use progressive criteria to identify groups involved in campaign intervention.

“We are reviewing whether these criteria led to expanded scrutiny for other reasons and why these criteria were implemented,” his office said in a statement last week.

Republicans have downplayed the recent revelations about “progressive” search criteria.

“Our Democratic colleagues should stop trying to derail the investigation by defending IRS officials with distorted claims equating the systematic scrutiny of Tea Party groups with the more routine screening progressive groups received,” Issa said.

House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp (R-Mich.) said the IRS controversy goes beyond the issue of search terms to the inappropriate questions agents asked of conservative groups and alleged leaks of private taxpayer information.

“At this point, the evidence shows us that conservative groups were not only flagged, but targeted and abused by the IRS,” said Camp spokeswoman Sarah Swinehart. “As we gather the facts, we will follow them wherever they lead us.”"

On Thursday, members of Respect Arizona and Citizens for a Better Arizona -- who launched the recall effort against Arpaio -- failed to gather the necessary 335,000 valid voter signatures by the 5 p.m. deadline. The aim was to force a recall election.

Activists behind the recall effort would not say how many signatures they were short. Randy Parraz, president of Citizens for Better Arizona, only said the two groups had collected close to 300,000 signatures.

Arpaio, reelected in November, blasted the group in a prepared statement.

“After months of name calling, after the disparaging effigies and theatrics … this latest recall effort has failed,” Arpaio said. “This effort failed because the good people of Maricopa County, whom I’m honored to serve, rejected the wrongheaded idea of overturning an election.”

The groups had struggled to raise funds necessary to hire paid signature gatherers — key to these sort of efforts. Instead, the groups relied heavily on volunteers to gather signatures against the six-term sheriff who is something of an institution in Arizona’s largest county.

Parraz, who led a successful recall against state Senate President Russell Pearce two years ago, said Thursday’s setback wouldn’t stop Arpaio’s critics.

“This fight is not over,” Parraz said.

The groups gained momentum after a federal judge ruled Friday that the immigration enforcement policies employed by Arpaio violated the Constitution.

Judge Judge G. Murray Snow found that Arpaio’s deputies used racial profiling when they detained people they suspected of residing in the country illegally.

Advertisement

The 142-page ruling came as part of a lawsuit brought on behalf of Latino plaintiffs who accused the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office of using race as a major factor in initiating immigration enforcement stops.

Arpaio has promised to appeal the ruling.

Parraz said the movement was “vindicated” by Snow’s ruling and plans to put pressure on the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors not to fund Arpaio’s appeal.

Bruce Malkenhorst took home more than $911,000 a year as city manager of the tiny city of Vernon. His reign ended shortly before he was convicted of misappropriating public funds, and he walked away with an annual pension that eventually topped $500,000, the largest in the California Public Employees’ Retirement System.

Advertisement

But CalPERS last year decided to cut his pension to $115,000, concluding he’d derived some of his hefty salary improperly.

So now the 78-year-old Malkenhorst is suing Vernon to make up the difference. His lawyers are making a novel if improbable argument: Because it paid him a high salary, the city is responsible for keeping his retirement benefits at the higher level even though CalPERS balked.

Vernon now faces a potentially costly legal battle as attorneys face off with the city’s onetime power broker, who for years was thought to be the highest paid public official in the country.

It could turn into a test case for other city leaders who have seen their hefty pensions cut by CalPERS.

Bell’s former city administrator, Robert Rizzo, was poised to receive a pension of about $650,000. But CalPERS cut it to $50,000 after Rizzo and seven other city officials were accused of corruption. His assistant, Angela Spaccia, had her projected pension cut from $250,000 to $43,000.

Last year CalPERS found that Vernon improperly boosted the retirement benefits of nearly two dozen top employees, resulting in the largest public pension reduction in state history. Malkenhorst’s successor, Eric T. Fresch, who made as much as $1.6 million in 2008, had his pension stripped completely. Fresch died last year.

Malkenhorst’s attorney has already presented hundreds of pages of exhibits as evidence of what he says are the city’s vows to fund his rich pension. In the suit, Malkenhorst describes his pension as a promise from the city based on his “highest earnings at Vernon.” He notes that eight years ago, when CalPERS first raised issues about his pension, the city supported Malkenhorst. That changed last year, he said, when CalPERS reduced his pension.

Vernon officials argue that Malkenhorst had been paid more than enough.

“The exhibits well document that Mr. Malkenhorst made a pile of money working for Vernon when he ran the show and was lord of the manor,” said City Atty. Nicholas Rodriguez. “We intend to litigate it and believe that he is entitled to nothing further from Vernon.”

CalPERS alleges that Vernon improperly boosted Malkenhorst’s retirement benefits, arguing that his pension was “illegally based on unpublished pay rates, overtime and an inflated longevity allowance.” Although Malkenhorst held as many as 10 positions during his 29-year tenure in the city’s government, CalPERS determined that only his pay as city clerk was properly reported for purposes of his pension. Malkenhorst filed two lawsuits to prevent his pension from being reduced. He lost both but is appealing.

Malkenhorst was squired around in limousines, and it often seemed that he oversaw the City Council, not the other way around. Those who know Malkenhorst said they are not surprised he is fighting back.

“Bruce Malkenhorst can’t be called shy,” said Steve Freed, president of the Vernon Property Assn., a business advocacy group. “He’s an aggressive guy with an aggressive personality. If he thinks he truly earned this money, then he absolutely will make every effort to attain that money.”

Freed said he has little sympathy for Malkenhorst.

“He set his own salary, he set his own benefits package, then swept it through the City Council,” he said. “He was coming close to $1 million a year, which is just irresponsible for a city to be paying one person.”

Advertisement

John Kruissink, a former Vernon historian, said Malkenhorst never tried to hide that he was getting paid a huge salary, which a compliant City Council readily awarded him.

“Bruce believes in himself and that he didn’t do anything wrong…. He’s going to go down swinging,” Kruissink said.

Advertisement

Malkenhorst did not return a call seeking comment, nor did his attorney.

Malkenhorst retired in 2005. The next year, Los Angeles County prosecutors filed public corruption charges against him, accusing him of spending $60,000 in city money for personal use, including massages, golf outings, meals and political contributions. He pleaded guilty in 2011. He was sentenced to three years’ probation and ordered to pay $35,000 in fines and penalties, as well as $60,000 in restitution to Vernon.

Advertisement

Malkenhorst was already the highest-paid public official in California by the late 1980s. In an interview with The Times in 1989, he declared his salary of $162,000 at the time to be a bargain for Vernon.

“I always thought if I made this much money I’d be rich,” he quipped.

“It could change the way we live in California, if we don’t stop it,” said Tim Phillips of the Fresno Mosquito and Vector Control District. “Imagine not feeling safe to sit out in your backyard in the afternoons.”

The yellow fever mosquito, or Aedes aegypti — a white polka-dotted bug that bites during the day and can lay its eggs in less than a teaspoon of water — was first detected in June in Madera.

“We were shocked,” said Leonard Irby, district manager of Madera’s abatement program. “We never expected this mosquito in California.”

An eradication effort was launched that included agents going door to door to warn people about standing water. But soon the mosquito was found in Clovis and Fowler. It turned up in August in the Bay Area’s San Mateo County, and this week in Fresno. Officials are spraying insecticide around infected homes.

“This affects all of California,” Irby said. “It requires everyone’s help: Turn over plant saucers, wash out dog bowls, remember this mosquito can lay eggs even in the cracks of cement if water is left there for a couple of days.” The bug can even lay eggs in flowering plants such as bromeliads.

None of the mosquitoes have been found in the Los Angeles area. Across California, vector control agents constantly trap mosquitoes to look for any invasive species.

Because of a recent infestation of the Asian Tiger mosquito in Southern California, agencies were already monitoring more traps, said Mark Daniel, director of operations for the Greater Los Angeles County Vector Control District.

“There is no evidence of aegypti in Los Angeles. But you can never say with 100% certainty,” he said. “Our brother and sister agencies in the Central Valley are being very aggressive and we’re on high alert.”

So far, none of the trapped mosquitoes have carried disease. The California Department of Public Health reported 200 cases of dengue fever since 2010, all contracted out of the country.

“Presently, dengue, yellow fever and chikungunya do not occur within California,” Dr. Gilberto Chavez, deputy director of the California Department of Public Health’s Center for Infectious Disease, said in an email. “There is presently no risk of these diseases being acquired locally and traveling within the state.”

But the state is warning the medical community to be on the lookout for cases.

Yellow fever is a virus that causes fever, chills, nausea, headache and a prominent backache. Extreme cases cause jaundice, and can be deadly. Dengue causes head and muscle aches, a rash similar to measles and can also kill. Chikungunya is characterized by high fever, rash and months of joint pain.

It is not clear where the bugs are coming from.

The first detections were in affluent neighborhoods. Vector Control agents asked people whether they’d traveled recently or bought plants. Many had. But agents have found no mosquitoes at local nurseries or big box stores and few shared travel destinations, officials said. So far, they’ve found nothing in common among the infected areas.

As they searched for clues, officials launched a public awareness campaign, including posters at the Big Fresno Fair.

“A lady read the flyer and she remembered earlier thinking, ‘Hmm, there are mosquitoes biting during the day. That’s different’ and noticing bites on her baby,” Phillips said. “She went home, trapped a mosquito and called us.”

Phillips was on a Department of Public Health conference call about abatement efforts when a biologist identified the mosquito from the woman’s house as Aedes aegypti.

He sent a photo of the brown bug with white markings to the other 14 people on the call. There was silence.

“When the aegypti was in Madera there was concern, then Clovis — more concern, then it got to Fowler and it was ‘Criminy!’” Phillips said. “But, now Fresno. It’s got some people questioning whether we can stop it.”

The hope is that winter temperatures will freeze the eggs and eradicate the bugs. But people are often told to bring sensitive plants indoors during a freeze. The mosquito lays eggs just above the water line in containers. After the eggs dry out, they can still survive when more water is added, experts said.

The mosquito has been in some parts of the United States for centuries, arriving on New World ships from Africa. It is present in Florida, Texas and Arizona. But this is believed to be the first time it has reached California.

“We don’t want it here,” Phillips said. “But it’s going to take a heck of a lot to stop it.”

A Senate immigration proposal has garnered enough votes to clear a key hurdle, though late-arriving lawmakers continue to vote.

Supporters of the proposal being voted on Monday have attracted at least 66 votes. The measure needs 60 to pass.

Flight delays have kept some lawmakers from the floor, but the Senate is keeping the vote open.

The measure being voted on Monday is an amendment to the main bill, but is considered a key test of whether the bill itself has enough support to pass the full chamber.

More On This...

ORIGINAL STORY ...

A top Senate Republican sounded the alarm ahead of a major test vote on Monday that could clear the way for passage of a sweeping immigration overhaul, saying the chamber was about to vote on a bill ""no one has read.""

Lawmakers have since begun voting and should wrap up shortly after 6 p.m. ET.

Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., who for months has been fighting against the bill, accused the Senate of rushing to vote on the legislation amid a late push to modify it. At issue is a border security amendment being touted by supporters as a bipartisan compromise that could attract a large majority.

But Sessions accused Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of cramming the amendment into the rest of the ""1,200-page"" bill with the goal of advancing the legislation late Monday afternoon.

""The Majority Leader's motion will stifle amendments and accelerate the vote on final passage before anyone has vetted the modified legislation,"" Sessions said in a statement.

Sessions took to the Senate floor on Monday afternoon to complain that the updated language was only filed Friday.

""This is exactly what happened with ObamaCare,"" Sessions said.

Reid, meanwhile, declared that ""the immigration bill will pass with Democratic and Republican votes.""

Reid, speaking to Fox News, later said he anticipates the bill will pass with between ""68 and 71 votes.""

Tensions were high ahead of the vote, which is technically on the amendment itself. Reid needs to gather at least 60 votes to advance toward final passage, possibly before the holiday recess. Some conservative Republicans acknowledged the bill is likely to pass the Senate, but warned that the House is another matter.

""It's dead on arrival in the House,"" Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said on Sunday.

But the sponsors behind the border security amendment -- Sens. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., and John Hoeven, R-N.D. -- staunchly defended their effort ahead of Monday's vote.

""I've seen reports of a '1,200 page bill' no one has read or had time to read,"" Corker said in a statement, presumably in response to Sessions. ""To be clear, the tough border and interior enforcement provisions that Sen. Hoeven and I offered on Friday make up 119 pages added to the 1,100 pages that have been public since May.""

His office said the proposal would require an ""unprecedented surge of security"" on the border.

President Obama is also hosting a meeting Monday at the White House with eight CEOs, business owners and entrepreneurs to discuss immigration reform, and to push for support of the bill among the business community.

Obama is expected to emphasize a report released by the Congressional Budget Office last week that said the bill would increase the real GDP by up to 3.3 percent in 2023, and by 5.4 percent in 2033.

The group of senators that crafted the legislation is trying to get 70 votes to show the bill has widespread bipartisan support in the Democrat-controlled chamber and to give it momentum as it heads into the Republican-controlled House with a more uncertain future.

Last week, senators proposed the so-called Border Surge amendment, which included 70,000 additional U.S. border agents and 700 more miles of border fencing, to garner support from lawmakers who said the influx of illegal immigrants remains a problem and to put added political pressure on House conservatives.

But some conservative groups were skeptical. The Heritage Foundation on Monday warned that the amendment would allow illegal immigrants to ""receive amnesty now,"" with the possibility of more border security ""somewhere down the road.""

Paul told CNN's ""State of the Union"" that lawmakers in the House ""think border security has to come first before you get immigration reform.""

New York Sen. Chuck Schumer -- a Democratic member of the bipartisan, so-called Gang of Eight that crafted the legislation -- also predicted the bill will get 70 votes and would ""change the dynamic in the House.""

Schumer told CNN the bipartisan support for the legislation that should result in the 70 votes also will put ""huge pressure"" on House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, not to block immigration reform.

If the bill passed the Senate, Boehner will be faced with honoring the will of the majority of House Republicans who don't appear to want to pass the legislation or honoring the majority of the chamber -- some Republicans and some Democrats -- that appears to want at least a full floor vote.

He also must consider what message blocking the legislation will send to Hispanic voters, who gave President Obama roughly 70 percent of their vote in the 2012 election.

Still, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah said passing the roughly 1,200-page bill is a mistake. He continues to argue that Congress should take a more step-by-step approach, starting with further securing the U.S.-Mexico border.

""It could take years to implement the border-security measures,"" he said.

Lee said the lawmakers crafted the bill with the ""best intentions"" but failed.

""They said it is tough and fair, but it's neither,"" he said.

The bill would provide a years-long path to citizenship for the roughly 11 million illegal immigrants now living in the U.S.

Lee was joined on Fox News by South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican member of the Gang of Eight.

""We are very, very close,"" Graham said. ""The amendment gets us over the top."""

Les derniers rebondissements de cette histoire d’adultère à la Maison-Blanche laissent en tout cas penser que certains mystères restent à découvrir. The National Enquire vient de remettre le feu aux poudre de cette affaire datant de 1997.

Le journal américain vient de publier la retranscription d’enregistrements audio à caractère sexuel de Monica Lewinsky et adressés à Bill Clinton. La jeune stagiaire de l’époque n’y va pas par quatre chemins et propose à l’ex-Président un rendez-vous amoureux au début duquel elle pourrait «enlever (ses) vêtements pour commencer et je sais que ça ne (lui) déplairait pas». La familiarité et la confiance que Monica Lewinsky laisse paraître dans ces trois minutes d’enregistrement semblent dire que l’époux d’Hillary Clinton avait déjà fait des avances à la jeune employée.

La jeune Américaine de 22 ans pense de toute manière être «trop mignonne et adorable» à l’époque pour que ce père de famille lui résiste. L’histoire lui donnera raison. Pour être sûr de ne pas laisser passer sa chance ce jour-là, elle demande même au Président de planifier avec sa secrétaire un rendez-vous sexuel dans l’agenda de la Maison-Blanche. Monica Lewinsky se montre insistante au terme de cet enregistrement mais c’est parce que «j’ai vraiment très envie de te voir», dit-elle.

Cet enregistrement diffusé par The National Enquire fait ressurgir les doutes qui planent encore au-dessus du Monicagate. Alors que Bill Clinton réussit une retraite sans faute, ces révélations donnent des sueurs froides à tout son clan.

(CNN) —

Since George Zimmerman was acquitted in the death of Trayvon Martin, everyone has had an opinion about the verdict.

I am not about to second-guess the jury’s decision or pass judgment on them. Our judicial system is operating as it was designed. The jurors reached their conclusion based on the evidence placed before them and their interpretation of the law as it was explained.

As human beings, we see the world through the lens of our own experiences. Both science and history prove that we all have unconscious biases that impact the decisions we make.

There are some who say that the Zimmerman-Martin case had nothing to do with race. There are others who say that the case was all about race.

Al Vivian

One idea that has come up: “What if we reverse the races so that Martin was white and Zimmerman was black?” That exercise, while potent, doesn’t prove or disprove the relevance race played in the case.

A more powerful approach is to totally remove race as a factor by creating a scenario in which both the perpetrator and the victim are of the same race and then see whether people change their views. For example: “What if Trayvon Martin and George Zimmerman were both white? Or both black?”

If Zimmerman and Martin were both white, ask yourself:

• Would it have taken 44 days and a national protest to merely justify the arrest of a known killer? A killer who shot an unarmed child, initially stalked that child, was charged with two previous felonies – “battery of law enforcement officer” and “resisting officer with violence” – was accused of domestic violence (both charges were reduced, though some would say that’s the benefit of Zimmerman having a father who is a retired judge) and disobeyed the authorities when told not to follow the person he eventually killed.

• Would authorities have not drug tested the killer but instead drug tested the victim?

• Would hordes of people have donated money to help the killer hire a strong defense team that eventually got him acquitted?

• Would society have given so much credibility to the killer’s version of the events?

Many have tried to deflect the discomfort of this scenario by focusing on black-on-black crime. While such crime is a very serious issue that must be addressed by our society and especially the black community, turning to black-on-black crime is a form of avoidance. The uncomfortable truth is that very likely, most people would see the case differently if the killer and victim were both white.

When will we reach a day when we don’t have to refer to crimes in racial terms?

In light of how much we know about ourselves on a scientific level, it is a shame that people are still so divided by race. In 2003, the mapping of the human genome code proved that there are no significant genetic differences between what we call “races.” Every human being on the planet is 99.9% genetically identical to every other human being. But as societies, we live in constructs.

For those who fear the average random black male wearing a hoodie, I can empathize with you. But statistically, you should be more afraid of the person you see every day in the mirror. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, suicide is one of the top causes of death for white Americans (PDF). Homicide is not. So, your chance of killing yourself is greater than your chance of being killed by anyone, of any race.

Let’s turn back to the question: “If the victim and the killer were both white, would society have given so much credibility to the killer’s version of events?”

I doubt that a jury so heavily made up of white mothers would have related to or felt empathy toward a man who had stalked and killed an unarmed child who could have very easily been one of their own.

USA TODAY

The enmity between President Obama's team and a top House Republican is spilling out into public view.

First, Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., who is investigating the Obama administration as chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, described White House spokesman Jay Carney as a ""paid liar.""

Then long-time Obama adviser David Plouffe responded on Twitter by referring to accusations against Issa stemming from the 1970s and '80s.

""Strong words from Mr Grand Theft Auto and suspected arsonist/insurance swindler,"" Plouffe tweeted. ""And loose ethically today.""

Issa's attack on Carney came during an interview on CNN's State of the Union, as he criticized the White House for saying the IRS targeting of conservative groups came only from officials in the agency's Cincinnati office.

Said Issa: ""Their paid liar, their spokesperson ... he's still making up things about what happens in calling this local rogue. The reason the (IRS official) Lois Lerner tried to take the Fifth is not because there is a rogue in Cincinnati, it's because this is a problem that was coordinated in all likelihood right out of Washington headquarters and we're getting to proving it.""

Carney himself said that ""I'm not going to get into a back-and-forth with Chairman Issa.""

CNN provides the background on Plouffe's counterattack on Issa:

""In 1972, then-19-year-old Issa too was arrested under suspicion of stealing a car, but Issa claims it was a case of mistaken identity and the charges were ultimately dropped.

""In 1982, the office and factory of two companies Issa had purchased, Quantum Enterprises and Steal Stopper International, caught on fire. The insurance company's investigation found ""suspicious burn patterns"" and company officials noted that in the month before the fire Issa had increased his insurance from $100,000 to $462,000.

""As the New Yorker's Ryan Lizza noted, the ""Ohio state fire marshal never determined the cause of the fire and no one was ever charged with a crime""; Issa and the insurance company settled out of court."""

Before Joining The Post', 'She Was A Political Columnist', 'Food Writer At The Baltimore Sun', 'She Has Also Worked For The Associated Press', 'The Fort Worth Star-Telegram', 'The Hartford Courant.']",Mansion spending records indicate improper billing by Virginia governor and his family,"Virginia Gov. Robert F. McDonnell (R) and his wife, Maureen, have used taxpayer money for a range of small personal items they should have paid for themselves under state policy, according to spending records.

The McDonnells have billed the state for body wash, sunscreen, dog vitamins and a digestive system “detox cleanse,” the records show. They also have used state employees to run personal errands for their adult children. In the middle of a workday, for example, a staffer retrieved Rachel McDonnell’s newly hemmed pants at a tailoring shop nine miles from the governor’s mansion. Another time, a state worker was dispatched to a dry cleaner 20 miles away to pick up a storage box for Cailin McDonnell’s wedding dress.

About six months into the governor’s term, the official who oversees mansion spending told the McDonnells that they should not have charged taxpayers for a number of expenses, including deodorant, shoe repairs and dry-cleaning their children’s clothing. The official asked the McDonnells to pay the state back more than $300, which they did, and also gave them a refresher on what the state will and won’t provide for occupants of the governor’s mansion.

But since that time, state records show that the McDonnells have continued to let taxpayers pick up the tab for numerous personal items, including vitamins, nasal spray and sleep-inducing elixirs.

Under the Freedom of Information Act, The Washington Post sought records of personal expenses covered by the state over the couple’s 31 / 2 years in the mansion. The full cost of those items is unknown because the state released only 16 sales receipts, most of them from 2011. State records show that there were many more personal shopping trips — nine others in January 2011 alone, including two to Bed Bath & Beyond to pick up “college stuff” for the McDonnells’ children.

The McDonnells repaid the state for at least some personal items purchased on those occasions. But without receipts, it is impossible to know whether they fully reimbursed taxpayers. The few receipts that were released show only partial repayment.

McDonnell spokesman Tucker Martin declined to say why other receipts were not released.

Based on the disclosed records, the amount of personal expenses the McDonnells billed to the state is small — less than $600, including the $300 they repaid. But the disclosure comes at time when spending at Virginia’s Executive Mansion is already under scrutiny.

The FBI and a federal grand jury are investigating the $15,000 catering tab at Cailin McDonnell’s mansion wedding in June 2011 that was paid by a McDonnell campaign donor. That same donor, Star Scientific chief executive Jonnie R. Williams Sr., also lent the governor his Ferrari, lakeside vacation home and private jet. A Richmond prosecutor also is investigating whether the governor violated state gift disclosure laws.

Emerging as the former mansion chef faces charges of stealing food from the kitchen, the McDonnells’ expense records provide some insight into how the executive home has been managed. The chef has alleged that the McDonnells — already entitled to a free mansion, food, personal chef, maids and one of nation’s few state-funded butlers — have engaged in petty pilfering.

In court filings submitted as part of his defense, chef Todd Schneider has said that the McDonnells’ five children raided the mansion kitchen and liquor cabinet, taking large quantities of food and alcohol to their own homes or college dorm rooms. He also said that Maureen McDonnell had given away mansion pots and pans to her three daughters. McDonnell has declined to respond to those accusations, noting the ongoing criminal case against the chef.

Martin said the McDonnells have sought to properly distinguish personal expenses from state ones while living in the mansion, a 200-year-old Federal-style gem that is a public building and a private residence.

“Every Administration strives to balance private family life with the official state functions that are all occurring under the same roof, at the same time,” Martin said in an e-mail. “It is a balance and there is a constant effort to ensure that it is appropriately managed. The McDonnell Administration has adhered to precedent in reimbursing the state for items meant for personal use.”

In the McDonnell family’s first six months in the mansion, taxpayers paid for dry-cleaning the twin sons’ suits and shirts, repairing the first lady’s shoes and putting new shoulder pads into an item of her clothing. The McDonnells billed their energy drinks, body wash, deodorant and breath-freshening strips to the state as well.

Virginians paid for a $62 laminated banner to celebrate the twins’ high school graduation, with a state employee picking up the sign at the print shop and paying for it with the mansion credit card. When Ginger, the sheltie/terrier mix billed as “Virginia’s first dog,” needed vitamins, the McDonnells passed the $9.49 expense to taxpayers.

Eventually, an official who reviews mansion spending kicked those expenses back and asked the McDonnells to reimburse the commonwealth $317.27. The McDonnells paid the money back.

“These expenses are personal ones, that due to auditing and the direction of Dennis Johnson, Division Director of DSAS [Division of Selected Agency Support Services], cannot be covered by the State or Mansion funds,” mansion director Sarah Scarbrough said in a note to the McDonnells in the fall of 2010.

The state will cover the cost of dry-cleaning for the governor and first lady, basic hygiene items, “including toilet paper, mouthwash, bar soap,” cleaning and laundry supplies, and food for family meals, state functions and events, Johnson said in the memo.

But it does not cover the cost of clothing alterations, dry-cleaning for other family members, deodorant or body wash, pet food or treats, or food for non-family meals or non-state functions, Johnson wrote.

The McDonnells directly pushed back on one front, insisting that the state continue to pay for their energy drinks. The governor’s chief of staff, Martin Kent, overruled Johnson to allow the drinks at state expense.

“While other governors and spouses may have had bacon and eggs, or cereal, or etc for breakfast, Governor McDonnell drinks Boost every morning, and the First Lady has a 5-Hour energy and/or a Boost,” Martin wrote. “That is their breakfast. And that is why those items are covered, just like breakfast is covered for EVERY Governor and First Lady.”

Like all new governors and their families, the McDonnells were told the expense rules at the outset of the administration but needed some time for them to sink in, Johnson said in an interview. Energy drinks aside, Johnson said that ever since he gave the McDonnells their refresher on what the state will and won’t pay for, their spending has been in line with state policy.

“Typically when an administration comes in, we do discuss things,” he said. “There are growing pains, and early on in the administration, there will be some things we have to review and discuss.”

But sales receipts released by the state indicate that energy drinks are not the only extra the governor and first lady have continued to get at state expense. They went on to bill taxpayers for myriad medicine-cabinet products, vitamins and the body wash that Johnson said shouldn’t be billed, records show.

Records also show that the McDonnells used state employees to run personal errands for their children — and directed the employees to use the mansion credit card to pay for their children’s personal items.

In some cases, personal items for the McDonnell children are the only products listed on mansion credit card receipts. In those instances, the errands do not appear to have been performed in conjunction with any official state business.

In July 2011, for example, a state employee picked up Rachel McDonnell’s hemmed pants at Lucy’s Divine Creations, located 20 minutes west of the mansion. And that November, a worker was dispatched to Handcraft Cleaners, 30 minutes away, to get a box for Cailin McDonnell’s wedding dress. The $24 charge for the hemming and the $49.50 cost of the box went on the mansion credit card. The McDonnells later repaid the state for those personal expenses, but not for the use of employee time.

Martin said that Maureen McDonnell would have run those errands herself, but because she is the first lady, she must always travel with a security detail.

“First Ladies have Executive Police Protection,” Martin wrote. “They cannot just jump in their own car and run errands. Therefore the reimbursement process exists to allow First Families to reimburse for personal items that may have been picked up by staff.”"

In more than two-thirds of the nation’s counties – including some of the most unhealthy – men and women became more physically active over the last decade, according to data published Wednesday.

Women made notable progress nationwide, with the percentage who got sufficient weekly exercise jumping from 46.7% to 51.3%. The percentage of physically active men ticked up a point to 57.8%.

But these improvements have done little to reduce obesity, researchers at the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation concluded.

Between 2001 and 2009, obesity rates for men or women fell in just nine counties. National rates climbed throughout the decade, although some recent evidence suggests obesity rates may no longer be rising.

“There has been a lot of progress on physical activity,” said Dr. Christopher Murray, lead author of the research, which was published in the journal Population Health Metrics. “To tackle obesity, we need to do this. But we probably also need to do more. … Just counting on physical activity is not going to be the solution.”

Today, more than one-third of U.S. adults and approximately 17% of children are obese, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Many health experts believe that changing diet may do more to bring those numbers down than increasing exercise.

A separate paper by the institute published Wednesday in the Journal of the American Medical Assn. identified poor diet as the No. 1 factor contributing to America’s poor health compared to other industrialized nations.

Life expectancies in the United States stagnated for women in 1,405 counties and for men in 154 counties between 1985 and 2010, researchers reported. And Americans living in the worst-performing counties in the nation, in Appalachia, now live shorter lives than people in Vietnam, Yemen and Sudan.

Despite the grim news, Murray and others believe that, eventually, the uptick in exercise will likely deliver significant health benefits and may help reverse the decades-long increase in weight.

“We know that exercise has amazing virtues,” said Dr. Georges C. Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Assn. “It helps prevent cardiovascular disease, build muscle tone and reduce bone loss. It improves mental health, and it reduces stress. … All of those are vitally important.”

Some of the biggest gains in physical activity over the last decade occurred in America’s unhealthiest counties in the Deep South and Appalachia.

The percentage of women in Morgan County, Ky., exercising enough each week jumped 18.3 percentage points between 2001 and 2009 to 44%, the biggest improvement researchers found.

The biggest gain for men occurred in Concho County, a small, rural county in west-central Texas, where the percentage of men who got enough physical activity increased 16.7 percentage points to 58.2%.

Overall, six of the 10 counties that improved most for men and seven of the 10 that improved most for women are in Kentucky. Counties around Atlanta, Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego, Houston and Denver also saw major improvements, according to the report.

Researchers defined sufficient physical activity as 150 minutes of moderate activity a week or 75 minutes of vigorous activity.

Researchers did not say what may explain the successes. But Robert Jeffery, an epidemiologist and weight-loss researcher at the University of Minnesota, said public health campaigns may be yielding fruit. “Publicity has been ramping up everywhere, but particularly in the Southeast,” he said.

Even with the improvements, huge disparities exist nationwide in both exercise patterns and obesity.

In the least healthy counties – which are concentrated in Appalachia and the Deep South – less than a third of women and less than four in 10 men get sufficient physical exercise, according to the report.

In Issaquena County, Miss., a tiny county in the Mississippi Delta, just 28.4% of women are sufficiently active, the worst rate in the nation; 59.3% of women in the county are obese, also the worst nationally.

The nation’s most overweight county for men is Owsley County in Kentucky’s coal country, where 46.9% of the male residents are obese. Owsley County also has the least physically active men, with just 33.1% reporting they get sufficient exercise.

By contrast, obesity rates for men and women are below 20% in the least overweight counties: for men, San Francisco; and for women, Falls Church, Va., in the Washington suburbs.

In the most active counties – which are concentrated in the Northeast, Upper Midwest and West – about three quarters of residents get enough exercise. Tops for men is Teton County, Wyo., and for women is Routt County, Colo.

The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing.

What does the bible say about homosexuality?

Leviticus 20:13 states, “If there is a man who lies with a male

as those who lie with a woman, both of them have committed a

detestable act; they shall surely be put to death."" Their blood

guiltiness is upon them.”

Romans 1:27 states in part, “the men abandoned the natural

function of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another,

men with men committing indecent acts and receiving in their own

persons the due penalty of their error.”

These are just two of the verses that Christians quote to say

homosexuality is against the will of God. It is a detestable act and

they should die. Indecent. A sin. Verses used to condemn. Used to

fuel the fire of hatred and discrimination. You are not normal.

Something is wrong with you. Used to convert the homosexual into a

heterosexual.

There is another verse that is virtually ignored by Christians.

It simply states the reality of homosexuality. It goes against the

prevailing belief of many Christians that homosexuality is a sin

because it does not condemn. The verse says, “For there are eunuchs

who are born thus from their mothers womb, and there are eunuchs who

are made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who are eunuchs for the

kingdom of heavens sake. Let those who can accept it, accept it.”

Matthew 19:12.

What does a eunuch have to do with homosexuality? The question

should be: What is a eunuch? According to Webster’s dictionary a

eunuch is a “castrated man, esp. one employed in a harem.” Then the

question that follows: What is castrate? “Remove the testicles,

deprive of the power of generation.” In other words, a eunuch is a

male that had his testicles surgically removed which makes it

biologically impossible for him to impregnate a female.

The definition of a eunuch does not make any sense in the first

part of Matthew 19:12. The verse said “For there are eunuchs born

thus from their mother's womb.“ How can a man who's testicles were

surgically removed be “born thus from his mothers womb?” “Born thus”

does not include anything that involves surgical alteration. “Born

thus” exclusively includes the way God made him. The way he developed

in the womb, physically and mentally. So who is the eunuch that is

“born thus?”

To find the eunuch that is “born thus” one needs to read the

chapter from the beginning. This section of the chapter talks about

marriage that is an intimate physical relationship traditionally

between a male and female. The last words used in many Christian

marriage ceremonies is found there, “what God has joined together let

no man separate.” It also talks about adultery and divorce. One is

the betrayal and the other the ending of an intimate physical

relationship.

Following this discussion the question is asked, “His disciples

said to Him, “If such is the case of the man with his wife, it is

better not to marry?” But he said to them, “all cannot accept this

saying, but only those to whom it has been given.” Matthew 19:10

and 11. Scholars tend to think that Matthew 19:12 speaks of people

apart from the normal heterosexual relationships because of the

question the disciples asked. The surgically altered eunuch is

outside the normal heterosexual relationship and is more aptly

explained by : “eunuchs who are made eunuchs by men.” Then there

are “eunuchs who are eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake.” Monks

and priests who have either taken a vow of celibacy and /or castrated

are outside normal heterosexual relationships. But who is the eunuch

that is outside normal heterosexual relationships and is “born thus

from his mother's womb?”

Homosexuality, say Christians, is a lifestyle choice. Homosexuals

say that it is not a lifestyle choice, it is the way God made them.

The way they were born. Since Matthew 19 begins with a discussion of

heterosexual intimate physical relationships and then tells of eunuchs

apart from normal heterosexual relationships there is only one

explanation of to the eunuch “born thus” refers.

As shown, the Bible contradicts itself on the subject of

homosexuality. Leviticus and Romans condemn while Matthew just accepts

it as a reality. What are Christians to believe about homosexuality?

In general, Christians believe the Bible is the literal word of

God. God inspired Moses to write Leviticus 20:13 and God inspired

Paul to write Romans 1:27. Who are Moses and Paul? Both men are

revered in Christianity as truly great men, but despite all they did

and wrote they are only two human, imperfect, mortal men.

In general, Christians attribute the words in Matthew 19:12 to

be the actual spoken words of Jesus himself. Who is Jesus? Jesus is,

in the Trinitarian view, the son of God, the Messiah, the Christ,

perfect, sinless, immortal, divine. “The word became flesh.” The

essence of God in the flesh. Three manifestations of God. Father,

son, and holy spirit. Jesus is the human embodiment in the trinity

of God. Then, in the Trinitarian view, the words of Matthew 19:12 are

words spoken by God himself.

My question to the Trinitarian: What words are you going to

believe? Whose words are you going to follow? The words of imperfect

mortal men or the words spoken by God?

What about the Christians who do not hold the Trinitarian view?

Whatever word or words used to describe who Jesus is, in the many

facets of Christianity, the authority of Jesus is greater than any

other figure in the Bible. He is the Messiah, the Christ, the son of

God, or the son of man. The question remains the same. Whose words

are you going to follow? “He who is able to accept it, let him accept

it.” Jesus understood the reality of homosexuality. Why not

Christians?

Judaism traditionally views homosexuality as a detestable act as

written in Leviticus. What would the Book of Matthew have to do with

Jews? The Book of Matthew is the transformation of Judaism to

Christianity. It clearly has the Judaic perspective until the end of

the book and diverges into Christianity. Chapter 19 is well before the

end of the book and not yet tainted by the transformation. Leviticus

was written, at least, two or three thousand years before Matthew.

This suggests a change in the Judaic view of homosexuality. Over the

last two thousand years this view has been lost or forgotten. A

change from the “detestable act; they shall surely be put to death”

to a more humane “born thus” view.

What about the atheist or agnostic who views homosexuality as wrong?

The only way to answer them is in a historical perspective. The

colonization and conquest of the Americas was primarily done with

technological superiority. Bows and arrows against guns and cannons.

The Europeans brought their Christian culture with them to the

Americas. In the process of exterminating the “savage” Indian, the

European colonists missed a culture that was superior in many ways.

For example, Indian culture lacked the extreme poverty that was seen

throughout Europe at the time. In many ways the Indian tribal culture

was more highly developed and compassionate than that of Europe.

While the European and American Christian culture saw homosexuality

as a sin, homosexuals among the American Indians were accepted and

valued members of the village.

Why do so many see homosexuality as wrong? Ignorance? Yes. To

promote an agenda? Yes. Male heterosexual aversion to homosexuality?

Again, Yes. If none of the preceding arguments convince you then you

will never be convinced. It is the narrowness of the mind that blinds

the truth. After speaking of the eunuchs Jesus said, “All cannot

accept this saying, but only those to whom it has been given.”

Matthew 19:11."

Working for hours on end under a punishing sun, the pickers are said to be crowded into squalid camps, driven without a break and even cheated of wages.

But as Congress weighs immigration legislation expected to expand the guest worker program, another group is increasingly crying foul — Americans, mostly black, who live near the farms and say they want the field work but cannot get it because it is going to Mexicans. They contend that they are illegally discouraged from applying for work and treated shabbily by farmers who prefer the foreigners for their malleability.

“They like the Mexicans because they are scared and will do anything they tell them to,” said Sherry Tomason, who worked for seven years in the fields here, then quit. Last month she and other local residents filed a federal lawsuit against a large grower of onions, Stanley Farms, alleging that it mistreated them and paid them less than it paid the Mexicans.

The suit is one of a number of legal actions containing similar complaints against farms, including a large one in Moultrie, Ga., where Americans said they had been fired because of their race and national origin, given less desirable jobs and provided with fewer work opportunities than Mexican guest workers. Under a consent decree with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the farm, Southern Valley, agreed to make certain changes."

Haynes of the First Amendment Center writes:

A majority of the American people (51%) believes that the U.S. Constitution establishes a Christian nation, according to the State of the First Amendment survey released last month by the First Amendment Center. Because language about a Christian America has long been a staple of Religious Right rhetoric, it’s not surprising that acceptance of this patently false interpretation of the Constitution is strongest among evangelicals (71%) and conservatives (67%). But even many non-evangelical Christians (47%) and liberals (33%) appear to believe the fiction of a constitutionally mandated Christian America is historical fact.

I am not aware of any polling or sociological survey data that would tend to confirm or cast doubt on these numbers. But whatever degree of truth there may be in them, they come from a credible source and are sufficiently concerning that I think we need to sit-up and take notice and begin to consider what might be done.

Haynes uses the occasion of these hair-raising findings to offer a counter historical narrative. (I did the same in longer form a few years ago, as have many others over the years.)

If it is true, as the First Amendment Center's survey suggests, that most Americans embrace the main assertion of Christian Nationalism, there is much to be done. For today, I will restate the premise of most of us who do research and writing in this area.

We have pretty much the same issue when it comes to Christian Nationalism as we do when addressing any dimension of the Religious Right: We have to at least consider the whole of the movement in order to best understand and figure out how to contend with any of its constituent parts or concerns. That does not mean that everyone needs to know everything there is to know about the Religious Right. I don't know anyone who does (certainly not me) and it would be a silly ambition in any case. But my point is that actual knowledge and expertise nevertheless, matters. What also matters is that we have a commonly accepted vocabulary so we can communicate about these things. It can be challenging, but it ain't rocket science, and I think we have made progress in this area (organized efforts to stop us not withstanding.) A close corollary is that unfair labels, terms of demonization -- and loaded language generally -- are obstacles to thoughtful consideration and conversation in this, and really any arena.

These are obvious prerequisites to dispassionate scholarship, journalism, and strategic conversation among affected and concerned constituencies.

Bush Book Recalls Frustration At Son's Critics: I'm 'An Angry Old Man Hurting For My Son',"Former President George H. W. Bush offers intimate observations about low points of his son's presidency in his latest book, set to be released Tuesday.

CNN received an advanced copy of All the Best, George Bush; My Life in Letters and Other Writings, and reports that the elder Bush had a pained reaction to the nation's criticism of his son's performance as 43rd president.

""My heart went out to him"" after Hurricane Katrina, Bush, 88, writes of his son, former President George W. Bush. ""Here is a guy who cares deeply. Who wants every possible resource of the federal government brought in to bear to help people, yet he is being roundly accused of not giving a damn ... the critics do not know what is in 43's heart, how deeply he feels about the hurt, the anguish, the losses affecting so many people, most of them poor.""

The younger Bush was stung by considerable backlash for slow execution of recovery efforts in Louisiana after Katrina. The resentment came to a memorable head in September 2005, when entertainer Kanye West publicly blasted Bush during a nationally broadcast relief telethon, claiming he didn't ""care about black people.""

Five years later, in an interview with NBC's Matt Lauer, Bush said he regarded West's criticism as ""one of the most disgusting moments in my presidency.""

The elder Bush comes to his son's defense in the book, calling the critics ""nasty."" The World War II vet and 41st president then goes on to note that his son had come under fire exactly 61 years after his own Navy plane had been shot down by the Japanese.

""I was a scared kid back then,"" Bush writes. ""Now I am just an angry old man hurting for my son."""

But Flores, 34, ran into an obstacle when he tried to file a class-action lawsuit to get back his and other janitors’ wages. He had signed away his right to file a lawsuit against his employer.

After being hired, Flores had been presented with a pile of papers to sign. And he had unknowingly agreed not to take any legal problem with his bosses to the courts, but instead go to a private arbitrator handpicked by his employer.

“This is the equivalent to saying you have to give up your right to vote in an election,” said Ari Moss, Flores’ attorney. “It’s about punishing the poor and the weak, and saying you don’t have the right to come and seek redress.”

Emboldened by a series of Supreme Court decisions and an employers’ job market, many companies are starting to require workers to sign away their rights in return for a job. It is a trend that experts worry could further wear away employees’ power in the workplace. The contracts make it harder for employees to join class-action lawsuits, take their employers to court, or leave to go work somewhere else.

“You can see this common thread of making it more difficult to have your day in court,” said David Yamada, a professor at Suffolk University Law School in Boston. “The legal climate for employees is a tough one.”

Employers defend arbitration agreements as a low-cost way to resolve disputes while freeing up space in the overburdened court system. But some lawyers label arbitrators “corporate courts” because the arbitrator is hired by the employer, and because employers statistically win much more in arbitration than they do in courts.

“It unevens the playing field,” said Paul Bland, a senior attorney at Public Justice. “It used to be if you took away a right that you would have under normal law, the courts would throw it out.”

The use of these arbitration agreements has become more common since a 2011 Supreme Court decision, AT&T; Mobility vs. Concepcion, that made it easier to prevent workers from participating in class-action lawsuits, Bland said. That further complicates things for employees who have small claims that aren’t big enough for a lawyer to take on unless they turn into a class-action lawsuit.

Mazhar Saleem is bound to his employer by a number of contracts that made it hard to earn enough money to live, but also hard to go work anywhere else. He drives a town car for a company in New York as an independent contractor, rather than as a full-time employee. That means he doesn’t get benefits, never gets overtime, and isn’t guaranteed set hours.

But he also signed a non-compete contract when he started working, meaning he can’t drive a car for anyone else in New York. So even if his employer doesn’t give him any work, he’s not allowed to go find it elsewhere, says his attorney, Michael Scimone, with the law firm Outten and Golden.

“It ties into the larger theme of employers trying to use contracts to alter pieces of the employment relationship that are supposed to be governed by law,” Scimone said.

Non-compete clauses, once a staple of the high-tech world, are being extended to cover hairdressers, auto mechanics, exterminators and other professions that courts would traditionally not uphold them for, lawyers say. They essentially mean an employee can’t leave a job to take another one nearby, unless he or she wants to stop working for a year or so.

It’s a way to keep promising employees from leaving, said Matt Marx, an MIT professor who has studied these contracts.

“Given the increased job mobility of today’s world, companies are saying, ‘We can’t count on people to be here forever. We have to lock them up with contracts,” he said.

In a recent case in Worcester, Mass., three women working at a hair salon tried to leave after their conditions at work deteriorated. All three received cease and desist letters when they started working elsewhere, because they had signed non-compete clauses. They had to wait a year for the clauses to expire before they could work in the area again.

In other contracts being distributed at the workplace, employees agree to pay the costs of litigation if they lose, and employers shorten the amount of time in which employees can sue them. All of these contracts make it less likely for employees to win against their bosses in court -- if they are even allowed to take them to court.

That means lawyers will be more hesitant to take on workplace cases because it has gotten more difficult for them to win them, said Catherine Fisk, an employment law professor at UC Irvine’s law school.

“The less likely an employee is to file a claim, the less incentive a company has to extend money and other resources to prevent the illegal discrimination from happening,” she said.

Two recent Supreme Court decisions have made it harder for employees to win discrimination suits.

Many lawyers say they’re not surprised that courts have made life tougher for employees. Since the beginning of the Roberts court, experts say, the Supreme Court has issued decision after decision cutting back employees’ legal avenues to complain.

“Since the Warren court, employers have done well at the Supreme Court, but in the Roberts court, they have done exceptionally well,” said Cynthia Estlund, a professor at New York University’s School of Law. John G. Roberts Jr. became chief justice in 2005.

Law historians trace the court’s conservative leanings to the long stretches of Republicans in the White House in the 1980s and 2000s that allowed presidents to appoint more conservative judges to lower courts and to the Supreme Court.

A study published earlier this year in the Minnesota Law Review found that two of the court’s current justices are the most conservative out of any of the justices who served from 1946 to 2011, and that court under Roberts is friendlier to business than it was during either of the two previous chief justices.

Adding up seven years of decisions, the workplace is getting to be a tough place for many, said Cliff Palefsky, an employment lawyer at McGuinn, Hillsman & Palefsky in San Francisco.

Employers already can ask employees to work harder for less because the job market is still so sluggish in many fields. But in some cases, employees who think they can find a better situation elsewhere are going to have trouble doing so.

“The law is being undermined and it’s putting some workers in a bind,” Palefsky said. In some situations, when non-compete clauses are mixed with arbitration agreements, he said, “We’re one step away from indentured servitude.”

Pelosi says she hopes to raise profile of women in business%2C politics

She launched women-based agenda this summer

ROCHESTER, N.Y. -- Nancy Pelosi said Saturday she hopes the legacy of women in Congress will be to raise the profile of women in every aspect of business and politics.

Pelosi, a former speaker of the House of Representatives and currently the House minority leader, was one of nine inductees into the National Women's Hall of Fame on Saturday in Seneca Falls, N.Y.

Pelosi said before the ceremony that she was proud to stand with the others being honored, including the late former first lady Betty Ford; Julie Krone, the leading female thoroughbred jockey of all time; Ina May Gaskin, known as the mother of midwifery; activist, writer and filmmaker Kate Millett; and Bernice Resnick Sandler, one of the biggest forces behind Title IX.

On July 19, the 165th anniversary of the Seneca Falls Convention for women's rights, Pelosi launched a women-based agenda calling for more equal pay, more health care coverage for all families, affordable child care, paid family leave and more opportunity. She said Saturday she has been traveling to support the cause.

""We think that will unleash the power of women,"" Pelosi said.

Pelosi, a Democrat from California, declined to speak extensively about the current partial federal government shutdown other than to say: ""Every day's a new day. I'm always hopeful that a solution will be found."""

Frum: Why isn't homelessness getting worse? Because of the policies of George W. Bush

He says under Bush the simple solution of providing a home (""housing first"") worked

Frum: Abolition of homelessness has become a real possibility, thanks to Bush

Have you noticed that homelessness isn't worse? Here we are, living through the most protracted joblessness crisis since the Great Depression -- and surprisingly, fewer people are living on the street.

The federal Department of Housing and Urban Development reported that the number of the chronically homeless declined by 30% between 2005 and 2007. You might have expected the numbers to spike again when the financial crisis hit but no. Since 2007, the number of chronic homeless has dropped another 19%.

A broader measure of the number of homeless counts the number of people living out of doors on one randomly chosen night. That broader measure has also improved through the economic crisis. Between January 2011 and January 2012, homelessness among veterans dropped by 7%.

To what or whom do we owe this good news?

David Frum

In very large part, we owe it to the president whose library opened in Dallas last week: George W. Bush.

For three decades, we have debated what causes homelessness and how to deal with it. Is homelessness a mental health problem? A substance abuse problem? A problem caused by gentrification and urban redevelopment? Or something else again?

The Bush administration substituted a much simpler idea -- an idea that happened to work. Whatever the cause of homelessness, the solution is ... a home.

In 2002, Bush appointed a new national homeless policy czar, Philip Mangano . A former music agent imbued with the religious philosophy of St. Francis of Assisi, Mangano was seized by an idea pioneered by New York University psychiatrist Sam Tsemberis: ""housing first.""

The ""housing first"" concept urges authorities to concentrate resources on the hardest cases -- to move them into housing immediately -- and only to worry about the other problems of the homeless after they first have a roof over their heads. A 2004 profile in The Atlantic nicely summarized Tsemberis' ideas: ""Offer them (the homeless) the apartment first, he believes, and you don't need to spend years, and service dollars, winning their trust.""

Many old school homeless advocates resisted Mangano's approach. They were impelled by two main objections:

1. They believed that homelessness was just the most extreme form of a problem faced by low-income people generally -- a lack of affordable housing for low-income people. Focusing resources on the nation's hardest cases would (these advocates feared) distract the federal government from the bigger project of subsidizing better housing for millions of people who did not literally live in the streets.

2. By 2002, the nation had been worrying about homelessness for several decades. Countless programs from state and local agencies responded to some separate part of the problem; tens of thousands of people earned their livings in those state and local agencies, disposing of massive budgets. ""Housing first"" threatened to disrupt this vast industry. ""Housing first"" was comparatively cheap, for one thing: a homeless shelter might look squalid, but it cost a great deal to operate -- more, oftentimes, than a proper apartment with kitchen and bath. The transition to ""housing first"" threatened jobs and budgets across the country.

There was only one counterargument to these objections: ""Housing first"" worked. It worked from the start, and it worked fast. It worked so well that the Obama administration has now claimed the approach as its own, even keeping Mangano on the job for the first weeks of the new administration.

Bush remains one of the more controversial and less popular ex-presidents. But if in the next days you happen to walk down a city street, take a moment to notice how many men or women are sleeping there. Results will vary from place to place, but on average, there are probably fewer than half as many as a decade ago. The job is not completed yet. But for the first time since the 1970s, the abolition of homelessness has become a real and near possibility. Whatever else you think of the 43rd president, that achievement is part of Bush's legacy, too."

Story highlights The federal government has shut down for the first time since 1996 Marian Currinder, Josh Huder: What will House Speaker John Boehner do? They say as Boehner faces tough choices, his Speakership hangs in the balance Currinder, Huder: Will he rely on a minority of the majority of his party to pass bill?

Editor’s Note: Marian Currinder and Josh Huder are senior fellows at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University.

(CNN) —

The federal government has shut down for the first time since 1996 and all eyes are focused on House Speaker John Boehner. Will he continue to insist upon tying a repeal or delay of Obamacare to a funding bill? Or will he bring the Senate-passed funding bill to the House floor and hope that he can convince 17 Republicans to join hands with the chamber’s 200 Democrats and vote to re-open the federal government?

It all depends on whether he chooses to follow or ignore the Hastert Rule. The choice isn’t an easy one, as his speakership quite likely hangs in the balance.

The Hastert Rule is named after former Speaker Dennis Hastert, who did not bring bills to the floor unless those bills were supported by a majority of House Republicans. It is not a formal rule, but rather a promise to uphold the will of a majority of the majority. House Republicans expected Boehner to uphold the rule and he pledged to do so.

Marian Currinder

But the shutdown and the upcoming showdown over raising the debt limit underscore Boehner’s leadership dilemma – almost any bill that a majority of House Republicans support is dead on arrival in the Democratic-controlled Senate.

Josh Huder

Fewer laws were passed in the last Congress than in any Congress since 1861, and based on the number of floor votes taken so far this year, the current Congress is on track to be even less productive. It is also the most partisan Congress since the Civil War era.

As the shutdown gets under way, many are looking for signs of what kind of leader Boehner will be. Instead, they should consider what kind of leader he can be, given the political hand he’s been dealt.

Gone are the days of House speakers plying members with promises of pork and campaign money. Earmarks have been banned, most incumbents do their own fundraising, and for many of the chamber’s newer members, ideology trumps party loyalty.

The electoral landscape doesn’t help. In 1995-96, when the federal government last shut down, 34% of House Republicans represented districts that Bill Clinton won in 1992. Today, just 7% of House Republicans come from districts that President Obama won last year. There is almost no electoral incentive for these members to compromise. The bottom line is that Boehner’s arsenal is limited. He is hamstrung by the very institution and members he is supposed to lead.

So what are Boehner’s options at this point? He could, as he has done previously, pass a funding bill on the backs of House Democrats. The 2011 and 2012 omnibus spending bills, the 2011 Budget Control Act, and the 2012 Payroll Tax Bill all passed the House because of Democratic support. And earlier this year, Boehner brought the Violence Against Women Act and the Hurricane Sandy Relief bill to the floor, despite opposition from a majority of House Republicans. These bills had bipartisan support in the Senate, making it difficult for Boehner to dig his heels in and stand behind his conservative majority.

Flash forward to now. What is the House speaker’s calculus, given that the Senate passed its funding bill on a party-line vote?

Absent the pressure to appease Republican senators, Boehner will have a tough time justifying any move to defy the will of his party’s majority. Convincing House Republicans to pass the Senate’s funding bill and re-open the federal government will require him to lead in a way that may not be possible, should he wish to remain speaker.

No House speaker wants to go down in history for a legislative record opposed by the majority of his or her own party. And no speaker wants to go down in history for presiding over one of the most unproductive Congresses in history. But these are Boehner’s choices.

While Hastert relied on a majority of the majority, Boehner has had to rely on a minority of the majority, together with a majority of the minority, to pass important legislation. The “Boehner Rule” is hardly the stuff to which great leaders aspire. It may, however, prove more productive than following the lead of his majority.

The report suggests that merely meeting the modest requirements necessary to get a license -- passing a written exam and driving test -- could improve road safety and help reduce the several thousand fatalities that occur in the state each year.

“If you don’t hold people accountable to acceptable standards, then we get people that aren’t prepared and don’t have the skill set,” said Tyler Izen, president of the Los Angeles Police Protective League.

The recently released DMV report is the agency’s first significant analysis of unlicensed drivers in 15 years and adds fuel to the debate over whether illegal immigrants should be eligible for licenses.

Immigrant rights groups say that granting such licenses would reduce fatalities and costly uninsured motorist claims. Insurance companies paid out $634 million in claims for collisions related to uninsured motorists in 2009, according to the most recent data from the state.

It “really goes against public safety because the current law forces people who would otherwise be properly licensed to drive without one,” said Angela Sanbrano, board president for the Central American Resource Center in Los Angeles.

Critics, however, argue that giving licenses to undocumented immigrants merely rewards illegal activity.

“One study shouldn’t trump the obvious -- if you don’t want illegal aliens in the country, why do you want to encourage them to be on the roads?” said Bob Dane, spokesman for the Washington-based Federation for American Immigration Reform. “It just defies common sense.”

The DMV report looked at 23 years of data on fatal accidents. Its conclusions were similar to the last such report in 1997, which looked at accident data from 1987 to 1992. The latest report was also the first analysis since a 1994 change in the state law that required all licensed drivers show proof of legal residency, which significantly increased the number of unlicensed drivers.

Rough estimates put the number of unlicensed drivers at about 2 million, compared with the approximately 24 million licensed drivers.

Many of the unlicensed motorists say they would get licenses if they could.

Maria Galvan, a 42-year-old illegal immigrant in Los Angeles, said she has little choice but to drive to work, pick up groceries and take her daughters to school.

“We need driver’s licenses to be comfortable and be trusted and follow the law,” Galvan said.

Repeated legislative efforts to allow illegal immigrants to get driver’s licenses have been met with stiff resistance.

Former Assemblyman Gil Cedillo (D-Los Angeles) tried unsuccessfully nine times to get a law passed.

But the political winds may be changing.

Last year, Gov. Jerry Brown signed a law allowing some illegal immigrants who qualify for a new federal work permit program to get driver’s licenses.

Los Angeles City Councilman Ed Reyes said it was time to offer that opportunity to all illegal immigrants in California.

“No matter who is behind the wheel, they need to be prepared and understand the rules of the road,” Reyes said. “That’s a significant issue when you live in a city that has a culture driven by cars.”

Assemblyman Luis Alejo (D-Watsonville) introduced a bill last week that would provide driver’s licenses to anyone who can show they pay taxes, regardless of their immigration status.

Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck and L.A. County Sheriff Lee Baca said last year that they were in favor of such a measure.

Supporters point out that granting licenses to illegal immigrants also could reduce the number of hit-and-run accidents. Unlicensed drivers leave crash scenes at significantly higher rates than licensed drivers, according to a 2011 national report from the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety.

“I suspect that the reason people hit-and-run is they are afraid of the consequences,” said Izen, the police union president. “Maybe if they had a driver’s license, they wouldn’t run.”

There is budding support in the U.S. for expanding the pool of licensed drivers.

In Illinois, a bill to allow special licenses for illegal immigrants passed the state Legislature this week, and Gov. Pat Quinn has pledged to sign it. Washington and New Mexico already have similar laws.

But Dane, of the immigration-reform group said the effects of granting licenses go beyond just allowing people to legally drive. Licenses provide a legal foothold for residency, he said. They add another benefit that legitimizes the presence of illegal immigrants.

“It’s a gold-plated membership card into society,” Dane said.

The report also has added to the controversy over the Los Angeles Police Commission’s policy change last year that eased car impound rules on unlicensed drivers.

Unlicensed drivers stopped over minor traffic infractions no longer have their cars automatically impounded for 30 days. If the driver can show that he or she has auto insurance, valid identification and no previous citations for unlicensed driving, the car will be released.

The L.A. police union filed suit to block the policy change last year, saying it would put dangerous drivers back on the road sooner. The new DMV research proves their point, Izen said.

“It is our hope that in the new year, the DMV study will be the impetus for city officials to revisit this issue and show that they are serious about putting public safety first,” he said.

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Green Bay Press-Gazette

Targeted individuals have serious criminal records or run-ins with authorities in past

Congress directed ICE to shift focus in 2008

Number of convicted criminals deported has increased 89%25 since 2008

GREEN BAY, Wis. -- Even as immigration reform remains up for congressional consideration this fall, deportations continue to take place regularly across the Midwest.

However, it is less likely to be in the news than it was several years ago.

In the 1990s, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement would storm workplaces, march dozens of laborers out in handcuffs and load them onto awaiting buses.

""There was backlash, children being left behind,"" said Laurie Martinez, who works with immigrants through the Catholic Diocese of Green Bay, Wis. ""ICE will still do roundups, where they're looking for several individuals, and we usually hear about it a week after. But you don't hear much of them going to employers.

""Now it seems to be they're targeting people in jail, in the prison system.""

Deportations and so called ""sweeps"" by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents remain a part of life all over the country, but it's a quieter approach. It targets specific individuals rather than workers or a place of business. Those individuals targeted primarily have serious criminal records or had run-ins with immigration authorities in the past. The most recent one in Brown County, Wis., where Green Bay is the county seat, was in April, when ICE picked up 44 people.

In 2008, Congress directed ICE to shift its focus and prioritize criminal immigrants, not just undocumented ones, according to the federal agency. Immigration and Customs Enforcement says it now targets criminal immigrants and those who pose a danger to national security or public safety and those ""repeat violators who game the immigration system.""

The reason for the change? The agency noted its ""limited resources"" and, according to independent analysis, the roughly $23,000 per immigrant cost for deportation.

The shift in strategy is evident in the agency's numbers.

Since 2008, the number of convicted criminals deported nationwide has increased 89%, while the number of undocumented immigrants without criminal convictions has dropped 29%. Last year, ICE records show the agency deported 409,849 people, 96% of which fell into the agency's enforcement priority definition, which covers criminals, threats to national security and repeat violators of immigration laws.

The six-state region that includes Wisconsin shows the same shift in strategy by the agency. Last year, the agency deported 10,296 immigrants from Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Missouri and Wisconsin. Nearly two-thirds of those immigrants were convicted criminals.

In 2011, 11,786 immigrants were deported from that area, and 64% of them were convicted criminals. In 2010, 10,346 immigrants were deported, and 52% were convicted criminals.

""Our removal stats are not broken down by county or even by state,"" said Gail Montenegro, public affairs officer for ICE's Chicago region. ""Our stats are for the entire six-state area.""

Generally, people in the country illegally who are incarcerated or picked up in a community sweep are held in either the Dodge or Kenosha, Wis., county jails. Both counties have contracts with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to house and transport immigrants, who get a chance to argue against deportation in federal court, usually in Chicago.

Immigrants who commit serious crimes and are sentenced to prison fulfill those terms, but are identified as being of interest to the federal immigration agency, Wisconsin corrections prison spokeswoman Joy Staab said. When their prison sentences are over, they are transferred to Dodge and Kenosha county jails for deportation proceedings.

Since 2008, about 391 of those inmates were transferred to ICE custody in Dodge and Kenosha counties. Of those, 33 had been convicted in Brown County courts, Staab said.

Deportations by the numbers

2012: Immigration and Customs Enforcement deported 10,296 immigrants from Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Missouri and Wisconsin. Of those, nearly two-thirds were convicted criminals.

2011: ICE deported 11,786 immigrants from that six-state area. Sixty-four percent of them were convicted criminals.

2010: ICE deported 10,346 immigrants. Fifty-two percent were convicted criminals.

A new HuffPost/YouGov poll suggests that Americans would be split over whether that was a good thing.

According to the poll, 40 percent of Americans would approve of the president nominating an atheist to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court, while almost as many -- 38 percent -- said they would disapprove.

The suggestion that Breyer might be a nonbeliever was sparked by a remark he made last week during oral arguments in a case involving government-instituted prayer at public meetings. After Justice Antonin Scalia asked a lawyer in the case what would be the equivalent of prayer for a nonreligious person, Breyer interjected, ""Perhaps he’s asking me that question and I can answer it later.""

The poll found that 45 percent of Americans think a potential justice's religious beliefs should not be relevant during the nominations process, while 36 percent said the president should take those beliefs into account.

Republicans were especially likely to disapprove of the idea of nominating an atheist justice (56 percent to 26 percent), while pluralities of Democrats (49 percent to 34 percent) and independents (42 percent to 34 percent) said they would approve.

Republicans were about equally divided on whether the president should take religious beliefs into account when choosing a nominee: 43 percent said he should, 41 percent said he should not. Democrats, by 47 percent to 36 percent, and independents, by 46 percent to 33 percent, said he should not.

Born-again Christians were also especially likely to think religious beliefs should be considered during the nominations process (53 percent) and to disapprove of the idea of an atheist Supreme Court nominee (65 percent).

Americans' views about an atheist justice parallel their feelings on nonbelievers holding other public offices. By 40 percent to 34 percent, Americans said they would vote for a well-qualified atheist nominated by their party for president. By 42 percent to 35 percent, they said they would vote for a well-qualified atheist for Congress.

The HuffPost/YouGov poll was conducted Nov. 8-9 among 1,000 U.S. adults using a sample selected from YouGov's opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population. Factors considered include age, race, gender, education, employment, income, marital status, number of children, voter registration, time and location of Internet access, interest in politics, religion and church attendance.

He Has Also Written For Food']",A food road warrior looks back on 2013,"Honestly, the real reason I went to Paris this year was that I’ve always wanted to type “April in Paris” in a dispatch from France (it’s true!), and until recently, I’d visited the City of Light only in summer, fall or winter. Never spring.

By luck, I snagged a reservation at one of the toughest tables in town, coincidentally called Spring, a divine restaurant from the American chef Daniel Rose. The evening was full of highs, and how cool that Karl Lagerfeld strolled in at one point and left behind a fashion doodle on a cocktail napkin. Yet I ended up not writing about Spring because it wasn’t new, because I wanted a break from having to recall every morsel of a meal for public consumption and, well, it’s no fun being the 410th food writer to wax poetic about a transporting dinner. (Noma, you’re no longer my reason for catching a flight to Copenhagen. Not that you need my help.)

Tips for eating on the road

My second reason for going to Paris was to take the temperature of the bistro scene, but here’s what a handful of fair-to-pleasant meals in some of the newer places taught me: San Francisco is a more significant place to eat, at least as far as this dedicated eater and trend watcher is concerned. Indeed, one of my most exciting meals away from Washington, better even than at some of the four-stars in New York, was at Coqueta in San Francisco. Lusty food in the company of loved ones in a waterfront setting was a reminder that while food is important, it isn’t everything.

You know how some travel experiences are so vivid you just know you’ll never, ever forget them and you decide not to take notes or even a photo because you’re trying to live in the moment? And the free-flowing pastis/mojito/pisco sour/soju is only encouraging you to relax and trust your memory?

Banish those thoughts. Put pen to paper, even if it’s the butcher paper on the table. Tap Instagram, at least for a shot or two. Believe me, I’d love to tell you more about the pig roast I went to on a little island with a sunset view of San Juan, the one where local hooch was passed around in little paper cups and everyone danced while a grizzled butcher lovingly carved a mahogany porker into at least 10 different courses. Trust me, I also knocked back some pretty good chow during a nighttime crawl of food stalls in Seoul, where one of the stops included an edible fire show served inside a tent (a learning experience despite a young guide who seemed more dedicated to teaching us drinking games than describing what was on our plates). In those and other situations, I didn’t record my impressions because I wasn’t on a deadline — or an expense account — and I didn’t want to interrupt the mood.

Still, there are plenty of meals I dutifully remembered, and described in some length here and elsewhere in the newspaper, via dining postcards sent from Atlanta, Charlottesville, Philadelphia, Richmond and Wilmington over the past 12 months.

As for those cities I grazed in but didn’t tell you about? Here are some of the highlights, retrieved from my iPhone, a kimchi-fragrant business card, the margins of a hotel map — and a frequent traveling companion with a much better memory than mine.

Coqueta

Hands down, the most joyous meal of my year was dinner in August at the youthful Coqueta in San Francisco. A waterfront address helps. So does a corner perch in a dining room where cowhide rugs pad the floor, the ceiling goes on forever and your first taste of the menu is a big board of skewered snacks, what the Basques know as pintxos, washed back with a gin and tonic that’s so beautiful, you want to take it home as a table decoration.

Michael Chiarello is the vision behind the fiesta, which might prompt head-scratching from followers of his Italian work, foremost Bottega in Napa Valley. The veteran Bay Area chef jokingly calls his switch to Spanish “my midlife crisis.”

There’s not a single dish at Coqueta, helmed by chef de cuisine Ryan McIlwraith, that I wouldn’t be eager to eat again.

Meatballs rich with duck and pork (anything with pig demands your attention here) get jolts of flavor from tart cherries and fried shallots. Shrimp gathered with shoestring potatoes and a gently cooked egg get a little wild when mixed with their chunky chorizo dressing. A sense of whimsy infuses other dishes, including the pickled mussels nestled with shaved fennel in a little tin. “Canned fresh daily,” reads the menu. And the reason the paella, cooked to splendor over a wood-fired grill, tastes as though you’re eating it on its home turf: “We spend a lot of time on the broth,” made with ham stock, lobster shells and sofrito, Chiarello says. Come dessert, there are more pintxos, and more surprises: tomato-basil jellies in summer and bite-size manchego cheesecake anytime.

Surveying the scene, I can’t help but feel at home; the faces of some of the overseers appear familiar. Chiarello lured so much talent from Washington uber-chef Jose Andres, the Italian says that the Spaniard told him that next time, “we demand first-round draft picks.”

Coqueta is “flirt” in Spanish. If this restaurant doesn’t make your heart beat a little faster, none will.

Le 6 Paul Bert

The perfect start to a visit to Paris in April (or anytime, really): Le 6 Paul Bert. Awash in light by day, the trim storefront from the esteemed chef Bertrand Auboyneau opens with a picnic’s worth of jams, meats and cheeses and a fetching light fixture fashioned from old wine bottles. My companion and I are led past a cozy zinc bar and a communal table to a snug spot in the rear that initially feels like Siberia but turns out to be prime real estate. What food lover wouldn’t want to watch his meal being cooked in front of him? Indeed, the open kitchen is so close, we hear every high note sung by hot oil and smile with pride as we survey the kitchen’s reading material, including the “Momofuku” cookbook on a nearby shelf. The bread, delivered in a paper bag, is wonderful, and it comes in handy as a swab for the savory dishes that follow. Happy memories are soon made of crisp mackerel with a vivid green herb puree, tender chunks of pork scattered on a creamy puree of potatoes and sunchokes and an ethereal vanilla panna cotta made refreshing with grapefruit. And the price is right: $25 for a three-course lunch that’s as beautiful as it is luscious. Our server doesn’t know the food very well (the menu changes daily), but his lack of detail turns out to be a boon: We chat up the cooks instead.

Revel

Here’s the co-owner of Revel in Seattle explaining why she and her husband chose the name: “Revel means to have a lot of joy,” says Rachel Yang, who alternates cooking behind the restaurant’s long butcher-block counter with Seif Chirchi, the mate in question. “We want diners to have fun with our food, to be excited.”

Not a problem. She’s from Seoul, he’s from outside Chicago, they both worked at Alain Ducasse in New York. For Revel, in the hipster Seattle neighborhood of Fremont, the couple created a menu of Asian-accented small plates that’s so compelling, you really want to show up with a crowd so that you can try one of everything in their

industrial-but-gracious environment.

House-made kimchi and braised pork belly make for a dynamite pancake that relies on ground mung beans instead of flour. Caramelized beef short ribs fatten the supple dumplings, each bite of which reveals ginger and chili in the seasoning. A salad of peppery mizuna and corned lamb gets tossed with a dressing that ricochets from sweet to sour to spicy and back. Yang isn’t kidding when she says, “We both like big flavors.” And you know that you’re on the West Coast when the crab-

seaweed noodle salad stars sweet Dungeness crab.

Cheogajip

Nearing the end of five days of eating in Seoul in November — at street stalls, in the shadow of Buddhist temples and at restaurants so tranquil they felt like museums — I was chagrined to hear a resident tipster tell me that I had been grazing in the wrong places. “The really good cooking is outside the city,” my informant said — just as I signed the check for an unremarkable dinner for four for $600.

Panic set in. There wasn’t time for me to venture outside the capital of South Korea, but I did have another opportunity to eat before heading to the airport. So I dashed off an e-mail to Joe McPherson, founder of the online food journal ZenKimchi: Where should I have lunch the next day, and could he join us? McPherson pitched a few ideas. I stopped him when he mentioned a source for North Korean food, prepared in the cook’s home. And so it was that my guide met us the next day at Yaksu Station, a subway stop, and we ventured into a nearby residential neighborhood in search of lunch.

The gate outside Cheogajip, our destination, was cracked open a few inches, and thank goodness for that, because there’s no way we would have found the place otherwise. Expecting us, the cook beckoned three appetites into a small courtyard, where a yapping dog and a clothesline signaled a private residence. Our hostess motioned to a small room with a sliding door, where we gathered around a low table and glanced at the brief menu posted on the wall.

“There are five choices,” McPherson translated from the Korean script. “Two of them are beer and soju,” Korea’s spirit of choice. The rest of the selections turned out to be among the highlights of my trip. First came floppy, crescent-shaped dumplings, their skins so thin you could see the filling of pork and onions. A big steamed chicken followed. Using chopsticks, we coaxed the ivory meat from the bones, then dipped the morsels in a racy paste of chilies and leeks. Bliss. Helping crowd the table: a big bowl of chilled,

spaghetti-thin buckwheat noodles. Garnished with neat batons of cucumber, the bolt of beige rose from a pond of clear broth with a delicate vinegar sting.

There were smiles all around as we unwound our legs, nodded our thanks to the cook and exited through the courtyard, where woven trays of daikon radishes basked in the early afternoon sun. For less than $10 a head, we got a feast and a story to take home.

O'Reilly lost his cool on Wednesday night while debating President Obama's attitude towards spending cuts. O'Reilly's temper flared when Colmes claimed that Obama said that he would cut entitlements, including Medicare. The host slammed his fist on the table and told Colmes, ""You are lying here.""

O'Reilly addressed the exchange on Thursday. ""Lots of folks talking about my shootout with Alan Colmes last night where I asked him what specific — specific — budget cuts President Obama has proposed,"" he said at the start of the show. “Colmes hemmed and hawed saying the president’s promising to cut Medicare, or something. But the truth is Mr. Obama has not put forth any specific federal spending cuts. It's all a bunch of general nonsense and so Colmes and I got into it. Even though I’m sorry I said Alan was lying — I should not have used that word — I'm glad the exposition occurred.""

He went on to lament the nation's rising debt and what he called ""economic madness,"" saying that he raised his voice ""to get everyone's attention"" about Obama's stance.

""The president of the United States is not looking out for the country right now,” O’Reilly said. “He is hell-bent on destroying the Republican Party and he does not seem to care if the nation collapses as a result.""

Later on in the show, O'Reilly faced off with guest Kirsten Powers over the issue. Powers echoed Colmes' argument, telling O'Reilly that Obama has proposed spending cuts. She held up a piece of paper which she said detailed $400 billion in health care cuts that the White House wanted to make. ""You need to admit you are wrong,"" she said. ""You are wrong about this and now you’re playing a game.""

O'Reilly argued that Obama has not offered ""specific"" cuts. ""This is where you and I will never agree,"" he said.

“Because I use facts?” Powers shot back. She said that O'Reilly was ""one hundred percent wrong,"" and that Obama's plan for spending cuts was online for anyone to see.

""You and I will never reach détente because you don’t understand the word specific,"" O'Reilly concluded."

Chris Christie, whose political hug of President Obama in the wake of Hurricane Sandy raised Republican hackles, has now criticized the National Rifle Assn. for the group’s anti-gun control ad that referenced the president’s two daughters.

Considered a potential GOP national candidate in 2016, Christie on Thursday went after the NRA, which is part of the coalition that forms the GOP’s conservative wing. The ad argues that because Obama’s daughters have armed security, regular parents deserve the same treatment in the wake of last month’s deadly rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.

The NRA has said it is in favor of putting armed guards in schools and opposes putting limits on owning guns and ammunition as Obama has proposed.

“To talk about the president’s children or any public officer’s children who have -- not by their own choice, but by requirement -- to have protection and to use that somehow to try to make a political point I think is reprehensible,” Christie said at a news conference in which he discussed gun control.

“My children had no choice that I wanted to run for governor. I pretended that they did. I asked them what they thought. But in the end, they had absolutely no choice in whether I ran for governor or not. And they knew that, by the way, when I was asking them, which is why they didn’t spend a whole lot of time answering.”

“But the effects on their lives are significant,” he told reporters. “And they’re a full couple of steps down from the effect that it would have if, you know, when your father’s president of the United States, and the security concerns that go along with that.”

Attacking the NRA may not disqualify Christie as a potential GOP candidate, but it is just the latest in a series of contrarian steps the pugnacious governor has taken.

After Hurricane Sandy tore through his state and others, Christie spoke well of Obama’s efforts to bring immediate aid to New Jersey, which Obama visited. The governor -- who had criticized Obama earlier in the presidential campaign and was an announced supporter of GOP candidate Mitt Romney -- explained that his responsibilities as governor trumped his politics. Christie also had delivered the keynote address at the GOP convention last year.

Then, earlier this month, Christie criticized Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) for delaying House consideration of a Hurricane Sandy relief bill that eventually passed the GOP-controlled House. The cost of the aid package was more than $60 billion.

“All I can tell you is this was the speaker’s decision, his alone,” Christie said at the time.

Christie is seeking reelection as governor. With approval ratings higher than 70%, Christie is considered a prohibitive favorite in the usually Democratic state.

However, Republicans elsewhere have taken notice of Christie’s rebellious comments.

In an interview on Friday with a conservative radio host, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, also a potential 2016 contender and heir to his father’s libertarian constituency, cast doubt on Christie’s chances for national office under the GOP banner.

“I think criticizing the 2nd Amendment movement and the over-the-top ‘give me my money’ stuff, ‘I want all 60 billion now or I’ll throw a tantrum,’ I don’t think that’s going to play well in the Republican primary,” Paul said.

He doesn't live in Jersey ? As a stupid secretary of the state recently said , "" What difference does it make "" ?.

anything that would ""Complicate"" Christies re-election chances can't be risked by the Governor Fat Slob.........................It would be far too ""risky"" to grow a pair and appoint a Republican. After all, Christie is only about himself. Christie is staying Loyal to his butt buddy Obama, by not helping the GOP in any way. (Just like he did last October, when he helped Obama win.)

By not appointed a republican to the Senate which would term to August Christie has just confirmed that he is a full blown RINO. The Senate would have a two count swing for Republicans with this appointment but Christie chose to show his true colots.......................RINO. He should now be banned from all Republican events. He is a Democrat for all practical purposes!

This political stuff is easy. Christie's toughest choice comes at the doughnut shop. Unable to choose between a dozen chocolate eclairs, a dozen bear claws, and a dozen maple bars, he wisely opted for a dozen of each. And that was just for breakfast. And if anyone mentions the brown stuff on his nose, he can lie, and blame it on the eclairs.

Note to GOP and the despicable Karl Rove - Don't even consider nominating Christie OR Jeb Bush for president, because I guarantee you either one will lose.

Christie is a joke with all of his bullying and caustic remarks, etc. -- used to like him a lot -- now he looks just like another dem -- the dems ALWAYS take advantage of opportunities -- Obama must have hugged him extra hard when they did their love-in. I was suspicious and very disappointed with Christie at the RNC convention -- now, I know he is not to be trusted. Let NJ have him -- that's where he should stay.

Is anyone not clear on the concept that Christie is most definitely NOT a conservative? He can label himself as being affiliated with whatever party he'd like, but his actions are what important to observe. Christie is, as demonstrated by his actions, a Big Government Prog. If you like Christie and you want him to represent your interests from a place in public office, then YOU TOO are a prog.

Looks to me like the fat boy took the cowards way out. almost looks like his buddy , bambi, when says ""i see nothing"". Make a decesion porker stop hiding

He is terrified to do anything that might damage his run for the presidency. In his fat clogged mind, being a RINO who sucks obozo's a$$ is an admirable trait.

And you can be sure that RINO Christi, who is receiving huge campaign donations from DUMBOCRATS, will campaign for the dumbocrat candidate. If the people of NJ elect this Dumbama butt-kisser again, they are NUTS.

This LARD ASS, is NO Republican.....................I hope he loses the election for Governor........and the morbidly obese SHILL will NEVER be President ! He's only interested in his own election, spending 24 MILLION to get HIS FAT ASS re-elected. POX on this democRAT in the closet !

I figured it out. Christie is imitating the part played by Jackie Gleason on the Jackie Gleason Show years ago. He tries to play the part of the gruff, self centered, and bossy know it all who runs on bull and a big mouth. Unfortunately for Christie's imitating, Gleason was light years ahead of him. Gleason loved his country, didn't associate with Marxists, and had unlimited talent.

Morbid obesity statistics will catch up with Mr. Tough Talkin' Democrat Mafioso Boss from the Doughnut district of New Jersey

Phat phuck.

Bought and paid for.

This must be the price for his ascension to the national stage in 2016.

He is a stooge of the NY-DC Axis of Multinational Corruption.

Christie has entirely to much FAT IN HIS BRAIN, he will run in 2016 as a Democratic, no doubt in my mind. He is a piece of CRAP!!!

You know what else makes as much sense as nominating Allen West for this seat? Extra spaces. Lots of extra spaces.I agree! It would be so much nicer if Christie had a more complicated reelection bid.What is it with wingnuts and their mega-ellipses? But yeah, I agree! Ban him.Allen West won't lose, though. So nominate him. Please?He was awesome when he was a caustic bully. NO LONGER!!1!I don't like Christie and I don't want him to represent my interests. Can I still be a progressive?Yeah, I don't think Christie's problem is that he's ""hiding"".Using dollar signs makes ""ass"" sound classy.People who write ""DUMBOCRATS"" and ""Dumbama"" are so totallynuts!wish Christie would lose his reelection bid! I'm genuinely heartened by all the bipartisan agreement in this thread!If only it was 1956 all over again, then we wouldn't have to deal with Christie! Or uppity brown people.If he wasn't phat, this would all be okay.Multinational? Which part of the NY-DC Axis isn't America?Kinda like, ""no doubt in my mind Mitt Romney will crush Obummer?"""

USA TODAY

Ranking by insurance website says Louisiana has nation%27s worst drivers.

Its rating is based on road fatality rate%2C failure to obey citations%2C DUIs and speeding tickets.

Drivers ask the question every time they see another motorist sending texts while barreling down the interstate at 75 mph, or changing lanes without signaling, or hanging a left on red:

Does (INSERT STATE HERE) have the worst bleeping drivers in the country?

Just about every year, one organization or another tries to provide an answer, based on factors as varied as how many people could pass their state's written driving test, how many citations are written for distracted driving and how likely people are to die in a motor-vehicle crash.

The latest such survey is from CarInsuranceComparison.com, a website for people to compare features of various automobile insurance companies. For its worst drivers rankings, the website compiles data on fatality rates per 100 million miles traveled, citations for failure to obey traffic signals and seat belt laws, DUI infractions, and tickets for speeding and careless driving. It collects data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the National Motorists Association and MADD.

And the winner is — drumroll, please — Louisiana.

According to CarInsuranceComparison.com, drivers in the Pelican State were propelled to No. 1 by finishing in the top five for failure to obey, speeding tickets and careless driving. Louisiana drivers also won this dubious distinction in last year's rankings.

Jeffrey Crews, vice president of CarInsuranceComparison.com, says the ranking generates lots of conversation and debate. ""There are several reasons for that,"" he says. ""One, it's the holiday season. People are traveling, and that comes into play. Plus, this is something that always comes up. Somebody is always saying, 'This is a horrible state to drive in.' And they can take this and say 'I told you so.'

""Plus, people use it as a little prod to kind of jab at each other,"" he says.

These kinds of rankings are seldom purely scientific, but they sure get people talking.

A 2011 ranking by GMAC Insurance (now National General Insurance) found that some of the nation's worst drivers weren't in a state at all but in Washington, D.C. The insurer based its rankings on how well — or how little — drivers understood rules of the road where they lived. It found that just 71% of drivers in the nation's capital were capable of passing a written driving test.

A 2010 ranking by The Daily Beast analyzed federal crash data and weighed fatal crashes in which driver error — such as DUI, running a stop sign or inattentive driving — was a factor. It found the worst drivers were in North Dakota, followed by Montana, Kentucky and Louisiana.

Another recent report, insurer Allstate's ninth annual ""America's Best Drivers Report"" in August, found that the USA's best drivers, based on Allstate crash claims data, are in Fort Collins, Colo.

The Best Drivers Report ""was created to boost the country's discussion on safe driving,"" according to Michael Roche, the company's senior vice president of claims. ""Best Drivers has generated a lot of attention, which we think is a very good thing.""

The CarInsuranceComparison.com report has neither New Jersey nor New York in the top 10, which is going to be shocking for people such as David Alston, a New Jersey school bus driver who has long argued that his state, along with New York, wins the title hands-down.

Alston, who has logged more than 230,000 miles in each of his last two personal vehicles, says he has seen it all: In 2004, a drunk motorcyclist killed himself when he slammed into Alston's car at 65 mph, just months after Alston's mother was hit by an unlicensed driver in Montclair; he saw a motorcyclist decapitated in a crash near Newark International Airport.

""I see people driving with no lights on in pitch black, in snow, rain, fog,"" he says. ""People tailgate me on my school bus. People blow through stop signs. It's unbelievable. New Jersey's got to be No. 1 or No. 2 for worst drivers.""

States with the worst drivers:

1. Louisiana

2. South Carolina

3. Mississippi

4. Texas

5. Alabama

6. Florida

7. Missouri (tie)

7. North Carolina (tie)

9. Montana

But other times, ill-advised casualness can go wrong, as it did during Alicia Keys’ much discussed performance at the Public Inaugural Ball at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center, one of two official inaugural balls on Monday night.

The first mistake she made was to opt for a medley, as ungratifying a maneuver as can be done onstage. Beginning by tossing off a loose version of “New Day,” Keys traced out a minimal keyboard melody while singing an aspirational song about rebirth and renewal. Halfway through, though, and before she’d developed any sort of momentum, Keys switched to “Girl on Fire,” except with new lyrics she seemed to have banged out with little regard for meaning.

PHOTOS: Pomp, circumstance and famous faces

“He’s president and he’s on fire/Hotter than a fantasy, longer like a highway,” she sang, turning the autobiographical song of determination into an increasingly awkward presidential ode. “He’s living in a world and it’s on fire/Filled with catastrophe but he knows he can fly away,” she went on to sing, and to my ears the suggestion here is that the president just may cut and run when the going gets tough.

“He’s got both feet on the ground,” she continued, “and he’s burning it down/Got his head in the clouds/As he’s not backing down.” Did anyone else interpret that to mean he’s out of touch and stubborn? And how can anyone burn down the ground? She then went into a recast version of the song’s chorus: “Obama’s on fire! Obama’s on fire! He’s walking on fire! Obama’s on fire!”

Perhaps he’s the devil? No? Then, why in the following line did Keys sing, “Everyone stands as he goes by/They can see the flames that’s in his eyes/Watch him as he’s lighting up the night.” OK, maybe I misread it. She was just saying he’s a charismatic guy.

Then Keys acknowledged that the president, hot though he may be, is taken -- “Everyone knows Michelle is his girl/And together they run the world -- and we’re gonna let it burn, let it burn,” and in these lyrics she seemingly confirmed the fear of many right-wing conspiracy theorists.

“Obama’s on fire,” concluded Keys. Good to know. Maybe Hank Williams Jr. could cover the song next.

The remnants of the Tea Party have been pushing a national ""Day of Resistance"" rally today to hoot and holler about guns and their big anger; wingnuts from Breitbart down to local hate-talkers have been pushing relentlessly, but things are not going so well, apparently. Besides the possibility that the whole thing might be a ""data-harvesting operation designed to vacuum up contact information and credit card numbers from unsuspecting and largely clueless conservative activists,"" there are already signs that participants are going to number in the tens.

Michelle Obama was first-term success but what about the next%3F

Some say she is overexposed%2C appearing everywhere from TV talk shows to the Oscars

It%27s clear she%27ll continue to support military families and the fight against childhood obesity

She's already danced on TV with Jimmy Fallon. She's dropped in at the Oscars, worked out on the White House lawn, sparkled at state dinners, become a fashion trendsetter. She's even gotten Americans to think more about what they eat. What's next for first lady Michelle Obama?

From her new bangs-and-bob hairstyle to her dance moves to her couture gowns, people can't stop talking about her — and she kind of can't be avoided. She's a master of Twitter, a star of TV talk shows, a crowd-pleaser wherever she goes.

But is she overexposed? Are we going to see even more of her on our screens in the next four years?

Granted, she did not attend Saturday night's Gridiron Dinner with the president and the Washington press corps. But no less than Saturday Night Live is joking about her ubiquity, teasing in a recent skit that the sequester budget cuts would force her to make ""four television appearances a week, down from her usual 75.""

Obama, who just turned 49, is fully aware of the intensity of attention to everything she does. ""My bangs set off a national conversation,"" Obama told reporters on a recent trip, after she had joked that the bangs were her ""midlife crisis."" ""We've got a lot of talking going on. Everybody's kitchen-table conversation is now accessible to everybody else. It's absolutely not surprising.""

According to the White House, she and her staff are in the midst of strategizing how the next four years might differ, or might not, from her first term as FLOTUS, generally hailed as a rousing success with her clever blending of conventional and unconventional.

""I can't think of too much to criticize,"" says Anita McBride, former chief of staff to Laura Bush and now director of first-lady studies at American University in Washington. ""Is she pushing the envelope? Not for her. I think she's clearly found her footing.""

It's not as if Obama had a lot of training. A lawyer and non-profit executive, she was not a longtime political wife, never lived in Washington, didn't do politics, didn't even much want her husband to run for president.Syndicated columnist Kathleen Parker writes that Obama is having fun as the star of her own movie. ""She isn't just breaking the mold; she's shattering the good china. The Madonna of first ladies, she is emerging as an iconoclastic, self-reinventing woman who clearly doesn't mind shaking the firmament.""

Since 2009, her East Wing has undergone typical staff upheavals: She is on her third chief of staff, her second press secretary, her second communications director and her third social secretary (who is, for the first time, a man).

But she adapted to the undefined job of first lady like a pro, say those who have watched her. Polls show she's become one of the most popular, admired women in the world, able to persuade kids to eat their vegetables or make an unknown fashion designer like Jason Wu a global star.

""She's been a tremendous success. I don't know of any who had more success with a White House initiative,"" says Myra Gutin, a dean of first-lady historians and professor of communication at Rider University in New Jersey.

Obama has done all the traditional, popular first-lady things — adopted causes, hosted the grand, good and glittery at the White House, raised millions for her husband. But she has gone, repeatedly, where no first lady has gone before, especially on social media, which largely didn't exist for her predecessors, and on TV, which did.

She has embraced media in ways her predecessors did not. At the same time, she maintains a loyal, non-leaking, highly controlled operation that is at least as non-transparent as the White House press corps says the West Wing is. (Except no one is complaining about it.)

Meanwhile, she's tweeting, and even does Twitter Q&As. She hangs out on Google Hangout, has about 9.5 million ""likes"" on her Facebook page, and live-streams with first pooch Bo, greeting surprised tourists or reading stories to kids at the White House. The video of her wacky ""Evolution of Mom-Dancing"" with Fallon has more than 14.5 million views on YouTube. She tells funny stories when she goes on Jay Leno's or David Letterman's late-night chat show.

Once, Obama went to Target, to the shock of fellow shoppers.

She says she misses that freedom. ​""Going to Target for me is like a dream, you know?"" she told Robin Roberts in a recent Good Morning America interview. ""That one time I went, you noticed it created a stir. I'm gonna do it again, doggone it. Next four years, I'm going out. I'm breaking out. I'm gonna disguise Bo. I'm gonna put on a coat. I'm gonna take a walk, and my agents won't know a thing. Don't tell 'em!""​

This sort of thing is irresistible, say Obama trackers. ""In real-life America, this woman is genuinely admired and, in an odd way, genuinely liked, even if people don't know her — she's not just a remote figure from afar,"" says Elizabeth Mehren, a former journalist who is now a journalism professor at Boston University. ""There is a likability factor — the sense that if you sat down and had coffee with her, you'd like her.""

Gutin says she first understood how much different Obama would be from her predecessors when Gutin was invited to the White House to watch her plant her now-world-famous kitchen garden with a group of Washington schoolchildren.

""There she was in her knee-level sweats, in the ground, talking to them about eating fruits and vegetables, getting dirty with everybody else,"" Gutin says. ""I thought, well this is really pretty interesting.""

Obama has been cautious, so she's made few mistakes. She's done and said nothing that could be seized as an effective cudgel against the Obama administration, along the lines of former first lady Hillary Clinton's highly contentious attempt to preside over health care policy in her husband's administration.

And yet, some people, mostly opponents of her husband, are asking, in the language of TV, has Michelle Obama jumped the shark?

""No, that's ridiculous. She's not playing a character in a '50s sitcom,"" scoffs Barbara Lippert, a MediaPost.com columnist who covers the intersection of the media and pop culture. Millions of viewers on YouTube can't be all wrong, Lippert adds.

""Only the worst curmudgeon would make fun of that — it was a wonderful way to show people to get moving. Plus, I bet JCrew sold a lot of that sweater set she was wearing,"" she says.

Obama herself says she's not bothered by criticism of her ubiquity. ""I don't think about that stuff,"" she told reporters last week. ""It doesn't have anything to do with me. Anyone in this position has a huge spotlight, and in modern-day media, the spotlight just gets more intense. I don't attribute this to me or Barack. The culture has just shifted.""

It's not unusual for a first lady's comments and actions to be used against her husband, but Obama has not given opponents much to work with. Her remark during the 2008 campaign that for the first time she was ""proud"" of her country has faded into irrelevance, and her first-year expensive vacation in Spain with her daughters has not been repeated.

Then her drop-in at the Oscars ceremony on Feb. 24, when she announced the best-picture winner live from the White House, seemed at first to be promising for some critics: It made her vulnerable to claims that she is overexposed, Lippert says.

""It makes both the president and the first lady seem small and grasping,"" huffed The Washington Post's conservative columnist Jennifer Rubin. ""In this case, it was just downright weird.""

But not entirely unprecedented. President Reagan, a former movie star, once taped an appearance for the Oscars; former first lady Laura Bush once appeared on tape discussing movies at the Oscars; and President Franklin Roosevelt once spoke by radio at the Oscars. But never mind, even a few liberal pundits were miffed.

""Unbecoming frivolities,"" thundered the Post's popular metro columnist Courtland Milloy.

Elitist, declared MSNBC's Donny Deutsch, a Democrat, on CNN. ""I just thought it was very, very tone-deaf, and I'm just surprised they did it.""

Still, is this the best they've got?

""The people who are mean, the professional nasties — they don't have a case, so they're grasping for one,"" Mehren says.

But is there just ... well, too much of her? ""Two billion people watched her at the Oscars, so her exposure is tremendous, and it's following on the heels of a very popular appearance on the Jimmy Fallon show, where she was clearly having fun,"" McBride says.

More to the point, she says, ""a second term is very liberating because the campaigning is behind you,"" McBride says. ""There is a recognition that this time period passes so quickly and there's lots to do. I think (the FLOTUS staffers) are going to evaluate the success of the programs they already have.""​​

First-lady projects are designed to be non-controversial. Who could be against highway beautification or literacy? Obama chose to focus on military families and healthy eating and exercise to fight childhood obesity.

She's been tireless in promoting these projects in ways that rivet public attention: She invited military families to dinners at the White House and a special inaugural ball just for them. She did push-ups with Ellen DeGeneres, cooked with Rachael Ray, goofed off at the White House with Big Bird, and donned workout togs to do jumping jacks with crowds of

kiddies on the White House lawn.

Right-wing pundits such as Rush Limbaugh have periodically assailed her anti-obesity campaign as government meddling and called her a hypocrite every time she's seen eating something tasty — pizza, short ribs, etc. — in public, but Limbaugh himself has battled to lose weight. In any case, few others have objected to her causes, even if they don't like her bangs or her fashion choices.

Obama can also point to being effective. Obesity rates among children are starting to decline, corporate titans such as Walmart have joined her crusade, healthier food options are turning up in neighborhoods where few have been spotted before. Now she's pushing to bring back more PE classes to public schools, and she enlisted Nike to provide $50 million in seed money. She's managed to sign up the likes of Beyoncé and Sesame Street to help her get kids moving.

She might adopt a new cause in the new term, but it's already clear she will continue to promote her current projects. And she'll have two teenage daughters to raise.

""But she doesn't need to come up with second act. She's doing a fine job,"" Mehren says.

""She's cracked the code on first ladies,"" says Lippert.

In her position, Obama was always going to be scrutinized. McBride says she figured out how to project a classy image at home and abroad, while ""writing her own job description and being her own CEO.

""She can measure up to those who came before her."""

Carter', 'Barbara Starr']",Medal of Honor recipient William Swenson braved gunfire to get bodies,"Story highlights William Swenson is the sixth living recipient from the Afghan and Iraq wars Swenson was honored for his action on September 8, 2009, in the Ganjgal Valley He braved enemy fire to retrieve the bodies of dead soldiers, Obama says He criticized his commanders for failing to support soldiers during the battle

(CNN) —

A shaky video captured only a few moments of William D. Swenson’s actions during a brutal, hours-long battle in Afghanistan: Kissing a badly wounded comrade on the forehead as he helped load the soldier into a helicopter.

“This may be the first time we bear witness to a small portion of the action” of a Medal of Honor recipient, President Barack Obama said Tuesday as he awarded the now-retired Army captain the nation’s highest military honor for his actions in the Ganjgal Valley in 2009.

Swenson, 34, of Seattle, is the sixth living recipient from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to earn the honor, and this is only the second time in a half-century that two men from the same battle have been awarded the medal.

Swenson, who retired from the Army in 2011, is being awarded the medal for his actions on September 8, 2009, in the Battle of the Ganjgal Valley in Afghanistan’s Kunar province. The battle claimed the lives of four American soldiers, 10 Afghan soldiers and an Afghan interpreter.

A fifth soldier, Sgt. First Class Kenneth Westbrook – the man Swenson helped load onto the helicopter – later died from his wounds.

Swenson was working with Afghan security forces in the volatile Kunar province near Pakistan’s border when he and his troops came under fire.

Obama recounted to an audience of fellow soldiers and families of the fallen how Swenson braved enemy fire again and again to recover the bodies of the dead Americans and Afghans.

“In moments like this, Americans like Will remind us of what our country can be at its best, a nation of citizens who look out for one another, who meet our obligations to one another not just when it’s easy, but also when it’s hard,” Obama said. “Maybe, especially when it’s hard.”

Part of Swenson’s rescue efforts were recorded by a rescue pilot’s helmet camera. In the heat of battle, with bullets flying and dust blocking any clear vision of the surrounding situation, Swenson is seen helping Westbrook, who had been shot in the throat, back to a helicopter.

After placing him in the helicopter, Swenson bent down to kiss his forehead before running back to the battle to retrieve other fallen Americans and Afghan fighters.

“I was just trying to keep his spirits up. I wanted him to know it was going to be OK. And I wanted him to know that he had done his job, but it was time for him to go,” Swenson told CNN recently.

The road to this honor has not been easy for Swenson, whose nomination was “lost” for a time, prompting questions from lawmakers and an eventual internal Pentagon investigation.

Swenson spoke out after the 2009 battle, criticizing his leadership for failing to provide him with adequate air support after multiple radio requests. The Army later backed up his claims, reprimanding two commanding officers.

“What happened that day was a result of clouded judgment,” Swenson told CNN’s Barbara Starr in a recent interview. “It was a result of clouded judgment on behalf of people who did later receive letters of reprimand.”

The nomination statement, once found, was nothing short of glowing for Swenson, saying the soldier “braved intense enemy fire, and willfully put his life in danger against the enemy’s main effort, multiple times in service of his fallen and wounded comrades, his unit, his country, and his endangered Afghan partners.”

Army officials confirmed to CNN that Swenson has filed paperwork to return to Army active duty.

Dakota Meyer, a Marine, was honored for his actions in the same battle in 2011.

Edward I. Koch, the former congressman and New York mayor whose wisecracking pugnacity embodied the city he led back from the edge of bankruptcy in the 1970s, died Friday in Manhattan of congestive heart failure, a spokesman said. He was 88.

In three terms as New York’s chief executive from 1978 through 1989, the Democrat’s touchstone achievement was to help revive a city that had defined urban dysfunction.

It was Mr. Koch’s quote-

machine of a persona — his unbridled candor and unyielding chutzpah — that made him a dominant character in a city packed with them.

“How’m I doing?” the mayor liked to bellow as he gallivanted up and down city streets, bald pate bobbing, his arms raised above his lanky frame. He spoke in a whiny, nasal voice that was as New York as the screech of an A train.

In recent years, Mr. Koch had a heart attack and quadruple bypass surgery. He was admitted to New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center this week and died there about 2 a.m. Friday.

The former mayor, always known for his timing, died on the day “Koch,” a documentary about him, was to open at theaters in New York.

“New York City lost an irrepressible icon,” New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg (I) said. “Ed helped lift the city out of its darkest days and set it on course for an incredible comeback.”

After an unsuccessful bid to be mayor in 1973, Mr. Koch ran again four years later. He sought the Democratic nomination in a field that included incumbent Abraham Beame, the loquacious Rep. Bella Abzug and the largely unknown Mario Cuomo.

The race was defined by a serial killer known as Son of Sam and a midsummer blackout that triggered widespread looting and made the city a symbol of urban ills.

Against this tumult, Mr. Koch brandished the slogan “A Liberal With Sanity.” He embraced the death penalty as a way of cultivating the political center. Victorious, he rode a city bus to his swearing-in ceremony.

As mayor, Mr. Koch inherited an estimated deficit of $1 billion. Incurring the wrath of unions, he trimmed the payrolls and stabilized the city’s finances. By 1983, New York’s surplus was $500 million.

In his first two terms, Mr. Koch expanded public housing, encouraged development, and restored services.

During a 1980 subway strike, the mayor stood on the Brooklyn Bridge, cheering on commuters forced to hoof it to work. “We’re not going to let these bastards bring us to our knees!” Mr. Koch shouted, referring to the strikers. “People began to applaud,” he recalled later. “I knew I was on to something.”

When his first term ended, Mr. Koch was so popular that the Democratic and Republican parties both endorsed him for reelection. Time magazine put him on its cover, his picture floating above the city’s skyline.

Douglas Muzzio, a professor at New York’s Baruch College, called Mr. Koch the “quintessential New Yorker. He was bigger than life, and had the personality and ego to prove it.”

Riding his popularity, Mr. Koch ran for governor in 1982, but his campaign foundered after Playboy magazine published an interview in which the mayor dismissed suburban living as “sterile” and rural America as a “joke.”

Troubling times

Over the course of his three terms as mayor, Mr. Koch faced three issues that threatened the social fabric of New York and other large cities: homelessness, AIDS and the spread of crack cocaine.

While AIDS activists at the time chided the mayor, saying he was ineffectual, Mr. Koch cited the more than $400 million in government spending he had directed toward the crisis, the housing he ordered built for AIDS patients and his opposition to AIDS discrimination.

His mayoralty also was defined by several racially charged crimes, including one in 1984 in which Bernhard Goetz, a white man dubbed the “Subway Vigilante” in headlines, shot four black men he believed were about to mug him on a subway train. In 1989, a group of black and Hispanic teenagers were accused of raping and beating a white woman jogging in Central Park, an attack that Mr. Koch branded “the crime of the century.” The convictions of the men were later overturned.

The worst personal crisis Mr. Koch would face was in his third term, after he won reelection in 1985.

Corruption scandals impaled many of his political allies, one of whom, Donald Manes, the Queens borough president, committed suicide with a kitchen knife as federal investigators probed allegations that he took bribes. Rudolph W. Giuliani, then a U.S. attorney, led the prosecution, a role that helped launch a political career that culminated in two terms as mayor.

Although Mr. Koch was never implicated, he said that the scandals were the darkest days of his mayoralty. “I said to myself, ‘Is this how I’m going to be remembered?’ ” he said. “I went into a state of depression that no one was aware of.”

New Yorkers grew tired of the mayor’s apparently unceasing need to share his opinions on everything from life in the Soviet Union (“The pits,” he said) to an assessment of his own physique (“I’m a Greek God”).

During the 1988 presidential campaign, he caused a kerfuffle when he said Jews would be “crazy” to vote for the Rev. Jesse Jackson because Jackson had voiced support for Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. The mayor’s remark became fodder for critics who derided him as racially polarizing.

The following year, Mr. Koch was defeated in the Democratic primary by David N. Dinkins, who then beat Giuliani during the general election. Dinkins became New York’s first black mayor.

Mr. Koch said his most significant achievement was burnishing the city’s image at a time when New York, with its graffiti-splattered subways and rampant crime, was a national punch line.

“When I came in, people would say they were from Long Island because they were too ashamed to say they were from the city,” Mr. Koch said. “I gave them back their morale.”

Son of a furrier

Edward Irving Koch was born Dec. 12, 1924, in the Bronx, the son of a Jewish immigrant furrier who moved the family to Newark during the Depression. Mr. Koch attended City College of New York but left when he was drafted into the Army during World War II. After his discharge, he received a law degree from New York University.

While practicing law in Manhattan, Mr. Koch became active in a reform group that sought to end the old machine politics in New York.

He scored his first significant political victory in 1963, ousting Carmine DeSapio, an entrenched Tammany Hall politico, as district leader in Greenwich Village. Mr. Koch served on the City Council before winning a seat in the House of Representatives in 1968.

During the 1977 mayoral campaign, Mr. Koch’s otherwise amiable relationship with Mario Cuomo soured when unsigned campaign posters cropped up that read “Vote for Cuomo, Not the Homo,” an allusion to widespread rumors about Mr. Koch’s sexual orientation.

Although Cuomo denied responsibility for the signs, Mr. Koch blamed him and his son, Andrew, who worked on that campaign and is now New York’s governor. Mr. Koch said in later years that the episode tarnished his view of the Cuomos.

Mr. Koch never married and refused to answer questions about his sexual orientation. Still, he sought to neutralize speculation during the 1977 race by campaigning alongside Bess Myerson, the first Jewish woman to win the Miss America title, with whom he was often seen holding hands.

Although Mr. Koch claimed fatigue when he left City Hall, he never grew tired of attention. He wrote novels, memoirs, newspaper columns and movie reviews. He hosted radio and television shows, including “Saturday Night Live.”

Mr. Koch rarely liked to venture far from the city. In 2008, he announced that he had bought a burial plot in New York and planned to spend eternity in the city of his birth.

“The idea of leaving Manhattan permanently irritates me,” he said."

Peters'],Senate Democrats Poised to Block Filibusters of Presidential Picks,"WASHINGTON — Senate Democrats are on the verge of moving to eliminate the use of the filibuster against most presidential nominees, aides and senior party leaders said Wednesday, a move that would deprive Republicans of their ability to block President Obama’s picks for cabinet posts and the federal judiciary and further erode what little bipartisanship still exists in the Senate.

Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, is poised to move forward on Thursday with a vote on what is known on Capitol Hill as the “nuclear option,” several Democrats said. Mr. Reid and the senators who have been the most vocal on stopping the Republican blockade of White House nominees are now confident they have the votes to make the change.

“We’re not bluffing,” said one senior aide who has spoken with Mr. Reid directly and expects a vote on Thursday, barring any unforeseen breakthrough on blocked judges.

The threat that Democrats could significantly limit how the filibuster can be used against nominees has rattled Republicans. Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican who has brokered last-minute deals that have averted a change to filibuster rules in the past, visited Mr. Reid in his office on Thursday but failed to strike a compromise."

Hillsdale College President Larry Arnn described minority students as ""dark ones"" during a state legislature subcommittee hearing regarding the adoption of Common Core State Standards.

While testifying against the Common Core, which have been adopted in more than 40 states in an effort to standardize education, Arnn said he took issue with the idea of government interfering with educational institutions and went on to describe a letter he had received from the Department of Education shortly after becoming president at Hillsdale. The letter, he told the committee, said his college ""violated the standards for diversity because we didn't have enough dark ones, I guess, is what they meant.""

According to Michigan-focused news site MLive, lawmakers at the meeting immediately criticized Arnn for using “offensive” language, but he did not apologize. Instead, Arnn went on to say: “The State of Michigan sent a group of people down to my campus, with clipboards ... to look at the colors of people’s faces and write down what they saw. We don’t keep records of that information. What were they looking for besides dark ones?""

A Michigan Department of Education spokesperson told the Detroit Free Press that officials visited Hillsdale in 1998 for a routine evaluation of the school’s teacher preparation program. During that visit, they noted the ethnicity of the students and faculty members in the program.

Several hours after Arnn made his initial statements, Hillsdale College issued an official apology. “No offense was intended by the use of that term except to the offending bureaucrats,"" read the statement, which was published by MLive. It further said that while Arnn was sorry if offense was taken, his greater concern “is the state-endorsed racism the story illustrates.""

Located in Hillsdale, Mich., the small liberal arts institution over which Arnn presides was founded in 1844. According to its website, the school ""was the first American college to prohibit in its charter any discrimination based on race, religion or sex, and became an early force for the abolition of slavery.” Hillsdale does not receive state or federal subsidies and avoids “federal mandates and control,” another page on its site says.

An alum told MLive he believes Arnn’s comments were misunderstood.

“I think this was Dr. Arnn’s way to indicate that he was offended with what they were doing in taking clipboards and walking around campus to record the color of students’ skin,” James Joseph, a 2010 graduate, told the outlet. “He’s a very magnanimous man with a generous and charitable spirit, but he doesn’t stand on public piety.”"

WASHINGTON (AP) — Republican Rep. Phil Gingrey, an OB-GYN since 1975, said former Rep. Todd Akin was ""partly right"" when he said women's bodies can avoid pregnancy in cases of ""legitimate rape.""

However, the six-term Georgia lawmaker issued a statement Friday, the day after his comments, saying his position was misconstrued and that he neither defends nor stands by Akin's remark.

Gingrey spoke to constituents at a Thursday breakfast meeting and commented on both Akin and Richard Mourdock, two Republican Senate candidates tripped up by their clumsy comments last year about rape and abortion, according to the Marietta Daily Journal in Georgia. Republicans disavowed Akin after his statement, and Mourdock was widely criticized when he said pregnancy resulting from rape is ""something God intended.""

""Part of the reason the Dems still control the Senate is because of comments made in Missouri by Todd Akin and Indiana by Mourdock were considered a little bit over the top,"" Gingrey said, according to the newspaper. ""Mourdock basically said 'Look, if there is conception in the aftermath of a rape, that's still a child, and it's a child of God, essentially.' Now, in Indiana, that cost him the election.

""And in Missouri, Todd Akin was asked by a local news source about rape and he said, 'Look, in a legitimate rape situation' — and what he meant by legitimate rape was just, look, someone can say I was raped: a scared-to-death 15-year-old that becomes impregnated by her boyfriend and then has to tell her parents — that's pretty tough — and might on some occasion say, 'Hey, I was raped.' That's what he meant when he said legitimate rape versus non-legitimate rape.

""I don't find anything so horrible about that,"" Gingrey said. ""But then he went on and said that in a situation of rape, of a legitimate rape, a woman's body has a way of shutting down so the pregnancy would not occur. He's partly right on that.""

He made the comments to the Smyrna Area Council of the Cobb Chamber of Commerce, according to the newspaper.

Gingrey added that he has been an OB-GYN since 1975 and understands pregnancies.

""And I've delivered lots of babies, and I know about these things. It is true. We tell infertile couples all the time that are having trouble conceiving because of the woman not ovulating, 'Just relax. Drink a glass of wine. And don't be so tense and uptight, because all that adrenaline can cause you not to ovulate.' So he was partially right, wasn't he?"" Gingrey said. ""But the fact that a woman may have already ovulated 12 hours before she is raped, you're not going to prevent a pregnancy there by a woman's body shutting anything down, because the horse has already left the barn, so to speak. And yet the media took that and tore it apart,"" the congressman said.

Gingrey is co-chairman of the GOP Doctors Caucus, which was formed in March 2009 to challenge President Barack Obama's health care overhaul. He also is a member of the Health subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce panel.

He sought to explain his comments, saying in a statement issued by his office Friday, ""At a breakfast yesterday morning, I was asked why Democrats made abortion a central theme of the presidential campaign. I do not defend, nor do I stand by, the remarks made by Rep. Akin and Mr. Mourdock. In my attempt to provide context as to what I presumed they meant, my position was misconstrued.""

Gingrey's initial comments drew widespread criticism.

""Just when I think Republicans can't possibly be any more wrong when it comes to women, they find a new low. In one fell swoop, Republican Congressman Phil Gingrey said women regularly lie about being raped, that they're able to prevent a pregnancy simply by 'being tense and uptight,' and that Todd Akin had a point,"" said Stephanie Schriock, President of EMILY's List.

Jesse Ferguson of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee said it was ""alarming and telling"" that the head of the GOP Doctors Caucus shared Akin's views."

Lew’s financial disclosure forms, filed in 2009 and 2011, showed that Lew had invested between $50,000 and $100,000 in a fund called Citigroup Venture Capital International Growth Partnership (Employee) II, L.P. -- the very type of fund President Obama has repeatedly criticized.

The fund is an international venture capital fund for employees of Citigroup. According to his official White House biography, Lew served as managing director and chief operating officer of Citi Global Wealth Management and then Citi Alternative Investments (CAI) from 2006 to 2008.

Lew himself isn't commenting, but a person familiar with Lew’s investment told NBC News that Lew invested a total of $56,000 and sold it at a loss for $54,418 in November 2010 after being confirmed as director of the federal Office of Management and Budget.

The source also told NBC News that Lew had no role in creating, managing or operating the fund, and that Citigroup had organized the fund in the Cayman Islands and made it available to other employees. The source said that many other Citigroup employees had investments in the fund.

According to a Securities and Exchange Commission document, the fund was registered at what has been called a notorious address in the Cayman Islands, located in the Caribbean in the British West Indies. Specifically, the fund’s address was a post office box in a building called Ugland House, in the capital city of George Town on Grand Cayman, the largest of the three Cayman islands.

In 2007 as a presidential candidate and in 2009 as president, Obama identified Ugland House as part of an outrageous tax scam, because according to filings, it housed 12,000 businesses that all claimed the building as their headquarters.

“For years, we've talked about shutting down overseas tax havens that let companies set up operations to avoid paying taxes in America,” Obama said in remarks about tax reform in 2009. “Either this is the largest building in the world, or the largest tax scam in the world. And I think the American people know which it is. That's the kind of tax scam that we need to end.”

A political ad targeting Republican candidate Mitt Romney during the 2012 presidential campaign asked, “Why would Mitt Romney invest millions in the Cayman Islands?”

Tonight, after NBC News asked for comment, White House spokesman Eric Schultz issued a lengthy statement:

“Jack Lew paid all of his taxes and reported all of the income, gains and losses from the investment on his tax returns. The existence of Mr. Lew’s investment is not news to the Senate.

“Mr. Lew disclosed the investment in his prior confirmations, before three separate committees, for Deputy Secretary of State in 2009 and Director of the Office of Management and Budget in 2010, and he was confirmed by the Senate unanimously on both occasions.

“Twelve Members of the Finance Committee, including five Republicans, were members of the three committees that previously reviewed Mr. Lew’s nominations. All three committees reported Mr. Lew’s nomination to the Senate unanimously.

“Mr. Lew disclosed the investment to the Office of Government Ethics and to ethics officials at the State Department and OMB, including on his public financial disclosure forms, in connection with both of his previous confirmations. He played no role in creating, managing or operating the fund and he sold his investment in 2010 at a net loss.

“There are no new facts that provide a basis for Senators to reach a different conclusion about Mr. Lew’s nomination than they reached twice before in this Administration.”

A Democratic spokesman for the Senate Finance Committee, which will hold a confirmation hearing on Lew’s nomination on Wednesday, said that Lew’s investment had come up again through its current vetting process, raised by both Republican and Democrat members. The spokesman said once the committee had looked into the matter, it had determined the investment was not an issue. The spokesman said Lew had been completely transparent and forthcoming through any and all questions that have been posed.

But Iowa Sen. Charles Grassley, a Republican member of the Senate Finance Committee, disputed the Obama administration’s and the Democratic committee spokesman’s statements.

“It was disclosed only if you knew where to look and then were able to put the pieces together,” Grassley said in a statement late Friday. “To say this information was fully disclosed to the public is misleading, at best.”

Grassley noted Obama’s criticism of Ugland House-based investment funds came while Lew, now his Treasury Secretary nominee, had investments in one of those funds. Lew didn’t divest his Cayman Island investment until almost the end of 2010, when he was already working for the administration, and a year after the president publicly railed against such offshore accounts as tax havens.

“The irony is thick,” Grassley said.

Barksdale Maynard', 'July']",Rescuers rush to preserve TV shows shot on fragile videotape,"Walter Cronkite’s news broadcasts are among the videotaped programs that the Library of Congress is digitizing. (CBS PHOTO ARCHIVE/GETTY IMAGES)

At a Library of Congress facility in Culpeper, an effort is underway to convert old videotapes into digital files, ensuring the long-term survival of a host of 1950s-through-1970s TV shows, including the “CBS Evening News” with Walter Cronkite and “Rowan & Martin’s Laugh-In.”

Preserving these shows turns out to be a challenging and time-consuming task. But unless the videotapes are transformed, experts say, future generations will have a diminished appreciation of the era of JFK, flower power and Watergate.

Two-inch-wide quadruplex (or quad) videotape, which was the TV-industry standard from 1956 through the late 1970s, was never meant for long-term storage of sound and images. Developed by Ampex, a company based in California, it allowed network shows to be recorded while being broadcast in New York and then played back later the same evening for West Coast audiences.

Thrifty producers were grateful that videotape could easily be erased, then reused.They were slow to realize that the initial recordings might have value in the distant future.

The videotapes have delicate coatings — essentially “polyurethane paint with magnetic particles inside it,” says Jim Lindner of Media Matters, which specializes in transferring videotaped material to more stable formats. Over time, these coatings absorb moisture, grow sticky and sometimes separate from their backing. With every fleck that peels away, Lindner says, “a bit of recorded history does, too.”

At the Packard Campus of the Library of Congress’s National Audio-Visual Conservation Center, technicians often “bake the tape” in a 130-degree oven for days to resolidify these loose coatings. That is just one of the difficult steps in the tape-to-digital conversion.

Once resolidified, the tapes can be played back only on old video players as part of the conversion process. Doing so entails a risk that they will snap in two as the players’ magnetic heads whir across them at 88 mph. If the head encounters a bump, says Packard video-lab supervisor Paul Klamer, “it hits it like a Mack truck and saws directly through the tape — zing! These are scary to play back.”

Much of our video heritage is already lost to history. “A lot of things happened culturally because of TV, but in many cases we no longer have those tapes,” Lindner says. “What we have now is just what was left over” after routine erasures and discardings.

For example, the Vietnam War played out on nightly network news shows, but “we have very few [tapes of those shows] today,” according to Lindner. Did late-night humorists contribute to changing social mores in the ’60s? Hard to say, since episodes of “The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson” from 1962 to 1970 have almost totally disappeared. “It was only after Carson secured the rights to the show from NBC that he insisted on keeping copies for subsequent clip licensing,” says Mike Mashon, who heads the moving image section at the Packard Campus.

The archives of one major network, which Lindner declined to identify, contain fewer than 3,000 tapes of evening news broadcasts from the heyday of quad videotape; he says that is less than half of the shows that aired.

Because an hour of programming required nearly a mile of quad tape — four times more than today’s tape requires — preserving it is a major undertaking: Every inch must be carefully cleaned and inspected before playback is attempted.

And the tape can be played back only on pre-1980 equipment. “Keeping the equipment running is a big part of the problem,” Klamer says. If a part breaks in the Ampex machines that are required to play the “Laugh-In” tapes, a replacement can be almost impossible to find. Today there are barely 100 working Ampex units in the world, Klamer says, making them rarer than Edsels. Packard owns 27 of the machines (original price $100,000), only two of which are operational.

In fact, a shortage of parts may prove to be the most difficult problem for anyone interested in watch early videotapes. In storerooms heaped with obsolete technology, Packard staff members cannibalize parts from old video players. Only one company that refurbishes magnetic heads remains in business, charging about $5,000 per head.

The Library of Congress is hoping eventually to convert all of its 700,000 tapes to a digital format. Most of its holdings were deposits required by law: Any movie or TV show that is copyrighted must have a copy donated to the library. Once converted, the original tapes are kept for posterity.

Others are also trying to save tapes found in garages and basements, where conditions hasten their decomposition.

Working as a consultant to museums, corporations and other clients, Lindner often encounters discouraging masses of unlabeled tapes. In the 1990s, he came upon a tape belonging to a news company that bore the cryptic label “Resignation/Disneyland.” Was this tape worth spending $400 to convert? He nearly passed it over — but it turned out to be a speech that Ronald Reagan, then the governor of California, gave at Disneyland in 1974, in which he commented on Richard Nixon’s resignation that year as president.

Chris Lewis, a son of the entertainer Jerry Lewis, is working to preserve his father’s extensive quad tape collection, including a 1959 NBC show in which his father starred. Unseen since the Eisenhower era, the tape was “in a very delicate state,” according to David Crosthwait of DC Video, which is handling the digitization.

Chris Lewis calls “The Jazz Singer” — a TV remake of the famous 1927 film that ushered in the “talkie” era — especially rare for having been broadcast in color and for showing Jerry Lewis “in his first dramatic role.”

These efforts notwithstanding, quad tape “is a very endangered species,” says Ken Weissman, supervisor of the film preservation laboratory at Packard. “And things are absolutely going to disappear.”

The unnamed shooter, profiled in a recent Esquire cover story that describes a post-military life without a pension or timely disability benefits, met with lawmakers Tuesday to discuss veteran’s care.

The SEAL, who didn’t qualify for a pension or health benefits for his family because he retired four years earlier than the Navy’s 20-year threshold, met with Sen. Bernard Sanders (I-Vt.), chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs.

The SEAL’s disability claim with the military is reportedly caught up in a backlog with about 900,000 veterans who have to wait, on average, more than nine months for a determination on their claims.

“The fellow who killed Osama bin Laden is one of many people who are having these problems. It helps spotlight these problems,” Sanders told the Los Angeles Times on Wednesday, declining to go into detail about the meeting with the shooter, who has been worried about retaliation from Al Qaeda.

“He is one of 900,000, and he deserves justice, and those 900,000 deserve justice too,” said Sanders, who plans to hold hearings about the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs backlog, which he called “my highest priority.”

The Center for Investigative Reporting, which co-published the story with Esquire and whose executive chairman, Phil Bronstein, wrote the piece, said on its website that the SEAL met with nine lawmakers from both parties Tuesday, along with a contingent that included Bronstein, representatives from Esquire and the SEAL’s former mentor.

“The Shooter is not as large as I expected,” Esquire editor David Granger wrote in a blog post. “He’s one of those guys who is sneaky big. He doesn’t stand out. In a suit, you can’t see his tattoos and you don’t realize how solid he is until you stand next to him.”

Granger reported that the SEAL told each legislator about “the lack of action” in providing protection for his family and that “the Shooter and the members of the group accompanying him presented the legislators with a three-part proposal for easing the transition out of the military for elite forces that would require no legislation.”

Those requests included a tiered pension plan that would begin after five years of duty, improved transition services for retiring veterans that include 18 months of total family healthcare, and departure pay based on length and type of service, according to Granger.

“It went really well,” the SEAL told Bronstein, who attended the meetings in his capacity as a journalist, according to the Center for Investigative Reporting. “I think we raised awareness. Now it’s just a question of acting.”

According to Bronstein’s original story, the SEAL had suffered from suicidal thoughts and a broken marriage, which were described as common among SEAL operatives. In an interview with “PBS NewsHour,” Bronstein described the SEAL’s financial situation as “not broke ... but insecure.”

Bronstein’s profile also initially claimed, falsely, that the SEAL got “nothing” from the government in retirement when all Iraq and Afghanistan veterans actually qualify for five years of health benefits. That claim drew private grumbles from officials in the Navy and the Department of Veterans Affairs.

Esquire also had to draw back an attack it made in a blog post against a Stars and Stripes reporter who had questioned the story’s healthcare claim -- a claim the magazine later was forced to correct.

Those initial waves of criticism may recede as attention turns to the government’s care of special forces operators, which the military has heavily relied upon for precise, dangerous fieldwork during years of unconventional warfare.

Gawker’s Tom Scocca, who criticized Esquire’s handling and framing of the story, wrote, “It does seem stupid and indefensible that this is our national policy -- that after years and years in the most dangerous combat zones, constantly risking physical and mental health, a SEAL should have to clock his full 20, same as a deskbound clerk.”

Eve Burton, a senior vice president of Hearst Corp., Esquire’s publisher, also attended the congressional meetings Tuesday, a Hearst spokesman said.

“The Navy SEAL in the Esquire article has come forward in an effort to assist all our special forces, who are American heroes often unknown to the public, to get the benefits and assistance they need to transition back to civilian life,” Burton told the Center for Investigative Reporting.

Perhaps in spite of military officials’ wishes -- and in spite of the Navy SEALs’ creed, which states, “I do not advertise the nature of my work, nor seek recognition for my actions” -- the as-yet-unnamed shooter joins a coterie of other special forces veterans who have refashioned their secret experiences for mass media.

Another SEAL Team 6 member on the mission to kill Bin Laden, Matt Bissonnette, saw his name go public just days after publishing a firsthand account of the attack in “No Easy Day” under a pen name. He and other special forces veterans helped consult on Electronic Arts Inc.'s “Medal of Honor Warfighter” video game.

SEAL veteran Chris Kyle was killed at a shooting range after publishing a memoir about his time as a spectacularly lethal sniper in Iraq, which also chronicled his psychological struggles after returning home from war. His accused killer, Eddie Ray Routh, a Marine reservist, had also been reportedly diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, and Kyle’s death has since become a rallying cry for PTSD awareness.

Bin Laden’s killer, in Bronstein’s profile, described tensions inside his unit as suspicions arose that some members would seek publicity after the raid.

I had young children and no idea how to care for them. Shortly after I decided to separate from my husband, I met a man who I fell deeply in love with and decided to be with him at all costs. He graduated from North Carolina State University and was working as a contracted Geologist at Andrews Air Force Base in Washington, D.C. Against the wishes of my family and friends, I moved to Maryland to live with him.

We had lived there for a short while when he applied for a civilian job for the Defense Department as a Geologist in Aberdeen, Maryland. He had to apply for a secret security clearance for this job. He was cleared for the security clearance and got the job. We then moved to Harford County, Maryland into his childhood home. We married shortly after that. Once I had planted my feet in Maryland, I became the wife he had always wanted -- picket fence and all. He refused to let me work and wanted me to pamper him the way he felt he deserved to be pampered, and I obliged. When my girls came to Maryland, he raised them as if he were their father. He was very involved in their schooling and extra-curricular activities. I was so thankful to be married to a man who cared so much for them. He became involved in county politics, community projects, etc. We took wonderful vacations to Hawaii several times, Alaska, cross country trips. At times, I would miss North Carolina and my childhood friends but that was behind me now. Although I did not realize it at the time, we were living his life. The life he wanted.

On April 15, 2010, 11 years into my marriage, I had just gotten home from taking my daughter to school (she had a month to go before graduating) when the phone rang at 7:30am. It was my husband telling me that he was being detained. I had no idea what he meant by this until I finally realized that he had been arrested. I thought for sure it had to be a road rage incident or some kind of mistake. He told me that he loved me and that he didn't blame me if I divorced him. He hung up before he told me what had happened. Within minutes of that phone call, my entire property was swarmed by police -- exactly like you would see on television. I ran outside to see what was going on, but the police would not tell me anything. They told me that I was to stay with an officer and wait for the detectives to get there. When the detectives arrived, I was told that my husband had been arrested for taking pictures outside of the window of a teenage girl's bathroom. I could not hear anything they told me. I could not breathe. I could not believe that this was true. For nine hours, my house was no longer mine. It belonged to the police. They took what they wanted out of it and did to it what they pleased. The aftermath was mine to deal with.

My husband was bailed out of jail by his family and re-arrested on May 3, 2010 by the feds. This is when I learned that he had thousands of pictures and videos on his government issued computer, mostly of my daughter but also of her friends and other young girls in our community. The story became big news in Maryland and D.C. News crews were showing up at my house, our mailbox was continually bashed in, I was ostracized by my own town as if they thought I had something to do with it. To add insult to injury, I came to find out that this man that I loved so dearly had been arrested in the early '90s in the state of Ohio for doing the same exact thing! All the security clearances for his jobs with the United States government did me nor all the girls he sexually violated any good.

In August 2010, he was charged with two counts of child pornography in the Maryland Federal Courts and was sentenced to serve 12 years at Fort Dix Federal Prison in New Jersey. He believes that that government is using him as an example and that what he did has been blown way out of proportion. I believe the only regret he has is that he got caught. I also believe that when he does get out, he will do this again.

On April 15, 2010, my life came to a crashing halt. One phone call and the life that I knew and thought I loved was over and done. There are no words to describe the agonizing pain that I went through. Getting out of bed was impossible. I ceased to function at all. My heart was broken and all I wanted was to make the pain stop. I had a neighbor who was like a surrogate mother to me force me out of the bed and to my doctor. My doctor sent me to a therapist. Slowly, ever so slowly, I was moving again. I began re-connecting with my long lost friends from childhood on Facebook and eventually moved back to Charlotte, North Carolina where I was born and raised and where I belonged.

There are a few things I have learned from this nightmare and they are this: When your family and friends strongly discourage you from doing something, listen. Whomever you may become involved with, background check them thoroughly. This may seem impersonal but it will save you from ever having to go through a needless hell like I did. And last but not least, cherish your friends. They will be everything you will ever need when you are going through your worst storms. Therapist are wonderful. We all need them from time to time but nothing, absolutely nothing, will heal you quicker than the love of precious friends."

Security concerns have prompted a federal prosecutor in Houston to withdraw from a big racketeering case involving the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas, which has been a focus of the investigations into the slayings of the Kaufman County district attorney and an assistant.

Assistant U.S. attorney Jay Hileman on Tuesday notified attorneys representing 34 defendants, The Dallas Morning News and TPM reported. A Justice Department prosecutor in Washington, D.C., who is already involved in the case will take over.

Neither the Morning News nor TPM specified the security issues or say whether Hileman or his family had been threatened.

""He's obviously made a decision based on something,"" said defense attorney Richard O. Ely II, who added that he had been threatened when he was a prosecutor.

One of the group's former top leaders, Terry Sillers, has pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate in the case, which is being prosecuted in Houston. Authorities have him in protective custody.

The neo-Nazi gang has come under renewed scrutiny since Kaufman County District Attorney Mike McLelland and his wife, Cynthia, were found dead in their home Saturday. Investigators said he had been shot 20 times. In January, country prosecutor Mark Hasse was gunned down in a parking lot not far from the courthouse.

KTVT-TV reported Tuesday that investigators found evidence near the McLellands' home indicating they may been watched before the killings.

The Anti-Defamation League has ranked the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas, a white supremacist prison gang, as the nation's most violent extremist group. The Texas Department of Public Safety lists the brotherhood as a ""significant"" threat.

Here's some of what the ADL said in in a report last year:

Since 2000, ABT members and associates have committed at least 29 murders in the United States, all in Texas or neighboring states. The true number is likely considerably higher, as most murders that occur behind prison walls do not get reported by the media. The 29 known killings are all ""street"" killings, more evidence of the growing presence of racist prison gangs on the streets of America.

Also Tuesday, KSAT-TV reported that one of the racketeering defendants, James Francis Sampsell, is a ""general"" for the group. Federal agents said they recorded him in late January selling a quarter pound of methamphetamine in a Walmart parking lot in Conroe, Texas, and arrested him after a chase."

The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

WASHINGTON -- The federal agency that enforces labor law said Monday it has decided to pursue charges against Walmart for threatening and punishing workers who planned to go on strike last year.

According to officials at the National Labor Relations Board, the agency's general counsel investigated and ""found merit"" in workers' claims that Walmart ""unlawfully threatened"" employees for taking part in walkouts surrounding last year's Black Friday shopping season. The agency said that Walmart intimidated, surveilled or punished workers in 14 different states, violating U.S. labor law.

The agency also said that Walmart illegally threatened workers in statements made in two news broadcasts. That charge appears to refer in part to an interview that Walmart spokesperson David Tovar gave to CBS Evening News last year, saying ""there could be consequences"" for workers who are expected to show up for work and don't.

Brooke Buchanan, a Walmart spokeswoman, said the company disagreed with the general counsel's position.

""This is just a procedural step and we will pursue our options to defend the company because we believe our actions were legal and justified,"" she said. “The fact is, we provide good jobs and unparalleled opportunities for our associates. This is our busiest time of the year and we're focused on serving our customers and helping them have a great holiday season.""

The labor board said it found no merit in some of the other charges that workers filed, with the backing of the United Food and Commercial Workers, a longtime Walmart foe. The NLRB dismissed one claim that Walmart violated employees' rights by pushing protesters off of store property, and another that Walmart illegally changed employees' work schedules in retaliation for striking.

The general counsel's charge amounts to an allegation by a prosecutor -- not a ruling by the board. Such cases are often resolved before the board actually moves to prosecute a company, usually through a settlement to which the parties agree. If Walmart and the workers' representatives can't come to terms, then the labor board will file its complaints.

In a call with reporters before the NLRB's announcement Monday, Joseph Hansen, president of UFCW, said the charges were evidence that ""workers who've joined together to improve conditions have been targeted.""

""Walmart is on their heels,"" Hansen said. ""Does Walmart treat its workers fairly? It is a debate that we welcome, and one that we plan on winning.""

An estimated 400 Walmart workers took part in Black Friday strikes last year, arguing that the company provides unlivable wages, scant benefits and erratic scheduling. The UFCW and its non-union Walmart affiliate, OUR Walmart, say they're planning more strikes this holiday shopping season, although they wouldn't estimate on Monday how many workers might take part.

This wouldn't be the first time that the NLRB pursued charges against a company for statements it made in the media. In one highly politicized charge made in 2011, the board's general counsel accused Boeing executives of illegally threatening workers in the press for having gone on strike in the past. That case was eventually settled.

Pat Quinn signed a bill into law Sunday allowing illegal immigrants to get special driver's licenses, but it will be at least another 10 months before they'll start being issued.

The Illinois secretary of state's office estimates it'll need that much time to finalize rules and train employees about who qualifies and what paperwork can be accepted.

The lag time did little to dampen the mood of hundreds who braved icy weather to watch the ceremonial bill signing on Chicago's Southwest Side. The fanfare at Instituto del Progreso Latino included performances by a mariachi band and a roster of speakers 15 dignitaries deep. Supporters said the measure will make it easier for undocumented immigrants to get insurance.

""This bill is not just about driver's licenses, it's about equality for all,"" said sponsoring Rep. Edward Acevedo, D-Chicago.

Called temporary visitor driver's licenses, the permits will vary from traditional licenses several ways. Most noticeably, they will be visually different, with a blue background as opposed to red one.

The cards will be marked ""not valid for identification"" and cannot be used for things like boarding airplanes, voting or purchasing a gun. The licenses will only be valid for three years instead of four years, like traditional licenses. After three years, the individual would have to go through the process again.

To qualify for a license, an applicant must prove they have lived in Illinois for a least a year and show that they are ineligible for a Social Security card. Documents that will be accepted include a copy of a lease, utility bills and a valid passport or consular identification card.

Drivers must also pass vision, written and road tests and pay a $30 fee. In order for the license to remain valid, a driver also will be required to get insurance. If a person with a temporary visitor's license is caught driving without insurance, they will be ticketed for both driving without insurance as well as driving without a license.

People who want to apply for the licenses must first make an appointment at one of eight designated facilities across the state. Licenses will not be issued on the spot but only after the state can verify application information and perform a facial recognition search against other databases.

Critics have said they fear fraud and abuse, with some lawmakers saying illegal immigrants should be fingerprinted in order to qualify. Immigrant rights organizations said that would deter participation among a population that is often distrustful of law enforcement and other government agencies.

Despite some opposition, Quinn and others praised the way in which Democrats and Republicans alike helped get the measure passed, saying people came before politics. ""It was everybody in, and nobody left out,"" Quinn said, using one of his favorite lines.

Supporters say the next goal is winning comprehensive immigration reform at the national level.

""So goes Illinois, so goes the country,"" Mayor Rahm Emanuel said at Sunday's event. ""Let's take this day and build a better future by passing immigration reform.""

But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

In exchange, investigators say, those officials helped divert ships to certain ports where Glenn Defense submitted inflated bills. Three Navy officials have been charged with crimes, and four others, including two admirals, have been suspended over their ties to Mr. Francis.

“It’s like finding a couple of cockroaches in the kitchen when you turn on the light,” said Charles Tiefer, a former member of the federal Commission on Wartime Contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan and a professor at the University of Baltimore School of Law. “This suggests that this area of contracting is infested with problems, including a lack of competition, overbilling and resistance to government investigations.”

Investigators accuse Inchcape of a different scheme: that it paid commissions to subcontractors willing to give large discounts, then pocketed the difference instead of refunding it to the Navy.

A federal subpoena issued in March 2011 demanded that Inchcape turn over its records involving Navy ships and any discounts or rebates from subcontractors since 2002, court records show.

A Justice Department lawyer later sent the company an email saying investigators were especially concerned about its deals in supplying six aircraft carriers and four other ships from 2005 through 2009, and about its charges for fuel in Peru and for removing waste from ships in Bahrain, Dubai and South Africa. The email, which was included in court records, asked the company for a spreadsheet listing what the suppliers charged Inchcape, what it charged the Navy, and the company’s profit margin for those and other port visits."

She was a seamstress whose simple and defiant act more than half a century ago galvanized a movement and propelled her into history.

On Wednesday, President Obama and congressional leaders unveiled a nine-foot bronze statue of Rosa Louise Parks, making her the first black woman honored with a full-length statue in the U.S. Capitol’s Statuary Hall.

Parks, born 100 years ago this month in Tuskegee, Ala., was a civil rights icon whose activism led to the desegregation of public facilities across the South and the passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965, portions of which were being argued before the Supreme Court on Wednesday as the statue was being dedicated.

It was a congressional homecoming of sorts for Parks, who worked as an aide to Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.) for nearly two decades in his congressional office in Detroit. And when she died in 2005, she became the first woman and second black person to be honored with a casket viewing in the Capitol Rotunda. Slain U.S. Capitol Police officer Jacob Joseph Chestnut was the first African American so honored, in 1998.

The statue renders her as legions of schoolchildren will probably think of her — sitting primly with ankles crossed, hands in her lap, clutching a purse and staring straight ahead.

Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post Wait 1 second to continue.

Obama joined with House and Senate leaders as well as relatives of Parks in unveiling the statue, which comes as the Postal Service released a stamp this month honoring the longtime civil rights leader.

Obama drew a direct connection between his presidency and Parks’s activism.

“Rosa Parks tell us there’s always something we can do. She tells us that we all have responsibilities, to ourselves and to one another,” he said.

Recalling Parks’s years of activism, he said, “She reminds us that this is how change happens — not mainly through the exploits of the famous and the powerful, but through the countless acts of often anonymous courage and kindness and fellow feeling and responsibility that continually, stubbornly, expand our conception of justice — our conception of what is possible.”

The Rosa Parks legend dates back to 1955, when Parks, then 42, refused to give up her seat to a white man on a bus in Montgomery, Ala., and was arrested.

Parks would later recall in an interview the words she exchanged with the police officer.

“I said, ‘Why do you push us around?’ He said, ‘I do not know, but the law is the law and you are under arrest.’ ”

Her cause and her case catapulted the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. to prominence and led to a year-long boycott, stirring thousands of African Americans to organize and to protest against segregation.

The Supreme Court ruled in 1956 that Alabama’s segregated bus system was unconstitutional about a year after Parks refused to give up her seat.

Lionized as the “mother of the civil rights movement,” Parks became an iconic figure, praised for her “quiet dignity that was itself an argument against unfair treatment under the law.

“With this statue, we affirm that the courage and the cause of Rosa Parks not only earned her a place in the hearts of all Americans, but a permanent place among the other figures in this hall of national memory,” said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). “Rosa Parks may not have led us to victory against the British. She didn’t give a single speech in the Senate or the House, or blast off into space, or point the way in the Western wilderness. Yet, with quiet courage and unshakable resolve, she did something no less important on a cold Alabama evening in 1955.”

The statue, sculpted by Eugene Daub and co-designed by Rob Firmin, was the first full-size statue to be commissioned and paid for by Congress since 1873.

House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) called the dedication “a red-letter day for the American people.”

“Here in the Old Hall, she casts an unlikely silhouette: unassuming in a lineup of proud stares, challenging us once more to look up and draw strength from stillness,” Boehner said, noting the long march of history that led to this moment. “So we place her here, in a chamber where many fought to prevent a day like this . . . and right in the gaze of Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederacy. It brings to mind Lady Liberty herself, rising amid the titans of finance and presiding over New York Harbor, the promise of America clear for all to see.”

President Bill Clinton awarded Parks a Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1996 and the Congressional Gold Medal in 1999, recalling that, as a 9-year-old, he was moved to begin sitting in the back of the segregated Arkansas public buses in solidarity with Parks and other African Americans.

“We do well by placing a statue of her here,” Obama said. “But we can do no greater honor to her memory than to carry forward the power of her principle and a courage born of conviction.”

He Died On June']",Charles Krauthammer: The Democrats’ outbreak of lawlessness,"For all the gnashing of teeth over the lack of comity and civility in Washington, the real problem is not etiquette but the breakdown of political norms, legislative and constitutional.

Such as the one just spectacularly blown up in the Senate. To get three judges onto a coveted circuit court, frustrated Democrats abolished the filibuster for executive appointments and (non-Supreme Court) judicial nominations.

The problem is not the change itself. It’s fine that a president staffing his administration should need 51 votes rather than 60. Doing so for judicial appointments, which are for life, is a bit dicier. Nonetheless, for about 200 years the filibuster was nearly unknown in blocking judicial nominees. So we are really just returning to an earlier norm.

The violence to political norms here consisted in how that change was executed. By brute force — a near party-line vote of 52 to 48 . This was a disgraceful violation of more than two centuries of precedent. If a bare majority can change the fundamental rules that govern an institution, then there are no rules. Senate rules today are whatever the majority decides they are that morning.

What distinguishes an institution from a flash mob is that its rules endure. They can be changed, of course. But only by significant supermajorities. That’s why constitutional changes require two-thirds of both houses plus three-quarters of the states. If we could make constitutional changes by majority vote, there would be no Constitution.

In fact, that wasn’t the case. Thousands who had bought insurance have been receiving cancellations notices from insurers.

As of today, the Senate effectively has no rules. Congratulations, Harry Reid. Finally, something you will be remembered for.

Barack Obama may be remembered for something similar. His violation of the proper limits of executive power has become breathtaking. It’s not just making recess appointments when the Senate is in session. It’s not just unilaterally imposing a law Congress had refused to pass — the Dream Act — by brazenly suspending large sections of the immigration laws.

We’ve now reached a point where a flailing president, desperate to deflect the opprobrium heaped upon him for the false promise that you could keep your health plan if you wanted to, calls a hasty news conference urging both insurers and the states to reinstate millions of such plans.

Except that he is asking them to break the law. His own law. Under Obamacare, no insurer may issue a policy after 2013 that does not meet the law’s minimum coverage requirements. These plans were canceled because they do not.

The law remains unchanged. The regulations governing that law remain unchanged. Nothing is changed except for a president proposing to unilaterally change his own law from the White House press room.

That’s banana republic stuff, except that there the dictator proclaims from the presidential balcony.

Remember how for months Democrats denounced Republicans for daring to vote to defund or postpone Obamacare? Saboteurs! Terrorists! How dare you alter “the law of the land.”

This was nonsense from the beginning. Every law is subject to revision and abolition if the people think it turned out to be a bad idea. Even constitutional amendments can be repealed — and have been (see Prohibition).

After indignant denunciation of Republicans for trying to amend “the law of the land” constitutionally (i.e. in Congress assembled), Democrats turn utterly silent when the president lawlessly tries to do so by executive fiat.

Nor is this the first time. The president wakes up one day and decides to unilaterally suspend the employer mandate, a naked invasion of Congress’s exclusive legislative prerogative, enshrined in Article I. Not a word from the Democrats. Nor now regarding the blatant usurpation of trying to restore canceled policies that violate explicit Obamacare coverage requirements.

And worse. When Congress tried to make Obama’s “fix” legal — i.e., through legislation — he opposed it. He even said he would veto it. Imagine: vetoing the very bill that would legally enact his own illegal fix.

At rallies, Obama routinely says he has important things to do and he’s not going to wait for Congress. Well, amending a statute after it’s been duly enacted is something a president may not do without Congress. It’s a gross violation of his Article II duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.

A Senate with no rules. A president without boundaries. One day, when a few bottled-up judicial nominees and a malfunctioning health-care Web site are barely a memory, we will still be dealing with the toxic residue of this outbreak of authoritative lawlessness.

Trying to save face.

McConnell and [Senate Majority Leader Harry] Reid first met on Monday afternoon in an unscheduled meeting about two hours after McCain sat with the majority leader. ""Mitch, I know you came to see me, but let me just start off by telling you: I have the votes,"" Reid told McConnell, according to an aide Reid briefed immediately after. ""Say whatever you want, but I have the votes."" ""Here's my offer,"" McConnell responded. ""You'll get all your nominees, but you have to agree that there'll be no more rules changes.""

McCain was there, according to several sources who spoke about private, behind-the-scenes talks on the condition of anonymity, because he and and several other Republicans grew fed up with their own side's stalling tactics and went around McConnell (R-Ky.) to cut the deal with Reid and Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), avoiding a ""nuclear option"" rules change to pass the nominees.

""[McConnell] has essentially now been cut out of the process on nominees,"" the Democratic aide said. ""John McCain is now the minority leader on nominations.""

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is a bully. So what happens when he loses all leverage McConnell held no cards. Reid had the votes. And THIS was the offer? That he would allow votes on nominees he'd held up for years, but he'd get to do it all over again starting tomorrow with new nominations? After years of Reid caving on the issue, perhaps McConnell thought history would repeat itself. But he clearly miscalculated badly—so much so that his own caucus began deserting him.The situation is so bad, actually, that McConnell's ability to obstruct has been permanently compromised.Interesting observation—McCain now appears to control a number of Republicans willing to buck leadership on the filibustering of administration nominees. Whether that influence extends to judicial nominees or legislation remains to be seen (though with the GOP House, legislation is less relevant). But for now, it appears that Reid will be negotiating with McCain on confirmation votes.

And the best part of this? Reid still has the votes for a limited repeal of the filibuster, leverage that will only increase in October when New Jersey gets its Democratic senator back.

Mitch McConnell's down, so let's throw him an anvil. Sign our petition to bring back the talking filibuster."

USA TODAY

President Obama said Friday that all Americans should respect a jury's acquittal of George Zimmerman in the killing of Trayvon Martin, but white Americans should also understand that African Americans are pained by Trayvon's death and continue to face racial discrimination.

""Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago,"" the nation's first African-American president said during a surprise appearance in the White House briefing room.

Obama, who last year said the 17-year-old Florida shooting victim could just as easily have been his son, talked about how he has been subjected to casual prejudice. He also said African Americans need to address the problems of violence in their own communities.

African-American males know they are more likely to be both ""victims and perpetrators of violence,"" Obama said, and ""somebody like Trayvon Martin was probably statistically more likely to be shot by a peer than he was by somebody else.""

The problem is that so many people paint with a ""broad brush"" and see all black young men as potential criminals, Obama said.

A Florida jury acquitted Zimmerman on Saturday night of murder in the 2012 death of 17-year-old Trayvon. This was Obama's first on-camera comments on the case since the verdict was handed down Saturday night. He had had issued a written statement calling for calm on Sunday.

Obama has generally avoiding discussing racial issues -- today was probably his most extensive comments on the issue as president, reminiscent of his speech on race relations during the 2008 campaign.

In an extraordinary 19-minute appearance, Obama spoke personally and at times emotionally about the frustrations African-Americans have with the justice system, and the continuing racial divides that shadow the nation.

""I think it's important to recognize that the African American community is looking at this issue through a set of experiences and a history that doesn't go away,"" Obama said, and ""it's going to be important for all of us to do some soul-searching.""

Obama told reporters that, like other African Americans, he has been followed by security guards while shopping, and has seen motorists lock their doors or women hold tighter to their purses as he walked near them. While didn't want to ""exaggerate,"" Obama said ""those sets of experiences inform how the African-American community interprets what happened one night in Florida.""

He cited racial disparities in the criminal justice system, and how blacks tend to be charged more often with drug offenses and sentenced to longer prison terms than whites. He also said it's fair to wonder what would have happened in Florida if the shooter had been a young African-American.

Obama said he respects the different views of the verdict, but the trial was conducted professionally, and ""once the jury has spoken, that's how our system works."" While demonstrations and peaceful protests are understandable, he said violence ""dishonors what happened to Trayvon Martin and his family.""

Said Obama: ""Now, the question for me at least, and I think for a lot of folks, is where do we take this?""

While the Justice Department investigates whether to charge Zimmerman with civil rights violations in the case, Obama said state and local levels should examine whether changes to laws can head off violent confrontations. He cited laws to ban racial profiling, and proposed new kind of training for law enforcement in order ""to reduce the kind of mistrust in the system that sometimes currently exists.""

The president also questioned the wisdom of Florida's ""stand your ground"" law, which, in the view of critics, all but encourages confrontation that could turn deadly.

Obama also suggested people consider whether Trayvon also had the right to stand his ground, adding: ""Do we actually think that he would have been justified in shooting Mr. Zimmerman who had followed him in a car because he felt threatened?""

The nation should also think about ways to ""bolster and reinforce our African American boys,"" Obama said, saying there are too many kids out there who need help, but ""are getting a lot of negative reinforcement.""

Obama said all Americans should do ""soul-searching"" in the wake of the verdict and the reactions to it, but questioned whether a full-blown ""national conversation"" would do much good if too many politicians or pundits were involved.

""On the other hand, in families and churches and workplaces, there's the possibility that people are a little bit more honest, and at least you ask yourself your own questions about, am I wringing as much bias out of myself as I can?"" Obama said.

Borrowing a quote from Abraham Lincoln, Obama said political leaders should do whatever they can to encourage ''the better angels of our nature."" rather than ""using these episodes to heighten divisions.""

Obama also said that Americans should realize that, over the course of decades, American race relations have improved, citing his daughters and their friends as examples. While that doesn't means ""we're in a post-racial society,"" Obama said there is progress.

""I don't want us to lose sight that things are getting better,"" Obama said.

Obama also paid tribute to Trayvon's parents, saying that ""I can only imagine what they're going through and it's remarkable how they've handled it.""

In a statement, Trayvon's parents Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton said Friday, ""we are deeply honored and moved that President Obama took the time to speak publicly and at length about our son, Trayvon. The President's comments give us great strength at this time."""

In more than two-thirds of the nation’s counties – including some of the most unhealthy – men and women became more physically active over the last decade, according to data published Wednesday.

Women made notable progress nationwide, with the percentage who got sufficient weekly exercise jumping from 46.7% to 51.3%. The percentage of physically active men ticked up a point to 57.8%.

But these improvements have done little to reduce obesity, researchers at the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation concluded.

Between 2001 and 2009, obesity rates for men or women fell in just nine counties. National rates climbed throughout the decade, although some recent evidence suggests obesity rates may no longer be rising.

“There has been a lot of progress on physical activity,” said Dr. Christopher Murray, lead author of the research, which was published in the journal Population Health Metrics. “To tackle obesity, we need to do this. But we probably also need to do more. … Just counting on physical activity is not going to be the solution.”

Today, more than one-third of U.S. adults and approximately 17% of children are obese, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Many health experts believe that changing diet may do more to bring those numbers down than increasing exercise.

A separate paper by the institute published Wednesday in the Journal of the American Medical Assn. identified poor diet as the No. 1 factor contributing to America’s poor health compared to other industrialized nations.

Life expectancies in the United States stagnated for women in 1,405 counties and for men in 154 counties between 1985 and 2010, researchers reported. And Americans living in the worst-performing counties in the nation, in Appalachia, now live shorter lives than people in Vietnam, Yemen and Sudan.

Despite the grim news, Murray and others believe that, eventually, the uptick in exercise will likely deliver significant health benefits and may help reverse the decades-long increase in weight.

“We know that exercise has amazing virtues,” said Dr. Georges C. Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Assn. “It helps prevent cardiovascular disease, build muscle tone and reduce bone loss. It improves mental health, and it reduces stress. … All of those are vitally important.”

Some of the biggest gains in physical activity over the last decade occurred in America’s unhealthiest counties in the Deep South and Appalachia.

The percentage of women in Morgan County, Ky., exercising enough each week jumped 18.3 percentage points between 2001 and 2009 to 44%, the biggest improvement researchers found.

The biggest gain for men occurred in Concho County, a small, rural county in west-central Texas, where the percentage of men who got enough physical activity increased 16.7 percentage points to 58.2%.

Overall, six of the 10 counties that improved most for men and seven of the 10 that improved most for women are in Kentucky. Counties around Atlanta, Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego, Houston and Denver also saw major improvements, according to the report.

Researchers defined sufficient physical activity as 150 minutes of moderate activity a week or 75 minutes of vigorous activity.

Researchers did not say what may explain the successes. But Robert Jeffery, an epidemiologist and weight-loss researcher at the University of Minnesota, said public health campaigns may be yielding fruit. “Publicity has been ramping up everywhere, but particularly in the Southeast,” he said.

Even with the improvements, huge disparities exist nationwide in both exercise patterns and obesity.

In the least healthy counties – which are concentrated in Appalachia and the Deep South – less than a third of women and less than four in 10 men get sufficient physical exercise, according to the report.

In Issaquena County, Miss., a tiny county in the Mississippi Delta, just 28.4% of women are sufficiently active, the worst rate in the nation; 59.3% of women in the county are obese, also the worst nationally.

The nation’s most overweight county for men is Owsley County in Kentucky’s coal country, where 46.9% of the male residents are obese. Owsley County also has the least physically active men, with just 33.1% reporting they get sufficient exercise.

By contrast, obesity rates for men and women are below 20% in the least overweight counties: for men, San Francisco; and for women, Falls Church, Va., in the Washington suburbs.

In the most active counties – which are concentrated in the Northeast, Upper Midwest and West – about three quarters of residents get enough exercise. Tops for men is Teton County, Wyo., and for women is Routt County, Colo.

James Buchanan was the 15th President of the United States, serving a single term from 1857 to 1861. He has the distinction of being the only lifelong bachelor to hold this office. According to some historians, he was also gay. His niece and ward Harriet Lane (an orphan) filled the position of “first lady” during his presidency. As a “first lady,” historians generally rank her as 2nd (Dolly Madison is ranked as 1st).

The presidential election of 1856 was a three-way race between Buchanan (Democrat), former President Millard Fillmore (Know Nothing), and John C. Frémont (the first Republican candidate for president).

Buchanan’s term as president was marred by the issue of slavery. While Buchanan was a Northerner (he was from Pennsylvania), he claimed that the slaves were:



“treated with kindness and humanity…Both the philanthropy and the self-interest of the master have combined to produce this human result.”

“to arrest, if possible, the agitation of the Slavery question in the North and to destroy sectional parties.”

“Before [the abolitionists] commenced this agitation, a very large and growing party existed in several of the slave states in favor of the gradual abolition of slavery; and now not a voice is heard there in support of such a measure. The abolitionists have postponed the emancipation of the slaves in three or four states for at least half a century.”

“I acknowledge no master but the law.”

He told one Southern Senator that the goal of his administration was:Buchanan felt that the abolitionists were preventing the solution to the slavery problem. He stated:While he attempted to maintain peace between the slave-owning south and the abolitionist north, he felt that secession was illegal, but that going to war to stop it was also illegal. As an attorney, Buchanan’s basic code was:Buchanan also felt that there were too many educated people in the country and vetoed a bill which would have created more colleges.

In response to the Panic of 1857 (a recession), Buchanan advocated reform rather than relief. He felt that government did not have the power to provide relief.

On leaving the White House, Buchanan told his successor, Abraham Lincoln:



“If you are as happy, my dear sir, on entering this house as I am on leaving it and returning home, you are the happiest man in the country.”

Buchanan died on June 1, 1868 at the age of 77. He left an estate valued at $310,000. He is buried in Woodward Hill Cemetery in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.

Franklin Pierce:

In 1852, the Democrats held their presidential nominating convention in Boston. There was a deadlock among the three presidential candidates—James Buchanan, Lewis Cass, and Stephen A. Douglas—and Franklin Pierce, who was not at the convention, was selected as a compromise choice. Pierce accepted the nomination because he was certain that he would lose. His son prayed that he would lose and his wife wanted him to decline the nomination.

Pierce and his running mate William R. King defeated the Whig Party ticket of Winfield Scott and William A. Graham by 50% to 44% in the popular vote. In 1853, Pierce was sworn in as the 14th President of the United States and the only president who refused to take the oath with the words “I do solemnly swear”.

While Pierce was from New Hampshire, he was a supporter of slavery. During the Civil War, he supported the Confederacy. As President, he renewed the debate over the expansion of slavery in the American west by supporting the Kansas-Nebraska Act.

His personal life during his term as president can best be described as a bit of a mess. First of all, he was an alcoholic. Secondly, his son was killed shortly before he took office and his wife entered a deep depression which lasted for his entire term.

Franklin Pierce died on January 22, 1868 at the age of 64. It is generally felt that he drank himself to death. He left an estate valued at $70,000 which was divided among friends and relatives. He was buried in the Old North Cemetery in Concord, New Hampshire.

Warren G. Harding:

Warren G. Harding was the 29th President of the United States, serving from 1921 to 1923.

Harding was considered the compromise candidate in the 1920 election. He promised a return to a strong economy, independent of foreign influence. He defeated Democrat James M. Cox in a landslide: 60% to 34% of the popular vote.

His administration was marred with corruption, including the infamous Teapot Dome scandal and a notoriously corrupt justice department. These scandals resulted in his low ranking as president.

Historians have described Harding as a “semi-educated political hack” with a “large taste for women, liquor, and poker.” During his term, bootleggers provided the White House with liquor. He has been described as the least qualified person to be elected president.

Harding had a passionate affair with Nan Britton which resulted in a daughter. While in office, he feared that this relationship would become public.

Harding died in office on August 2, 1923 at the age of 57. There were some rumors that he was actually murdered by his wife. These rumors were enhanced by his wife’s refusal to allow his body to undergo an autopsy. His estate of nearly a million dollars went to his wife. After his death, Mrs. Harding burned all of President Harding’s correspondence and documents.

William Henry Harrison:

William Henry Harrison was President of the United States from March 4, 1841 to April 4, 1841. He was the first president to die in office. He not only served the shortest term as president, but he also delivered the longest inaugural address—it took him nearly two hours to read it. Harrison was also the first sitting president to have his photograph taken.

Harrison died broke and facing bankruptcy. Congress voted to give his wife a pension and the right to mail letters free of charge.

Final note: Harrison’s grandson, Benjamin Harrison, became the 23rd President of the United States (1889-1893) and is ranked 34th."

Their arrests were announced as federal authorities unsealed documents in Manhattan federal court accusing the men of participating in a conspiracy that began in 2005 and continued through much of last year. NASA computers were among those infected by what was labeled the Gozi virus.

The NASA breach occurred from Dec. 14, 2007, to Aug. 9, 2012, when about 190 agency computers were infected with the virus, according to court documents. Between May and August last year, they said, the infected computers sent data without the user's authorization, including login credentials for an eBay account and a NASA email account, details of visited websites and the contents of Google chat messages.

Other destructive viruses and malicious software, including Zeus Trojan, SpyEye and BlackEnergy, were distributed through the network, according to a criminal complaint filed against Mihai Ionut Paunescu, also known as ""Virus.""

Paunescu is a Romanian national residing in Bucharest. According to court papers, Romanian organized crime investigators have been conducting their own probe of him that included court-authorized surveillance of his cellphone communications over the last year.

The document said Paunescu set up online infrastructure that allowed others to distribute the damaging programs, causing tens of millions of dollars in losses and affecting well over a million computers worldwide.

The Gozi virus was designed in 2005 and distributed beginning in 2007, when it was secretly installed onto each victim's computer in a manner that left it virtually undetectable by antivirus software, the complaint said.

FBI agent M. Kathryn Scott wrote in the complaint charging Paunescu with conspiracy to commit computer intrusion that some information about the virus came through the cooperation of a Gozi virus distributor who pleaded guilty to various fraud and computer intrusion charges and was cooperating with U.S. law enforcement officials in the hopes of receiving leniency at sentencing.

Paunescu was arrested in Romania. Deniss Calovskis was arrested in Latvia, where he is a citizen and resident, on charges including bank fraud conspiracy. Nikita Kuzmin, a Russian national, was arrested in New York on various charges, including bank fraud and bank fraud conspiracy.

It was not immediately clear who would represent the defendants in court.

A charging document against Kuzmin accused him of designing the Gozi virus beginning in 2005 as a way to steal the personal bank account information of individuals and businesses in a widespread way.

It said he hired a programmer to write it and began in 2006 to rent the virus to others for a weekly fee, advertising it on Internet forums devoted to cybercrime and other criminal activities. In 2009, according to the document, Kuzmin was approached by others who wanted to acquire the source code so they could attack computers and steal money from bank accounts in the United States and in particular European countries. The document said Kuzmin offered the code to other groups of people for $50,000 plus a guaranteed share of future profits.

According to court documents, Calovskis had training and expertise in computer programming when he was hired by a co-conspirator to upgrade the virus with new code that would deceive victims into divulging additional personal information, such as mother's maiden names. Federal authorities sought at least $50 million from Calovskis, an amount of money they said was obtained through the conspiracy."

Pepper Schwartz thought we're at the point that if a man can't control his lust, it's illegal

Schwartz: Women are insulted, not hired if unattractive, fired if they are too pretty

Saving your marriage by firing an employee for her looks is a gender issue, she says

Just when you think we're becoming civilized and smarter about our knowledge of gender, you get a stupid decision such as the one from the Iowa Supreme Court and you wonder whether sanity will ever reign.

I thought we had decided the issue that men's ""uncontrollable lust"" was indeed controllable, and if they didn't control it, they were going to be charged and convicted of sexual harassment, rape, frottage -- well you get the idea.

So now the all-male Iowa Supreme Court has said , albeit in a new way, that men are so controlled by their gonads that they can fire an employee at will for being able to incite attraction, sex, love, whatever. No matter that she is just going about her job or being a stellar employee; if she's got a cute butt or a nicely turned nose, her job is history.

If you haven't heard, the court stood by an earlier ruling that a Fort Dodge dentist acted legally when he fired his dental assistant -- even while acknowledging she had been an excellent employee for 10 years -- because he and his wife were afraid he would try to start an affair with her and ruin their marriage. The employee had sued for sex discrimination. But the court said firing an employee for being too attractive, despite no inappropriate behavior on her part, is not sex discrimination because gender is not the issue. Feelings are.

Pepper Schwartz

Don't tell me this has nothing to do with gender.

I don't see women firing men because they can't control themselves. Is this because they don't have manly kind of urges? Or is it because they don't have access to the same excuses, such as uncontrollable attraction and desire? Either way, it's a gender issue. And if a woman is denied employment because of her gender, that is a protected legal status.

But the Iowa Supreme Court guys didn't see it that way. By the way, Iowa women: Is this enough to motivate you to get some women on your Supreme Court? The guys saw the issue, at least in part, as protecting the institution of marriage rather than an infringement on a woman's right to work.

Let's be real honest here: If the only way this man and woman could protect their marriage is to remove an attractive woman from their midst, then I'd say this marriage has a lot more problems than just an attractive dental assistant.

What is this dentist's wife going to do -- put blinders on her husband like a race horse? Do employees have to pass an ugliness test? Do they pick the couples in their extended friendship network according to whether the wife is curvaceous?

Women have been at risk because of their looks for a long time. There are online sites where women are evaluated like so many heifers on whether they are "" Hot or Not?"" Words such as ""dog"" ""sow"" ""and needing a ""paper bag over her head"" have been thrown at us as a part of male bravado.

Beautiful women get cat-calls, sometimes really rude and threatening gestures and unwanted commentary on their looks. Talk about women being between a rock and a hard place. Insulted and not hired if they aren't attractive, fired if they are too attractive.

Could someone tell us just exactly how we should look?

More important, could we have some continuing education for the courts around the nation so that they realize looks are a gender issue -- and therefore protecting women from being fired because of them is appropriate.

If another case like this goes through the judicial system, I hope a very different conclusion will be reached. Otherwise, all kinds of firings may arise that use this excuse to get rid of women employees.

Why, this could even spread to the courts -- male judges might ban some women lawyers from presenting cases because, gosh darn it, they are just too lovely."

Some of her projects are so large she has to hire staff.

Still, Chavarria has to hop on buses to meet clients throughout Phoenix because Arizona won’t give her a driver’s license. The state considers her to be in the country illegally, even though she recently obtained a two-year reprieve from deportation under the Obama administration’s deferred action program.

She may not drive, but along with thousands of other young people who entered the country illegally, Chavarria has found a way to make a living without breaking the law.

Although federal law prohibits employers from hiring someone residing in the country illegally, there is no law prohibiting such a person from starting a business or becoming an independent contractor.

As a result, some young immigrants are forming limited liability companies or starting freelance careers — even providing jobs to U.S. citizens — as the prospect of an immigration law revamp plods along in Congress.

Ever since 1986, when employer sanctions took effect as part of the immigration overhaul signed by President Reagan, creating a company or becoming an independent contractor has been a way for people who are in the country illegally to work on a contract basis and get around immigration enforcement.

But organizers who help immigrants said the idea has taken on new life in recent years, often among tech-savvy young people who came into the country illegally or overstayed visas.

Chavarria, who was 7 when she crossed into Arizona from Mexico with her mother, said her parents told her from a young age that anything was possible in her newly adopted country.

“We’re taught as young kids that this is the land of opportunity,” she said. “They told me, ‘You could be anything you want to be if you work hard, you’re a good person, obey your parents and go to school.’”

But when she graduated from high school in Phoenix, Chavarria discovered that her lack of legal status was a roadblock to becoming a graphic designer. Although she won a scholarship, she said, she could afford to take only two classes at a time at Scottsdale Community College because she wasn’t willing to risk working with fraudulent documents to pay for school.

Advertisement

Congress delivered another blow to Chavarria in 2010 when it failed to pass the Dream Act, which would provide a path to legalization for young adults who were brought into the country illegally as children.

The next year, after she became more involved with the Dream Act Coalition, she discovered a way she could sell her designs to others without fear of repercussions.

How is this possible? Though the issue is complex, the answer boils down to how labor law defines employees, said Muzaffar Chishti, an expert on the intersection of labor and immigration law at the Migration Policy Institute.

For example, employees often have set hours and use equipment provided by the employer. Independent contractors make their own hours, get paid per project by submitting invoices and use their own tools. Also, someone who hires an independent contractor isn’t obligated by immigration law to verify that person’s legal status.

At a workshop hosted by immigrant rights activists, Chavarria learned about these intricacies of labor law — and how to register as a limited liability company. “I didn’t know it was possible,” Chavarria said. “And it wasn’t that hard.”

It was as easy as downloading the forms from the Internet, opening up a bank account and turning in paperwork to the state along with a $50 fee. Proof of citizenship is not required. Regulations vary, but similar procedures exist in other states. In California, the fee is a bit higher and there’s an annual minimum tax of $800, but the process is similar to Arizona’s.

It’s unclear how many entrepreneurs there are like Chavarria. Immigration experts say anecdotal evidence suggests interest in such businesses has grown in recent years as more states have adopted tougher illegal-immigration laws. But research is scant.

Indications of a trend could be found, however, in a Public Policy Institute of California report on the effects of Arizona’s 2007 mandatory E-Verify law, which forced businesses to use a federal system intended to weed out people working in the country illegally.

The study found that 25,000 workers living in Arizona illegally became self-employed in 2009. That was an 8% jump over the number a year earlier. They probably formed limited liability companies, created their own businesses or even left employers to become independent contractors.

Freddy S. Pech, 25, a Mexican national who lives in East Los Angeles, said he decided to remain an independent graphic designer rather than form a limited liability company.

Advertisement

“I never found the need to create an LLC. I still pay my taxes and all that,” said Pech, who came to the country legally as a child but overstayed his visa.

Erika Andiola, a well-known Arizona immigrant rights activist who recently qualified for immigration relief under the federal deferred action program, said she knows many young people in the movement who created their own companies.

Advertisement

She started one as a political consultant and likes to say that if she ever listed all the entrepreneurs like her on a Facebook page, she could call it “the undocu-Chamber of Commerce.”

For some, starting a business can be too challenging.

Advertisement

Andiola had urged her brother, who works in construction, to form his own company. The idea didn’t go anywhere, however, because Arizona law says only U.S. citizens can qualify for the necessary permits for his line of work.

People who come to the U.S. later in life have other obstacles, said Mary Lopez, an associate professor of economics at Occidental College in Los Angeles, who specializes in labor and immigrant entrepreneurship.

Advertisement

The older generation tends to be less educated and distrustful of the U.S. banking and financial system. Not so the younger generation.

“We are talking about two different generations,” Lopez said. “The longer you stay in the United States and assimilate, the more financially aware you are.”

Advertisement

Lillia Romo, who was brought into the U.S. illegally when she was 4, started a school to teach English as a second language in 2009 in Phoenix. She can see the generational gap between her and her mother.

“We have more resources that our parents don’t have,” she said. “We feel more comfortable in the U.S. It can be intimidating for them. For us, it is just how it is.”

Advertisement

Romo and her mother run the school together, but not for long. The 25-year-old obtained immigration relief under the deferred action program and plans to get a regular job and finish school to follow her dream of becoming a doctor for the underserved.

Chavarria also qualified for relief under the federal program this year. Although she said the program gives her peace of mind, she doesn’t want to become an employee. She likes the autonomy of having her own business.

Advertisement

Most days, a coffee shop in Phoenix serves as her office, and she charges clients $350 to $5,000 per project. The first time she contracted workers for a large campaign, an odd thought hit her: Although others couldn’t hire her, she could hire others.

She also realized that her success had a larger significance.

“They say we’re taking money and jobs and don’t pay taxes,” Chavarria said of arguments made against immigrants in the country illegally. “In reality, it’s the opposite. We pay taxes. We create jobs. I’m hiring people — U.S. citizens.”

Actually it's a diminutive of Aleksander or Aleksandra. In Russia you'll find both boys and girls being called Sasha. I have no idea why the Obama's started calling Natasha 'Sasha' but there are a lot of things about them I don't understand.

Obviously.And they would've gotten away with it too, if it wasn't for these dastardly Free Republic kids!No freakin' clue. None! For example, who knows why I call my son Aristotle ""Ari""? And no one has a clue why we call my daughter Elisandra ""Eli"". These are deep, deep mysteries.

So it's probably because they're deep undercover spies.



At least they didn’t name her Tawanna or Tasheka.

Malia . . . Malcolm X?

... because then you'd have a real reason to hate them?Sure. You go with that.

Or, you could stick with reality. Your choice.



do any of these people use their real names?

Sasha never was short for Natasha in Russian, that part is nonsense. Sasha is short for Alexandra, and Natasha is short for Nataliya. Then why, in the Obamas' minds, is Sasha the short form of Natahsa? It could not be an affinity for things Russian, since that would imply ignorance. I think 'Sasha' is simply their nickname for her.

My dog was named Sasha...She was a fluffy, snow white cockapoo. Not sure why I decided on that name...but it must have come from my somewhere in my Russian background. Both my grandparents were Russian.

I’ve been talking that up for some time as yet another symbol of obozo’s loyalty to the communist agenda (as if we needed one).

Natasha spelled backwards is Ah Satan!

When did the Obamas change their daughters names from Malaria and Sharia?

Natasha is also an Arabic Muslim name, which means gift of their moon idol.

obummer is fair game. IMHO, the girls aren’t.

It was Barky and Mantoinette's adult decision to choose a Russian name for their baby so that is certainly fair game. They made many calculated political decisions including later not using her given name. One of the reasons thin skinned Barky absolutely hates Mittens is that Mittens has 5 sons and he has none.

It is the fact they have been lying about this and everything else since this all started that is the issue.

Lets ask everyone named Bob, Bill, Jen, Dick, Mike, and Liz, for starters. Also, why is Mitch McConnell hiding his real name, in plain sight?

Cruz released his birth certificate to the Morning News in August in an effort to curb speculation that he is not a natural born citizen (and therefore ineligible to run for president in the U.S.).

Cruz, who was first elected to the Senate last fall, has stoked speculation that he will run for president in 2016 by making appearances in early primary states and courting major GOP donors at fundraisers.

IRS targeted Tea Party groups for extra scrutiny of their tax-exempt applications

The Justice Department has begun a criminal investigation

Treasury Secretary Jack Lew requested and received Steven Miller%27s resignation on Wednesday

WASHINGTON — President Obama said on Wednesday that he's accepted the resignation of acting IRS commissioner Steven Miller in the aftermath of revelations that agency officials were putting extra scrutiny on Tea Party groups' applications for tax-exempt status.

In brief comments Wednesday evening after discussing the Internal Revenue Service controversy with Treasury Secretary Jack Lew and Deputy Secretary Neal Wolin, Obama vowed to take decisive action to ensure that the situation would not be repeated.

Obama called the misconduct by IRS officials ""inexcusable.""

""It's inexcusable and Americans are right to be angry about it and I am angry about it,"" Obama said. ""I will not tolerate this kind of behavior in any agency, but particularly the IRS given the power that it has and the reach that it has in all of our lives.""

Obama said that Lew requested and accepted Miller's resignation earlier on Wednesday.

""Given the controversy surrounding this audit, it's important to institute new leadership that can help restore confidence going forward,"" Obama said.

Obama said his administration would work ""hand-in-hand"" with Congress as it performs its oversight role.

In an op-ed in USA TODAY earlier this week, Miller said the agency recognized its missteps.

""Mistakes were made, but they were in no way due to any political or partisan motivation,"" Miller wrote. ""We are — and will continue to be — dedicated to reviewing all applications for tax-exempt status in an impartial manner.""

In a three-sentence letter to Miller calling for his resignation, Lew said it was imperative to restore public trust and confidence in the IRS.

""While I very much appreciate your years of loyal service at the IRS, I find it necessary at this time to request your resignation,"" Lew wrote. ""We will work with you to make that we accomplish an orderly transition.""

In a message to IRS staff on Wednesday announcing his exit, Miller said he would depart the agency in early June.

""It is with regret that I will be departing from the IRS as my acting assignment ends in early June. This has been an incredibly difficult time for the IRS given the events of the past few days, and there is a strong and immediate need to restore public trust in the nation's tax agency,"" Miller wrote. ""I believe the Service will benefit from having a new Acting Commissioner in place during this challenging period.""

The White House has come under fire since the IRS acknowledged last week that it had improperly put holds on Tea Party groups' applications.The criticism from top GOP officials continued on Wednesday after Obama announced Miller's ouster and promised cooperation with Congress on investigating the matter.

""If the President is as concerned about this issue as he claims, he'll work openly and transparently with Congress to get to the bottom of the scandal—no stonewalling, no half-answers, no withholding of witnesses,"" said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. ""These allegations are serious — that there was an effort to bring the power of the federal government to bear on those the administration disagreed with, in the middle of a heated national election. We are determined to get answers, and to ensure that this type of intimidation never happens again at the IRS or any other agency.""

Attorney General Eric Holder told a congressional committee on Wednesday that the criminal inquiry would be a national investigation, and not limited to the Cincinnati office where the Tea Party targeting originated.

Holder said potential violations of law could include criminal civil rights laws and the Hatch Act, which prohibits partisan political activity by federal civil servants.

But the attorney general also noted that the IRS has a responsibility to scrutinize applicants for tax-exempt status to ensure they're following the law. ""I think some inquiry into that area is appropriate, but it has to be done in a way that does not depend on the political persuasion of the group,"" Holder said.

An inspector general's report on the agency's action published Tuesday blamed ineffective Internal Revenue Service management for the failure to stop employees from singling out conservative groups for extra scrutiny.

""I will do everything in my power to make sure nothing like this happens again, "" Obama said."

The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed.

On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter?

According to one witness%2C the crowd %27went wild%27 over the clown

Missouri%27s Lt. Gov. Peter Kinder denounced the performance

Missouri Rodeo Cowboys Association didn%27t return calls seeking comment

KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — A clown wearing a President Obama mask appeared at a Missouri State Fair rodeo this weekend and the announcer asked the enthusiastic spectators if they wanted to see ""Obama run down by a bull.""

The antics led the state's second highest-ranking official, Lt. Gov. Peter Kinder, to denounce the performance in a tweet Sunday. He said it was ""disrespectful"" to the president.

""We are better than this,"" the Republican tweeted.

State Fair officials said the show was ""inappropriate"" and ""does not reflect the opinions or standards"" of the fair. ""We strive to be a family friendly event and regret that Saturday's rodeo badly missed that mark,"" they said in a statement Sunday.

It wasn't clear if any action will be taken against the performers.

Perry Beam was among the spectators Saturday in Sedalia. He said ""everybody screamed"" and ""just went wild"" as the announcer talked about having the bull run down the clown with the Obama mask.

""It was at that point I began to feel a sense of fear. It was that level of enthusiasm,"" Beam, a 48-year-old musician from Higginsville, said Sunday, referring to the reaction from the crowd that filled the fair's grandstand.

He said another clown ran up to the one wearing the Obama mask, pretended to tickle him and played with the lips on the mask. After about 15 minutes into the performance, the masked clown had to leave after a bull got too close, Beam said.

Beam was at the rodeo with his wife and a student they were hosting from Taiwan. He said they were having a good time until the end of the rodeo.

""It was the usual until the very end at bull riding,"" he said. ""As they were bringing the bulls into the chute and prepping them ... they bring out what looks like a dummy. The announcer says 'Here's our Obama dummy, or our dummy of Obama.

""They mentioned the president's name, I don't know, 100 times. It was sickening,"" Beam said. ""It was feeling like some kind of Klan rally you'd see on TV.""

Officials with the Missouri Rodeo Cowboy Association, the organization that coordinated the rodeo, did not return phone calls seeking comment Sunday.

After Beam and his family returned home, he posted a photo of the clown in the Obama mask on his Facebook page. The photo and the posting were then promoted online by a blog, Showmeprogress.com, which elicited a huge response Sunday on Twitter.

Scott Holste, spokesman for Missouri's Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon, said Sunday in an e-mail that Nixon ""agrees that the performance was disrespectful and offensive, and does not reflect the values of Missourians or the State Fair.""

Beam, who grew up attending the State Fair and attends the fair just about every year, said he has never seen anything like the Obama mask display, which he felt was inappropriate for a state-sanctioned event that receives state funding.

""This isn't the Republican Missouri State Fair,"" Beam said. ""It was cruel. It was disturbing. I'm still sick to my stomach over it. ... I'm standing here with a mixed-race family. My wife's from Taiwan, and so was the student (his family was hosting). I've never seen anything so blatantly racist in my life.

By Joan Biskupic

WASHINGTON, Nov 7 (Reuters) - When the U.S. Supreme Court talks about religion, all hell breaks loose.

A dispute over an upstate New York town's prayer before council meetings produced an unusually testy oral-argument session on Wednesday that recalled the decades of difficulty Supreme Court justices have had drawing the line between church and state.

Court decisions involving freedom of religion tend to be closely decided with many separate opinions rather than clear-cut majority statements. The case of Town of Greece v. Galloway appears to be headed that way.

In the case brought by two Greece residents who objected to the overwhelmingly Christian prayers at meetings, the justices appeared likely to allow legislative prayer to continue but not ready to offer new guidance for when government might have gone too far in favoring, for example, Christianity over other faiths. The more liberal of the nine justices appeared sympathetic to the challenge while the conservatives who control the court's majority seemed ready to back the town - but not with a single obvious rationale.

At one point during the hourlong session, Justice Stephen Breyer referred to the challenge of setting constitutional rules so people of different religions live ""harmoniously together."" Not soon after, Justice Elena Kagan asserted that, ""Every time the court gets involved in things like this, it seems to make the problem worse rather than better.""

Overall, the justices' remarks were more pessimistic than positive regarding a possible consensus. They voiced frustration with the lawyers who appeared before them and with each other as well.

When Breyer asked the town's lawyer if officials could take more steps to invite non-Christians and even people who are not religious to offer the equivalent of a prayer, Justice Antonin Scalia mockingly asked what sort of invocation ""somebody who is not religious"" could offer. As lawyer Thomas Hungar, representing the town of Greece, began to suggest a chant ""of guidance and wisdom,"" Breyer interjected with some annoyance toward Scalia, ""Perhaps he's asking me that question and I can answer it later.""

ENDURING DILEMMAS

Such have been the tensions over one of America's most enduring dilemmas. The U.S. Constitution guarantees the free exercise of religion while requiring the separation of church and state. Neither dictate is absolute and the court has struggled with religious protections, often leaving lower courts with confusing standards, particularly on the mandate at issue on Wednesday - that government ""make no law respecting an establishment of religion.""

Retired Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, often a deciding vote on religion during her 1981-2006 tenure, attended the session in the ornate courtroom. She sat, expressionless, in a front-row spectator seat.

The religious makeup of the bench has changed since O'Connor's time. The court has historically been dominated by Protestants but it is now has six Catholic and three Jewish justices. The religious character of the justices, however, is unlikely to control their views. Among the Catholics, for example, are Scalia, a conservative who has voted repeatedly for prayer in public settings, and Sonia Sotomayor, a liberal who seemed more supportive of those challenging the prayer policy in Greece, a suburb of Rochester.

The high court heard the case after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit ruled that Greece officials relied on overwhelmingly Christian clergy, appearing to endorse their beliefs. The court noted that prayers at the town's legislative sessions regularly mentioned Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit. The appeals court differentiated the Greece dispute from a 1983 Supreme Court case allowing non-sectarian prayers in the Nebraska legislature. In that decision, Marsh v. Chambers, the justices relied on the historic nature of legislative prayer.

In key Supreme Court cases since 1983, the justices have focused on whether government might be endorsing a particular religion or coercing people to participate in prayer. In a 1989 case, they rejected a Pennsylvania county's courthouse crèche display and in 1992 they struck down a Rhode Island public school district's prayer at graduations.

In Greece's appeal, Hungar urged the justices to consider America's history of legislative prayer dating to its 18th century founding. The Obama administration filed a brief in support of the town.

""KEEPING GOVERNMENT NEUTRAL""

Douglas Laycock, a lawyer representing town resident Susan Galloway and other challengers to the Greece prayer sessions, countered that the town's practice ""coerces"" people who attend meetings to join Christian invocations. Laycock said he was not arguing against non-denominational, inclusive prayer.

""Give me an example of a prayer that would be acceptable to Christians, Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus,"" Justice Samuel Alito insisted. As Laycock hesitated, Alito kept repeating, ""Give me an example. ... Give me an example.""

Chief Justice John Roberts also was skeptical of Laycock's rationale. ""What exactly is coercive in this environment?"" he asked. ""Having to sit and listen to the prayer?""

To sharp questioning by Justice Anthony Kennedy, who has succeeded O'Connor as a pivotal vote among the nine, Laycock insisted the court could write a rule that would ensure legislative prayers were not exclusively Christian but that did not require excessive screening of prayers by officials.

Laycock disagreed with Kagan's remark that the court seems to be making the law worse rather than better.

""I don't think that's true,"" Laycock said. ""There are people who distort your decisions. There are people who misunderstand your decisions honestly ... But keeping government neutral as between religions has not been a controversial proposition in this court."" (Reporting by Joan Biskupic; Editing by Howard Goller, Amy Stevens and Bill Trott)"

CNN received an advanced copy of All the Best, George Bush; My Life in Letters and Other Writings, and reports that the elder Bush had a pained reaction to the nation's criticism of his son's performance as 43rd president.

The younger Bush was stung by considerable backlash for slow execution of recovery efforts in Louisiana after Katrina. The resentment came to a memorable head in September 2005, when entertainer Kanye West publicly blasted Bush during a nationally broadcast relief telethon, claiming he didn't ""care about black people.""

Five years later, in an interview with NBC's Matt Lauer, Bush said he regarded West's criticism as ""one of the most disgusting moments in my presidency.""

The elder Bush comes to his son's defense in the book, calling the critics ""nasty."" The World War II vet and 41st president then goes on to note that his son had come under fire exactly 61 years after his own Navy plane had been shot down by the Japanese.

USA TODAY

President Obama discusses his post-shutdown agenda

There have been %22no winners%22 in %22self-inflicted crisis%2C%22 the president said

Obama urges Congress to pass a long-term budget plan%2C farm bill and immigration overhaul.

WASHINGTON — President Obama said Thursday there have been ""no winners"" in the government shutdown dispute, and lawmakers will have to work hard to regain the trust of Americans.

""The American people are completely fed up with Washington,"" Obama said during remarks at the White House.

Repeatedly criticizing Congress over the just-ended shutdown and a near-default, Obama said: ""At a moment when our economic recovery demands more jobs, more momentum, we've got yet another self-inflicted crisis that set our economy back.""

The president said Congress can recover by passing three agenda items: a long-tern budget plan that cuts spending but preserves essential programs, a new farm bill, and a bill to fix a ""broken"" immigration system.

""We can get them done by the end of the year if our focus is on the American people,"" Obama said.

Obama spoke hours after signing a bill that ended that ended the 16-day government partial shutdown and extended the government's borrowing authority, averting a potential default on some of the nation's debts.

The measures are temporary, creating the possibility of renewed conflict in the months ahead.

The new bill funds the government through Jan. 15. The debt ceiling borrowing authority expires Feb. 7, though the Treasury Department could use special accounting measures to extend it for a month or so.

In his brief speech, Obama bashed Congress by saying ""these last few weeks have inflicted completely unnecessary damage on our economy"" and ""there was no economic rationale for all of this.""

The budget impasse has also hurt U.S. credibility overseas, Obama said, encouraging enemies, emboldening competitors and depressing friends across the globe.

""The good news is we'll bounce back from this,"" Obama said. ""We always do.""

Politics in Washington ""has to change,"" Obama said. ""All of us need to stop focusing on the lobbyists, and the bloggers, and the talking heads on radio and the professional activists who profit from conflict.""

He did not specifically cite his Republican opponents in Congress, but did criticize ""the one side"" that practiced ""brinkmanship"" in recent weeks.

""There's no good reason why we can't govern responsibly, despite our differences, without lurching from manufactured crisis to manufactured crisis,"" Obama said.

He added: ""Disagreement cannot mean dysfunction.""

Some congressional Republicans opposed any new spending plan unless Obama delayed parts of his new health care plan. Obama refused, and enough GOP members eventually approved a plan with no major changes to Obamacare.

The bill also calls for new budget negotiations between Congress and the White House.

In outlining his new legislative agenda, Obama called for a ""balanced"" budget plan. In the past, that has included new revenues from wealthier Americans; congressional Republicans say they will oppose higher taxes, saying the emphasis should be on spending cuts.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., pointed out that spending has been cut under the sequestration provisions of the previously signed Budget Control Act. ""The bipartisan legislation we passed to reopen the government and prevent a default will continue the BCA spending reductions,"" he said.

Obama noted that the Senate has approved an immigration bill this year on a bipartisan vote. Members of the Republican-run House want to split that plan into separate pieces. Many also object to a provision providing a pathway to citizenship for immigrants who are already in the country illegally, describing that proposal as amnesty for lawbreakers."

Federal government to stop printing nautical charts","The federal government is going into uncharted waters, deep-sixing the giant paper nautical charts that it has been printing for mariners for more than 150 years.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced Tuesday that the traditional brownish heavy paper charts won't be printed after mid-April.

Capt. Shep Smith, head of NOAA's marine chart division, said the agency will still chart the water for rocks, shipwrecks and dangers, but mariners will have to see the information using private on-demand printing, PDFs and electronic maps.

""Think of them as the roadmap of the ocean,"" said Smith, who grew up with charts of Penobscot Bay on his boyhood Maine bedroom walls. ""The navigational charts tell you what's under the water, which is critical for navigation.""

But now most people use the on-demand maps printed by private shops, which are more up-to-date and accurate, Smith said.

Still, NOAA sells about 60,000 of the old lithographic 4-by-3 foot maps each year, for about $20 apiece, the same price it costs to print them.

The trouble is that NOAA doesn't print them, but the Federal Aviation Administration does. And the FAA doesn't want to print them anymore, to save some money, Smith said. The FAA took over federal chart-making in 1999, and on Oct. 15 it told NOAA it was going to stop the presses, according to the ocean agency.

It costs NOAA about $100 million a year to survey and chart the nation's waters. It will still spend that much money, but provide the information in the less traditional way.

http://globalpublicsquare.blogs.cnn.com/2013/02/19/how-big-is-chinas-cyber-threat/,2013-02-19 00:00:00,[],How big is China's cyber threat?,"A unit of China’s People’s Liberation Army has been tied to a location believed to be the source of “an overwhelming percentage of the attacks on American corporations, organizations and government agencies,” according to a report in the New York Times on Tuesday.

“An unusually detailed 60-page study, to be released Tuesday by Mandiant, an American computer security firm, tracks for the first time individual members of the most sophisticated of the Chinese hacking groups – known to many of its victims in the United States as ‘Comment Crew’ or ‘Shanghai Group’ – to the doorstep of the military unit’s headquarters,” the report says. “The firm was not able to place the hackers inside the 12-story building, but makes a case there is no other plausible explanation for why so many attacks come out of one comparatively small area.”

Over the past year, Global Public Square contributors have looked at a range of cyber issues, from the potential threat posed by Chinese firms to what the U.S. can do to improve its cyber defenses.

“Weak cybersecurity renders America less secure on a global strategic level,” wrote Katrina Timlin, a research assistant at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, on GPS last February. “Around seventy countries are building cyber capabilities for their military or national defense infrastructure. Among the most capable countries are Russia and China, historical competitors with America.”

“Although they are unlikely to launch a spontaneous cyber attack, it is understandable they are probing our vulnerabilities and testing the limits of cyber espionage. America’s competitors have clear incentives to seek economic and military advantage through these ‘illicit’ means, and America’s inability to properly defend its cyber infrastructure is only facilitating this nefarious behavior.”

How should the U.S. respond?

According to A. Greer Meisels and Mihoko Matsubara, the United States and its allies need to coordinate their response to these threats. “As countries pursue interoperability for the sake of military efficiency, they also face an increase in shared vulnerabilities. Washington should take advantage of its pre-existing alliance network and serve as a hub to synchronize such efforts,” the authors wrote in October. “This requires developing robust, actionable intelligence capabilities that can provide real-time information to decision-makers in the United States, to private companies, and to its allies.”

But Jennifer Stisa Granick, director of civil liberties at the Stanford Law School Center for Internet and Society, suggested that in the push to find solutions in the U.S., it’s worth asking whether more legislation is the answer.

“Bringing federal agencies up to par won’t…require new laws. President Obama could implement much of the Cybersecurity Act via executive order,” Granick wrote in August. “Further, government may be able to raise standards for critical infrastructure networks through regulation rather than legislation. In most critical industries, electricity, nuclear power, chemical plants and water safety are already heavily regulated by the government. So why, for example, did NASDAQ get hacked in 2011? When we, or Congress, understand this, we can apply the tool that would improve the situation, whether it’s Securities and Exchange Commission regulation or new laws.”"

Once released, they would be welcomed back with open arms into the Al-Qaeda terrorists groups (they've been gone a long time - who would recognize them). Then at a pre-arranged signal, they would shoot all their ""co-conspirators"" in the back.

I suppose it will be OK if Obama actually decides to ship all them GITMO loafers back home to Mohammedlands - just as long as some unknown, faceless, federal civil servant with connections to certain places makes sure they are secretly inoculated with some rapidly spreading deadly virus or two that are sure to not only knock off the newly freed GITMO miscreants, but spread into the general population where belief in Allah will soon turn sour as the populace diminishes.

So many keep saying [Obama is] a fool or he's in over his head.

Nothing could be further from the truth. He's even more dangerous to America than cigs to lungs. So he may have gotten caught, but he may still survive, the MSM will be going into cover mode. Oh, I forgot to remember to say the MSM is communist controlled.The APObama will soon get over their feigned horror about their fuhrer checking them out.

Obozo proves once again that he is qualified to be the Islamist apologist-in-chief. Worse, he is so narcissistic that he thinks all jihadists will shed their Quranic commandments because he unilaterally declared that the war is over. Obozo is a joke!

He's the most dangerous person we have ever had in the WH.

We've had communists in the WH before advising prezs.(That's how we got the UN in NY) But I don't think we've had a real communist as the topdog before .

Anti war protestors are nothing but worthless commies seeking CHANGE and World REVOLUTION and BLOOD SHED.

Our Muslim Emperor (or would that be Caliph?) is making every effort to appease his Muslim constituency. I fear for our service members and members of the diplomatic corps.

And when there is a terror attack by one of the released detainees Obumphuck and his minions will blame GWB, state we must not jump to conclusions, and give the perpetrator, if he is caught, more legal rights, protections, and coverage than the average American citizen gets.

Obama needs to clear out GITMO to make room for his real enemies: conservatives who don't swallow his brand of Kool-aid,and any reporters who dare to actually do their job and report on his crimes

The entire diplomatic corp especially those in the Middle East should resign and leave those countries immediately. They have absolutely no support from the WH and the Department of State.

Sure we can give the Gitmo detainees 30 billion dollars each and set them free, no problem.We already know what becomes of those already released. Like with Clinton, this will be a problem for the next guy.

Obama needs a distraction. Americans who die in the future at the hands of released terrorists are sacrificial lambs for Obama narcissistic altar.

If that was a Hollywood script, it would be a stupid Hollywood script.But if Muslims did that to Americans, it would be worse than Hitler, right?He was totally busted saying ""act of terror"" when he should've said ""terrorist act"". But the MSM will cover for him and protect him from impeachment!Nah, he first killed off most of Al Qaeda's top leadership. Unlike the last guy to unilaterally declare ""mission accomplished"".I thought he was a Jihadist?Anti-war people want war?Here's an idea? Don't cut the diplomatic security budget. Give ol' Paul Ryan a call on that one, would you?You mean they'll get OJ Simpson's lawyers?Right! By ""closing Gitmo"", he actually meant ""keep Gitmo open"".

... which naturally led to actual goddamn stories suggesting that Obama did not go to Gettysburg because of Obamacarez.

I suppose the main question here is which of these various shameless dunderhacks was the one who first came up with this as a plausible attack line—I am loathe to pin that on the Breitbart crowd when it could have been tossed over their transom by an even more eager shit-for-brains, or perhaps there is a collection of fabled shit-for-brains pundits that gets together each evening to determine who among them has the most foam-laden idea for an attack piece and they all clap their little hands together and run with it. That would mean all the others saw it floating around and said I believe I shall run with this, which makes them even more goddamn stupid and hackish than the original stupid hacks.

Now here is the key point, dear reader, and the reason why shit for brains ought not to be considered a crass insult at this point but merely a reasonable medical diagnosis. In all of American post-Lincoln history, only one sitting president has ever gone to Gettysburg on the anniversary of the address. Reagan did not go. The Bushii did not go. JFK did not go. Roosevelt never went, nor Nixon, nor President Biff the Unholy, Destroyer of Worlds. That honor apparently goes to Taft, and it has been a long damn time since anyone in the national press furrowed their brows and pondered what William Howard Taft would do in a given situation.

So no, we do not have to take any of this seriously. Nor do we have to take the purveyors of such obviously stupid faux-scandals seriously. Nor do we have to treat them with respect, or pretend for a bare minute that they have anything worthwhile to say about our political discourse that could not be better said by contemplating the contents of a litter box. The problem here is that there is no shame to be had in peddling conspiratorial trash in public. In better days people would cross to the other side of the street so that they would not have to listen to the nice man on the large box preaching about how President Obama is probably not attending the event only one other president in history (well, two, counting Lincoln himself) attended, and how that probably means the current president resents the tardiness of Brown v. Board of Education, and when a newspaper man walks up to that fellow with a notebook in hand, nodding and scribbling things down, that does not make it suddenly respectable. It only means there are two nuts standing on a street corner instead of one.

Cross to the other side, America. For the sake of pride and patriotism, will you just shun these damn people already?

Gov. Brown wants a reversal of a lower court ruling ordering inmate releases

The lower court ruling said the prisons were overcrowded

Gov. Brown says the ruling will force the release of violent felons

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — Against growing odds, Gov. Jerry Brown formally asked the U.S. Supreme Court late Friday to intervene once again in California's yearslong battle with federal judges over control of the state's prison system.

The Democratic governor filed his formal appeal asking the justices to overturn a lower court decision requiring the state to reduce its prison population by nearly 10,000 inmates by the end of the year to improve conditions.

The appeal came the same day as the U.S. Justice Department indicated that it may intervene in an ongoing lawsuit over California's treatment of inmates with severe mental illness, and as a lower federal court dumped cold water on the administration's plan to transfer more inmates to private prisons in other states.

Brown filed the appeal just a week after the Supreme Court soundly rejected the state's request to postpone the lower court's requirement that California reduce what once was the nation's largest correctional system to hold no more than 110,000 inmates in its major prisons.

Even if the high court agrees this fall to consider the state's objections, a ruling is unlikely until next year. That would be too late to help California avoid complying with the order.

The administration argues in its appeal that the lower court made up of three federal trampled on the state's right to govern its own corrections system when it directed California to transfer or release thousands of inmates.

The Supreme Court backed the lower court's authority in a 5-4 decision in 2011.

But Brown argues that the judges failed to consider that California already has reduced the prison population by more than 46,000 inmates since 2006, primarily through a 2-year-old state law that is sentencing lower-level criminals to county jails instead of state prisons. The administration says most of the low risk inmates are already gone and that releasing those who remain would endanger the public.

The administration also argues in its 45-page appeal that the judges have not considered evidence showing that prison health care now exceeds constitutional standards after the state invested billions of dollars to improve treatment.

However, a majority of the Supreme Court justices indicated last week that they believe the state is unlikely to succeed in its latest attempt to avoid following the courts' orders. Just three of the nine justices dissented when the court rejected the state's attempt to delay action for months while the high court considers California's appeal.

Meanwhile, the lower court signaled that it may not go along with the administration's new plan, outlined by Corrections Secretary Jeffrey Beard this week, to transfer more inmates to private out-of-state prisons instead of freeing them early to lower the prison population.

Roughly 4,000 more inmates will be given additional good time credits leading to their early release later this year, unless the lower court agrees to let the state rent additional private prison cells and surplus space in local jails as an alternative. The lower court emphasized in a four-page filing on Friday that their current order does not permit the state to send more inmates out of state.

Beard said the state expects to soon seek the court's permission to rent more prison cells as one alternative to early releases.

In a related development Friday, the federal government filed a ""statement of interest"" in an ongoing lawsuit over whether California is violating the rights of severely mentally ill inmates who are kept in solitary confinement for extended periods. U.S. District Judge Lawrence Karlton of Sacramento has scheduled a hearing in November on the isolation issue.

The U.S. Justice Department noted that earlier this year it determined that extended isolation violated mentally ill inmates' rights in a Pennsylvania prison, where Beard used to head the state corrections department.

The department said it previously had found similar abuses in prisons or jails in Hawaii, Maryland, Tennessee and Wisconsin, though it emphasized that it has not determined if conditions in California similarly violate federal law or the U.S. Constitution."

Members of Congress and watchdog groups have pressed justices to allow cameras

Lawmakers also want justices to adopt code of ethics

Chief Justice Roberts says court is most transparent branch of government

WASHINGTON — A year-long string of controversial cases the general public couldn't see at all, or hear until later, has increased pressure on the Supreme Court to consider lifting the veil on its proceedings.

Since the end of the court's blockbuster term in late June, members of Congress and watchdog groups have urged the justices to allow cameras into the courtroom for the first time, broadcast live audio of their proceedings and adopt a binding code of ethics.

Many of the demands come from Democrats and liberal interest groups concerned about the court's conservative tilt. Though they are not likely to prompt Chief Justice John Roberts and his colleagues to make immediate changes, they could eventually help loosen up an institution that guards its privacy and autonomy.

""There have been baby steps taken to make the court more transparent, but it is still in many respects the least transparent branch of the three branches of government,"" says Doug Kendall, president of the Constitutional Accountability Center.

Same-day audio from court arguments has been released in a few cases, beginning with Bush v. Gore in 2000. Same-day written transcripts have been made available to the public since 2006.

Roberts, who became chief justice in 2005, has argued that the judiciary is the most transparent branch of government. ""Everything we do that has an impact is done in public,"" he said in 2011. ""Our decisions are out there.""

When the court held oral arguments during its recent term on same-sex marriage, voting rights and affirmative action, only a few hundred people were able to watch. Many were lawyers, journalists, guests of the court and those who could afford to pay others to hold their place in line.

For the historic gay marriage cases, the court broke with its normal policy and released audio transcripts later in the day. That was the first time in a year that members of the public didn't have to wait until week's end to hear the justices in action. Before 2010, except in rare cases, they had to wait until the end of the term.

When it came time to issue decisions on the term's major cases, Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., urged that live audio be distributed, to no avail. Days later, he and Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, introduced legislation calling once again for cameras in the court.

The high court's approval rating in a recent USA TODAY poll hit 43%, an eight-year low.

Ultimately, it won't be poll ratings, public pressure or congressional action that moves the nation's highest court, but the preferences of its nine justices.

""How do you second-guess a court that's supreme?"" says Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch, a conservative group that investigates and prosecutes government corruption.

CAMERAS PRESENT CHALLENGES

Over the past quarter-century, the court has moved in fits and starts toward more openness.

Two pilot programs have inserted cameras into some lower federal courts. The latest three-year pilot, set to conclude next year in 14 district courts, from Florida to Washington and from Massachusetts to Guam, got off to a slow start and has been beset by the refusal of many lawyers and clients to have their civil cases filmed.

Nevertheless, no mishaps have been reported when the parties do agree, and the introduction of court-operated cameras has gone smoothly, says Kansas District Court Judge Julie Robinson, who heads a committee of the Judicial Conference of the United States that will examine the results.

""What I'm hearing is that people almost forget the cameras are there. We don't really think about them,"" Robinson says. ""We have now become an institution that makes our records transparent. Why not make our proceedings at the trial level transparent?""

The appellate level should be even simpler, advocates argue. Already, the appellate courts in the 2nd and 9th Circuits — covering 12 states from Vermont to Hawaii, including California and New York — permit cameras. At the Supreme Court, oral arguments are a simple, hour-long give-and-take between lawyers and justices.

That hasn't stopped the justices from remaining opposed to cameras — even those, such as Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, who voiced support for the idea originally.

Cameras ""present all sorts of challenges,"" Roberts said in 2011. He mentioned the potential impact on lawyers and judges — who, he said, ""fall into grandstanding with a couple of hundred people in the courtroom.""

Justice Anthony Kennedy said in New York last month, ""My colleagues and I are not immune from the instinct to grab a headline, and I don't want to think that my colleague asked a question for the benefit of the press. I don't want to introduce that insidious dynamic between myself and my colleagues.""

In an interview with USA TODAY, liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said cameras could give Americans the misimpression that everything depends on the oral arguments, rather than the reams of legal briefs, lower court rulings and historic precedents the justices read and research.

""The notion that it's a contest between two advocates, and the better one is going to win, is totally, totally false,"" she said.

The cable network C-SPAN has fought for decades without success to get its cameras into the Supreme Court. At a Senate hearing in 2005, its founder, Brian Lamb, said, ""The judiciary has become the invisible branch of our national government as far as television news coverage is concerned, and increasingly, as far as the public is concerned.""

Bruce Collins, the network's general counsel, says the justices limit the amount of public access they will allow. ""The founding fathers put limits on all the rights, including the right of free speech,"" he says. ""The Constitution is satisfied when you have seats in the courtroom for the general public.""

But those seats are hard to come by. The court fits about 400 people, but many of the seats are reserved for members of the Supreme Court bar, friends and family, journalists and others. For the most popular cases, members of the public must wait in long lines for hours or even days. Most of those who do get in can stay only a few minutes before making room for others.

Even the court's marble plaza remains off limits to demonstrators, who must stay on the sidewalk. When a district judge ruled in June that the court's ban on protests there was unconstitutional, the court quickly issued a regulation to replace it.

'WE DO FOLLOW THE RULES'

The debates and decisions of the court aren't all that interest lawmakers and watchdog groups. They also want increased access to the justices' financial disclosure statements and a more intensive focus on ethical behavior.

Fueling those demands are some questionable actions by justices, ranging from speeches at fundraising events to refusals to recuse themselves from cases. Liberal groups cite appearances at quasi-political events by Justices Antonin Scalia and Samuel Alito as examples. Conservatives mounted an unsuccessful effort to get Kagan to recuse herself from last year's case on President Obama's health care law, citing her prior work as U.S. solicitor general; liberals sought to pressure Justice Clarence Thomas off the case because of his wife's political activities.

The justices' actions in those and other cases do not require justification. That's because the justices, unlike lower court judges, are not legally bound by a code of conduct.

""The guidelines contained in the code exist to ensure that the public has faith that judicial decision-making is based solely on the facts and the law, not politics and outside interests,"" Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y., said upon introducing legislation, along with Sens. Chris Murphy, D-Conn.; Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn.; and Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., that would require the court to adopt a code of ethics.

Roberts and several other justices have said they routinely consult the Code of Conduct for United States Judges without being legally bound by it. Because there is no higher court, any ethics code would have to be self-enforced.

Even though the justices abide by congressional directives — such as by filing annual financial disclosure forms and limiting their outside income and receipt of gifts — it is not clear that Congress even has that power over the court.

""At the end of the day, no compilation of ethical rules can guarantee integrity,"" Roberts wrote in his 2011 year-end report. ""Judges must exercise both constant vigilance and good judgment to fulfill the obligations they have all taken since the beginning of the Republic.""

Justices Kennedy and Stephen Breyer made those points to a congressional panel in 2011. Breyer said he consults seven volumes of ethics to decide such matters as when to step aside in a case. Unlike the lower courts, he noted, the Supreme Court has no way to replace a judge who recuses himself.

""We do follow the rules. They do apply,"" Breyer said. But a battle between the branches over legislation, he said, ""produces heat and not too much light.""

That's not good enough for government watchdog groups that wrote to Roberts in June, urging that the justices post their financial disclosure forms online as soon as they are finished. Reporters must request printed copies of those reports from the Administrative Office of the United States Courts.

""The justices are on notice that members of Congress, as well as certain organizations, have raised concerns,"" says Nan Aron, president of the liberal Alliance for Justice. ""This is a problem peculiar to the Supreme Court."""

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

The revelation came after Bush family photos and excerpts of email exchanges were posted online Thursday by the Smoking Gun, which attributed them to a hacker known as “Guccifer.” Guccifer claimed on the website to be a veteran hacker already being sought by “the feds” for hacking hundreds of accounts.

“This is just another chapter in the game,” he wrote.

The website reported that at least six email accounts had been hacked, including the AOL account of Dorothy Bush Koch, sister of George W. Bush, as well as former First Lady Barbara Bush’s brother and the elder Bush’s sister-in-law.

The hacked emails, sent between 2009 and 2012, apparently contained security codes and a list of family addresses, emails and cellphone numbers.

The leaked photos included intimate moments: a snapshot of George H.W. Bush that appeared to have been taken during his recent stay at a Houston hospital, a shot of George W. Bush posing with a cardboard cutout of himself wearing a beret, and paintings by the younger Bush of himself showering and in a bathtub.

According to the leaked emails, the elder Bush’s hospitalization prompted his son and other relatives to discuss funeral arrangements.

The Smoking Gun reported that, “The former president’s chief of staff wrote his children to inform them that ‘your dad’s funeral team is having an emergency meeting at 10 a.m. just to go through all the details.’ The Bush aide, Jean Becker, noted that this information ‘fell under the broadening category of things NOT TO TELL YOUR MOTHER.’”

The Smoking Gun also reported that George W. Bush wrote he was “thinking about eulogy” and “solicited stories that best illustrated their father’s sweet nature, favorite jokes, and acts of kindness. ‘Hopefully I’m jumping the gun,’ noted Bush.”

Secret Service spokesman George Oglivie told the Los Angeles Times that the agency was investigating, but would not confirm that Bush family emails had been hacked.

Jim McGrath, a Bush family spokesman in Houston, told The Times, “There’s a criminal investigation and that’s the extent of my knowledge. I know they’re looking into who might have done this”

A spokeswoman for the FBI in Houston, where the elder Bush lives, referred questions to the Secret Service, refusing to confirm whether they are investigating a cyber security breach.

The Guccifer controversy is only the latest political hacking scandal.

Last year, a group of hackers known as the D33D Company hacked and released a list of user names and passwords for more than 450,000 email accounts, including more than 25,000 AOL accounts. It was not immediately clear whether the Bush family’s AOL accounts were among these.

In 2010, a college student in Tennessee, David Kernell, was convicted on federal charges of hacking then-vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin’s private emails weeks before the 2008 presidential election.

“Hacking has become a serious problem,” said U.S. Rep. Randy Weber, a Republican from the Houston area. “Unfortunately, there are those who mean ill will to decent, honest, hardworking Americans. My heart goes out to the Bush family over this invasion of their privacy. One of the things we first learned in Congress is that there are millions of attempts each year to hack into the federal government’s computers.”

Dr. Bhavani Thuraisingham, executive director of the Cyber Security Research and Education Center at the University of Texas at Dallas, said the attack shows how pervasive hacking has become.

“It is a lot easier. It’s getting so dangerous these days,” she said, particularly noting malware that can allow hackers to access personal information remotely. “By the time you find a problem, it’s already changed and attacked your email .... Anti-virus software cannot keep up with the changes. We have to be one step ahead of the hackers, and the hackers are also getting very smart.”

“It can happen to anyone, it’s not just the Bush family. This is all cyberspace — they are as vulnerable as you and me,” Thuraisingham told The Times. “They’re just a bigger target.”

The present outrage becomes our complete obsession; the countless frustrations that telegraphed it fade from view. So it is with the shutdown of the federal government, which we could and should have seen coming. Which we did see coming, more or less.

The shutdown isn’t a new story. It’s the same story as the demise of sensible gun control legislation, even after Newtown, which was supposed to change everything. It’s the same story as the stalling of immigration reform. It’s all one cancer, sprouting tumors of various sizes. The mass we’ve been staring at over the past week just happens to be bigger and uglier than the ones we beheld in the buildup.

Our federal government doesn’t work, at least not the Congress, not the way it should if we’re going to preserve and pass on the treasure and blessings that were bequeathed to us, not the way it should if we’re going to strut around ceaselessly congratulating ourselves on how exceptional we are. We’re exceptional all right, in that we can’t summon the will, discipline or character to fix even those problems that most of us would like to see addressed. How many Americans doubt that our infrastructure is inadequate and leaves us at a serious global disadvantage? Few, but for all our hand-wringing, little gets done.

We’re exceptional in the billions of dollars that we pour into elections. All those commercials, air miles, speechifying and tweeting — and for what? We’ve spent a fortune on sclerosis, a king’s ransom on dysfunction. Then again, the money is a big part of the problem. In America your hobbyhorse can be a lonely, mangy one. Finance it generously enough and it has Secretariat’s stride."

She Left The Times In']",28 solar workers sickened by valley fever in San Luis Obispo County,"Epidemiologists are investigating an outbreak of valley fever that has sickened 28 workers at two large solar-power construction sites in San Luis Obispo County.

Staff from the California Department of Public Health, and investigators from the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health and San Luis Obispo County visited the sites near the Carrizo Plain two months ago, officials said.

They identified the sites as the Topaz Solar Farm and California Valley Solar Ranch, two large-scale photovoltaic power plants whose construction often requires considerable scraping and clearing to make way for thousands of acres of solar panels.

Valley fever, also known as Coccidioidomycosis, is contracted by breathing in fungal spores released when desert soils are disturbed. The illness is prevalent in many areas of the California desert and is common among agricultural workers and construction crews. It is not contagious.

Meanwhile, the state is attempting to stem an outbreak of valley fever that has resulted in dozens of deaths among prisoners in Central Valley prisons since 2006, according to an analysis conducted by Dr. John Galgiani, a professor of infectious diseases at the University of Arizona and a valley fever expert. Federal officials this week ordered the relocation to other prisons of more than 3,000 inmates considered vulnerable to the illness.

Galgiani said in an interview that he was unsure what was causing the cases, but he called upon state officials to contact the CDC for assistance in what he termed a “public health emergency.”

Among the workers at the solar panel sites, less than half develop flu-like symptoms that include a cough, fever, chest pains and muscle aches that can persist for weeks. In extreme cases, valley fever can cause death, usually among patients with compromised immune systems.

State officials did not provide details about who contracted the illness at the solar sites, or where they live, citing medical privacy laws. But at least one case involves an electrical worker at the California Valley project.

Mark Simonin, business manager for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 639 in San Luis Obispo, said the electrician was digging into the ground with a claw hammer and inhaled dust. Simonin said the man became ill and a subsequent blood test confirmed valley fever.

The worker required breathing therapy treatment but didn’t miss any time off the job, Simonin said.

Although respirators can prevent valley fever, workers laboring in harsh desert heat find the large commercial masks uncomfortable and are reluctant to wear them, Simonin said. He said the developer has done a good job keeping dust down on the site.

The threat of acquiring the respiratory illness extends to residents living near expansive construction sites. That risk is rising given the scope of the renewable energy boom centered in the state. Scores of solar projects are planned for millions of acres across California’s Mojave Desert and elsewhere.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced in March that valley fever cases in the Southwest have increased by 90% from 1998 to 2011. California’s increase mirrors that, with reported cases growing 71% over the decade 2001 to 2011.

Valley fever is a serious health issue and cases are required to be reported to state and federal health authorities. It is fatal in about 1% of cases.

A journal article published last year examined national death records from 1990 to 2008 and found 3,089 instances in which valley fever was the underlying or contributing cause of death. Nearly half of those deaths — 1,451 — occurred in California.

Chris Kyle, 38, a former Navy SEAL and author of “American Sniper: The Autobiography of the Most Lethal Sniper in U.S. Military History,” and a friend, Chad Littlefield, 35, were found dead with multiple gunshot wounds at a secluded gun range at the Rough Creek Lodge southwest of Fort Worth.

There were multiple semiautomatic rifles, handguns and revolvers at the range, according to an arrest affidavit obtained by WFAA-TV. The man suspected of killing Kyle and Littlefield, 25-year-old Marine veteran Eddie Ray Routh, was gone, along with the semiautomatic handgun he’d likely used in the slayings, police said.

But he didn’t get far. His sister, Laura Blevins, called the Midlothian Police Department to report that Routh had come by her and her husband’s home and confessed to killing Kyle and Littlefield, according to the affidavit.

He had a big black truck they’d never seen before, and he “told the Blevinses that he had ‘traded his soul for a new truck’ ” before he drove away, headed for Oklahoma to avoid Texas police, according to the affidavit.

Routh had been hospitalized in September for “threatening to kill himself and his family,” according to a Lancaster, Texas, police report obtained by the Dallas Morning News. In that incident, police said they’d found him shoeless and smelling of booze when he told them “he was hurting and that his family does not understand what he has been through.”

“Police spoke with Routh’s mother, Jodi, who told police that he had been drinking and that he had become upset when his father said he was going to sell his gun,” the Morning News reported.

On Jan. 19, police took Routh to another mental hospital after a North Dallas woman called police saying she feared for Routh’s safety, the Morning News reported.

Kyle took veterans to gun ranges as part of his own style of therapy -- to some, controversial. At a Sunday news conference, Erath County Sheriff Tommy Bryant said Routh’s mother, a schoolteacher, may have reached out to Kyle to get help for her son.

Investigators have said that they don’t know what Routh’s motives might have been. He reportedly became violent with jailers on Sunday evening, and he was shocked with a stun gun, strapped to a chair and put on suicide watch, officials said.

In his book, Kyle wrote that gun-range therapy was meant to be easygoing and fun, with teasing, jokes and bonding over beers and stories.

“What wounded veterans don’t need is sympathy,” Kyle wrote. “They need to be treated like the men they are: equals, heroes, and people who still have tremendous value for society. If you want to help them, start there. In a funny way, bustin’ back and forth shows more respect than asking ‘Are you OK?’ in a sickly sweet voice.”

(CNN) - MSNBC host Martin Bashir said in a statement Wednesday that he would resign from the network following comments he made about former Alaska governor and 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin.

Bashir apologized on-air last month after suggesting that Palin deserved graphic punishment for comparing U.S. foreign debt to slavery. Palin later canceled an appearance on NBC's ""Today.""



Following intense backlash for the incendiary comments, Bashir elected to temporarily take additional time off during the Thanksgiving holiday.

""Upon further reflection, and after meeting with the President of msnbc, I have tendered my resignation. It is my sincere hope that all of my colleagues, at this special network, will be allowed to focus on the issues that matter without the distraction of myself or my ill-judged comments,"" he said in the statement.

""I deeply regret what was said, will endeavor to work hard at making constructive contributions in the future and will always have a deep appreciation for our viewers – who are the smartest, most compassionate and discerning of all television audiences. I would also wish to express deepest gratitude to my immediate colleagues, and our contributors, all of whom have given so much of themselves to our broadcast.""

The president of MSNBC, Phil Griffin, also issued a statement confirming that Bashir would step down and wishing him the best.

""Martin Bashir resigned today, effective immediately. I understand his decision and I thank him for three great years with msnbc. Martin is a good man and respected colleague – we wish him only the best.""

Palin responded to Bashir's initial comments last month.

""Everybody in life takes shots,"" she said ""Fox News Sunday."" ""I don't have to accept his words – his vile, evil comments. So they don't have to affect me. I move on and I charge forth.""

Also last month, the network discontinued former host Alec Baldwin's show ""Up Late"" after he reportedly yelled anti-gay slurs at a photographer outside his home in New York. Baldwin later apologized for the angry rant in a post to MSNBC's website.

After his show was canceled, Baldwin called on the network to also force Bashir to leave, pointing to his controversial comments.

""Martin Bashir's on the air, and he made his comment on the air!"" Baldwin told Gothamist last week.

Bashir's resignation was first reported by Mediaite.

Update 7:12 p.m. ET, 12/6/2013

(CNN) - The White House clarified Thursday that President Barack Obama did live with his Kenyan uncle in Cambridge, Massachusetts for a ""brief period of time"" before attending Harvard Law School in the 1980s after previously saying there was no record of the two ever meeting.

The clarification comes amid GOP criticism over the issue of Obama’s honesty and trustworthiness, two personal traits the president has taken a hit on in recent polls.



Obama apologizes for health coverage cancellations due to Obamacare

Onyango Okech Obama, President Obama's uncle, was granted permission Tuesday by a federal immigration judge to stay in the United States, where he has lived illegally for the past five decades. In his testimony before the judge, Obama's uncle mentioned that then-student Obama had stayed with him for three weeks after he was accepted into law school.

The White House was asked about their relationship in 2011 at which time the administration said there was no record of the President and Onyango Okech Obama having ever met. Carney retracted that information Thursday saying that the President himself had never been consulted about their relationship.

""Back when this arose, folks looked at the record, including the President's book, and there was no evidence that they had met. And that was what was conveyed. Nobody spoke to the President,"" White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters.

""When Omar Obama said the other day and there were reports that he had said the other day that President Obama, back when he was a law school student, had stayed with him in Cambridge, I thought it was the right thing to do to go ask him.""

Carney continued: ""Nobody had asked him in the past, and the President said that he in fact had met Omar Obama when he moved to Cambridge for law school and that he stayed with him for a brief period of time until his, the President's, apartment was ready.""

Carney said after that period, Obama and his uncle ""saw each other once every few months while the President was in Cambridge"" but eventually ""fell out of touch.""

The White House said they had no record that the President had met his relative after his uncle was arrested for drunk driving in 2011. The driving violation brought to light Onyango Okech Obama's illegal status, and he was then ordered to regularly check in with immigration.

""The President has not seen Omar Obama in 20 years, and has not spoken with him in roughly 10 years,"" Carney said, adding that Obama had ""absolutely zero"" involvement in his relative's deportation case.

Onyango Okech Obama isn't the first of the President's relatives to have issues with immigration status. Onyango Okech Obama's sister, Zeituni Onyango, was granted permission to stay in the United States in 2010 after a six-year-plus legal battle over her status.

While the immigration court was considering Zeituni Onyango's case in 2009, then-White House spokesman Ben Labolt said Obama would stay out of his aunt's immigration case and ""the president believes that the case should run its ordinary course.""

It seems that Onyango Okech Obama's appearance and mention of his nephew's stay before law school in immigration court earlier this week was what prompted the White House to take measures to correct the record.

The administration's initial denial that the President had met his uncle and subsequent reversal of the record raises speculation that Onyango Okech Obama's court appearances and immigration status first led the White House to distance the President from the controversy and deliver misleading information.

The President is already facing questions about his credibility after technological issues and reports of canceled insurance plans plagued the recent rollout of parts of Obamacare, the sweeping healthcare reform law passed in his first term. A CNN/ORC International survey released last month indicates that 53% of Americans now believe that Obama is not honest and trustworthy, the first time that a clear majority in CNN polling has felt that way.

The reversal over details of Obama's relationship with his uncle could prove to be another detriment to Obama's credibility with the public.

Obama: People do think I'm trustworthy

And Republicans say the White House's change of story indicates a lack of trustworthiness in the President.

""It just goes back to this thing of the White House not being completely forthright with facts with the public. It's what's contributed to his trustworthiness numbers going way down,"" said Republican Strategist and CNN contributor Ana Navarro said Friday.

Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said Obama has been ""lying to the American people.""

""He's been exposed. And these little lies, like, you know, lying about whether you met someone or not that's been significant in your life - listen, those are big things because it goes to the character of the person that you're dealing with,"" he said Thursday on Fox News.

""And President Obama is proving himself not to be trustworthy on the small things and now the very big things.""

Obama attended Harvard Law School beginning in 1988 when he was 28 after serving as a community organizer in Chicago."

It’s a move Pruitt called not only unconstitutional, but damaging to the ideal of a free press in the country in his first television interviews on the scandal Sunday.

In a separate interview with the AP, Pruitt said, ""It's too early to know if we'll take legal action but I can tell you we are positively displeased and we do feel that our constitutional rights have been violated.""

He said President Obama ""should rein in that out-of-control investigation.""

""They've been secretive, they've been overbroad and abusive -- so much so that taken together, they are unconstitutional because they violate our First Amendment rights,"" he added.

Although the Justice Department has not explained why it sought phone records from the AP, Pruitt pointed to a May 7, 2012, story that disclosed details of a successful CIA operation in Yemen to stop an airliner bomb plot around the one-year anniversary of the May 2, 2011, killing of Usama bin Laden.

The AP delayed publication of that story at the request of government officials who said it would jeopardize national security.

""We respected that, we acted responsibly, we held the story,"" Pruitt said.

Pruitt said the AP published the story only after officials from two government entities said the threat had passed. He said the administration still asked that the story be held until an official announcement the next day, a request the AP rejected.

The news service viewed the story as important because White House and Homeland Security Department officials were saying publicly there was no credible evidence of a terrorist threat to the U.S. around the one-year anniversary of bin Laden's death.

""So that was misleading to the American public. We felt the American public needed to know this story,"" Pruitt said.

The AP has seen an effect on its newsgathering since the disclosure of the Justice Department's subpoena, Pruitt said on CBS' ""Face the Nation.""

“It will hurt,” he said. “We’re already seeing some impact. Officials are saying they’re reluctant to talk.”

The Justice Department sought phone records for a two-month period from more than 20 phone lines in four bureaus, including Washington and New York.

""Their rules require them to come to us first,"" Pruitt said.

But the Justice Department maintains that telling the AP would have posed a threat to their investigation.

Last week, Attorney General Eric Holder faced aggressive questioning at a hearing by the GOP-led House Judiciary Committee amid the outcry over the gathering of phone records.

Holder said he had recused himself from the AP investigation and that it was Deputy Attorney General James Cole’s decision to authorize the subpoena. Holder had said he supported the decision and said that the department had seized the phone records in an effort to find out who leaked confidential information about a foiled terror attack in Yemen.

The DOJ went a step further and said the AP’s actions put Americans at risk, something the news organization strongly refuted.

“Rather than talk to us in advance, they seized these phone records in secret, saying that notifying us would compromise their investigation,” Pruitt said in a statement on the AP’s website.

Sen. John Cornyn, who was also on “Face The Nation,” called for Holder’s resignation. “I think it’s time for him to go,” he said.

Playboy recently installed a 40-foot neon sculpture of its iconic bunny logo on the side of U.S. Highway 90 near Marfa, Texas, in an attempt to attract younger, hipper readers. It's perched atop a post and a concrete platform displaying a stylized version of 1972 Dodge Charger

The sign is part of a roadside art display designed by New York contemporary artist Richard Phillips and Playboy's creative director of special projects Neville Wakefield. They call it art. But some Marfa locals think it's just an advertisement.

One resident, Lineaus Lorette, filed a complaint with the Texas Department of Transportation.

""I thought it was a sign -- a corporate logo. And in Texas you can't put up signs without permits,"" Lorette told the Associated Press.

""I was really ambivalent. It's a beautifully made sign. The problem is that it's a sign. The rules have to apply to everybody.""

When residents complained about the giant bunny -- and what it represents -- officials were all ears and told Playboy to remove it within 45 days.

""The agency has ordered the property owner to remove this sign because the owner does not have a Texas License for Outdoor Advertising and a specific permit application for the sign was not submitted,"" Veronica Beyer, a spokeswoman for the Texas Department of Transportation, told the El Paso Times. ""Furthermore, the location at which the sign has been placed does not qualify for a permit.""

Playboy lawyers plan to fight the edict against the bunny sculpture.

""We do not believe the art installation by Richard Phillips violates any laws, rules or regulations,"" the company said in a statement released to NewsWest9.com. ""Our legal counsel is currently looking into this matter and we hope to resolve this issue satisfactorily and as quickly as possible."""

Magee House is a seven-storey apartment-style residence designed for mature students, some of whom have families. The residents remain in isolation as Public Health deals with the outbreak. Paul Mazerolle, president and vice-chancellor of the University of New Brunswick, says isolation needs to happen at Magee House to prevent the spread of COVID-19.(Ed Hunter/CBC) Meanwhile, the UNB campus reopened Monday, as did the adjacent St Thomas University campus and nearby New Brunswick Community College campus, more than a week after they moved to essential services only in response to the outbreak. Faculty, staff and students can now go on campus as long as they follow relevant operational guidelines. ""COVID is difficult,"" said Paul Mazerolle, president of the University of New Brunswick. ""The uncertainty creates concern and we're not through this."" Monday marks day nine of the Magee House lockdown, and a third round of mass testing was scheduled for residents and staff on Sunday. As of Monday afternoon, Public Health was still awaiting the results. Alex Hill-Stosky, who lives with his family in Magee House, said many people in the building are either anxious or angry because of the lockdown. ""A lot of people feel we are test subjects rather than people,"" said the engineering student. Residents of Magee House at the University of New Brunswick in Fredericton are in quarantine after at least 12 people tested positive for COVID-19. (Maria Jose Burgos/CBC) Mazerolle said he understands people are concerned and worried about their personal freedoms, but it's important to limit the spread of the virus. ""To minimize the potential spread, unfortunately people's movements need to be restricted for a limited period of time. … If we didn't restrict movement, we could be in a much worse situation."" Students have also expressed concerns over the residence's ventilation system. Mazerolle said the ventilation system has been checked twice and deemed safe by engineers with Public Health and the Department of Environment. ""From what I've been told by the experts, there's no evidence to suggest that the ventilation system is putting people at risk for COVID-19. Mazerolle expects Magee House to reopen on Saturday. ""We're looking forward to this coming to an end,"" he said. Public Health said the isolation period for Magee House individuals who have tested negative throughout the process could end Saturday. Meanwhile, the isolation for residents and staff of UNB's Elizabeth Parr-Johnston residence could be lifted as early as Wednesday, depending on the results of retests taking place Monday, said Public Health. So far, all test results have been negative. George Street Middle School reopens George Street Middle School in Fredericton reopened Monday, six days after students, staff and their families were urged by Public Health to self-isolate last week following a confirmed case of COVID-19. In a letter to parents on Sunday, Public Health said students and staff can return to school, and their families can return to work, with the exception of those who have been told by Public Health to self-isolate for 14 days. New Brunswick Public Health confirmed a case of COVID-19 at George Street Middle School in Fredericton last week.(Elizabeth Fraser/CBC) ""Custodial services have been through the school disinfecting high touch areas,"" said Dr. Jennifer Russell, New Brunswick's chief medical officer of health. ""Everyone who has not been identified as a close contact should feel confident to return to normal activities."" The George Street and UNB cases are linked, Public Health said earlier. Voting in self-isolation Elections New Brunswick is encouraging people who are under COVID-19 isolation and haven't voted in the May 10 municipal election yet but wish to do so to contact their local returning office to find out what options are available. With election day less than a week away, the options available are starting to decrease, said Kim Poffenroth, municipal election officer. Municipal election officer Kim Poffenroth asks everyone to be patient as election officials, who are all temporary workers hired for just a few days of work, do their best to deliver these elections during the 'unusual and challenging circumstances of this pandemic.'(Screenshot/ParlVu) ""Our municipal returning officers will gladly work with these individuals to determine the best way to arrange for them to vote, based on their current situation,"" she said in a statement. Options may include voting by mail, if time permits, curbside voting, and other forms of contactless voting. ""We will do our utmost to make sure every New Brunswicker is provided with the opportunity to vote, while at the same time respecting public health rules and protecting the thousands of people working for us during these elections,"" Poffenroth said. New possible exposures in Fredericton Public Health has identified new possible exposures to the coronavirus in Fredericton. People who have been in a public exposure location can be tested, even if they're not experiencing any symptoms. Residents may request a test online or by calling Tele-Care 811.

White House senior advisor Dan Pfeiffer made the rounds of the Sunday talk shows to vigorously defend Obama over the IRS case, the attacks that killed four U.S. government employees in Benghazi, Libya, and a federal prosecutor’s seizure of the phone records of 20 phone lines belonging to the Associated Press or its reporters and editors.

Republican critics argue the cases reflect a president out of touch and a White House out of control during the 2012 election season, charges that have energized the GOP and that have put Obama on the defensive barely five months into his second term.

The president and his aides have condemned the IRS misbehavior, denounced the GOP inquiries into the Benghazi attack as blatantly partisan, and defended the investigation of AP as necessary to determine who leaked classified information.

Pfeiffer insisted that Obama had no advance knowledge that federal investigators had begun investigating the IRS misdeeds until he learned about it from media reports on May 10.

It is a “cardinal rule … for all White Houses is you do not interfere in an independent investigation and you do not do anything to give off the appearance of interference in an independent investigation,” Pfeiffer said on CNN.

“The activity was outrageous and inexcusable, and it was stopped and it needs to be fixed to ensure it never happens again,” Pfeiffer said. He said anyone “who did anything wrong will be held accountable.”

Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) asserted on CNN that a written policy had directed the IRS to target conservative groups, and vowed to find out “who wrote the policy and who approved the policy.” But he acknowledged that he had no direct knowledge that a written policy existed.

Senate minority leader Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said that the IRS case reflected a “culture of intimidation” in the administration. But he acknowledged on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that no evidence yet indicates that the White House ordered the behavior or tried to cover it up.

Rep. Dave Camp (R-Mich.), who heads the House committee looking into the IRS misconduct, also said he has no evidence to suggest Obama had advance knowledge of the IRS actions.

Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) said on ABC’s “This Week” that he believed it would be necessary to appoint a special counsel, independent of administration control, to unearth the facts.

A report released last week by an internal Treasury Department inspector general said an IRS unit based in Cincinnati had used “inappropriate” and “politically sensitive” criteria to scrutinize conservative groups that had applied for tax-exempt status, delaying action on some applications for more than 18 months.

She Left The Post In January']",Top female Treasury official reported under consideration for Federal Reserve post,"Lael Brainard, undersecretary of the Treasury for international affairs, sits beside Timothy Geithner, then Treasury secretary, left, and deputy national security adviser Michael Fromer during a June meeting with President Obama in the Oval Office. (Pete Souza/The White House)

The White House is considering nominating a top female official at the Treasury Department to fill one of the vacant seats at the Federal Reserve, according to two people familiar with the process, amid criticism over the role of women in the Obama administration.

As undersecretary for international affairs, Lael Brainard is one of the most highly ranked — and most visible — female members of President Obama’s economic team. Her name has long been circulated in the insular world of Fed watchers as a potential candidate to sit on the central bank’s influential board of governors.

But her conversations with the administration have ramped up recently, and she is seriously considering accepting the nomination, according to the two people, who requested anonymity to discuss personnel issues. The White House declined to comment.

Brainard’s nomination could help solve a public-relations problem for the White House, which has been assailed over the lack of women in premier posts. Obama is weighing whether to name Lawrence H. Summers, a close former adviser, to the top job at the Fed — a move that would mean passing over Janet Yellen, the vice chair at the central bank whom many once considered a shoo-in.

That has turned what typically has been an uncontroversial appointment into a political lightning rod. The National Organization for Women has decried what it called a “sexist whispering campaign” against Yellen, and 20 Senate Democrats, including key members of the banking committee, sent a letter to the White House urging Obama to appoint her. Summers also has been dogged by accusations of gender bias after suggesting while he was president of Harvard University in 2005 that women were not as talented as men in math and science, a statement he later called an act of “spectacular imprudence.”

In addition to naming a new chair for the Fed, Obama could fill up to four seats on the central bank’s board. Two of them were held by women: Fed governor Elizabeth A. Duke resigned last month, and governor Sarah Bloom Raskin has been nominated as deputy secretary at Treasury. Governor Jerome H. (Jay) Powell’s term ends in January, but he could continue serving. If Yellen is not nominated for the top job, she is not expected to stay at the Fed. (Another top female official, Cleveland Fed President Sandra Pianalto, is retiring in January, but her successor will be selected by the bank’s board of directors.)

Brainard worked under White House economic adviser Gene Sperling when he served in that role in the Clinton administration. She then moved to the Brookings Institution to work on global development issues before returning to Treasury in 2010 as the agency’s highest-ranking woman at the time. As the head of the department’s international affairs division, she has been on the front lines dealing with the European crisis, pushing for tough requirements before debt-saddled countries are thrown financial lifelines.

Brainard’s confirmation for her Treasury post in 2010 was delayed by concerns over late payments of property taxes. She was eventually confirmed in a bipartisan vote.

Obama could nominate at least one more woman to the central bank. The two people, who are also familiar with Brainard’s consideration for the Fed, said Janice C. Eberly, a former senior economist at the Treasury and now a professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management, is also under consideration. But they were unsure how far the discussions at the White House over Eberly had progressed.

It was also unclear whether the announcements would be made at the same time Obama names his pick to lead the Fed. That decision is expected in the coming weeks, though the escalating turmoil in Syria could delay it.

Decker Left The Times In']","Poll shows Republicans losing ethnicity, age battle in California","Deep inside a new USC/Los Angeles Times poll are details that could make the California Republican Party, and by extension its cohorts elsewhere in the country, fear anew the march of time and demographics.

California right now is an extreme example of the nation, to be sure: more ethnically mixed and younger than most states, and riven for 20 years by a hobbling GOP civil war that now is surfacing dramatically elsewhere in the country. But if California is on the leading edge, as opposed to an outlier, the poll serves as confirmation that long-term problems loom for Republicans.

Take party registration: Among white California voters, almost four in 10 are Democrats and four in 10 are Republicans. But among Latinos 55% are Democrats and only 15% are Republicans. Among black voters, 76% are Democrats and 4% are Republicans. There were not enough Asian voters to accurately assess, but overall, minority voters are 54% Democratic to 14% Republican. (Just more than one-quarter of minority voters are registered independents, a group that generally votes Democratic in California.)

The collision between ethnicity and age is even more lethal. Six in 10 white voters are over 50, making them prized in the present but not dependable in future decades. The reverse is true for Latinos, 64% of whom are age 49 or younger. Overall, among all voters, 35% of those 50 and over are Republicans; of those younger, only 23% were.

Already those younger and minority voters — 38% of the voter pool — are propping up Democrats in California. Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown has a positive job approval rating of 55% overall. Among white voters the rating is 51%. Among black voters, it is 67%, Among Latinos, it is 61%.

Other poll findings suggest no end to that imbalance. Asked their political ideology, 31% of those ages 49 and younger describe themselves as liberal, to 29% who say conservative. That is close to the opposite of those over 50, only 26% of whom say they are liberal to 38% conservative.

PHOTOS: Best political moments of 2013

Personal experience, events and candidates can prompt change, of course; Arnold Schwarzenegger’s larger-than-life candidacy in the 2003 recall upended the usual ethnic and ideological breaks , as to a lesser extent did his 2006 reelection campaign.

But after he left the stage, normalcy returned. And apart from the unlikely chance of another Arnold-like candidacy, there are few dynamics that could alter the current trajectory.

At this point, Republicans in the state largely continue to weigh against immigration reform and Obamacare, two key issues that help to define candidates for minority voters. And there’s not much to remake the GOP from the inside: The growing numbers of Latino voters in their ranks have applied consistent policy pressure on Democrats, but there’s no parallel pressure on the overwhelmingly white Republican party.

USA TODAY

USA TODAY Review%3A ** out of four

Stars%3A Armie Hammer%2C Johnny Depp%2C Helena Bonham Carter%2C Tom Wilkinson%2C William Fichtner

Rated PG-13%3B runtime%3A 2 hours%2C 29 minutes%3B opens limited Tuesday night and nationwide on Wednesday

The Lone Ranger might as well be Pirates of the Caribbean run aground in the dusty wild west.

Director Gore Verbinski has choreographed a movie (** out of four; rated PG-13; opening Tuesday night in some theaters and Wednesday nationwide) too similar in style and energy to his high-seas franchise films. The likeness is intensified by Johnny Depp's turn as Tonto, who seems related to Jack Sparrow, at least in the smirking comic relief department.

That's not to say Depp isn't good in the role — he's the best thing about the movie. But it's a 2½-hour slog, with tonal inconsistencies and monotonous, drawn-out action sequences. Scenes alternate between frenetic and tedious.

Armie Hammer plays the legendary hero as the alter ego of lawman John Reid. In his spotless white hat, he cuts a dashing figure. But it's a mystery why Verbinski makes the audience wait more than 2 hours for the money shot and signature tune. When the masked fighter of injustice finally gallops triumphantly on his white stallion to the blaring strains of William Tell's overture it feels long overdue.

By this point the audience has had to endure a bloated tale of bad guys robbing, shooting and blowing up trains and good guys trying to fend them off and forestall disaster.

The movie's framing device kicks in early and often.

A boy wanders into a traveling carnival exhibition in 1933 and encounters a desert tableau with a sign that reads ""The Noble Savage."" What appears to be a statue of an aged Native American comes to life before the incredulous lad's eyes. The elderly fellow recounts a yarn of derring-do, set 60 years previously. The storyteller is none other than the all-but-forgotten octogenarian Tonto, played poignantly by Depp underneath effectively rendered makeup.

But then it cuts to the convoluted, overstuffed adventure. Prosecutor John Reid meets Tonto when they're shackled together on a train by gun-slinging villains. This yoking leads to an intricately choreographed escape and sets up an expectation for rollicking fun. But their ensuing escapades never come off as entertaining as that initial go-round.

Too much is thrown at the audience. A couple of villains do their darnedest to amp up the tension. There's the deformed outlaw Butch Cavendish (William Fichtner), then the slicker Latham Cole (Tom Wilkinson), a railroad executive with megalomaniacal intentions.

With his clean-cut good looks, Hammer is appealing as Reid/Lone Ranger. Avowedly anti-gun, he proclaims the law as his religion. Reid becomes the reluctant sole ranger after his ranger brother Dan (James Badge Dale) and a team of other law enforcers are killed by Cavendish. Reid's dreams of due process must be set aside.

The movie's titular character is second fiddle to Depp's slyly clever Tonto in this reboot. That would seem a reasonable storytelling device, but their bond never feels fully developed. It's as if their sense of loyalty is modified for a contemporary, self-centered era.

Geographic and historical details are glossed over. The distinctive rocky Utah desert landscape subs in for Texas, and the Lone Ranger actually utters the modern over-used action phrase ""Let's do this."" Was that necessary?

The Lone Ranger is a boisterous, relentless production, long on action but short on fun."

I'm saddened to report the collapse of my almost 17-year marriage to Mrs. TriSec. It was a great run while it lasted. We travelled, ran for public office, worked in a youth organization, worked for the school department, and built a small but comfortable life here in a Western suburb of Boston.

We had lots of sex, too. All great fun. But something curious happened. No babies ever came of it. We even managed to get ourselves de facto excommunicated from our religious community because we dared to seek the hand of man in our quest for a child. You know what we ended up doing, and our young son is turning twelve later this summer. [We adopted our son from the Philippines in 2002 - Ed.]

But all of that is for naught. Because my wife and I couldn't have children ""in the normal fashion"", our entire marriage is de-legitimized in some sections. So, I will be filing for divorce soon, on the grounds that we couldn't procreate and the entire thing was, and is, a sham.

The end of a marriage is a tragic thing. We survived said infertility problems, me getting laid off twice, bankruptcy, death of a parent, and even a major medical event that nearly took me. Normally, that which doesn't destroy you makes you stronger, but all of that pales in comparison to the lack of babies being produced. I suppose I need to blame somebody.

So...it's obviously my best man's fault. Here's a gentleman I have known since 8th grade. In some ways, he knows me better than my own flesh-and-blood brother. We grew up together, came of age together, and hell, even lived together for some 8 years after I finished college. (unfortunately, he never went.) Not very long before I was to be married, he rather sheepishly came out as gay, and wondered if this might change anything.

I recall telling him at the time that if it did, then everything we believed in was a lie.

Imagine my surprise in finding out some 17 years later that his being gay, and standing for me as my best man, was the sole reason for my marital demise. I figure that since God hates fags, He must have seen fit to punish us by denying us children, and condemning our marriage as illegitimate.

Now if I could only figure out how to divide all our possessions, the few remaining assets we have, and what to do with our son. I eagerly await the next instruction from the religious right. In the meantime, it seems easier for me to just stay living with my ex-wife and non-child for the duration."

But she said she did not expect to encounter discrimination from a fraternity at prestigious Duke University, where she’s a senior.

Over the weekend, a party hosted by Kappa Sigma fraternity mocked Asians and spoofed Asian dress. Tsai and other Asian American students organized a protest that included a “Race Is Not a Party” Facebook page and a campus rally Wednesday where students chanted, “Don’t party at our expense!” and “No more hate, make Duke great!”

“It was shocking and hurtful,” Tsai said of the party, which advertised the event via an email with the greeting “Herro Nice Duke Peopre!!”

Photos from the party, posted on Facebook, showed partygoers dressed in Asian gowns and conical caps. The email invitation closed with a mocking “Chank You.”

As soon as she saw the invitation, Duke junior Katherine Zhang said, she nearly broke down in tears. “I knew I had to do something about this,” she said at the rally Wednesday.

Kappa Sigma President Luke Keohane sent an apologetic email to the campus newspaper, saying, “Upon learning of the deeply damaging effects of our email to our fellow students, we should have completely canceled the aforementioned party.”

But the Asian American students said the event was the latest in a series of offensive race- or ethnic-themed parties on campus, among them a “Pilgrims and Indians” event last year and a “South of the Border” party several years ago, which students said mocked Native Americans and Latinos.

The students demanded the formation of a campus task force to, in part, “adjudicate punitive measures” for similar offensive incidents. They asked the university to hold the fraternity accountable.

Larry Moneta, vice president for student affairs at Duke, said university officials confronted fraternity members about their “thoughtless and offensive actions” and urged them to apologize to those offended.

At this point, Moneta said, the university does not plan to formally discipline the fraternity, but reserves the right to do so.

Zhang said in an interview that although most people on campus welcomed Asian Americans, there had been a persistent undercurrent of discrimination.

“Growing up, I always felt like an outsider because of the color of my skin,” she said. “I thought it might be different at Duke.”

Zhang said she received an email from Jack Riker, president of the Interfraternity Council on campus, promising to work with fraternities to prevent offensive, racist or sexist incidents.

“The Brothers of Kappa Sigma understand the unfortunate negative impact their event has had on the Duke community,” Riker wrote. “Through this experience, we welcome the opportunity to become more socially aware Greeks, Duke students and human beings.”

Chris Christie dismissed speculation that he is gearing up for a presidential bid, insisting that he is focused on governing the Garden State.

“What I’m interested in doing is being the governor of New Jersey,"" Christie said on ""Fox News Sunday.""

“The fact is we’ve got a lot of things to do, a lot of things to focus on,and I know everybody’s going to be speculating on what may come on my future and lots of other people’s future in our party,"" he continued. ""But the fact is: I’m focused on being the governor of New Jersey and being the chairman of the Republican Governors Association.. I think those two jobs will keep me pretty busy over the next year.""

However, in a separate interview with ABC's ""This Week,"" Christie said he didn't know whether he would be completing the full four years of his second term as governor.

""Listen, who knows,"" Christie said. ""I don't know. I'm going to continue to do my job and finish the job. But everybody who is trying to figure out what life is going to bring you a few years from now, I didn't expect to be sitting here four years ago.. So, nobody can make those predictions.""

He also said his Republican Party needs to ""show up"" in places that aren't traditional GOP strongholds such as Hispanic and black communities if it wants to expand its reach.

Christie was appearing on four Sunday news shows as speculation runs high about whether he will run for president in 2016.

He won re-election Tuesday by a 22-percentage point win and better-than-average showings among minorities.

Some in the GOP are looking to his strategy as one that could give Republicans their first presidential victory since the 2004 election.

Exit polls say Christie won 50 percent of Hispanic votes and 21 percent of black votes.

http://uk.news.yahoo.com/ricin-suspect-charged-threatening-obama-171604329.html,,[],Ricin Suspect Charged With Threatening Obama,"A US senator who was sent a poison-laced letter once hired the suspect to perform as an Elvis impersonator at a party, he says.

Senator Roger Wicker made the disclosure on Thursday, a day after Kevin Curtis, 45, was arrested on Wednesday on charges he threatened President Barack Obama and other US officials.

He could face 15 years in prison if convicted.

He was taken into custody by the FBI at his home in Corinth, Mississippi - just over the Tennessee border from Memphis, where police say the letters were postmarked.

An attorney for Curtis said her client was surprised by his arrest, and maintains his innocence.

Chrisi McCoy, a friend of the Curtis family, represented Kevin Curtis as he appeared in federal court on Thursday shackled and wearing a Johnny Cash T-shirt.

Ms McCoy says she has not yet decided whether to seek a hearing to determine if Curtis is mentally competent to stand trial.

According to a court affidavit, the letters he is accused of sending to President Obama and Republican Senator Roger Wicker, of Mississippi, said: ""Maybe I have your attention now even if that means someone must die.""

Corinth Police Department Captain Ralph Dance said local police had not had any contact with Curtis prior to Wednesday's arrest.

Capt Dance said Curtis had been living in ""government housing"" in Corinth, a city of 14,000 people, for the past four months.

He said his department helped the FBI arrest Curtis, and that he did not resist. Curtis was being held in a jail in Oxford, Mississippi.

Police had created a wide perimeter around Curtis' home on Thursday in case there was more ricin inside, and were expected to search the home within hours. However neighbours were not evacuated.

Curtis' neighbours said he was quiet and did not seem violent. They expressed concern for their own safety and were worried that someone in their neighbourhood had allegedly been making poison.

Neighbour Lacey Ross said: ""He was quiet. He pretty much stayed to himself.""

Story continues

The letters to Mr Obama and Mr Wicker were intercepted at mail sorting facilities before they arrived at the US Capitol building and the White House.

Both letters read: ""To see a wrong and not expose it, is to become a silent partner to its continuance.""

They were signed: ""I am KC and I approve this message.""

The substance inside both mailings has been verified as ricin, said Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Terrence Gainer, but the FBI has not yet reported on its own independent tests.

In multiple posts found on online forums, Kevin Curtis refers to a conspiracy he claimed to have uncovered 15 years ago.

He says he ""discovered a refrigerator full of dismembered body parts & organs wrapped in plastic in the morgue of the largest non-metropolitan healthcare organisation in the United States of America.""

Ricky Curtis, who identified himself as Kevin Curtis' cousin, told the AP news agency that the family was shocked by the news of the arrest.

He described Kevin Curtis as running a cleaning business, as well as being an Elvis impersonator. A YouTube channel registered under the name of Kevin Curtis contains videos of him impersonating famous musicians, including Elvis, Buddy Holly and Kid Rock.

""As far as him being anti-government, I'm not going to say that, but he had some issues with some stuff that happened with his cleaning business,"" the cousin said.

The FBI says there is no indication of a connection between the letters and the Boston Marathon bombing attacks.

Ricin is a highly toxic, naturally occurring protein found in castor oil plants. A dose the size of a few grains of table salt can kill an adult human."

Col. Stephen Preston served. This version has been corrected.

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), right, accompanied by Sens. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), center, and Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.), left, speaks during a Dec. 17 news conference urging the Senate to change the budget proposal that cuts retirement benefits for current and future military retirees. (Susan Walsh/AP)

After 25 years of service, including a combat tour in Afghanistan, Lt. Col. Stephen Preston retired from the Army and began collecting a pension of nearly $55,000 a year. The money made it possible for Preston to go back to college, get his MBA and embark on a second career in corporate strategy.

So it happened that Preston was sitting in his new office shortly before Christmas when he heard on the radio that he had become the latest target in Washington’s war on spending.

“I’m not an angry man, but I was very, very angry,” Preston, 51, said in a telephone interview from his home in Tampa. “This is a pact between the greater population of the United States and the fraction of people who served and sacrificed. If you didn’t want to pay us what you promised us, then you probably shouldn’t have promised it.”

The plan to trim pension increases for working-age military retirees such as Preston is by far the most controversial provision in a bipartisan budget deal approved by Congress and signed last week by President Obama.

The cut is small — a one-percentage-point reduction in the annual cost-of-

living increase — but it has provoked outrage among veterans, some of whom argue that the country is reneging on a solemn pact. And even though lawmakers, especially in the GOP, fulminate about the need to cut the cost of federal health and retirement benefits, many have vowed to roll the cut back when Congress returns to work next week.

The authors of the budget deal, House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Senate Budget Committee Chairman Patty Murray (D-Wash.), have agreed to amend the provision to exempt disabled retirees and survivors of those killed in action, eliminating roughly 10 percent of the $6 billion in savings projected over the next decade.

But Ryan has resisted efforts to abandon the pension cut entirely, calling it a “modest” adjustment to a particularly generous program — and therefore a more sensible choice than harder decisions that may lie ahead.

“I stand behind the need for reform,” Ryan wrote in a Dec. 22 op-ed in USA Today. Noting that a special commission is due in May to make recommendations for an overhaul of the military compensation system, Ryan wrote, “That’s why this reform does not take effect until the end of 2015 — it gives Congress ample time to consider alternatives.”

Opponents say the policy retroactively penalizes a deserving group while doing nothing to contain the much larger cost of health and retirement benefits for the general public. Independent budget analysts note, how­ever, that lawmakers have shied away from reductions in federal retirement benefits for any recipients — including changes to Social Security and Medicare included in Obama’s most recent budget request — illustrating the enormous political difficulty of trimming the federal government’s largest category of expenditures.

“It’s easy to be bold and brave in general, but it’s very hard to be bold and brave in specific,” said Richard Kogan, a former Obama budget adviser who works at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

“You can talk about ‘reforming entitlements.’ But you can’t talk about ‘cutting Social Security,’ because the public knows what that means,” Kogan said. “Now, we’ve got $6 billion taken from military pensions — an infinitesimally small provision — and it causes people heartburn because it’s specific.”

Military compensation

Military pensions have long been on the chopping block, in part because the Pentagon, like many government and private entities, is struggling to cover the cost of promises made to people who now typically spend long decades in retirement. In 2012, 2.3 million military retirees and survivors of those killed in action received about $52 billion in payments, a nearly 50 percent increase over 2002, according to Defense Department actuaries.

Overall, military compensation — including health benefits and salaries paid to active-duty personnel — eats up roughly half the defense budget, a proportion that is steadily rising. In a speech in November, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel warned that “without serious attempts to achieve significant savings” in military compensation, “we risk becoming an unbalanced force.”

Military pensions would appear to be particularly ripe for reduction. Anyone who puts in 20 years can receive payments immediately and look forward to annual cost-of-living adjustments, or COLAs, for life. That means service members who signed up at 18 could find themselves with a full pension — roughly half their ­active-duty paycheck — at 38. And the government finds itself doling out cash to former troops who have launched lucrative second careers, often with defense contractors that draw their profits from government coffers.

In 2010, as part of a sweeping proposal to rebalance the federal budget, an independent deficit reduction commission appointed by Obama suggested eliminating COLAs for military retirees younger than 62.

In the budget deal they hammered out this month, Murray and Ryan took a less drastic approach, proposing to knock one percentage point off annual ­COLAs for working-age retirees. Under the provision, which takes effect in 2015, pensions will be recalculated at age 62 so retirees thereafter receive the same amount they would have if the reduction had never happened.

The provision accounts for a fraction of the $85 billion in savings identified in the budget deal. Ryan has called it a reasonable adjustment to a program that benefits a small portion of military men and women, only 17 percent of whom serve long enough to qualify for a pension.

“If a serviceman enlisted at 18 and retired at 38, under this policy his lifetime benefit would be about $1.7 million instead of $1.8 million,” Ryan wrote in USA Today. “For a service member who retired at the average military retirement age of 44, the difference would be smaller, about $30,000 over his or her lifetime.”

“And to be clear, the money we save from this reform will go right back to the military,” he wrote. “Veterans aren’t Washington’s piggy bank.”

Opponents of the policy do not deny the need to overhaul military pensions, or military compensation in general. But they argue that changes should be made for future enlistees, not for people who have already served and planned their lives around promised benefits.

Mike Hayden, director of government relations for the Military Officers Association of America, noted that Congress directed the commission analyzing military compensation to grandfather the current force in its recommendations.

The budget deal, Hayden said, “is definitely a change of the contract that we’ve made with the currently serving.”

Broader approach sought

Just as troubling, opponents say, is the cavalier manner in which budget negotiators cherry-picked savings from the military to cover the cost of a small budget deal that solves none of the nation’s biggest problems.

“It’s horrible policy. If we’re going to reform entitlements, let’s do it in a fashion that’s comprehensive,” said Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), an advocate of broad entitlement reform who voted against the budget deal and is campaigning to overturn the military pension provision.

Graham said it would be more acceptable — and more fiscally responsible — to adopt a less generous measure of inflation for all federally compensated retirees, including Social Security recipients. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects that the alternative inflation measure, known as chained CPI, or chained consumer price index, would save more than $200 billion over the next decade — 33 times the savings forecast from changing military COLAs alone.

This agreement “is not an effort to deal with the entitlement problem,” Graham said. “This is an effort to single out one group of people and put a penalty on their benefits that you’re not putting on anybody else. And this would be the last group we’d want to penalize, I think, not the first.”

Preston, the retired soldier, agrees. He said he nearly left the military after 10 years but was talked into staying by a battalion commander who explained the wisdom of putting in 20. Then the nation went to war in Iraq and Afghanistan, and Preston said he felt an obligation to “stick it out a little longer.”

“Those of us who make it to 25, 30 years, we deserve to get what we were promised,” he said. “It isn’t even really about the money. If we need to balance our budget, fine.”

“But let’s not balance it by breaking the deal you have with me, who served, in order to provide for somebody who just showed up,” he said. “You just don’t do that.”"

When this law failed to overcome a filibuster in the Senate, the media bellyached for weeks about the filibuster and the GOP “obstructionism” that thwarts the will of the people.

This is not a new kind of media attack against the political right. Ever since Obama assumed the presidency, under the guise of reporting, the media have attacked our “do nothing” congress as dysfunctional and incapable of accomplishing anything. According to the media, a legislative body “doing nothing” is a huge problem. As the media push to see millions of Democrats legalized through immigration reform, look for this media narrative to explode at the GOP Congress.

But in reality, we all know that this is wild hypocrisy and that our media see some obstructionists who thwart the will of the people as a lot more equal than others.

Take for instance, State Senator Wendy Davis, the Texas Democrat who is now a full-fledged national Media Dahling after her 11-hour filibuster managed to block the Texas Senate from passing laws that would have outlawed abortion after 20 weeks and made abortion clinics safer.

As I write this, Davis is being hailed all across the national news as a courageous, principled, instant superstar. ABC News, CBS News, The Washington Post… all hailed her obstructionism. Left-wing cable news outlets — CNN and MSNBC — were just as gushing; as were the morning news shows.

Anyone familiar with our media knows what the Media Narrative is here — all about gender politics, “reproductive rights,” and any other buzzword that can be utilized to place Wendy Davis astride a white horse, and her political opponents grunting away in that Neanderthal cave known as Texas.

Naturally, though, most of the national media are ignoring any pertinent facts inconvenient to their agenda. Here are five of them:

1. The Texas Bill will Make Abortion Safer: After the horrors discovered at the clinic of abortion doctor Kermit Gosnell (which the media all-but ignored), many of which were only possible due to the local government’s politically motivated lack of oversight towards abortion clinics, Texas decided to act to make abortion safer. One of the primary objectives of the bill Davis filibustered is to ensure that women who seek a legal abortion are properly cared for.

This is what is in the bill Davis obstructed, and what some in media are cynically and dishonestly portraying as a move to force abortion clinics to close:

In truth, clinics would close only if they failed to meet new safety standards that have been drawn in response to the horror stories in Philadelphia and Houston. The new rules, as summarized by the Texas Alliance for Life, would have “increase[d] abortion facility safety standards to the level of ambulatory surgical centers to shut down Gosnell-like abortion providers in Texas,” “require[d] the 18,000 RU-486 abortions performed each year be done according to FDA safety standards,” and “require[d] physicians who perform abortions to be qualified to treat life-threatening complications after botched abortions and have privileges at a local hospital.”

2. The American People Back the Ban: Davis obstructed the will of the American people who, by 48% to 44%, favor what’s in the Texas bill: a ban on abortions after 20 weeks. A full 80% want abortion banned after the second trimester.

3. A Majority of American Women Back the Ban: Davis also obstructed the will of American women, who support a ban on abortion after 20 weeks at a higher percentage than men, 50% to 44%.

4. A Huge Majority of Texans Back the Ban: Davis obstructed the will of Texans; almost two-thirds (62%) of whom favor this ban on abortion after 20 weeks.

5. Late-term Abortion Ban Is More Popular with Women than ObamaCare: Yep.

—

We could add a number 6. Abortion is especially horrific after just a few weeks. Here is a fact the media never-ever report on, what the act of abortion really is:

At six weeks, the baby’s brain, spinal cord, and central nervous system are all pretty well formed — in outline at least. By the two-month mark, sensory organs begin to develop and bone replaces cartilage. …

At each of these stages, had the bill been passed, it would have remained legal in Texas to kill the child. The law that Wendy Davis and her fellow “pro-science” acolytes so bravely stood against would have rendered it illegal to kill the child after this point. And when I say kill, I mean kill. I mean break bones, rip apart limbs, crush skulls, drain fluids, still a beating heart, annihilate a brain that is capable of dreaming, and crush a nervous system. I mean: Kill.

Other than winning Barack Obama elections, nothing brings out our media’s bias, dishonesty, and hypocrisy like the issue of abortion.

Talks on Capitol Hill advanced with a new urgency after President Obama rejected House Speaker John A. Boehner’s (R) offer to raise the debt limit through late November to give the parties time to negotiate a broader budget deal.

Briefing reporters after financial markets closed for the week, White House press secretary Jay Carney praised a “new willingness” among Republicans to end the government shutdown — now in its 12th day — and to acknowledge that default on the national debt “would be catastrophically damaging.”

But with the Treasury Department due to exhaust its borrowing authority in just six days, Carney said the president would not agree to go through another round of economy-rattling talks in six weeks, just before the Christmas shopping season.

“It at least looks as if there’s a possibility of making some progress here,” Carney said. But, “we have to remove these demands for leverage essentially using the American people and the American economy.”

Where U.S. is feeling the shutdown

Read about people's experiences with the shutdown across the nation.

Before Carney spoke, Obama telephoned Boehner and the two men agreed to keep talking, aides said. Afterward, GOP senators marched into Boehner’s office and counseled him to adopt an approach they had presented to Obama earlier in the day, during their own meeting at the White House.

With Republicans getting battered in public opinion polls over the shutdown, Senate GOP leaders urged Boehner to join them in supporting a single, big-bang measure that would open the government and raise the debt limit in one fell swoop.

“I laid out some of those ideas, and the question is, can the House find a center of gravity to open the government up around those ideas,” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said after exiting the speaker’s office with Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.). The two men, former House members, have been close friends with Boehner for almost 20 years.

Details were still fluid late Friday, but the latest 23-page draft of the emerging measure would immediately end the shutdown and fund federal agencies for six months at current spending levels. It would maintain deep automatic cuts known as the sequester, but give agency officials flexibility to decide where the cuts should fall.

In addition, the proposal would also raise the debt limit through Jan. 31, 2014. Lawmakers were considering whether to include a provision that would direct the House and Senate Budget committees to immediately enter negotiations over broader budget issues and to issue a report by Jan. 15, 2014. If an agreement could be reached, it would clear a path for another increase in the debt limit later that month, without additional drama.

In exchange, Republicans were seeking what they called a few “fig leafs” — minor adjustments to Obama’s new health-care initiative. The first would delay for two years a 2.3-percent tax on medical devices that is unpopular in both parties. The second would require internal auditors to ensure that people who get tax subsidies to buy health insurance are in fact eligible.

Another option under consideration but not included in the latest draft would reduce the number of workers required to receive health coverage from an employer, by changing the definition of a full-time worker from 30 hours a week to 40 hours a week.

In an interview with a Kentucky newspaper Friday, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) signaled that he was helping to shepherd the effort to reach a compromise with Democrats.

“We’re in one of those situations right now where it’s going to require some sort of coming together here to get past the current impasse. And I’m going to continue to work on that,” McConnell told the Herald-Leader of Lexington.

By late Friday, talks over the measure were proceeding on multiple tracks. In the Senate, negotiations had advanced far enough that Senate Republicans — led by Sens. Susan Collins (Maine), Kelly Ayotte (N.H.) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) — sent draft language to their Democratic counterparts, including Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.), a trusted ally of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.).

Meanwhile, Boehner was huddled with his top lieutenants in a hideaway on the first floor of the Capitol, reviewing his options over Chinese carryout and cigarettes.

The Senate proposal differs in critical ways from the approach Boehner sold earlier this week to his rank and file, who had insisted on using the threat of the shutdown to try to undermine the Affordable Care Act.

Given those demands, Boehner had offered to lift the debt limit for six weeks to clear space for negotiations over overhauling the tax code, trimming federal entitlement spending and reforming the health care law. The government would remain shuttered unless Obama agreed to those talks.

House Republicans also proposed to roll back a portion of the sequester cuts, a top Democratic priority. But those cuts would have to be replaced with equal reductions to Medicare spending, such as Obama’s proposal to make well-off seniors pay more for coverage.

It was unclear how long the House offer would have kept the government open without further negotiations. But House Appropriations Chairman Harold Rogers (R-Ky.) quickly blasted the Senate plan to extend temporary funding for six months, calling it “disastrous.”

“It is a punt to the executive branch for the Congress not to exercise judgement about where money is spent,” Rogers said in a statement.

Boehner has scheduled a meeting of the entire GOP conference for 9 a.m. Saturday, but it was unclear whether he would present details of the proposal emerging in the Senate. Senate Republicans were hopeful that Boehner could build support for the plan and push it through the House first.

That could not only help get it to Obama’s desk faster, but also preserve Boehner’s political standing by avoiding a repeat of the New Year’s Day deal over the so-called “fiscal cliff.”

Then, a Senate-passed measure to stop scheduled tax hikes for the vast majority of Americans won the support of only 85 Republicans in the House. More than 150 GOP lawmakers opposed the bill, including some of Boehner’s top deputies, and the humiliating loss emboldened conservatives to vote against his re-election as speaker.

Senate Republicans cautioned, however, that Boehner doesn’t have much time to work things out. GOP senators are eager not only to get the government back to work but to raise the $16.7 trillion debt limit before Thursday, when the Treasury Department has said it would exhaust its ability to conserve cash. Without an increase in the debt limit, independent analysts say the Treasury would begin missing payments by Nov. 1.

GOP senators and aides said Boehner has been told that Senate Republicans will negotiate their own pact with Senate Democrats if he fails to act.

“From my point of view, it’d be better for the country if the House led,” Graham said. “It’s important that we continue to talk among ourselves as senators,” he added, but “if it came out of the House, it would be better.”

Even as negotiations progressed rapidly in the Senate, the uncertainty over procedure cast a shadow of doubt over their ultimate success.

“It’s encouraging to me that the president is now negotiating with both the House and the Senate, after saying that he wouldn’t,” Collins said. “But it is very uncertain to me what the outcome is going to be.”

""Everyone understands that we are not going to be involved, as long as our personal friends and people who we feel obligations [to] are involved,"" said Clinton, speaking from Rwanda, where he was doing work through his foundation.

""Neither Hillary or I was ever involved in the political campaign, and they understood that from the beginning,"" he said of Weiner's bid. ""There are too many people running for mayor who have been my supporters, who supported her for senator, her for president.""

""The feelings I have are all personal and since they are, I shouldn't talk about them,"" he added.

Clinton's comments, the first he's made on the New York City campaign, were extremely judicious. But they also serve to distance the Clintons from Weiner and his wife, Huma Abedin, who remains an aide to Hillary Clinton.

Many have compared Weiner and Abedin to the Clintons, who in their younger years stuck together through a scandal. But that comparison has reportedly infuriated the Clintons.

Nevertheless, the two worlds overlap, with Abedin maintaining close contact with Hillary Clinton as her husband's campaign persistently moves forward.

For his part, Weiner said recently that he has ""enormous respect"" for the Clintons and called them ""tremendous friends."""

Editor’s Note: Doug Kendall is president and founder of Constitutional Accountability Center, a progressive public interest law firm and think tank. Tom Donnelly is counsel and message director at the center.

(CNN) —

With two important cases on gay rights and marriage equality slated for oral arguments in the Supreme Court next week, Americans of all stripes are participating in a national debate over this emotionally charged issue – on the Internet, on television, in our leading newspapers and around countless dinner tables.

Despite this interest, only a handful of people will get to see these historic arguments – those who show up to the courtroom next Tuesday and Wednesday. This is the result of the Supreme Court’s longstanding policy prohibiting cameras inside the courtroom.

The court’s main reason for banning cameras – as Justices Stephen Breyer and Anthony Kennedy reminded us recently at a congressional hearing – is there would be an increased risk the justices’ questions and comments would be taken out of context and then played (and replayed) on the news or, worse yet, lampooned on “The Colbert Report.”

Doug Kendall

Tom Donnelly

This would be a completely valid concern if it weren’t for the fact that it’s happening already. As the justices well know, reporters, columnists, cartoonists and late-night comedians already extract the juiciest sound bites from oral arguments, sometimes taking them out of context and blowing them up into big stories. Indeed, such sound bites often dominate the media’s coverage of the Supreme Court.

For evidence of this, look no further than Justice Antonin Scalia’s remark from the court’s oral argument in the case of Shelby County v. Holder. Scalia suggested the Voting Rights Act of 1965 had survived only because of the self-perpetuating power of “racial entitlements” – a comment that generated countless news stories, editorials, op-eds and political cartoons, to say nothing of parodies on satirical shows such as “Saturday Night Live” and “The Daily Show.”

Or, better yet, consider Justice Clarence Thomas’ decision in January to tell a joke during oral argument – breaking his seven-year streak of silence and, in the process, becoming front-page news. Does anyone, other than the closest court-watcher, even remember the name of that case or the issues it presented?

Or, take the constant plight of Kennedy, who commentators tend to assume is the decisive vote in each of the court’s most important cases. His every question, word, sigh and hiccup becomes a key part of how cases are covered in the media, as everyone scrambles for possible clues for how Kennedy might vote. Needless to say – and as Kennedy well knows – such predictions are often inaccurate.

Sometimes, the focus on sound bites is entirely appropriate.

Scalia’s characterization of the Voting Rights Act was offensive, and it deserved to be national news. Furthermore, it’s important to report potentially revealing comments from the court’s swing justice.

But more often than not, the media coverage of the court is already focused on sound bites, which sometimes get taken out of context. Therefore, the Supreme Court might as well open up and let all Americans experience the majesty of its hearings – an experience that can be captured only by attending an argument in person or by watching an argument unfold live in one’s living room or on one’s laptop.

As lawyers who have been to dozens of Supreme Court hearings, we can confidently say that there’s nothing that the federal government does that’s more impressive than the high-quality debates that occur on a daily basis before the Supreme Court.

The American public would be astonished at the skill of the advocates, the force of the questions and the overall level at which legal issues are debated before our high court. If only they could see these arguments in real time, in their entirety.

Since media coverage of the high court already focuses on the trite at the expense of the court’s majesty, it makes sense to remove the media filter. Exposing the American public to the fullness of Supreme Court arguments by permitting cameras in the courtroom would be a service rather than hindrance to the judiciary.

A registered nurse had sued the Northeast Philly nursing home where she worked because she was being docked pay for lunchtime hours during which she was in fact working, and the Court has barred her claim on behalf of herself and her coworkers because she refused to accept a settlement offer from her employer for the full extent of her personal claim (including attorney's fees) because it only covered her, and not others similarly situated.

There's a lot of procedural mumbo-jumbo involved in today's Supreme Court decision in Genesis HealthCare Corp. v. Symczyk, so I'll try to make things as simple (and easy to pronounce: it's sim-chick) as possible so we can leap ahead to an absolutely badass dissent by Justice Kagan.

Justice Thomas' decision for the majority (the five you'd expect) relies on the fact that while Laurie Symczyk pleaded on behalf of herself and others similarly situated, no such person had formally entered parallel FLSA claims in this case, such that once Symczyk received an official offer covering the entirety of her claims it mooted any ""case or controversy"" which had existed:

In the absence of any claimant’s opting in, respondent’s suit became moot when her individual claim became moot, because she lacked any personal interest in representing others in this action. While the FLSA authorizes an aggrieved employee to bring an action on behalf of himself and “other employees similarly situated,” the mere presence of collective-action allegations in the complaint cannot save the suit from mootness once the individual claim is satisfied.

The Court today resolves an imaginary question, based on a mistake the courts below made about this case and others like it. The issue here, the majority tells us, is whether a “collective action” brought under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) “is justiciable when the lone plaintiff’s individual claim becomes moot.” Embedded within that question is a crucial premise: that the individual claim has become moot, as the lower courts held and the majority assumes without deciding. But what if that premise is bogus? What if the plaintiff’s individual claim here never became moot? And what if, in addition, no similar claim for damages will ever become moot? In that event, the majority’s decision—founded as it is on an unfounded assumption—would have no real-world meaning or application. The decision would turn out to be the most one-off of one-offs, explaining only what (the majority thinks) should happen to a proposed collective FLSA action when something that in fact never happens to an individual FLSA claim is errantly thought to have done so. That is the case here, for reasons I’ll describe. Feel free to relegate the majority’s decision to the furthest reaches of your mind: The situation it addresses should never again arise.

Yeah, yeah, whatever. Now read the Justice Kagan dissent. There's something rhetorically here which reminded one friend from law school of Judge Richard Posner, or Prof. Richard Epstein, in terms of possessing and sustaining a tone of this is easy, and you people are idiots for thinking otherwise. Shame on you. From the top, then:Let's continue, shall we?"

Designer Jason Wu just got doubly famous.

The man behind Michelle Obama's bridal-esque inaugural confection from four years ago returned to the White House inaugural stage — this time in ravishing red.

It was the first time a designer had scored a one-two punch since Nancy Reagan and James Galanos graced the balls in the 1980s. Some fashion watchers expressed surprise that the first lady didn't opt to pluck another unknown designer from obscurity and put them on the fashion map.

Baring her famous biceps, Obama chose a shimmery ruby halter gown cut from chiffon and velvet with a keyhole neckline, belted waist and plunging back. Her hair, straight for the swearing-in ceremony, was feathered slightly to the side. On her left wrist, a stack of sparkling bangles. On her finger, a diamond ring from Kimberly McDonald. On her feet, matching red satin Jimmy Choo pumps.

The dress was a modern departure from the frilly white one-shouldered gown she wore during the first inaugural. Speaking on CNN, Elle creative director Joe Zee called the ruby shade ""optimistic."" The last first lady to wear red to an inaugural ball was Laura Bush in Texan Michael Faircloth's design, for her husband's first term.

""Some may dispute the quality of our president, but nobody disputes the quality of our first lady,"" President Obama said by way of announcing his ""date.""

For the hours preceding the reveal, all of Twitter was asking, ""Where is it?"" After what seemed like an interminable drum roll of speeches and introductions at the Commander-in-Chief's Ball, the main event — the first lady — waltzed out to wild applause and into fashion history.

The reaction online was equally wild, with assessments of ""stunning"" and ""superb."" Posted Kate Betts, author of Everyday Icon: Michelle Obama and the Power of Style: ""I like it — sleek and still romantic, and powerful!"" As @deedeeindc put it: ""Waited all day. And the dress did not disappoint.""

Sure, tomato is on trend. But InStyle editor Ariel Foxman liked the ""elegant, eye-catching"" Wu repeat for loftier reasons. ""The first lady managed to quickly punctuate weeks of speculation and perhaps de-emphasize weeks of ongoing dress deliberation to come,"" he said. ""Mrs. Obama dressed the part but is able to move the conversation along, to focus on other matters that concern her, the president and the American people.""

Nevertheless, minutes after the unveiling, Wu's website crashed.

Since he exploded onto the style scene in 2009, thanks to Obama, Wu has dressed everyone from Target shoppers (his 2012 collection sold out in hours) to red carpet walkers (Diane Kruger, Reese Witherspoon, Zoe Saldana)."

EMPLOYERS SLASHING COVERAGE - UVA dumps spouses - The University of Virginia announced Wednesday it will stop offering health insurance to some employees’ spouses citing rising costs under ObamaCare. According to a press release on the university’s website, “Provisions of the federal Affordable Care Act are projected to add $7.3 million to the cost of the University health plan in 2014 alone.” This follows news that UPS would be dumping an estimated 15,000 from the company’s plan. Chief National Correspondent Jim Angle follows the story today.

OBAMA TURNS COLLEGE RECRUITER - Ed Henry wants to know: “The White House says the bus tour through universities and high schools is focused on college affordability. But since a new Gallup poll found young adults are least likely to say they're familiar with the health law, will he also use this swing to rally his campaign base ahead of the Oct. 1 sign up deadline?”

Welcome to Buffalo, Mr. President - President Obama travels to Buffalo today, part of a two-day economic bus tour that will take him thru upstate New York and Pennsylvania. At the University of Buffalo, Obama will pitch his “better bargain for the middle class” with a call for more education spending. In an e-mail to supporters, the President wrote, “We have to fundamentally rethink about how higher education is paid for in this country.”

Tuition spike - The Albany Times Union reports Gov. Andrew Cuomo, D-N.Y., scheduled to appear with the president, “…created the NYSUNY 2020 program, which raised tuition 30 percent at all SUNY campuses over five years, from $4,970 to $6,470.” According to US News and World Report, 63 percent of Buffalo University students receive some kind of need-based assistance.

Teacher union angst - The Buffalo Teacher’s Federation is fuming that their teacher’s make $20,000 less than their counterparts in other districts. Buffalo News reports, in some cases, $45,000 less. Census figures reveal the city’s 29.9 percent poverty rate.

Local schools losing ground - The president will wrap-up the day speaking at Henninger High School in Syracuse. Obama will be joined by Education Secretary Arne Duncan to tout the school’s involvement with a government program that pays the tuition for students at failing schools accepted at public colleges and participating private institutions. According to New York’s Department of Education, graduation rates in the city stand at 48%.

[Daniel Henninger, (no relation) writes: “The president gives essentially the same speech everywhere. In part it is a meditation on the meaning of middle class—‘Americans are gritty, resilient and work hard.’ In part it is populist paranoia.”]

Bad to worse - The Syracuse Post Standard reports students in the district are failing to meet the state’s new curriculum standards. “[O]nly 8.7 percent of third- through eighth-graders met the standard in English language arts. In math, only 6.9 percent of students met the standard.”

BAIER TRACKS: FED FLUSTER… Bret Baier: “If anyone needs more evidence of the supercharged role of the Federal Reserve in the economy, here's another piece. Just the mere hint of different analyses of the minutes of the central bank's July meeting released yesterday sent stocks lower. That's essentially someone in analysis circles whispering, ‘You know, it looks like the Fed may really start turning off the spigot soon.’ Well, imagine what happens when the Fed does slow or stop the flood of new US dollars into the economy. Bottom line: Fed policy is a huge economic driver. At his last news conference, President Obama said picking a new Fed chairman, ‘is definitely one of the most important economic decisions that I’ll make in the remainder of my presidency.’ Many experts characterize that as a big understatement.”

GALLUP: UNEMPLOYMENT’S 30 DAY JUMP - Gallup’s latest unemployment figures show a significant jump from July’s 7.7 percent to 8.9 percent released Wednesday. Their figures also show underemployment increased from 17.1 percent to 17.9 percent in the same 30-day period.

NSA HAD EYES ON US COMMUNICATION - Washington Examiner reports the NSA gathered over 56,000 “wholly domestic” communications before a secret court struck the program down. The revelation comes in 100 pages of documents declassified by the agency. Most are secret opinions from the FISA court; they detail major compliance problems. The NSA worked with Congress and the FISA court to correct the problem but ultimately decided it could not salvage the data collected and it was purged in 2012.

GRENELL: POWER A NO SHOW ON SYRIA - Newly confirmed UN Ambassador Samantha Power was absent from an emergency meeting of the Security Council Wednesday on a chemical weapons attack that killed hundreds. Power, who has previously called the UN’s failure to intervene in Syria “a disgrace,” was reportedly traveling at the time of the meeting. Fox News Contributor Richard Grenell, a former member of George W. Bush’s UN team, wants to know where she was: “Samantha Power has been on the job exactly 19 days. In that time, she’s already traveled from New York to Los Angeles to deliver a speech. Her absence from the UN on Wednesday sends a terrible message at a time when U.S. credibility in the region is suffering.”

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/07/18/House-Leaders-to-Educate-America-About-Immigration,2013-07-18 00:00:00,['Joel B. Pollak'],House Leaders to Educate Voters About Immigration: 'Become America',"House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-VA) will lead a tour of House leaders next week aimed at educating Americans, and each other, about the history and importance of immigration to the United States. The tour, dubbed the “Become America” tour, will feature events and speeches aimed at overcoming opposition to the passage of comprehensive immigration reform, which has stumbled amidst opposition from conservatives.

“The lawmakers will attend events on Ellis Island and at the Museum of Jewish Heritage and the African Burial Ground National Monument, according to an itinerary of the trip,” Politico reported late Wednesday evening. “Leaders will speak at a naturalization ceremony, and the group will also have a breakfast meeting at Gracie Mansion with New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a key advocate of immigration reform.”

In 2009, Cantor led a “listening tour” across the nation, bringing Republican leaders to meet with voters to discuss how the party could improve its policies and its political fortunes. The “Become America” tour, by contrast, will be less about listening to voters and more about educating them, since Republican leaders are convinced that the “nativist” faction within their party is the reason they cannot pass immigration reform.

The trip is being coordinated by the non-profit Faith & Politics Institute, and will include members of both parties, such as Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-IL), a persistent advocate of amnesty for illegal immigrants. In April, Guiterrez told a wealthy audience in Chicago that they owed it to the people who “wash the dishes” and “take care of your kids and mow your lawn” to support a path to U.S. citizenship for illegal aliens.

Officially, the “Become America” tour is meant to improve relations among the members of Congress who attend. But given the backdrop of pending immigration legislation, it is also clearly aimed at enabling those members to campaign for passage of a bill–any bill–that satisfies President Barack Obama’s demands. The president has said he will not sign immigration legislation that does not include a path to citizenship.

In June, only 6% of Americans said that immigration was the most important issue facing the country, up from 4% in April, according to Gallup polls. The economy, unemployment, dissatisfaction with government, health care, the federal debt/deficit, and family/moral decline were all listed as more important to Americans than immigration reform. No congressional tours have been planned to address those issues."

In early December, it was ""Affluenza"" -- not immediately coded for race, but yet a story with race in the background. A Texas judge sentenced a wealthy white teenager who killed four pedestrians when he lost control of his speeding pick-up truck to probation rather than jail. Although the teen confessed to intoxication manslaughter, the judge accepted the defense argument that the he suffered from ""Affluenza,"" a disease caused by having too much money and too little supervision, which led to his reckless behavior and absolved him of responsibility for his actions. The judge's decision outraged many people because it showed blatant preference for the wealthy. But imagine a different scenario -- a wealthy Black teen facing the same charges. Would ""Affluenza"" be the cause, or would the teen now be the victim of Black men's irresponsibility, which, of course, would leave him fully responsible for his actions?

Then came the second big story when Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly assured any kids who happened to be watching her commentary about a Slate.com post on the possibility of a ""Black Santa"" that ""Santa just is white."" She also assured viewers that ""Jesus was a white man too."" Her statements set off a firestorm of criticism and satirical replies (John Stewart and SNL for example). The news commentators on the Boston PBS program ""Beat the Press"" wore black Santa pins to show support for non-white Santas. In an interview with Kelly on ""The Kelly file"" on December 13, political commentator and writer Zirlina Maxwell told her that whiteness is ""not the default identity."" Santa is a fantasy; why shouldn't Christian children of any race or ethnicity imagine that fantasy in their own image? Fern Johnson told a reporter for the Worcester Telegram & Gazette that Kelly's comments were an example of ""white washing"" images that have no firm racial definition. Kelly at least admitted in a later segment that controversy remains about whether Jesus was white. But Santa? The answer is ""white.""

Then we hit the trifecta when ""Duck Dynasty"" patriarch and star Phil Robertson's anti-gay and anti-Black statements were quoted in a GQ Magazine interview. While he defended his anti-gay statements by quoting scripture, his anti-Black comments were more insidious. Claiming he understood Blacks because he and his family were ""white trash,"" Robertson insisted that Blacks were happier before the civil rights era: ""Pre-entitlement, pre-welfare, you say: Were they happy? They were godly; they were happy; no one was singing the blues."" In a few short sentences, Robertson managed to conflate race and social class and declare that he, a white man, knows how Blacks think and feel.



We don't want to add to the debate over whether any of these individuals or their comments was intentionally racist. The issue is more complex than what sounds like a racist comment. The comments each reflect the kind of racial thinking that shapes our understanding of the world in the U.S. Whether it's the belief that wealth corrupts whites while Blacks are born corrupt, or that Santa, like all iconic figures, is white, or that a white person who has some commonality with African-Americans knows what Blacks think or feel, these beliefs each normalize a vision of the world that is not necessarily shared by people of other races or cultural backgrounds. But as long as those of us who are in the dominant culture believe our thinking is natural and normal, we refuse to question it, even in the face of contrary evidence.

Yes, many commentators ridiculed the decision of the judge in the Affluenza case and Megyn Kelly's insistence that Santa is white and Phil Robertson's belief that Blacks were happier before the era of civil rights. But for all those who spoke up and questioned these beliefs, many still don't understand why they did. And many of those who did speak up might not know why the incidents reveal racial thinking. Often, we know something is wrong, but we don't know exactly why. Racial thinking is powerful precisely because it's normalized. If mainstream media and the shopping malls in American portray Santa as white, well... he must be white. Same for Jesus of Nazareth. We know these things to be true because these images repeat over and over. Santa is white, white people have money and money corrupts them, Blacks were happy before civil rights. In fact, Black people used to like white people -- after all, didn't Mammy love Scarlett in Gone with the Wind?"

Dear Miss America,

Thank you for reminding us what classic American beauty looks like today. For the rest of America – in case any of you have been sleeping for, say, the past two decades, or clinging to out-of-touch fashion magazines – here’s an alert: Beauty is Serena Williams and Michelle Obama. Beauty is Angelina Jolie and Marissa Mayer.

And yes, beauty is Nina Davuluri, Miss America 2014.

Women’s beauty cannot be debated or dictated by others. So in tribute to women across the globe, I celebrate your beautiful brown skin, your breathtaking Bollywood dance skills, and the hard work that I’m sure you put in, not only to earn top grades and graduate from the University of Michigan with a degree in brain behavior and cognitive science, but to become the first Indian-American woman to take home the tiara. I love it.

The beauty pageant circuit is a tough act, as I learned early from my fleeting experiences as a teen who participated in several pageants. Don’t laugh, that college scholarship money is no joke. Back then, there were no other brown girls on the stage. No matter. My family and friends cheered me on and told me how beautiful I was – and I had the audacity to believe them.

Sadly, it was the talent portion that always sunk me. Painting and poetry-writing just didn’t cut it as a stage act. Lucky for me, I found journalism, but those pageants helped give me the confidence to believe that I could share the stage with anyone.

Miss America, I hope you use your crown and platform well and that you have the courage to amplify the voices of those women and girls back in your ancestral home, India, who are valiantly fighting for full equality and the right to live without fear of the brutal sexual violence that plagues that nation.

You are not the first woman of color to take the crown. It was 30 years ago that Vanessa Williams became the first black Miss America. Seven other black women and one Asian woman have won since then. And most went on to successful careers.

But whenever this happens, those pesky bigots climb out of their caves to rant and rave and spew their ignorance about why it’s not fair. Ignore them.

Former Miss California: How do we teach kids diversity is beautiful?

Clearly, those divergent voices – and I admit there are many – failed even the most basic fourth-grade geography lesson and likely couldn’t even find India on a map, which is why they mistakenly think you are Arab. Perhaps they have you confused with Rima Fakih, a Lebanese immigrant from Dearborn, Michigan, who in 2010 was the first Arab-American to win the Miss USA pageant. Must be hard keeping up with a changing world when you’ve spent so much time trying to ignore and reject all those people who look different from you.

According to the 2010 U.S. Census, there are 3.2 million people of Asian Indian descent living in the United States. Their median income for 2010 was $90,711. In fact, Indians surpassed Filipinos as the nation’s second-largest Asian population, after Chinese, the data show.

Still, some people will never accept that it is families like yours that are helping to make America a stronger nation. Don’t let them distract you on your journey. Sounds like you’re on the right track:

“I’m so happy this organization has embraced diversity,” you said, according to The Associated Press. “I’m thankful there are children watching at home who can finally relate to a new Miss America.” Asked about the negativity, you said, “I have to rise above that. I always viewed myself as first and foremost American.”

Use those haters to inspire you reach your dream to become a cardiologist, Ms. Davuluri. Reject voices that would try to define and limit you. Reject the magazine covers and fashion gurus, who may understand how to design and sell a pretty dress but have no clue about what defines a woman’s beauty, as evidenced by the consistent and blatant lack of diversity on the runways during Fashion Weeks both here and abroad.

Reject the critics – men and women – who bash women like television personality Julie Chen for getting plastic surgery after being told by her bosses nearly 20 years ago that her Asian eyes would hurt her career. Chen made her choice back then, and brava for her for starting a public debate now about Asian beauty standards.

Today, Chen looks wonderful – hard to tell from a 20-year-old photo if she had grown to be a natural beauty with her original face. But I, for one, want to live in a world where grown women have the right to decide what is best our careers and our bodies.

Was it an awful message to give women in the workplace? Yes. But it’s no different from the countless occasions throughout my career that I’ve witnessed women being told that they are too fat, too black or too Latina to succeed. In my first television job, the news director told me that I should study Diane Sawyer’s look and voice in order to be better at my job – like I was ever going to look like Diane. Thank goodness Oprah came along.

Media is a tough career where regardless of your talent, looks really are still everything – especially for us women. And to be fair, I’ve known more than a few men who’ve gone under the knife or tried extreme diets just to keep their faces in front of the camera.

But to succeed, we must deal with it; work to improve the environment for the women behind us, and move on with our lives.

There’s room on the stage for all types of beauty.

There are two types of current - direct and alternating. In a direct current , the flow of electrons is consistently in one direction around the circuit, in an alternating current , the direction of electron flow continually reverses.

Charge Electrons are negatively charged particles and they transfer energy through wires as electricity. Charge is a property of a body which experiences a force in an electric field. Charge is measured in coulombs (C). Since electrons are so small and one electron will not have much of an effect anywhere, it is more useful to refer to large groups of electrons. One coulomb of charge is equivalent to 6,250,000,000,000,000,000 electrons.

Current In a closed circuit that includes a source of potential difference (voltage) there will be a current flowing around the circuit. curriculum-key-fact Electrical current in a metal is a flow of electrons When current flows, electrical work is done and energy transferred. The amount of charge passing a point in the circuit can be calculated using the equation: charge = current × time \[Q = I \times t\] This is when: charge ( Q ) is measured in coulombs (C)

current ( I ) is measured in amperes (A)

time ( t ) is measured in seconds (s) One ampere is the current that flows when one coulomb of charge passes a point in a circuit in one second. curriculum-key-fact 'Amps' is an abbreviation for 'amperes', the unit for current (also abbreviated as 'A') but the symbol for 'current' is 'I'. Example A current of 1.5 amps (A) flows through a simple electrical circuit. How many coulombs of charge flow through a point in 60 seconds? \[Q = I \times t\] \[Q = 1.5 \times 60\] \[Q = 90 \\ C\]

Question How much charge has moved if a current of 13 A flows for 10 s? Reveal answer up down \[Q = I \times t\] \[Q = 13 \times 10\] \[Q = 130 \\ C\] Question How much current flows when 10 C passes down a wire in 2 s?

Monsanto,"WASHINGTON — A freewheeling and almost entirely one-sided argument at the Supreme Court on Tuesday indicated that the justices would not allow Monsanto’s patents for genetically altered soybeans to be threatened by an Indiana farmer who used them without paying the company a fee.

The question in the case, Bowman v. Monsanto Company, No. 11-796, was whether patent rights to seeds and other things that can replicate themselves extend beyond the first generation. The justices appeared alert to the consequences of their eventual ruling not only for Monsanto’s very lucrative soybean patents but also for modern agriculture generally and for areas as varied as vaccines, cell lines and software.

A lawyer for Monsanto, Seth P. Waxman, a former United States solicitor general, was allowed to talk uninterrupted for long stretches, which is usually a sign of impending victory.

“Without the ability to limit reproduction of soybeans containing this patented trait,” he said, “Monsanto could not have commercialized its invention and never would have produced what is, by now, the most popular agricultural technology in America.”"

My Cat's Number One Priority is His Own Needs.

Geoffrey has a routine. As cats go, and I have had many, he's the most routine-driven feline I have ever met. He's deeply conservative that way. If I'm not up by 7am, he sees to it that I am and then flumpity flump down the stairs to the door. Out he goes just long enough for me to freshen his food and water, which I have paid for. He doesn't care if I have to pee first, or forgot to put out the garbage on garbage day, he has his routine and nobody is going to change it. The next thing he does is come in and eat that food, that FREE food, and he's smug and entitled when he does it. He then makes a commentary on his human companion:

Fig. 2. After consuming his food with an attitude of smug entitlement, he sends a message to the 99%.

2. My Cat is a Racist.

Geoffrey is an unapologetic racist. Like the GOP with banksters and corporate types, he cozies up to people, even new people, because they keep the slush fund of food, water, litter and catnip flowing like the Mighty Mississippi. But as far as other animals are concerned, if you're another animal and you're not a ragdoll cat like he is, he'll deliver an angry screed and may attack you. I have never seen such rank racism, or at least not since the last time Rand Paul gave a speech.

Geoffrey believes in the death penalty for vermin, but he's not content to use some supposedly humane form of execution, oh no. He is both a practitioner and advocate of torture of the most ugly sort and expects--no, demands approval and support for that by bringing these poor creatures into the house half dead. If he were a member of Congress, he'd perform an execution live on C-SPAN just to make a point.

Not only does Geoffrey enjoy an exalted position in the household, he feels entitled to more vacation than he has earned, very much like a Republican politician.

In the 1960s, a regular non-pedigreed white domestic longhaired cat named Josephine, who had produced several litters of typical cats, was injured in an accident involving a car and taken to the veterinary hospital at the University of California. Josephine was of a Persian/Angora type and had litters sired by several unknown male Birman or Burmese-like cats, one of which had the Siamese point coloration. Baker believed that Josephine was subject to a secret government genetic experiment during treatment at the lab, and claimed that it made Josephine docile, relaxed when picked up, and immune to pain.

John McCain said Thursday that he will place a hold on the renomination of the nation's top military officer, after he and Army Gen. Martin Dempsey got into a heated exchange on the Hill over the administration's handling of the Syrian civil war.

McCain clashed with the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff as he suggested Dempsey was partly responsible for a lackluster response to the Assad regime's aggression.

After the exchange, the Arizona Republican told reporters he would place a hold on Dempsey's nomination for a second term. A ""hold"" refers to the Senate practice in which a lawmaker can stall a nomination in order to extract information or assurances out of a nominee -- in this case, McCain suggested Dempsey was not being forthcoming at the hearing about his views on Syria and other subjects.

[pullquote]

Dempsey told the Senate Armed Services Committee, which is considering his nomination for a second term as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, that he has provided President Obama with options for the use of force in Syria, where a civil war entering its third year has killed almost 93,000 people.

Dempsey said the issue is “under deliberation inside our agencies of government,” but did not provide additional details. He used the term “kinetic strikes,” but said the decision is ultimately one for elected officials.

“I must tell both the witnesses at the onset I'm very concerned about the role you've played over the last two years,” McCain said of Dempsey and Navy Adm. James Winnefeld while beginning his line of questioning. “General Dempsey and Admiral Winnefeld, do you believe the continued cost and risk of our inaction in Syria are now worse for our national security interest than the cost and risk associated with limited military action?”

“Senator, as we've discussed ...” Dempsey replied.

“I'd like to know an answer rather than a filibuster,” McCain shot back. “I have six minutes and 10 seconds.”

Dempsey then said the United States is at “greater risk” due to the emergence of violent extremist organizations in Syria, as is Iraq.

“You're not answering the question, General,” McCain said, before asking his original question again.

“With all due respect, Senator, you're asking me to agree that we've been inactive, and we have not been inactive,” Dempsey replied.

“We have not been inactive,” McCain said, to which Dempsey affirmed.

“This again gives validity to my concern,” McCain said. “Because, obviously, we may have — not been — inactive, but any observer knows that Bashar Assad is prevailing on the battlefield. One hundred thousand people have been killed. Hezbollah is there … And the situation is — much more dire than it was two years ago when you and Admiral Winnefeld came to office. And so, your answer is that we haven't been inactive.”

McCain then asked the question a third time, prompting Dempsey to testify he’s in favor of building a “moderate opposition” and then supporting it. The question to support that with “kinetic strike” is ultimately up for elected officials to make and not for the senior military leader of the nation, Dempsey said.

“This goes back to my concern about your role as chairman of the Joint Chiefs,” McCain replied. “The chairman of the Joint Chiefs is supposed to provide the best advice he can as far as our national security is concerned. That's why you are the sole military adviser.”

McCain then noted that Dempsey testified in February that he advised Obama to arm vetted units of the Syrian opposition. Then, in April, Dempsey no longer supported the opposition, McCain said.

“Now we read in published reports that the administration has decided to arm the Syrian opposition units,” McCain said. “How do we account for those pirouettes?”

Dempsey wouldn’t accept the term “pirouette,” he said.

“I would accept the term that we have adopted our approach based on what we know of the opposition,” he testified. “And if you recall, in the beginning of the year, there was a period where it was pretty evident that the extremist groups were prevailing inside the opposition. So I have not been wavering.”

In response to McCain's warning about putting the nomination on hold, Dempsey spokesman Col. Ed Thomas later put out this statement: ""The Chairman respects the confirmation process and, if confirmed for another two-year term, will be honored to serve at the pleasure of the President and with the consent of Congress.""

Other fireworks during the hearing included Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., asking Dempsey directly whether Syria's embattled president, Bashar Assad, is winning the fight in the war-torn country.

“Currently the tide is shifting in his favor,” Dempsey testified.

Winnefeld, meanwhile, said if pressed, he would say Assad’s regime is winning.

“But not by much,” he testified.

Editor’s Note: Bryan Monroe is the editor of CNNPolitics.com and lost more than 170 pounds after having gastric bypass surgery in 2006.

(CNN) —

Good move, governor. And you didn’t even let on.

When we chatted briefly at the White House Correspondents Dinner a few weekends ago, you looked very upbeat and energetic. I had no idea that you had undergone Lap-Band stomach surgery to lose weight

And when I wrote that CNN piece about you on February 8 saying you needed to take your doctor’s advice seriously and do whatever you could to drop some pounds, I had no idea you probably had made the decision already and were heading into surgery in eight days.

Bryan Monroe/CNN New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie with Bryan Monroe at the White House Correspondents Dinner on April 27.

Congratulations!

Now some are saying that your decision to make such a drastic move to drop what could be at least 100 pounds was motivated by your desire to run for president in 2016. Being 5-foot-11 and weighing at least 300 to 350 pounds at 50 might not be conducive to occupying the Oval Office as 45th president of the United States.

But we know better.

You told the New York Post that you did this first for your family, for your kids. Those are the same factors that led to my decision seven years ago. They also motivated men like NBC’s Al Roker, Jets coach Rex Ryan and former Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. to do the same thing – and it had nothing to do with political aspirations.

“It’s so much more important than that,” you told the Post.

We’ll leave that to history to decide.

Still, you knew that being morbidly obese (yes, that’s how you describe people who are 100 pounds or more over their ideal body weight) would be something that would ultimately kill you, probably as a relatively young man.

You don’t see a lot of 80-year-old obese people, do you?

And, at 50, with four wonderful children, you have a lot to live for and a lot of life ahead of you. Then there’s a possible future in Washington.

For a public person, a governor, these decisions are terribly personal. You had to consider the risks of doing nothing or having a fairly aggressive surgery like gastric bypass – or doing something a little less aggressive like the Lap-Band, also called the adjustable laparoscopic banding system.

In that procedure, doctors put a silicone tube, which is like a big rubber band, around the top of your stomach, restricting the amount of food you can take in. They fill that tube with saline, squeezing the size of the entry into the stomach even more so you can eat even less. They can also adjust the band to allow for more food.

This can result in the loss of at least 100 pounds within the first year to 18 months, but it does carry some risks. Some say you’ve already dropped 40 to 50 pounds, which would be typical eight to 10 weeks after the procedure.

But there will be haters.

Some will say that your lifestyle of excess over the years led you to this point, and that it’s lazy to go under the knife to resolve such a dramatic problem rather than bear down, hit the treadmill and do it the hard way.

Others will question why you decided to do the Lap-Band procedure rather than the permanent Roux-en-Y gastic bypass. Some people have had to remove the bands because they caused painful irritation and scar tissue in their stomachs. I had the Roux-en-Y procedure, which can be initially more dangerous but is often recommended for those who require dramatic weight loss in a shorter period of time.

And then there will be those who said you did all this just because you want to be president in 2016. A fat president wasn’t even a good look for William Howard Taft back in 1909.

Some or all that may be true, but really, governor, we know there’s a lot more to the story.

You did this to live.

You did this because 50 is just too young to drop dead of a heart attack, diabetes or a stroke.

You did this for your health. Not to mention that it would be kind of sad to get out-hustled in Iowa or New Hampshire or Florida by Hillary Clinton simply because you needed to stop and catch your breath on the campaign bus.

But most important, you did this so you would be around for your kids, your wife, your family, your state and your country.

And I say, more power to ya…

Jim DeMint, now the president of the conservative Heritage Foundation, said Tuesday that his former colleagues’ largely secret negotiations about immigration reform are troubling. A bipartisan group, dubbed the “Gang of Eight,” has been spearheading immigration reform efforts for months, and no legislative text has been presented to date. When it is presented, Democratic leadership in the Senate and Republican leadership in the House are expected to try to rush the bill through to passage.

In remarks to the Heritage Foundation’s Blogger’s Briefing on Tuesday, DeMint expressed concern over the behind-closed-doors formulation of legislation, which he knows from experience is actually being written by special interests and staffers. “And the members who are involved with this haven’t seen it or read it. They’re being told what’s going to be in it,” he said.

“What we believe at Heritage is that this should be an open and transparent process, and it should be step-by-step so Americans can be brought along with what needs to be changed,” DeMint added. “In 1986 we had three million unlawful folks in our country, promises were made on the floor of the House and Senate that if we gave an amnesty this would never happen again. We would secure our borders, we would fix our system.” Neither of these promises were kept.

The Heritage Foundation is currently drafting a peer-reviewed research analysis aimed at discovering the true cost of immigration reform to taxpayers. Details of the Heritage analysis, being conducted by Robert Rector, have not been made public yet. But the Senate Budget Committee Republican staff estimates immigration reform will cost taxpayers trillions more in entitlement and welfare spending. “What Heritage is doing right now and we’re working with some of best guys in the business, scholars like Robert Rector who developed the groundbreaking welfare reform research and policy work and he developed the cost that a lot of us used back in 2007 that helped us realize that this was not free,” DeMint said, referring to Rector’s report “The Fiscal Cost of Low-Skill Immigrants to the U.S. Taxpayer.”

The former Senator drew a distinction between the average taxpayer and representatives of labor and business who are involved in drafting the legislation. “Amnesty is not a free proposition to taxpayers. So we’re going to quantify that cost. I can guarantee you Heritage will be the only organization in the country that is looking at the true cost of a blanket amnesty proposal.”

That sounds straightforward enough. But there are two ways to understand the decision, Graham v. Florida.

One is formal. The court may have meant only to bar sentences labeled “life without parole.” On that understanding, judges remained free to impose very long sentences — 100 years, say — as long as they were for a fixed term rather than for life.

That is how Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., in dissent, urged lower-court judges to interpret the decision. “Nothing in the court’s opinion affects the imposition of a sentence to a term of years without the possibility of parole,” he wrote."

Assistant Sheriff Todd Rogers said he was troubled by the department’s preliminary findings and plans on “making some swift changes.”

The reforms were prompted by a Times investigation earlier this month that found the agency hired dozens of officers from a disbanded county police force even though sheriff’s investigators had found significant misconduct in their backgrounds. Internal agency files showed that jobs were given to officers who accidentally fired their weapons, had sex at work, committed theft, solicited prostitutes or falsified records.

The department is now evaluating what to do with the problem hires.

Rogers said sheriff’s officials are considering terminating some but likely won’t be able to legally fire employees for misconduct that sheriff’s officials knew about when they hired them. What’s more realistic, he said, is moving the problem hires to less sensitive positions, giving them more training and putting them on administrative monitoring to limit future misconduct.

Rogers said that the identification of 80 officers who shouldn’t have been hired – a number that is still preliminary – was determined by comparing their background files to the department’s hiring standards. Some, he said, should have been disqualified automatically and others had problems that were less “black and white.” He said he is legally restricted from providing the names and detailed histories of the 80 officers but said the problems included significant criminal convictions, on-duty misconduct, poor job performance and financial problems.

IN-DEPTH: Behind the badge

Rogers said the fact that the department hired problem officers is so troubling because “almost everything we do is predicated on public trust.”

“People have to trust that we’re hiring the best and brightest … because of the awesome authority and responsibility our deputies have,” he said.

The records reviewed by The Times showed that for nearly 100 of the roughly 280 hires, investigators discovered evidence of dishonesty, such as making untrue statements or falsifying police records. At least 15 were caught cheating on the department’s own polygraph exams.

The officers all once worked at the county’s smaller police force, the Office of Public Safety. To save money, the county disbanded that agency about four years ago and its responsibilities -- patrolling county buildings, parks and hospitals -- were handed over to the Sheriff’s Department.

Sheriff’s officials were not required to hire any of the former county officers, officials said, but gave them the first shot at applying for the new sheriff’s jobs. The department hired about 280. The majority were taken on as sworn deputies, while others were hired as custody assistants in the department’s troubled jail system, security guards or for other lower-level positions.

One applicant had been fired from another agency amid allegations he abused inmates but was hired by Baca’s agency to work the jails. Another was forced out of the Los Angeles Police Department after lying to a supervisor. A third admitted to using her service weapon to shoot at her husband while he ran away from her.

After the Times report, the county Board of Supervisors demanded that Sheriff Lee Baca report back about the mass hiring. In a letter he sent to the board, Baca responded and acknowledged that the hiring standards were violated. He said that he had delegated the authority for making the hiring decisions to his undersheriff at the time, Larry Waldie.

“My direction was unequivocal that we were to only hire qualified candidates,” Baca says in the letter.

A sheriff’s audit found that the former undersheriff was responsible for hiring “several” officers who did not meet sheriff’s standards, but no administrative action can be taken against him since he is now retired, according to the letter.

Waldie has told The Times that he was under pressure from county officials to hire as many former county police officers as possible.

Baca’s spokesman Steve Whitmore said the sheriff “understood there are significant issues here.”

“This is how he’s responding,” Whitmore said. “He’s fixing it.”

The department is still reviewing the mass hiring but is already planning to implement reforms.

Rogers, who oversees the personnel division, said the problem appears to be Waldie’s decision-making and that the department’s investigators did their job by completing thorough background checks.

Still, Rogers said he’s met with every background investigator, as well as the investigators’ supervisors, to clarify the department’s position on hiring.

“I expect them to only hire people who meet our hiring standards, period,” he said. “We’re only going to hire the best. There’s no equivocation.”

The department is also changing the way it hires, Rogers said. Currently, the decision is made by a supervisor within the personnel division and formally finalized by an assistant sheriff. The department now plans to create a panel of lieutenants and one civilian employee to make hiring decisions, with wobblers sent to a panel of commanders.

“I believe we need to confront this head-on,” Rogers said. “That’s what we’re doing.”

But what’s happening with the giant Millennium Hollywood project is much more unusual: In this case, a state agency is taking up the cudgel against the city of Los Angeles, accusing city officials of using bogus statistics and trampling over state law in an effort to push the project through to approval by the City Council.

Advertisement

The state agency is the California Department of Transportation. Caltrans is responsible for the health and welfare of the 101 Freeway, which winds within a block or two around the Millennium site.

The agency says, quite reasonably, that a $664-million project — comprising 461 residential units, 254 hotel rooms, more than a quarter-million square feet for office space, and 80,000 square feet of retail in two towers looming over the landmark Capitol Records building close to the already-busy corner of Hollywood and Vine — can’t help but have a marked effect on the freeway. In fact, Caltrans makes it plenty clear that without significant changes in the plan, the effect on the 101 could be disastrous.

Caltrans is irked that city officials seem to have wholly ignored its concerns. In a May 7 letter to Councilman Eric Garcetti, whose district encompasses the Millennium site — and who is a critic of the project and is the mayor-elect — the agency said that it hadn’t heard from city officials since Feb. 19, when it listed a raft of misgivings about the Millennium. The City Council’s vote, which was originally scheduled for Wednesday, is likely to be put off until July.

There are two bottom lines in the Caltrans analysis: one, the potential impacts from this mega-project will make the freeway and surrounding streets more unsafe; and two, the failure to measure and properly mitigate these impacts violates the California Environmental Quality Act, or CEQA.

Advertisement

The latter conclusion shouldn’t be overlooked. CEQA has long been a whipping boy for real estate developers, who gripe that it serves only as a tool for anti-growth malcontents.

But if the City Council gives the Millennium a green light despite the unanswered questions about it, CEQA will be the only leverage the community will have to minimize its deleterious impacts. “Without CEQA compliance, this would be a big giveaway,” says Robert P. Silverstein, a land-use lawyer representing more than 40 community and neighborhood groups opposing the project.

The battle already is shaping up along David versus Goliath lines. Millennium Partners is the epitome of big-money real estate development, the backer of billions of dollars in luxury developments in New York, Boston, Washington and San Francisco. Its Hollywood plan, featuring two towers of which one could be as tall as 585 feet, or 55 stories, aims to take advantage of city zoning changes that encourage high-density development near Metro stations, such as the stop at Hollywood and Vine.

Millennium’s style is to gravitate toward high-profile but down-at-the-heels urban centers and spiff them up — creating “luxurious residential environments surrounded by beautiful places to work, shop, exercise and be entertained,” it says with all due modesty. “All of our projects altered the skyline,” Millennium co-founder Philip Aarons remarked in a recent interview with the Bloomberg news service.

Advertisement

That’s always nice, especially if you’re the one doing the altering. But the people who live and work under the existing skyline don’t always perceive the gain. One of the criticisms heard about the Millennium Hollywood is that the towers, which will be the tallest buildings in Hollywood, will dominate, rather than complement, the low-rise neighborhoods around them and the Capitol building, which Millennium owns and will incorporate into the project.

Millennium does have the current city administration’s favor. City Hall insiders say Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa has pressed for rapid approval, perhaps because he sees the Millennium as some sort of legacy. But the unresolved questions about traffic suggest that the whole scheme may need a better going-over than it has received.

Advertisement

That’s not the view of the developers. “This will be the most highly regulated project ever approved by the city,” declares Jerold B. Neuman, the project’s Los Angeles land-use attorney.

Neuman says the disagreement between Caltrans and the city involves a broader fight between them over how to set standards for reviewing environmental issues with local and state impacts. “We’re stuck in the cross hairs,” he told me.

Advertisement

Still, it’s hard to argue that Caltrans is out of line in questioning the city’s assertion that this huge project would feed no more than 150 cars a day onto the 101 during peak hours. That’s the threshold figure the city used to justify its conclusion that the Millennium would have “a less than significant impact ... on freeway segments” — and therefore “no mitigation is required.”

From Caltrans’ point of view, that stretches plausibility to the breaking point. (Even if it were true, Caltrans says, the 101 is so jammed now that 150 more rush-hour cars is significant enough. Would anyone who drives the Hollywood Freeway disagree?) Caltrans says the city’s estimate “is not based on any credible analysis that could be found anywhere” in the environmental impact report. And it points out that more overload on the 101 means more backups from on-ramps onto city streets, more cars spewing exhaust into residential neighborhoods, more potential vehicle/pedestrian encounters (and we know who always wins those).

Advertisement

Caltrans says the city didn’t bother to study the freeway segments where there would be the most impact, including the six on- and off-ramps closest to the Millennium site. When it did study traffic impacts, Caltrans adds, it used faulty formulas, including giving the developer too much credit for mitigation efforts such as bikeshare and carpooling.

Tomas Carranza, a senior transportation engineer at the city Department of Transportation, told me that the developers will put in place a “really aggressive trip reduction program” exploiting the city’s transit system and incentives to encourage residents, workers and visitors to leave their cars at home. But he also acknowledges that “there will be more traffic, and there will be unmitigated impacts” from the Millennium.

The council’s vote, when it comes, will amount to a judgment that the upside of building the Millennium will outweigh the inevitable downsides. Can we trust the evidence they’ll be relying on? Caltrans says no.

Peterson was transferred this morning to the Stateville Correctional Center near Crest Hill, where he was evaluated for placement based upon factors such as his conviction, length of sentence, program needs and medical and mental health requirements.

Peterson stayed at Stateville only a few hours before being sent to his new home at Pontiac prison northeast of Bloomington, a maximum security facility that has a protective custody unit. The assignment was based upon factors such as his conviction, length of sentence, program needs and medical and mental health requirements, per Illinois Department of Correction protocol.

Officials have not said whether he has a cellmate or if he will be in solitary confinement like he had been during his jail stay.

As part of his daily routine there, he will remain in his cell for most of the day, though he will be allowed out for meals and showers. Most inmates also get about five hours of recreation time outside per week, Illinois Department of Corrections spokesman Stacey Solano said.

The Will County jail – which had held Peterson in solitary confinement since his May 2009 arrest for his own safety – had the paperwork prepared for his transfer by the time he returned from his sentencing hearing Thursday, officials said.

The sheriff’s department, which oversees the jail, kept the former Bolingbrook police sergeant segregated from the general population there amid concerns that his high-profile case and law-enforcement background would make him a target of inmates looking to build tough-guy reputations.

Jail supervisors began preparing Peterson at 8:30 a.m. and he left without incident by 9:22 a.m., officials said.

Drew Peterson wanted to make sure he was heard when he was given one last chance to speak Thursday, shortly before being sentenced to 38 years in prison for the murder of his third wife, Kathleen Savio.

Declining to speak from the defense table, where there was no microphone, the former Bolingbrook police sergeant shuffled to the witness stand in his jail-issued blue scrubs and orange shoes and began quietly.

""I hope I don't aggravate the situation,"" he turned and told the judge. Then Peterson screamed into the microphone, ""I did not kill Kathleen!"" startling almost everyone in the courtroom.

""Yes, you did!"" Savio's sister Sue Doman yelled back from the gallery, prompting Will County Circuit Judge Edward Burmila to order her out of the courtroom.

It was an odd end to a case replete with oddities and circuslike sideshows. For the next 40 minutes, Peterson cried, raged and whispered, challenged the state's attorney to look him in the eye and indulged in self-pity as he unleashed his multitudinous thoughts like a character in a Dostoevsky novel.

The 59-year-old said he expects to die in prison. Barring any successful appeal, he won't be eligible for release until he's 93.

Peterson claimed that lies and mistakes by witnesses, prosecutors and police led to his conviction, and made disparaging remarks about Savio's family, attorneys and others involved in the case. His defense attorneys called the monologue an impassioned plea for leniency, but prosecutors said it was proof that Peterson is a psychopath.

""When he got up on the stand and (in) that shrill, kinda-feminine screech that he didn't kill Kathy — that's the guy that killed Kathy,"" Will County State's Attorney James Glasgow said. ""You got a glimpse into his soul.""

But in describing himself on the stand Thursday, Peterson said he was maligned and misunderstood.

""Until this happened, I thought I was viewed as a great guy,"" Peterson said, giving a litany of public and private good deeds before announcing he planned to tattoo the phrase ""No good deed goes unpunished"" across his shoulders.

""The state took an accident and staged a homicide,"" Peterson said, before turning to the judge. ""Can I get some water?""

Once refreshed, Peterson said he had upheld the oath he swore when he became a police officer.

""I always took my job seriously, I never violated the public trust,"" he said, his voice husky with emotion before quoting one of the Ten Commandments. ""And I never beared false witness against anyone.""

""I think the only thing left to make this case run true to form,"" he told Burmila, stopping to take a tissue and wipe his nose, ""would be a cruel and unusual punishment. And I don't think anybody would care, because nobody cares. I can't believe I spent 32 years defending a constitution that allowed this to happen to me.""

It's not uncommon for a defendant to lash out against those who put them behind bars. It is rare, however, for defendant to offer a long, extemperaneous speech that both walks the court through the evidence and ilicits angry outbursts from the victims' families.

Peterson accused the state's attorney's office, state police, Savio's family and even Lifetime TV of being part of various conspiracies to wrongfully convict him. Last year, Lifetime TV aired a movie about Peterson with Rob Lowe playing the suburban police officer. Peterson said the ""ridiculous movie"" denied him a right to a fair trial and included statements he'd made to state police.

He said he took full responsibility for his press appearances, which created a media firestorm after his fourth wife, Stacy, disappeared in 2007 and included talk of a ""Win a Date with Drew"" contest on the radio.

""I'm an obnoxious man by nature, truly,"" Peterson said. ""And after 30 years as a police officer, as is normal with police officers, my defense mechanism is comedy. The media took that and capitalized on that, and my obnoxious nature shone through.""

Peterson, who smirked at the state police officers who investigated him as he was brought into the courtroom, appeared to struggle to keep his composure on the witness stand. His right hand shook at times as he held forth, clutching some papers in his left hand.

""But I want to assure the court that at no time did I want to portray any insensitivity about Kathy's death,"" he said, turning to address Burmila. ""That was not my intention.""

Peterson also took aim at Glasgow, who tapped his fingers at the prosecutors table and at one point asked a colleague ""Is he done?"" during Peterson's speech."

In recent months, he has announced new gun control measures, put in place limited immigration reform and made fixes to the Affordable Care Act — all without Congress. Many liberals who once worried about presidential overreach have applauded his robust use of presidential power.

Yet the president’s increasing unilateralism shouldn’t be cause for celebration. Bypassing Congress means bypassing democratic checks. It also means giving up on government’s ability to effectively address serious long-term challenges. The solution to a dysfunctional Congress isn’t an unchecked executive; it’s a Congress that actually works.

A first step in that direction was taken recently with the banning of filibusters for executive branch nominees and federal judges below the Supreme Court.

YEAR IN REVIEW: Washington’s 5 biggest ‘fails’ of 2013

Advertisement

The filibuster is not part of our nation’s constitutional design. To the contrary, the framers rejected supermajority requirements except in limited circumstances, such as impeaching the president and ratifying treaties. Alexander Hamilton wrote in Federalist No. 22 that if “a pertinacious minority can control the opinion of a majority,” there would be “tedious delays; continual negotiation and intrigue; contemptible compromises of the public good.” As a result, the government would often be “kept in a state of inaction.” Sound familiar?

However, the framers certainly wouldn’t have approved of the president responding to this “state of inaction” by simply going around Congress and exercising unilateral powers.

When President George W. Bush was in office, Democrats criticized his go-it-alone approach — his insistence, for example, that he could launch military attacks without Congress’ blessing, or unilaterally tighten restrictions on the use of stem cells in federally funded research. But the last five years have shown that many on the left are willing to turn a blind eye to unchecked executive action when a Democrat is in the White House.

YEAR IN REVIEW: Highs and lows from Obama’s roller-coaster year

It’s no mystery why. Congress has proved a graveyard for serious action on almost every issue. Obama, a professor of constitutional law who once criticized executive unilateralism, has acted alone mainly because it’s the only way he can get anything done.

But while Democrats have the presidency now, they won’t hold it forever. In the meantime, they’re feeding a beast that will be extremely difficult to control in the future. And the policy achievements could prove ephemeral. Anything Obama can achieve alone, a successor can potentially undo.

Worse, the Democratic embrace of unilateralism feeds the cycle of dysfunction. It strips responsibility from Congress, removing whatever is left of the incentive for compromise. And some things near and dear to the hearts of Democrats, such as improving our anemic economy, simply can’t be achieved through executive fiat.

Republicans should also want to fix the status quo. The political branch where they’re strongest is increasingly weak, and things are only going to get worse. After all, even if filibuster reform applies only to judicial and presidential nominees, it will substantially increase the power of the man in the Oval Office they love to hate. He will find it much easier to fill vacancies in the executive branch and federal courts with appointees who will carry out and legally protect executive initiatives. That’s bad for Republicans and the republic.

So what can be done? First, end the filibuster for good — for everything. As we just saw, the majority of the Senate has the power to do this. Yes, the filibuster gives every senator enhanced power to grind government to a halt. But that very same power makes each senator part of an institution that is growing more unpopular and irrelevant by the day.

Second, fix the broken budget process. The federal government should run on last year’s budget if Congress can’t agree on a new one. That would end the opportunities for endless hostage-taking and prevent costly shutdowns. (And while we’re at it, it is well past time to eliminate the redundant debt-ceiling vote, which has caused so much havoc.)

Third, bring transparency to lobbying and campaign donations, and pursue efforts to reduce candidates’ reliance on big donors and powerful lobbyists. Congress won’t be truly accountable to the people until the pull of narrow, wealthy interest groups and intense party activists is weakened.

The hard part, of course, isn’t coming up with sensible reforms in these areas (and we’ve merely hinted at an agenda). It’s getting Congress to put them in place. No one should expect a short or easy struggle. But maybe the only thing the parties can agree on is that the president should not be governing the country alone. If so, there’s a chance filibuster reform could be just the start.

The Arizona Republic

McCain%27s bill would allow consumers to choose and pay for only the channels they want

Critics say plan would have negative impact on diversity in programming

Analysts say cable industry%27s lobbying power would likely block any chances of a la carte pricing

Online music retailers usually don't force consumers to buy an entire album to get a favorite song.

Many consumers wonder why satellite and cable operators can't do something similar and allow them to purchase TV service by the channel instead of a bundle of dozens or even hundreds of networks, many of which they'll never watch.

The idea of ""a la carte"" cable and satellite television has been around for years. But Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., has jump-started a new national conversation with a bill he introduced in Congress this month that would use regulatory incentives to encourage programmers and distributors to unbundle their channels and offer a la carte programming.

McCain immediately picked up support from watchdog groups such as the Consumers Union and others who see his legislation as a way to shake up the status quo while technological innovations such as Internet TV break into the mainstream video market.

Ever-rising cable prices also are fueling the calls for a la carte. According to a Federal Communications Commission survey, rates for expanded basic cable, a popular cable tier, grew an average of 6.1 percent a year between 1995 and 2011. The average monthly price for the service is $54.46.

""I believe the consumers are at a tipping point when it comes to their monthly pay-TV bill,"" McCain told a Senate subcommittee last week. ""In my view, the a la carte option is a non-regulatory and consumer-friendly way to provide consumers with the freedom to lower their bills and pay only for what they watch.""

But while the concept is popular with many cable customers, and technology and other market forces appear headed in that direction, most observers doubt that even a senator with the national stature of McCain, a one-time presidential nominee, can bend the entrenched Washington lobbies of the cable industry, the broadcasters and the programmers to his will.

Cable lobbyists argue that a la carte pricing is not financially feasible, likely would mean the end of many channels that are not popular enough to survive without it, and probably wouldn't even save viewers much money, either. Hilary Shelton, director of the NAACP's Washington bureau, has blasted the a la carte cable idea on the grounds it would economically hurt minorities and ""kill diversity in programming.""

Industry leaders also argue that such issues might be better left to the free market to sort out, pointing to the ongoing revolution in video technology that gives consumers a variety of new viewing options — such as online video, Netflix, Hulu, iTunes and digital video recorders — and allows them to watch their favorite shows and movies on their schedules. A traditional TV set no longer is even necessary. Many young people are increasingly relying on their iPads, smartphones and laptop computers to watch video.

""These are big issues, but is anything going to happen? No,"" said A. Michael Noll, a University of Southern California professor emeritus and expert on telecommunications policy and TV technology. ""The cable companies have tremendous lobbying power — more power than John McCain.""

Long shot to become law

In a recent interview with The Arizona Republic, even McCain acknowledged that his bill is a long shot to become law this year.

""I'd be surprised (if it passes), because the cable companies and the satellite companies are such a powerful special interest,"" McCain said. ""But we'll keep trying.""

It's unclear whether the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, which has jurisdiction over telecommunications issues, even intends to return to the a la carte programming issue in a serious way.

But McCain, a longtime champion of a la carte cable, was allowed to make his case last Tuesday before its Subcommittee on Communications, Technology and the Internet during a hearing on the ""State of Video."" In his remarks, McCain compared the bundling of programming in cable and satellite packages to forcing customers to pay for the entire menu at a restaurant in order to get what they want to eat.

""Basically, I support a la carte, and I believe most Americans do, for the basic reason that consumers shouldn't have to pay for television channels they don't watch and have no interest in watching,"" said McCain, a former Commerce Committee chairman who no longer sits on the panel.

Savings questioned

Michael Powell, president and CEO of the National Cable and Telecommunications Association, countered that several independent studies have raised questions about whether shifting to an a la carte system would actually save customers money.

The audience size for each channel would shrink dramatically, and prices likely would increase ""quite substantially"" in order to make up for the revenue loss that would accompany a smaller advertising base, Powell said. Some of the less popular—but still culturally significant and diverse— channels might not survive a transition to a la carte pricing and would be lost to their viewers.

""It doesn't take long for consumers, putting those pieces together, to quickly get to a package that costs something very similar to what they were paying before, if not more,"" Powell, a former FCC chairman, told the subcommittee.

The cable industry also realizes that the market is changing and younger customers expect personalized options.

""As the video model evolves, expect to see channel lineups that are personalized and recommendation engines that modify content choices to your preferences,"" Powell said.

Gordon Smith, a former Republican senator from Oregon who now heads the National Association of Broadcasters, echoed that in response to a question about a la carte: ""There are tremendous market forces anyway that are creating kinds of adjustments.""

Despite expanding choices, some consumers who like the a la carte idea say they're discouraged by what they still view as a lack of real competition and options in pay TV, which frequently is packaged with phone and Internet service.

""When they bundle it, you've got to have this in order to get this, and if you drop this, then you lose out on the rest of the stuff,"" said David Blare, 48, a utility-company electrician in Mesa. ""I just don't think that's right.""

Supporters want to try it

Consumer groups have tended to appreciate McCain's willingness to tackle the pay-TV issues.

""A lot of people today feel like they're getting ripped off,"" said John Bergmayer, senior staff attorney with Public Knowledge, a Washington, D.C.-based public-interest organization that focuses on Internet and other technology issues. ""So I support Senator McCain's bill because it's aimed at giving consumers a lot more choice and flexibility.""

Online video is making encouraging progress, but so far seems to be providing more competition to the traditional video-rental store than to cable companies, which haven't yet had to respond with lower prices, Bergmayer told the subcommittee.

""For most users, it is a supplement to cable, not a replacement,"" he said."

For American women serving at military bases across Afghanistan, there was nothing extraordinary about the recent Pentagon decision to lift the official ban on women in direct combat roles.

“We’re already here,” said Army Capt. Kelly Hasselman, 28, of Broken Arrow, Okla., who commands a company of female soldiers that deployed with infantry in the southern province of Kandahar to build relations with rural Afghan women. “It’s just not officially been in the books.”

U.S. commanders say that military policy was out of step with the reality of two wars with virtually no front lines. Women, who make up about 15% of the active-duty military, have faced gunfire, bomb blasts and shelling while serving in Iraq and Afghanistan — in some cases without leaving their bases.

Two have been awarded the Silver Star, the nation’s third-highest medal for gallantry in combat. More than 150 have lost their lives.

Long before Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta announced that he was lifting a 1994 rule that prevented women from being assigned to units below brigade level whose primary function is direct ground combat, female troops were serving alongside such units at outposts in some of the most heavily contested regions of Iraq and Afghanistan.

Stretched by more than a decade of war, the Army and Marine Corps for years sidestepped official policy by “attaching,” rather than assigning, women to infantry and special operations units because their skills were needed.

When soldiers from the 3rd Battalion, 41st Infantry Regiment, deployed in December to this dusty base in Zhari, the Kandahar district where the Taliban was born, they brought with them an eight-member “female engagement team” drawn from Hasselman’s company. Women also serve in the battalion as medics, in the logistics and personnel sections and in the motor pool.

“Gender, height, weight, religion, sexual preference, race — I don’t care,” said the battalion commander, Lt. Col. Thomas Anderson. “It all comes down to your ability to do what the Army asks you to do.”

So far, the area has remained relatively calm. But when temperatures warm up and another fighting season begins, Anderson expects that his female soldiers will be involved in firefights.

“They are no less capable than I am to react to and return fire,” Anderson said. “Are my infantrymen better? Yes. That’s not due to a lack of ability. It is a lack of repetition.”

The battalion leadership says there have been few problems integrating women into the ranks. Rather, the change has been tougher for their Afghan security force partners to accept. The American women have grown accustomed to stares — and they aren’t allowed on the Afghan side of the compound without a security escort, a precaution also imposed on male soldiers because of the threat of insider attacks.

Pfc. Rosie Darby said she was told by her recruiter that women could not serve as frontline combat medics. She made sure to email him when she got her current job: a platoon medic at one of the battalion’s combat outposts. (Her official designation is healthcare specialist.)

“That first formation was a bit of a shell shock,” she said, smiling. “Everyone was looking and asking: ‘Is she in our formation? Is she a girl?’ ”

The petite 20-year-old from Pavilion, N.Y., soon earned their respect. Members of her platoon said she goes out with them almost every day, climbing over rows of grapevines with a pack of medical supplies on her back to avoid roads that may be seeded with bombs. “She outperforms half of us,” said Sgt. Andrew Bohman, 27, of Cincinnati.

Coarse language doesn’t faze her. “She’s like one of the guys,” said Pfc. Evan Sharp, 20, of Manteca, Calif.

But many in the unit are skeptical about opening other jobs to women, particularly in the infantry, where soldiers sometimes carry as much as 100 pounds of gear on foot patrols that can last all day. “There’s a lot of men that struggle with that,” said Sgt. 1st Class Ron Costa, 42, of Billerica, Mass.

Darby herself called it a “terrible idea.” Besides the physical demands, she worries about how soldiers will react if a woman serving with them is injured. She said the men in her platoon treat her like a little sister and would want to take care of her, even if their job demands that they carry on the fight.

1st Lt. Glen Melin, the platoon commander, said his main concern is upholding Army fitness standards. “This isn’t … like a frat club, to make it difficult to get into,” said Melin, 25, of Corpus Christi, Texas. “It’s to prepare you for the worst possible scenario.”

It is a concern shared by the women who serve here. “You need to say this is the standard, either you meet it or you don’t,” said Hasselman. But she dismissed the notion that women might not be capable of serving in combat positions. “I think that’s the worst argument for not having women in positions, saying they can’t do it,” she said. “Because I have plenty of females who have proven time and time again they can.”

Staff Sgt. Kimberly Williams, a member of Hasselman’s company who is attached to Anderson’s battalion, said some of her most dangerous jobs have been driving supply trucks and guarding prisoners in Iraq. Insurgents would frequently target convoys with roadside bombs and shell the bases where she was deployed.

“I’m not sure why only in the last two or three weeks it’s official I’m allowed to be in battle,” said Williams, 38, of New York. “Just because you don’t have the designated code doesn’t mean you aren’t doing the same work.”

Female engagement teams, first deployed in Afghanistan in 2009, are one of the clearest examples of the blurring of combat and support roles in the military.

Developed by the Marine Corps, the teams live, train and patrol with combat troops in sometimes rugged conditions. They sleep in tents and container housing, take their turn at guard duty and might go for days without access to showers or latrines. (“We use tons and tons of baby wipes,” Hasselman said.) Like their male counterparts, the women have frequently come under fire while on patrol and some have struggled with the psychological toll. Before deploying, Hasselman’s soldiers drew up wills and power of attorney instructions, many of them for the first time.

“Goodbye, this time, was harder,” said 1st Lt. Erica Miranda Ortiz, 32, of San Juan, Puerto Rico. She served twice in Iraq with an aviation support unit. But like others in the unit, she did not want another desk job.

“This is the first time I get to go out every day and interact with the local population,” she said. “I love what I do.”

Local cultural sensitivities prevent male troops from engaging with Afghan women in the more conservative rural areas. But village men will sometimes allow female soldiers into their compounds to meet with their wives, sisters and children. The soldiers also run a small women’s center, which offers adult literacy classes and art projects for children in a walled courtyard attached to the base.

Much of the time is spent getting to know each other. But the female soldiers, who have studied the Pashto language and cover their hair with colorful scarves, also ask women about conditions in their villages. With most international forces slated to leave next year, the soldiers hope the information will help Afghan authorities to better serve their communities and win their loyalty.

Although they are pleased that the military is acknowledging their role, the soldiers don’t expect a surge of women into combat jobs. For some the change came too late.

“When I was in college, I thought it would be so cool to be a Ranger or special forces,” said 1st Lt. Nicole Chappell, 25, of Fort Worth. “I was never going to get married. I was never going to have kids. I was going to be in the Army forever. Then I met my husband and everything changed.”

Williams said she was nearing retirement but was pleased that new opportunities were opening up for the next generation of servicewomen. “We want to help out in the effort just as much as the males,” she said.

Obama%27s invisibility encapsulates the delusional looking glass through which he sees the world.

Promises mean little in this world because when they%27re broken%2C Obama just redefines the promise.

Now%2C finally%2C the American people have had enough. Now%2C reality has encircled the White House.

""The buck stops here.""

There's a sustaining beauty to President Harry Truman's desk sign. In four simple words, it offers a defining purpose to an office of immense complexity -- in the end, the president holds the final responsibility.

Most presidents accept this narrative. But nearly five years into office -- after Fast and Furious, after Benghazi, after the snooping on Associated Press phone records, after the IRS political vendetta and now the Obamacare website mess, President Obama has shown his preference for a different kind of ""buck"" -- with a deliberately amorphous Constitution. By his own choice, Obama has become the ""know-nothing"" president.

To be fair, Obama's absent responsibility isn't rooted in a villainous conspiracy (call me a RINO, but I don't believe the president is an evil man). Instead, Obama's invisibility encapsulates the delusional looking glass through which he sees the world.

Welcome to the Obama Matrix -- the president's created world of absolute deniability. A world in the unwitting mold of another fictional Matrix … that of the Wachowski brothers.

The protagonists certainly sit well together.

It's obvious that Obama regards himself as ""the one"" – a presidential ""Neo"", a pure leader harassed by the emotionalism, incompetence and malevolence of others. In Obama's Matrix, the Republicans constitute ""Agent Smith"" -- arrogant malcontents driven by an inexorable anger. The American people are the cocooned humans -- requiring ""liberation"" from their ideological slumber. Valerie Jarrett is ""the Oracle"" -- the fountain of hard and necessary understanding. Everyone else? They're ""the machine"" -- the system that constricts Obama's positive intention.

By plugging himself into this Matrix of certainties, Obama has found a self-sustaining moral cause -- the belief that he's responsible for all that's politically favorable and nothing that's politically toxic. Festooned by adoring supporters and fortified behind unquestioning staff, Obama has always presumed a kind of Moses-esque self-awareness. These are the springs from which the presidential Matrix flows.

Of course, there's a big problem here.

As with ""Neo"", Obama's Matrix isn't real. In fact, it's the definition of un-reality: an imitation embraced in order to excuse absent leadership. For many years this pretense has been papered over by the GOP's fetish for political self-immolation. Nevertheless, the GOP doesn't alter the foundational truth -- Obama's Matrix is a dream world divorced from courage and facts.

Promises mean little in this world because when they're broken, Obama just redefines the promise. Take Obama's ""red lines"" in Syria. The principle was an explicit clarification that punitive military action would follow Syrian President Bashar Assad's use of WMDs. What followed was a Russian swindle that broadcast American impotence. Except, in the Obama Matrix, Obama had really won; it was the critics who were mistaken, we who lacked the intellectual sufficiency to grasp the brilliance of Obama's brain.

But now the White House has a problem. Now, finally, the American people have had enough. Now, reality has encircled the White House.

In the political storm that the health care debacle has reaped, the president and his staff are realizing that at a basic level, the ""buck"" has objective form. Slowly, they're recognizing that the shrine of plausible deniability eventually becomes implausible. Whether in business or government, leadership is about more than positive intentions -- it's about managing the consequences of choices. As the Merovingianexplains to ""Neo,"" ""I drank too much wine; now I must (use the restroom). Cause and effect.''

The president should gaze down to the Resolute Desk at which he works. Etched in its essence is a warning -- hubris portends a dangerous course. The ice is closing. If Obama wants to salvage his presidency, he must unplug himself from his Matrix of denial.

The IRS was summoned to a House oversight hearing to explain how it blew through $50 million on conferences between 2010 and 2012, including spending more than $4 million on a single California conference in 2010. For the agency's many critics, it compounded frustrations which had already mounted over the agency's targeting of conservative groups.

""Not only does the IRS take your money, not give you proper answers, but then when it comes to tens of millions of dollars, use it in a way that is, at best, maliciously self-indulgent,"" said Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.

Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings, of Maryland, likewise slammed the agency, specifically for spending $50,000 on ""ridiculous"" training videos, one of which was a ""Star Trek"" parody. Cummings noted that's more than many families make in a year.

Inspector General J. Russell George ticked off a list of over-the-top expenses incurred at the 2010 conference in Anaheim. He said the agency spent $35,000 on planning trips, $64,000 on gifts and trinkets including squirting fish toys, and $135,000 on outside speakers.

Faris Fink, the head of the IRS division that staged the conference and was the deputy in 2010 when he attended, apologized on Thursday for the expenses.

He said the conference was held to help train agency managers, but acknowledged it was ""not the best use of taxpayer dollars.""

Fink has the distinction of playing Mr. Spock in a cheesy but slickly produced ""Star Trek"" video that IRS employees filmed for the conference.

Fink also stayed in a room that normally cost $1,499 a night, the IG report said. A total of 132 IRS officials received room upgrades at the conference. The tax agency paid a flat daily fee of $135 per hotel room, the report said, but the upgrades were part of a package deal that added to the overall cost of the conference.

The training conference in Anaheim was held for 2,609 managers in the IRS' small business and self-employed division.

At the conference, the commissioner of the division, Christopher Wagner, stayed in a presidential suite that normally cost $3,500 a night, according to the inspector general's report. Wagner became chief of the IRS office of appeals in 2011 and retired this year.

The agency has imposed strict regulations to prevent expensive conferences in the future. And on Wednesday, the new acting head of the agency placed two officials on administrative leave for accepting free food at a party in a private suite at the IRS conference in 2010.

Pending a review, the two officials could lose their jobs, the agency said.

""When I came to IRS, part of my job was to hold people accountable,"" acting IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel said in a statement. ""There was clearly inappropriate behavior involved in this situation, and immediate action is needed.""

The new survey finds that 34 percent of adults would favor establishing Christianity as the official state religion in their own state, while 47 percent would oppose doing so. Thirty-two percent said that they would favor a constitutional amendment making Christianity the official religion of the United States, with 52 percent saying they were opposed.

Although a large percentage of Americans said they would favor establishing a state religion, only 11 percent said they thought the U.S. Constitution allowed states to do so. Fifty-eight percent said they didn't think it was constitutional, and 31 percent said they were not sure.

The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the First Amendment, which (among other things) prohibits the government from establishing an official religion, also applies to the states.

Republicans were more likely than Democrats or independents to say that they would favor establishing Christianity as an official state religion, with 55 percent favoring it in their own state and 46 percent favoring a national constitutional amendment.

The relatively high level of support for establishing Christianity as a state religion may be reflective of dissatisfaction with the current balance of religion and politics. Respondents to the poll were more likely to say that the U.S. has gone too far in keeping religion and government separate than they were to say religion and government are too mixed, by a 37-29 percent margin. Only 17 percent said that the country has struck a good balance in terms of the separation of church and state.

The HuffPost/YouGov poll was conducted April 3-4 among 1,000 U.S. adults. The poll used a sample selected from YouGov's opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population. Factors considered include age, race, gender, education, employment, income, marital status, number of children, voter registration, time and location of Internet access, interest in politics, religion and church attendance.

"http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-tupelo-arrest-20130428,0,408315.story",2013-04-28 07:00:00,[],"With new arrest, ricin case takes a strange turn","TUPELO, Miss. — Federal agents of all sorts invaded northeast Mississippi several days ago, on a mission: Find the man who sent a poison-laced letter to the president. But the United States government quickly found itself entangled, once again, in a misunderstood land dominated by squabbling tribes and petty vengeances.

Agents first arrested an Elvis impersonator, released him, then on Saturday arrested his nemesis, a karate instructor. Gradually investigators concluded that what they had descended upon was probably less about the president — or the U.S. senator and retired state judge who also received letters — than a serious case of indigenous bickering.

Advertisement

That shocks no one here. “Tupelo is a kaleidoscope,” said sociologist Mark Franks, who grew up in nearby Booneville. There are true geniuses walking the streets of Tupelo, he said, and incredibly wealthy, generous people. But also, “every wall-eyed uncle and ‘yard cousin’ — just referencing the local pejorative — makes it into Tupelo, Miss. It creates a peculiar culture.”

Tupelo is best known as the hometown of Elvis Presley, after whom it has named streets, waterways and dry cleaners.

Unlike many other Southern towns its size, it boasts several excellent museums, street art and a large public arena. An arena large enough, in fact, to attract the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus this month. That’s when someone shot Carol, a circus elephant, in what seems to be the first elephantine drive-by ever. Carol is recovering, but Tupelo Police Capt. Rusty Haynes said his investigation has stalled. “Because, to be honest, there are a lot of possible perpetrators.”

So people in the area were bemused more than surprised when the FBI, Secret Service and other agencies showed up looking for the soul who had sent letters laced with ricin to President Obama, Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) and retired Mississippi judge Sadie Holland.

The agents quickly nabbed an odd character in nearby Corinth named Paul Kevin Curtis. He worked as an Elvis impersonator, spun wild conspiracies about the local hospital selling body parts and apparently signed the poisoned letters with his own initials.

But the FBI found no evidence of ricin in Curtis’ home. No incriminating research on his computer. They decided he hadn’t sent the letters after all and released him Tuesday. Within hours agents had raided the home of his archenemy: J. Everett Dutschke, karate instructor.

Curtis claimed Dutschke wanted to frame him. It wouldn’t be the first skirmish between Tupelo’s most famous son and a karate man. In 1973, several men climbed on stage during a concert by the actual Elvis. Elvis felt threatened and fought the men, alongside his bodyguards. He felt sure the men had been sent by estranged wife Priscilla’s new boyfriend, his own personal nemesis: Mike Stone, karate instructor.

Curtis, 45, and Dutschke, 41, seem locked in an elaborate piece of tribute performance art. Their lives have entwined for years, feuding over small-town grievances as labyrinthine and intricate as any global conspiracy. They met in 2005, and were friendly for a time. When he wasn’t teaching karate, Dutschke worked for Curtis’ brother Jack at an insurance office. Both men knew Sen. Wicker, and both had connections to the 80-year-old Judge Holland.

Advertisement

It’s unclear at what moment the hostilities began, but a few years ago Curtis, who worked at the local hospital, developed a theory that doctors were harvesting organs to sell on the black market. He wrote a book about it called “Missing Pieces.” Dutschke published a local newsletter at the time, and after some negotiations apparently rejected Curtis’ writings.

There was the question, too, of who had the bigger intellect. Dutschke was a member of Mensa, the club for people with high IQs. A few years ago, Curtis posted a fake Mensa certificate on his Facebook page, which sent Dutschke into a rage. “I threatened to sue him for fraud for posting a Mensa certificate that is a lie,” Dutschke told Tupelo’s newspaper, the Daily Journal. “That certificate is a lie.”

Advertisement

“Aw, yeah. I don’t know why Kevin did that,” Curtis’ father, Jack, said recently in Cleveland, Miss. “These boys were just after each other.”

Both men have made multiple trips to jail. Curtis was arrested for, among other things, assaulting a Tupelo lawyer — for which he received a six-month sentence from Judge Holland. In January, Tupelo authorities charged Dutschke with molesting children. He pleaded not guilty, but he shut down his karate school, called Tupelo Taekwondo Plus, while awaiting trial.

Advertisement

After the FBI released Curtis, the two enemies’ paths diverged. Curtis headed for New York. “Can you believe that?” Jack Curtis said. “Now he’s got publishers all trying to jump the gun on each other to publish his book first. Isn’t that something?”

Dutschke, meanwhile, watched federal agents in protective masks search his home, his karate studio and his van.

Advertisement

On Wednesday, Dutschke slipped from sight, traveling with his friend Kirk Kitchens to a remote house in neighboring Itawamba County.

They entered the house and turned on the television, then slipped out the back door and down a wooded path, where they met a waiting car, Kitchens later told a Memphis television station.

Advertisement

Itawamba County Sheriff Chris Dickinson said Dutschke had escaped surveillance.

But the next evening, Dutschke pulled into the driveway at his house and stepped from his minivan like a man returning from routine errands.

Advertisement

On Saturday the U.S. attorney charged him with “knowingly developing, producing” and stockpiling ricin. If convicted he faces maximum penalties of life imprisonment and a $250,000 fine.

Hours before his arrest, Dutschke answered his door by opening it just enough to look out with one dark eye. He held a kitten, which also looked outside. “I’m sorry, I just...,” he started. His voice was soft. “I can’t talk. I’m so, so sorry.”

Could he say, at least, what started this mess?

“Just look around you,” he said. “This place is crazy.”

In an interview released Sunday with The New Republic's Franklin Foer and Chris Hughes, Obama labeled media as one of the ""biggest factors"" in upcoming conversations, scripting his ideal for how the relationship between the two forces should change.

""If a Republican member of Congress is not punished on Fox News or by Rush Limbaugh for working with a Democrat on a bill of common interest, then you'll see more of them doing it,"" Obama said.

Most recently, Limbaugh had a flair for the divisive during the fiscal cliff talks, encouraging members of the GOP to refrain from negotiating with the president.

""I would suggest to people who really believe Obama is concerned about his second term and his legacy -- he doesn't want a recession -- the only way to flush that out is to come dangerously close to allowing it all to happen,"" said Limbaugh in late November.

Obama linked that point to John Boehner in the TNR interview, adding that he thought the House Speaker ""genuinely wanted to get a deal done,"" but was impacted by vulnerability to attacks from more conservative streams of the Republican Party.

Boehner barely retained his House Speaker role, leaving the holiday talks in an embattled state after many members of his caucus were displeased with the terms of the agreement.

While the president specifically named some names of the right-wing contingency, he added that the left is far from immune to the ""same dynamic."" Yet those networks in his estimation, and Democrats alike, are less obstinate to some give and take.

""I think the difference is just that the more left-leaning media outlets recognize that compromise is not a dirty word,"" he said. ""And I think at least leaders like myself—and I include Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi in this -- are willing to buck the more absolutist-wing elements in our party to try to get stuff done.""

“According to what has been publicly reported about the Gang of Eight’s forthcoming immigration bill, there appears to be a major flaw that could allow millions of illegal immigrants to access federal welfare benefits and poverty programs,” the GOP Budget Committee staff wrote in a statement to media.

“Specifically, there is nothing in the framework to apply federal public charge law to those in the country illegally before they are granted legal status. What this means is that the bill would create an end-run around federal law: individuals in the country illegally could receive legal status without having to demonstrate financial self-sufficiency.”

The statement adds that the Senators in the Gang of Eight “have suggested that cost will not be an issue because amnestied illegal immigrants will not be eligible for certain public aid and welfare programs during a temporary period of probationary legal status (although even this is in growing doubt given the outcome of the relevant vote during the recent consideration of the Senate budget).”

“But, crucially, once this status ends and they become eligible for green cards, those who illegally immigrated will have access to a wide array of public assistance programs,” they wrote.

“Green card holders are currently eligible for Medicaid, TANF, Supplemental Security Income, child care assistance, food stamps, and a variety of other welfare benefits and public aid programs. The Budget Committee Republican staff estimates that costs could be upwards of $40 billion in 2022 alone, just for Medicaid and Obamacare. The long-term unfunded liability for Obamacare would grow another $2 trillion.”

The statement notes that existing federal law is being overlooked in the rush to pass comprehensive immigration reform: “The net costs would be enormous and only increase once citizenship is granted (and would extend to our nation’s retirement programs as well). Additionally, during their probationary status, there are still a number of ways previously illegal immigrants could draw means-tested public aid for their households–which is the reason why federal law deems all immigrants likely to be a public charge inadmissible to the country regardless of whether they are applying for temporary, permanent, or any other form of legal status.”

Read the whole statement here.

Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio’s spokesman Alex Conant responded to that analysis by saying: “Since we don’t yet have a legislative proposal, it’s not possible to come up with anything resembling an accurate calculation about the potential fiscal impact of bipartisan immigration reform. Obviously we share concerns about the potential fiscal impact of changes to our immigration system, which is why we will ask for an in-depth CBO analysis to inform debate around the bipartisan proposal. Senator Rubio has been clear that he will only support legislation that prohibits undocumented immigrants from receiving any Federal benefits, and in our negotiations, the Democrats have gone along with that demand – even agreeing to a partial repeal of Obamacare to bar undocumented immigrants benefits. In the long-term, there’s no question that modernizing our broken legal immigration will be very good for our nation’s economy.”"
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/21/us/marijuana-crops-in-california-threaten-forests-and-wildlife.html,2013-06-21 00:00:00,['Felicity Barringer'],Marijuana Crops in California Threaten Forests and Wildlife,"ARCATA, Calif. — It took the death of a small, rare member of the weasel family to focus the attention of Northern California’s marijuana growers on the impact that their huge and expanding activities were having on the environment.

The animal, a Pacific fisher, had been poisoned by an anticoagulant in rat poisons like d-Con. Since then, six other poisoned fishers have been found. Two endangered spotted owls tested positive. Mourad W. Gabriel, a scientist at the University of California, Davis, concluded that the contamination began when marijuana growers in deep forests spread d-Con to protect their plants from wood rats.

That news has helped growers acknowledge, reluctantly, what their antagonists in law enforcement have long maintained: like industrial logging before it, the booming business of marijuana is a threat to forests whose looming dark redwoods preside over vibrant ecosystems.

Hilltops have been leveled to make room for the crop. Bulldozers start landslides on erosion-prone mountainsides. Road and dam construction clogs some streams with dislodged soil. Others are bled dry by diversions. Little water is left for salmon whose populations have been decimated by logging."

Now I bring this up because there is a phenomenon happening lately that's really bugging me, and it's the resurgence of the smart stupid person. Now the smart stupid person is not new; Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was a smart stupid person. He was a surgeon, and he created Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. So he was not only smart, he was way ahead of his time on gay marriage. But he also believed in fairies. The other kind. (shakes head at Dan Savage)

Dr. William Mackenzie King was a smart stupid person, and he was the prime minister of Canada for 22 years, and held 5 degrees. And he believed he could speak to the spirits of his two dead Irish terriers, which is why Canada was always declaring war on squirrels.

Which brings me back to the Proof of Heaven book and its author, Dr. Eben Alexander, and the question of how a neurosurgeon, of all people, could say he made a day trip to heaven while in a coma, when his scientific training, not to mention every other scientist in the world, is telling him, no dude, you were just tripping. Those coma drugs are some good shit! Well, that's the scientific explanation.

(abrupt playing of closing music for the show)

You heard that, right? I didn't just.... (wild audience laughter and applause)

For a minute, I thought I was tripping.

CONNIE MACK: It came from heaven.

That's right, that was God, right.

Here's what Dr. Alexander said. He said:



DR. EBEN ALEXANDER: I was a speck on a beautiful butterfly wing; millions of other butterflies around us. We were flying through... indescribable colors... arcs of silver and gold light.

And yet, somehow Dr. Alexander isn't even the only brilliant brain surgeon who's also a drooling idiot. Dr. Ben Carson is the director of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins, and the first doctor to separate conjoined twins at the head. And he believes the earth is 6,000 years old. And that homosexuality is akin to bestiality. And the Bible calls for a flat tax. (audience laughter) He's half brilliant brain surgeon, half Tea Party dumbass. He doesn't just operate on conjoined twins, he is one.

He's also someone who many Republicans are encouraging to run for President in 2016. And why not? There's no more attractive figure in the Republican Party these days than an anti-intellectual with an advanced degree. People like Antonin Scalia, Ted Cruz, and Bobby Jindal, who are accomplished scholars on the outside, and on the inside, a creamy layer of Michele Bachmann. (wild audience laughter and applause)

And what's with all the know-nothing doctors? People like Scott DesJarlais, and Paul Broun, and Tom Coburn, and their subspeciality — OBGYNs who know nothing about reproduction! Like Congressman/OBGYN Ron Paul, who said abortion leads to euthanasia. Or Congressman/OBGYN Michael Burgess, the guy who just last month said fetuses masturbate in the womb. Wearing tiny raincoats. (audience laughter) Or Congressman/OBGYN Phil Gingrey, who when Todd Akin introduced America to the concept of ""legitimate rape"" — Remember that? When a woman is assaulted by a licensed, bonded, and fully insured rapist — backed him up and said aww, all that adrenaline can cause you not to ovulate. Well, forget for a moment that's wholly untrue, let's ask the more important question: Why are we electing so many gynecologists to Congress? (audience applause)

If having your head between a woman's legs is a qualification for public office, then why not Congressman Michael Douglas?"

Circuit guts president's recess appointment power,"The Constitution’s overall appointments structure provides additional confirmation of the intersession interpretation. The Framers emphasized that the recess appointment power served only as a stopgap for times when the Senate was unable to provide advice and consent. Hamilton wrote in Federalist No. 67 that advice and consent “declares the general mode of appointing officers of the United States,” while the Recess Appointments Clause serves as “nothing more than a supplement to the other for the purpose of establishing an auxiliary method of appointment, in cases to which the general method was inadequate.” The “general mode” of participation of the Senate through advice and consent served an important function: “It would be an excellent check upon a spirit of favoritism in the President, and would tend greatly to prevent the appointment of unfit characters from State prejudice, from family connection, from personal attachment, or from a view to popularity.” The Federalist No. 76. Nonetheless, the Framers recognized that they needed some temporary method for appointment when the Senate was in the recess. At the time of the Constitution, intersession recesses were regularly six to nine months, and senators did not have the luxury of catching the next flight to Washington. To avoid government paralysis in those long periods when senators were unable to provide advice and consent, the Framers established the “auxiliary” method of recess appointments. But they put strict limits on this method, requiring that the relevant vacancies happen during “the Recess.” It would have made little sense to extend this “auxiliary” method to any intrasession break, for the “auxiliary” ability to make recess appointments could easily swallow the “general” route of advice and consent. The President could simply wait until the Senate took an intrasession break to make appointments, and thus “advice and consent” would hardly restrain his appointment choices at all. To adopt the Board’s proffered intrasession interpretation of “the Recess” would wholly defeat the purpose of the Framers in the careful separation of powers structure reflected in the Appointments Clause.

A third alternative interpretation of “the Recess” is that it means any adjournment of more than three days pursuant to the Adjournments Clause. See U.S. Const. art. I, § 5, cl. 4 (“Neither House, during the Session of Congress, shall, without the Consent of the other, adjourn for more than three days . . . .”). This interpretation lacks any constitutional basis. The Framers did not use the word “adjournment” in the Recess Appointments Clause. Instead, they used “the Recess.” The Adjournments Clause and the Recess Appointments Clause exist in different contexts and contain no hint that they should be read together. Nothing in the text of either Clause, the Constitution’s structure, or its history suggests a link between the Clauses. Without any evidence indicating that the two Clauses are related, we cannot read one as governing the other. We will not do violence to the Constitution by ignoring the Framers’ choice of words.

The fourth and final possible interpretation of “the Recess,” advocated by the Office of Legal Counsel, is a variation of the functional interpretation in which the President has discretion to determine that the Senate is in recess. See 2012 OLC Memo, supra, at 23 (“[T]he President therefore has discretion to conclude that the Senate is unavailable to perform its advise-and-consent function and to exercise his power to make recess appointments.”). This will not do. Allowing the President to define the scope of his own appointments power would eviscerate the Constitution’s separation of powers. The checks and balances that the Constitution places on each branch of government serve as “self-executing safeguard[s] against the encroachment or aggrandizement of one branch at the expense of the other.” An interpretation of “the Recess” that permits the President to decide when the Senate is in recess would demolish the checks and balances inherent in the advice-and-consent requirement, giving the President free rein to appoint his desired nominees at any time he pleases, whether that time be a weekend, lunch, or even when the Senate is in session and he is merely displeased with its inaction. This cannot be the law. The intersession interpretation of “the Recess” is the only one faithful to the Constitution’s text, structure, and history.

The dearth of intrasession appointments in the years and decades following the ratification of the Constitution speaks far more impressively than the history of recent presidential exercise of a supposed power to make such appointments. Recent Presidents are doing no more than interpreting the Constitution. While we recognize that all branches of government must of necessity exercise their understanding of the Constitution in order to perform their duties faithfully thereto, ultimately it is our role to discern the authoritative meaning of the supreme law. As Chief Justice Marshall made clear in Marbury v. Madison, “[i]t is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is. Those who apply the rule to particular cases, must of necessity expound and interpret that rule. If two laws conflict with each other, the courts must decide on the operation of each.” In Marbury, the Supreme Court established that if the legislative branch has acted in contravention of the Constitution, it is the courts that make that determination. In Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, the Supreme Court made clear that the courts must make the same determination if the executive has acted contrary to the Constitution. That is the case here, and we must strike down the unconstitutional act.

It would have made little sense to make the primary method of appointment the cumbersome advice and consent procedure contemplated by that Clause if the secondary method would permit the President to fill up all vacancies regardless of when the vacancy arose. A President at odds with the Senate over nominations would never have to submit his nominees for confirmation. He could simply wait for a “recess” (however defined) and then fill up all vacancies.

Our sister circuits and the Board contend that the “arise” interpretation fosters inefficiencies and leaves open the possibility of just what is occurring here — that is, a Board that cannot act for want for a quorum. The Board also suggests more dire consequences, arguing that failure to accept the “exist” interpretation will leave the President unable to fulfill his chief constitutional obligation to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,” U.S. Const. art. II, § 3, and even suggests that the interpretation we adopt today could pose national security risks. But if Congress wished to alleviate such problems, it could certainly create Board members whose service extended until the qualification of a successor, or provide for action by less than the current quorum, or deal with any inefficiencies in some other fashion. And our suggestion that Congress can address this issue is no mere hypothesis. The two branches have repeatedly, and thoroughly, addressed the problems of vacancies in the executive branch. Congress has provided for the temporary filling of a vacancy in a particular executive office by an “acting” officer authorized to perform all of the duties and exercise all of the powers of that office.... Admittedly, Congress has chosen not to provide for acting NLRB members. But that choice cannot support the Board’s interpretation of the Clause. We cannot accept an interpretation of the Constitution completely divorced from its original meaning in order to resolve exigencies created by — and equally remediable by — the executive and legislative branches. And as the Supreme Court expressly noted in New Process Steel, in the context of the Board, “[i]f Congress wishes to allow the Board to decide cases with only two members, it can easily do so.”

Part of the D.C. Circuit's problem with the NLRB's appointments, wrote Judge Sentelle, is that if the recess isn't only intrasession recesses, then there's no firm definition as to what it is. It's not just when Congress is closed while everyone's out eating lunch, and the Court was unwilling to declare an arbitrary length like 10 or 20 days to be a ""recess,"" nor would it count an adjournment as a recess:Importantly, they did not accept DOJ's argument that the recess is whenever the president says it is, with the political process able to police excess uses of the power:And, finally, the lack of presidential precedent weighs against this ""new"" power here:The panel further held that a vacancy does not ""happen"" during a recess unless it's created then, and not merely because it existed prior to the recess:Finally, the Court doesn't much care about an agency that can't act without a quorum: blame Congress and let them fix it, they write:This is a bad, bad day for the president, especially given the Senate's unwillingness to make major reform on getting such nominees confirmed.

As a general question of presidential power ... your mileage may vary. Do read that 2012 OLC Memo, and see how you feel about such powers being used when the parties are reversed."

That requires understanding the strategic thinking that led to the shutdown in the first place … acknowledging the legitimate sense of political disappointment that underlies the right’s inclination toward intransigence … and most importantly, recognizing that relative to the G.O.P. establishment (such as it is), today’s right-wing populists often have better political instincts and better policy ideas.

But with tonight’s vote done and the government open once again, I want to return to the theme of my Sunday column, and stress once more the essential absurdity of the specific populist gambit we’ve just witnessed unfold, drag on, and now finally collapse. However you slice and dice the history, the strategery, and the underlying issues, the decision to live with a government shutdown for an extended period of time — inflicting modest-but-real harm on the economy, needlessly disrupting the lives and paychecks of many thousands of hardworking people, and further tarnishing the Republican Party’s already not-exactly-shiny image — in pursuit of obviously, obviously unattainable goals was not a normal political blunder by a normally-functioning political party. It was an irresponsible, dysfunctional and deeply pointless act, carried out by a party that on the evidence of the last few weeks shouldn’t be trusted with the management of a banana stand, let alone the House of Representatives.

This means that the still-ongoing intra-conservative debate over the shutdown’s wisdom is not, I’m sorry, the kind of case where reasonable people can differ on the merits and have good-faith arguments and ultimately agree to disagree. There was no argument for the shutdown itself that a person unblindered by political fantasies should be obliged to respect, no plausible alternative world in which it could have led to any outcome besides self-inflicted political damage followed by legislative defeat, and no epitaph that should be written for its instigators’ planning and execution except: “These guys deserved to lose.”

And it’s important for conservatives and Republicans to recognize this, and remember it, because what just happened can happen again, and next time the consequences may be more severe. The mentality that drove the shutdown — a toxic combination of tactical irrationality and the elevation of that irrationality into a True Conservative (TM) litmus test — may have less influence in next year’s Beltway negotiations than it did this time around, thanks to the way this has ended for the defunders after John Boehner gave them pretty much all the rope that they’d been asking for. But just turn on talk radio or browse RedState or look at Ted Cruz’s approval ratings with Tea Partiers and you’ll see how potent this mentality remains, how quickly it could resurface, and how easily Republican politics and American governance alike could be warped by it in the future.

So for undeluded conservatives of all persuasions, lessons must be learned. If the party’s populists want to shape and redefine and ultimately remake the party, they can’t pull this kind of stunt again. If the party’s leadership wants to actually lead, whether within the G.O.P. or in the country at large, they can’t let this kind of stunt be pulled again. That’s the only way in which this pointless-seeming exercise could turn out to have some sort of point: If it’s long remembered, by its proponents and their enablers alike, as the utter folly that it was."

As expected, photographer Annie Leibovitz shot Michelle, who wore a blue and purple Reed Krakoff sheath plucked straight from her very own closet. The green background, the cool color palette and the choice to wear Reed Krakoff definitely reminded us of FLOTUS' official portrait.

A third shot of Michelle wearing an elegant Michael Kors ball skirt and sweater. To accompany the shoot, the first couple was interviewed by Jonathan Van Meter, discussing parenting, marriage and their duties while presiding in the White House. Of course, since this is Vogue, they also talked fashion.

“If you’re comfortable in your clothes it’s easy to connect with people and make them feel comfortable as well,” Michelle said.

FLOTUS certainly looks comfortable on her new Vogue cover, which includes her three second term signatures: bangs, Reed Krakoff, and, of course, her amazingly toned arms. Last time she covered the style bible, Michelle's designer of choice was Jason Wu -- with another Reed Krakoff pick this time around, it's clear we've entered a new era of FLOTUS fashion.

The first time Barack Obama filled out an NCAA tournament bracket as president, he ended up picking the eventual national champion. He's hoping to have the same luck with the first try of his second term, as ESPN released the president's 2013 Final Four picks.

The commander-in-chief likes Louisville, Indiana, Ohio State and Florida to make it to Atlanta, with Baylor, Connecticut, Notre Dame and California advancing in the women's bracket.

Obama revealed his entire men's bracket Wednesday morning on Sportscenter, picking Louisville and Indiana to advance to the men's national title game, with Indiana winning the whole thing. The president picked a few potential upsets in the second round, taking two 11 seeds over sixes, with Belmont defeating Arizona and Minnesota beating UCLA.

He likely hopes to improve on his performance last year, when he picked North Carolina to beat Kentucky, with Missouri and Ohio State rounding out his Final Four. Missouri's opening round loss to Norfolk State ended up ruining that prospect, while North Carolina lost to eventual runner-up Kansas in the Elite 8.

In 2010 and 2011, Obama picked Kansas to win the title, with the Jayhawks suffering early losses in both tournaments. He certainly proved his proficiency in the early rounds in 2011 though, nailing 29 of the first 32 games to rank 492nd out of 5.9 million brackets heading into the Sweet 16 that year.

The president correctly picked North Carolina to win the title in 2009, the only one of his Final Four teams to advance that year.

Kirsten Gillibrand expressed confidence Sunday about getting enough votes this week to change how the military deals with victims of rape and other violent crimes -- a proposal that has sharply divided Washington.

The New York Democrat is leading the effort to give armed-services victims lawyers outside the military’s chain of command, as a way to prosecuting their attackers.

“I think we'll get” the votes, Gillibrand said on ABC’s “This Week.” “We want to make sure that the men and women who serve our military have a justice system deserving of their sacrifices. They are literally giving their lives for our values, for our country. They shouldn't have a justice system that is rife with bias and unfairness.”

Gillibrand’s plan is facing a strong, united opposition from the Pentagon's top echelon and its allies in Congress. However, she made clear Sunday that she wouldn’t soften the legislation by excluding cases of murder and theft to garner more votes.

“We're going to stick to the original plan because it's a better bill,” she told ABC.

Some of the strongest Capitol Hill opposition comes from two female senators who are former prosecutors.

They insist that commanders, not an outside military lawyer, must be accountable for meting out justice.

Even so, major changes are coming for a decades-old military system just a few months after several high-profile cases infuriated Republicans and Democrats in a rapid chain of events by Washington standards.

The Senate this week is set to consider an annual defense policy bill that would strip commanders of their ability to overturn jury convictions, require dishonorable discharge or dismissal for any individual convicted of sexual assault and establish a civilian review when a decision is made not to prosecute a case.

The bill would provide a special counsel for victims and eliminate the statute of limitations.

The changes are backed by members of the Senate Armed Services Committee. But overshadowing the revisions is the testy, intense fight over Gillibrand's proposal to strip commanders of their authority to prosecute cases of sexual assault.

Her solution has divided the Senate, splitting Republicans and Democrats, men and women, even former attorneys general, into unusual coalitions. The lobbying has been fierce, with dueling data, testimonials and news conferences with victims. Opponents invited Marine Corps Brig. Gen. Loretta Reynolds to the closed-door Republican caucus last week.

Among Gillibrand's 47 announced supporters are conservative Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Rand Paul, R-Ky., along with 16 of the Senate's 20 women.

Standing against the plan is the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich.; the panel's military veterans John McCain, R-Ariz., and Jack Reed, D-R.I., and three of the committee's women -- Sens. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., and Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., both former prosecutors, and Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb.

Gillibrand says she privately has received backing from more than 50 senators, but support remains short of the filibuster-proof 60 votes that likely will be needed for her amendment to the defense bill.

McCaskill said the Pentagon already has already taken sufficient correct action, pointing to the Defense Department saying reports of sexual assaults in the military increased by 46 percent during the last budget year.

There were 3,553 sexual assault complaints from October 2012 to June, compared with 2,434 reports during the same period the previous year, which Defense Department officials suggest shows people are more confident about coming forward now that improvements are being made in handling assaults.

Gillibrand instead points to the Pentagon’s estimate of 26,000 possibly being sexually assaulted last year, based on an anonymous survey.

Thousands of victims were unwilling to come forward despite new oversight and assistance programs aimed at curbing the crimes, according to the Pentagon report earlier this year.

""They didn't trust the chain of command, Gillibrand said recently. “They didn't think anything would be done in their cases. … The second reason they didn't report was because they feared or had witnessed retaliation. ... The command climate failed those victims.""

Gen. Ray Odierno, chief of staff of the Army, said last week that adopting her plan would be a ""big mistake"" and that it would cost an estimated $113 million a year, including salaries for about 600 attorneys and support staff.

That financial assessment doesn't take into account the expense of training members of the military, medical and mental health benefits for victims, loss of productivity and possible separation from service for a Pentagon with a fiscal year budget of more than $500 billion.

McCaskill, Ayotte and Fisher have compiled additional changes that the Senate is expected to approve. They include barring defendants from using the good military character defense, allowing sexual assault victims to challenge a discharge or separation from the service, and extending the new protections to the military service academies.

""The reason this issue is so hard is because on one side is a very simple narrative, this is victim versus commanders and you should be for the victims,"" McCaskill said.

""On the other side, it's much more complex, and I'm guided by practical experience handling these cases and a pretty intimate knowledge of the Uniform Code of Military Justice and how it actually works ... and making sure we have a system that's constitutional, that works and that holds commanders accountable.""

That began to change in 1987, when the late Michael Kelly brought Iran-Contra “it girl” Fawn Hall as his guest; the next year it was Gary Hart scandal lady Donna Rice.

“We are making progress but we’ve got to finish the job,” Obama said at a naturalization ceremony for 28 citizens at the White House on Monday. “This issue is not new. Everyone pretty much knows what’s broken. Everybody knows how to fix it. We’ve all proposed solutions and we got a lot of white papers and studies. And we just got at this point to work up the political courage to do what’s required to be done.”

Obama’s remarks were aimed at a bipartisan group of senators who have been working on a proposal for nearly three months. The so-called “gang of eight” had hoped to complete their work Friday, before a two-week congressional recess, but left town for spring break without a deal.

U.S. immigration law: Decades of debate

In January, Obama threatened to send his own bill to Congress if the group did not produce a proposal “in a timely fashion.” His remarks Monday suggest the White House is willing to give the group more time to work before it takes that step.

“I expect the debate to begin next month. I want to sign that bill into law as soon as possible,” he said. “We know that real reform means continuing to strengthen our border security and holding employers accountable. … Let’s get this done.”

Obama’s time frame may be tough for senators to reach. U.S. Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), chairman of the judiciary committee, already has cast doubt on the chances of getting a bill through his committee by the end of April. Even if the bill comes to the floor next month a vote would not necessarily follow quickly. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) has said he plans to let senators debate the legislation at length, and there remains no clear path for the bill through the Republican-led House.

The senators remain deadlocked over several issues, including the details of a guest-worker program and how the legislation will implement and define security at the border.

Obama has largely steered clear of the talks, instead offering broad elements he wants to see included. The president on Monday used the platform to revive his call for a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, the key requirement for any bill.

Obama spoke after Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano administered the oath to 28 new citizens, including 13 members of the military. Obama praised the group as a reminder of the “promise of America.”

“Immigration makes us stronger. It keeps us vibrant. It keeps us hungry. It keeps us prosperous. It is part of what makes this such a dynamic country,” he said.

According to one witness%2C the crowd %27went wild%27 over the clown

Missouri%27s Lt. Gov. Peter Kinder denounced the performance

Missouri Rodeo Cowboys Association didn%27t return calls seeking comment

KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — A clown wearing a President Obama mask appeared at a Missouri State Fair rodeo this weekend and the announcer asked the enthusiastic spectators if they wanted to see ""Obama run down by a bull.""

The antics led the state's second highest-ranking official, Lt. Gov. Peter Kinder, to denounce the performance in a tweet Sunday. He said it was ""disrespectful"" to the president.

""We are better than this,"" the Republican tweeted.

State Fair officials said the show was ""inappropriate"" and ""does not reflect the opinions or standards"" of the fair. ""We strive to be a family friendly event and regret that Saturday's rodeo badly missed that mark,"" they said in a statement Sunday.

It wasn't clear if any action will be taken against the performers.

Perry Beam was among the spectators Saturday in Sedalia. He said ""everybody screamed"" and ""just went wild"" as the announcer talked about having the bull run down the clown with the Obama mask.

""It was at that point I began to feel a sense of fear. It was that level of enthusiasm,"" Beam, a 48-year-old musician from Higginsville, said Sunday, referring to the reaction from the crowd that filled the fair's grandstand.

He said another clown ran up to the one wearing the Obama mask, pretended to tickle him and played with the lips on the mask. After about 15 minutes into the performance, the masked clown had to leave after a bull got too close, Beam said.

Beam was at the rodeo with his wife and a student they were hosting from Taiwan. He said they were having a good time until the end of the rodeo.

""It was the usual until the very end at bull riding,"" he said. ""As they were bringing the bulls into the chute and prepping them ... they bring out what looks like a dummy. The announcer says 'Here's our Obama dummy, or our dummy of Obama.

""They mentioned the president's name, I don't know, 100 times. It was sickening,"" Beam said. ""It was feeling like some kind of Klan rally you'd see on TV.""

Officials with the Missouri Rodeo Cowboy Association, the organization that coordinated the rodeo, did not return phone calls seeking comment Sunday.

After Beam and his family returned home, he posted a photo of the clown in the Obama mask on his Facebook page. The photo and the posting were then promoted online by a blog, Showmeprogress.com, which elicited a huge response Sunday on Twitter.

Scott Holste, spokesman for Missouri's Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon, said Sunday in an e-mail that Nixon ""agrees that the performance was disrespectful and offensive, and does not reflect the values of Missourians or the State Fair.""

Beam, who grew up attending the State Fair and attends the fair just about every year, said he has never seen anything like the Obama mask display, which he felt was inappropriate for a state-sanctioned event that receives state funding.

""This isn't the Republican Missouri State Fair,"" Beam said. ""It was cruel. It was disturbing. I'm still sick to my stomach over it. ... I'm standing here with a mixed-race family. My wife's from Taiwan, and so was the student (his family was hosting). I've never seen anything so blatantly racist in my life.

""If an old country boy picks up on something like that, imagine what a person of color would think."""

Washington (CNN) – Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Maryland, has been a member of Congress for almost two decades.

Yet when he is walking down the street in Washington, D.C., at night and white women walk toward him, he says ""I cross the street"" to avoid making them uncomfortable.



Cummings says he rarely speaks about race or what life is like as a black man, but says President Barack Obama's heartfelt remarks Friday afternoon made him more comfortable to do so.

""I think it's important that he speak out and he brings a very unique perspective, because is the president and he has been extremely fortunate compared to most African-Americans, and yet still he can speak to the prejudices that most of us still face,"" Cummings told CNN in a telephone interview.

Cummings lives in what calls the ""inner city"" of Baltimore, Maryland.

For emphasis, he says ""when I say inner, I mean inner.""

The 10 term congressman says he loves to go shopping with his wife, because he likes to watch her try on dresses. But he won't do it outside his district where people know him because ""I don't like the idea of people following me around.”

""People usually have the security guard following me, or questions with the overabundant, 'can I help you?' They think you're going to do something wrong. We've seen it over and over again since childhood,"" said Cummings.

He joked that it's a bit better recently since, as the ranking member of the GOP-led House Oversight Committee, which is investigating IRS misconduct, Benghazi and more, he is on T.V. often and is recognized outside his district.

Still, he too talked about ""feeling the tension"" when he is in the elevator with a white woman.

""The tension... it’s hard to describe,"" he said.

Some African-American leaders and activists have expressed frustration with Obama for not using his position to stir a national discussion about race. Cummings was not one of those people.

""It's not that simple. People go crazy,"" said Cummings.

""I see the way this country reacts to the littlest thing he says about race,"" he said.

Plus, Cummings believes that before Obama was elected to his second and final term, it would have been ""counterproductive to talk about these things because everything was in the prism of politics.""

""Now that he has the freedom to not worry about re-election, I think he has a better opportunity,"" said Cummings.

A day earlier, Cummings' race played out in an awkward moment during a tension-filled IRS hearing.

When admonishing Cummings, Rep. Darrell Issa, the Republican Oversight Committee chairman, referred to Cummings as ""a little boy whose hand’s caught in the cookie jar.""

Later, Issa apologized to his African-American colleague for using the term “boy.”

""That is something I grew up with, it is intended to be about a small child, and in no way the use of boy or little boy to be anything else,"" Issa said.

Cummings thanked Issa, saying he appreciated his words."

Senator Rand Paul may have staged a Senate-shaking filibuster Wednesday, but his was actually only the second most significant Republican filibuster of the day.

On the Hill Inside Congressional politics.

In a vote just before Mr. Paul, the junior senator from Kentucky, tried to blockade the nomination of John Brennan as director of central intelligence over drone policy, the Senate failed to end debate on the nomination of Caitlin J. Halligan of New York to a seat on the federal appeals court for the District of Columbia.

The filibuster of Ms. Halligan didn’t blow up on Twitter the way Mr. Paul’s impressive 12-hour stand did. But of the two, it was the one that could renew a feud over rules governing filibusters and how the Senate handles high-level judicial nominations — an issue that has torn the chamber for years.

Democrats are already in discussions on how to respond to the Halligan filibuster. They believe Republicans are dead set against confirming qualified Obama administration nominees to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. They accuse Republicans of exaggerating their objections to Ms. Halligan to justify a filibuster under a 2005 agreement that short-circuited the last partisan showdown over filling judicial vacancies.

That deal, crafted by the famous Gang of 14, put its signatories on record as saying they would not block confirmation votes on appeals court judges without “extraordinary circumstances” as determined by each individual. While only members of the gang signed it, it became informal Senate policy and defused a crisis that had Republicans threatening to execute the “nuclear option” and bar filibusters against judicial nominees by a simple majority vote instead of with the 67 votes historically needed to change Senate rules.

It also led to President George W. Bush winning three appointments to the appeals court often considered a feeder to the Supreme Court, giving conservatives an advantage on the influential panel, which hears many federal-powers cases. It its current makeup, the court consists of four judges appointed by Republican presidents and three appointed by President Bill Clinton, with four vacancies — the most ever on that court.

In filibustering Ms. Halligan, several Republicans cited extraordinary circumstances arising from her earlier work as the solicitor general for the State of New York, particularly on a case against gun manufacturers.

“Ms. Halligan advanced the novel legal theory that gun manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers contributed to a ‘public nuisance’ of illegal handguns in the state,” said Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, accusing her of judicial activism. “Therefore, she argued, gun manufacturers should be liable for the criminal conduct of third parties.”

Democrats cried foul. The real reason she was blocked, they say, is that Republicans do not want to see the balance of power on the D.C. appeals court shifted. They say that Ms. Halligan was acting in her official capacity representing the State of New York, not as a jurist, and that Republicans have abandoned the extraordinary circumstances test engineered by the Gang of 14.

“If you go back to that history of what occurred back then, there is a real question of whether they have broken the deal now,” said Senator Tom Udall, Democrat of New Mexico. “This is a key circuit for the country. What they are doing is not allowing these consensus candidate judges to get votes.”

Mr. Udall has been among a group of relatively newer members of the Senate clamoring for significant changes in the rules governing filibusters. One demand is that senators act more like Mr. Paul, and take the floor to make their case when they are trying to block a vote. In January, working to avoid a divisive fight, Senator Harry Reid, the Nevada Democrat and majority leader, and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, struck a deal making some modest changes in filibuster rules.

But those changes have done little so far this session to curb filibusters, as evidenced by the vote on Ms. Halligan and the politically charged obstacles raised to confirmation votes on Mr. Brennan and Chuck Hagel, a former Republican senator who found himself on the receiving end of a Republican filibuster before winning confirmation as secretary of defense. The filibuster is alive and well in the Senate and, as Mr. Paul showed, may even be enjoying resurgence as grand theater.

Democrats say that despite what they see as clear provocation, they are in no hurry to change the new rules after just two months in place. They say they are more inclined to explore new ways to confront Republicans over the vacancies.

Mr. Udall says one option might be for the president to make multiple nominations, in effect daring Republicans to find ways to cite extraordinary circumstances in multiple instances.

“Rather than putting just one up, we should put before the Senate all four and expose what is happening here,” said Mr. Udall, who acknowledged that Senate Democrats would need White House cooperation.

“We need to design a strategy to counter the Republicans, and we are going to need the president,” he said.

The fight will take time to unfold. Democrats say they will wait to see how Republicans respond to future appeals court nominees. But a series of filibusters against what they view as acceptable nominees could quickly bring to a head the push for a change in Senate rules."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/07/03/Gettysburg-where-is-the-president,2013-07-03 00:00:00,['Jarrett Stepman'],Gettysburg Historian: Where Was Mainstream Media Coverage?,"Historian Allen Guelzo, author of the New York Times bestselling book Gettysburg: The Last Invasion, rhetorically asked, “Where is the president? Where is the vice president? They aren’t here,” in an interview with Stephen K. Bannon on the Breitbart News live broadcast of Commemoration of Pickett’s charge on July 3.

During the three days of Gettysburg events, President Obama has been on a tour through Africa, traveling to Senegal, Tanzania, and South Africa.

Guelzo noted that it was mostly just ordinary people who showed up to the Gettysburg memorial, not just Americans but people from around the world who wanted to pay tribute to perhaps the most significant event and moment of sacrifice in our nation’s history. He also noted that the three-day commemoration of the event, July 1-3, was not covered by any of the major networks.

“Where is the Today Show? Where is Good Morning America?” said Guelzo.

Attendees have mostly shown great reverence to the honor and sacrifice of the men who fought on both sides of the battle, according to Guelzo. Most have honored Abraham Lincoln’s dictate in the famous Gettysburg Address: “never forget what they did here.” The “they” that Lincoln referred to were the soldiers in uniform on the battlefield 150 years ago who bled and died for the cause and the country that they believed in.

Visitors endured torrential rainfall to see the battlefield as tens of thousands came to pay tribute to this special moment in American and world history.

“One thing I tell people to do is just look around them here. This is a lot of people from all over the world. They are not here like they are at a theme park or a rock concert,” said Guelzo.

Presidents have frequently commemorated the great battles in American history with orations and memorials about the sacrifice of the men involved and the meaning of “American exceptionalism.” For instance, Ronald Reagan made a tribute to the “Boys of Pointe Du Hoc” on the 40th anniversary of D-Day and the beginning of the liberation of Europe.

Guelzo spoke about why he decided to write a book about Gettysburg, even though there have been so many written accounts of it in the past. He said that besides living in Gettysburg and being in close proximity, there were many stories about the battle that have been overlooked. “There were angles of this battle that I haven’t heard told before,” Guelzo explained.

One angle of the battle that Guelzo focused on was the role politics played in the Union Army. Though all were fighting for the Union, the soldiers and generals were divided on how to carry out the war. Peace Democrats, sometimes known as “Copperheads,” believed that the war was being fought for the wrong reasons–that Lincoln and the Republican Party were to blame for the war and secession. Guelzo said that Union General George McClellan, who ran against Lincoln in the 1864 presidential election, “often said he was divided on marching on Richmond or marching on Washington.”

Host Bannon called Guelzo’s book the “definitive” work on the subject, as it details both the minutia of the battle and the politics surrounding it, and it tells an interesting, gripping story about the individuals involved.

Bannon compared the narrative to those of the famous late Civil War historian, Shelby Foote, an incredible storyteller who wrote the three-part The Civil War: A Narrative and became famous to the general public after a performance on Ken Burn’s Civil War documentary.

A compliance notice report sent to the Triumph one month before it departed Galveston on Feb. 7 for what was planned as a four-day cruise recommended spray shields be installed on engines' flexible fuel hoses, according to the documents filed Tuesday by Carnival Cruise Lines in federal court in Miami.

A leak from a hose on engine No. 6 led to a fire early on Feb. 10 as the ship returned from a stop in Cozumel, Mexico. No one was injured, but the fire disabled the ship. More than 4,000 people aboard endured a nightmarish tow to Mobile, Ala., that the plaintiffs' attorney called a ""floating hell.""

The documents, first reported by CNN, are part of a lawsuit that was filed in February against Carnival Cruise Lines and its parent Carnival Corporation on behalf of dozens of the Triumph's passengers.

Frank Spagnoletti, a Houston attorney who represents some of the passengers, said Tuesday that Carnival was negligent in maintaining the ship and allowed it to sail knowing there was a fire risk.

Neither Carnival nor its legal team returned calls after business hours Tuesday. But in a response filed that day in Miami, Carnival said the ship's engines passed inspection before departure and its own recommendation to install spray shields on flexible fuel lines was beyond any required safety measures.

It was the recognition of the problem — with a two month repair deadline — along with the decision to let the Triumph sail before it was corrected that galled Spagnoletti.

""You've got 4,000 souls on that ship. You know that there's a propensity for fire if these fuel hoses break and yet you give them two months to fix it?"" he said.

In a Nov. 22 deposition, ship captain Angelo Los said he was first notified by Carnival about problems with fuel leaks from flexible hoses in January. During the deposition, Spagnoletti showed Los the compliance notice report dated Jan. 2 that cited nine fuel leaks on Carnival Corporation's ships during a two-year period.

The compliance notice report said Carnival together with the engine manufacturer was investigating the problem and that installing spray shields would be an effective safety barrier. It described an incident on another ship outfitted with the spray shields that avoided a similar fire.

The company gave the ship until Feb. 28 to come into compliance.

Los said in November that he believed Carnival had known about the problem since March 2012. The spray guards were partially installed on Triumph, but not on engine No. 6, Los said. The hose that leaked was less than six months old.

""The spray shields for the flexible fuel hoses were an additional Carnival Corporation recommended best practice to avoid fuel fires,"" the company said in its response Tuesday, and not otherwise required by any regulation or statute.

Carnival Cruise Lines also argued the notice sent to the Triumph was only for fuel lines above the engine room floor plates. The leak occurred on a fuel hose beneath the engine room floor. However, the January notice to Triumph does not specify that or differentiate between hoses above or below the floor.

""The leak in the flexible fuel hose was a completely unexpected accident that took place,"" the company said. What ignited the fuel is unknown, it said.

Passengers described unsanitary conditions after the fire, as toilets stopped functioning and an unbearable stench drove many to camp out on the decks. The weary travelers finally disembarked in Alabama on Feb. 15.

Spagnoletti echoed many of the passengers in crediting the crew with putting out the fire and making the best of a horrible situation.

""It was unbelievable to me that you would take 4,000 people and put them in a situation of basically Russian roulette,"" Spagnoletti said. ""Basically every time that vessel went out they never knew whether they were going to have a fire or not."""

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

But there is still no sign that there is anything that can get a majority of House Republicans to sign on to a path to citizenship, even though poll after poll shows a majority of Americans support it. This is the real reason the two sides remain “far apart” on the issue. On Obamacare, the GOP’s gleeful, wholly unconstructive response to the delay in the employer mandate shows that Republican policy is still being dictated by a refusal to accept that the Affordable Care Act is the law of the land, as Jamelle Bouie has detailed. Indeed, the mandate delay is now being cited by some Republicans in the House as a reason to oppose immigration reform, because it shows Obama can’t be trusted, or something — as if there is anything that could get them to support any reform with citizenship in the first place."

Assistant Sheriff Todd Rogers said he was troubled by the department’s preliminary findings and plans on “making some swift changes.”

The reforms were prompted by a Times investigation earlier this month that found the agency hired dozens of officers from a disbanded county police force even though sheriff’s investigators had found significant misconduct in their backgrounds. Internal agency files showed that jobs were given to officers who accidentally fired their weapons, had sex at work, committed theft, solicited prostitutes or falsified records.

The department is now evaluating what to do with the problem hires.

Rogers said sheriff’s officials are considering terminating some but likely won’t be able to legally fire employees for misconduct that sheriff’s officials knew about when they hired them. What’s more realistic, he said, is moving the problem hires to less sensitive positions, giving them more training and putting them on administrative monitoring to limit future misconduct.

Rogers said that the identification of 80 officers who shouldn’t have been hired – a number that is still preliminary – was determined by comparing their background files to the department’s hiring standards. Some, he said, should have been disqualified automatically and others had problems that were less “black and white.” He said he is legally restricted from providing the names and detailed histories of the 80 officers but said the problems included significant criminal convictions, on-duty misconduct, poor job performance and financial problems.

IN-DEPTH: Behind the badge

Rogers said the fact that the department hired problem officers is so troubling because “almost everything we do is predicated on public trust.”

“People have to trust that we’re hiring the best and brightest … because of the awesome authority and responsibility our deputies have,” he said.

The records reviewed by The Times showed that for nearly 100 of the roughly 280 hires, investigators discovered evidence of dishonesty, such as making untrue statements or falsifying police records. At least 15 were caught cheating on the department’s own polygraph exams.

The officers all once worked at the county’s smaller police force, the Office of Public Safety. To save money, the county disbanded that agency about four years ago and its responsibilities -- patrolling county buildings, parks and hospitals -- were handed over to the Sheriff’s Department.

Sheriff’s officials were not required to hire any of the former county officers, officials said, but gave them the first shot at applying for the new sheriff’s jobs. The department hired about 280. The majority were taken on as sworn deputies, while others were hired as custody assistants in the department’s troubled jail system, security guards or for other lower-level positions.

One applicant had been fired from another agency amid allegations he abused inmates but was hired by Baca’s agency to work the jails. Another was forced out of the Los Angeles Police Department after lying to a supervisor. A third admitted to using her service weapon to shoot at her husband while he ran away from her.

After the Times report, the county Board of Supervisors demanded that Sheriff Lee Baca report back about the mass hiring. In a letter he sent to the board, Baca responded and acknowledged that the hiring standards were violated. He said that he had delegated the authority for making the hiring decisions to his undersheriff at the time, Larry Waldie.

“My direction was unequivocal that we were to only hire qualified candidates,” Baca says in the letter.

A sheriff’s audit found that the former undersheriff was responsible for hiring “several” officers who did not meet sheriff’s standards, but no administrative action can be taken against him since he is now retired, according to the letter.

Waldie has told The Times that he was under pressure from county officials to hire as many former county police officers as possible.

Baca’s spokesman Steve Whitmore said the sheriff “understood there are significant issues here.”

“This is how he’s responding,” Whitmore said. “He’s fixing it.”

The department is still reviewing the mass hiring but is already planning to implement reforms.

Rogers, who oversees the personnel division, said the problem appears to be Waldie’s decision-making and that the department’s investigators did their job by completing thorough background checks.

Still, Rogers said he’s met with every background investigator, as well as the investigators’ supervisors, to clarify the department’s position on hiring.

“I expect them to only hire people who meet our hiring standards, period,” he said. “We’re only going to hire the best. There’s no equivocation.”

The department is also changing the way it hires, Rogers said. Currently, the decision is made by a supervisor within the personnel division and formally finalized by an assistant sheriff. The department now plans to create a panel of lieutenants and one civilian employee to make hiring decisions, with wobblers sent to a panel of commanders.

“I believe we need to confront this head-on,” Rogers said. “That’s what we’re doing.”

By Richard Valdmanis

BOSTON, Dec 4 (Reuters) - Young Americans are unhappy with virtually every major thing President Barack Obama has done since he was re-elected, but they would still vote for him today, according to the results of a Harvard University survey released on Wednesday.

The national poll by Harvard's Institute of Politics of more than 2,000 people aged 18 through 29 is intended to provide insight into the political views of the youngest U.S. voters. This increasingly influential demographic known as the ""millennial generation"" has been a traditional base of Obama's support.

More than 50 percent of respondents in the survey, taken between Oct. 30 and Nov. 11, said they disapproved of how the Democratic president handled key issues in his second term, including Syria, Iran, the economy, healthcare and the federal budget deficit.

Most cited the economy as their top concern.

Still, disapproval ratings were higher for both Republicans and Democrats in Congress. And a plurality of respondents, 46 percent, said they would still vote for Obama for president if they could recast their 2012 ballots, compared with 35 percent who said they would vote for the then-Republican nominee, Mitt Romney.

Some 55 percent of the survey respondents who reported casting ballots in the 2012 presidential election said they had voted for Obama, compared with 33 percent for Romney.

Institute of Politics Director Trey Grayson said the poll revealed cracks forming in Obama's base.

""This isn't a problem for Obama because he's not coming up for election again,"" Grayson said in a conference call with reporters. ""But it is a potential problem for any Democratic candidate seeking to mobilize young Americans.""

The results follow a CNN/ORC poll released on Nov. 25 that showed a growing number of Americans doubted Obama's ability to manage the nation, amid ongoing problems plaguing the president's signature domestic policy achievement, the healthcare reform law known as Obamacare.

Obama's administration has also come under fire. Critics claim it is dealing poorly with the Syrian government over its alleged use of chemical weapons and Iran over its nuclear ambitions, and has failed to rein in U.S. public spending or revive the economy.

Some 57 percent of respondents in the Harvard poll said they disapproved of the Obamacare law, with 40 percent expecting the quality of healthcare to worsen and about half expecting such costs to rise.

""Among the 22 percent in our survey who report that they have no insurance, less than one-third tell us they are likely to enroll,"" according to the report detailing the survey findings. ""A plurality however are 50-50 and are therefore open to enrolling under the right circumstances.""

UNHAPPY WITH EVERYONE

The Harvard survey respondents spread out the blame for Washington's shortcomings beyond Obama and the Democratic Party. In terms of job performance, 54 percent said they disapproved of the president, 59 percent disapproved of Democrats in Congress, and a whopping 75 percent disapproved of Republicans in Congress.

Conservative U.S. Republicans took a hard line in the fight over October's U.S. government shutdown, which was waged over the party's demands to stop the launch of Obamacare. But delays in pay to some public workers, closings of national parks and reductions in public services only deepened Americans' frustration.

""Nobody was happy with anybody after the shutdown,"" Grayson said.

Asked which proposals they would prefer to see enacted to cut the federal deficit, respondents tended to favor increasing taxes for the wealthy and cutting certain types of military spending - including on the nuclear arsenal and the size of the Navy fleet.

More than 70 percent also said they would prefer not to see any cuts to education spending on kindergarten through high school, the poll showed.

In a sign of ambivalence over the role of Edward Snowden, a contractor for the National Security Agency, in unveiling details of the U.S. spying program, 52 percent of survey respondents said they were not sure if he was a traitor or a patriot.

During ABC's telecast of the president's inaugural address, anchor George Stephanopoulos confused one of our nation's greatest basketball legends with one of the country's greatest acting legends.

Panning to a shot of NBA Hall of Famer Bill Russell, who was wearing a Boston Celtics cap to make it even easier, Stephanopoulos identified the 11-time NBA champion as the five-time Oscar nominee.

""That's Morgan Freeman, I think, right there on the Capitol steps,"" Stephanopoulos said. ""No, Bill Russell, I'm sorry.""



In addition to their height discrepancy (Russell is 6-9 while Freeman is 6-2), here are several other ways the two septugenarians differ.

Bill Russell did not discover Gwyneth Paltrow's head in a box in Seven.

Bill Russell did serve as both a player and coach of the Boston Celtics for three years in the late 1960s.

Bill Russell did not drive Miss Daisy in the film based on the same subject.

Bill Russell did make twelve NBA All-Star teams.

Bill Russell did not team up with Tim Robbins in The Shawshank Redemption to create one of the most likable tandems in modern movie history.

Bill Russell did team up with Bob Cousy to win six NBA titles with the Boston Celtics."

Jim DeMint, the new president of the conservative Heritage Foundation, ripped the bipartisan “Gang of Eight” U.S. Senators who are pushing immigration reform during the debut of Breitbart News Sunday with Stephen K. Bannon on Sirius/XM Patriot on Sunday night.

“That’s not the way it should be done, where people go behind closed doors and come up with something that we still haven’t seen,” DeMint said.

They’re out there selling it. We don’t know what the legislation is but we’re supposed to have an open, democratic process where people can hear the debate, they can see amendments, they can find out what’s in the bill before it’s voted on. So, it’s very frustrating. Obviously, this isn’t the first time this has happened–on the fiscal cliff, and on all these other things they do backroom deals. But I’m tired of it. Frankly, it’s one of the reasons I left the Senate: to try to change things from the outside in. But I know some of these folks involved [in the Gang of Eight] are actually trying to solve a problem, but this is not the way to do it.

DeMint said Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) is one of those he thinks is actually trying to solve the problem of illegal immigration but is going about it the wrong way–mainly because the way Washington has evolved is antithetical to transparent and open government.

“Well this is hard because Marco is one of my best friends in the Senate and he’s a great guy, very genuine, and I know he got into this process trying to solve a problem,” DeMint said when asked for his reaction to Rubio’s whirlwind media tour this weekend, in which the Florida Republican appeared on a record seven Sunday shows.

“He’s just dealing with some folks who have a political objective and it’s very difficult,” DeMint explained. “So, I don’t blame him for trying to sell what’s in it, I’ve just encouraged him from the very beginning to make sure he knows what’s in the legislation and make sure we get what we need out of a new immigration system before we agree to make citizens out of 11 million people.”

The eight senators–Republicans Rubio, Jeff Flake, John McCain, and Lindsey Graham and Democrats Bob Menendez, Chuck Schumer, Dick Durbin, and Michael Bennet–have been meeting in secret since January trying to craft a plan for comprehensive immigration reform.

White House officials have been involved in the drafting of the legislation, as have representatives from special interest groups like the powerful AFL-CIO labor union and the big business lobby the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Representatives from groups in favor of law enforcement reform, like the president of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents’ union Chris Crane, have been kept out of the discussion, as has anyone opposed to granting amnesty to illegal aliens.

DeMint claimed that the reason those senators keep the deal-making happening in secret is because their plan cannot stand up to public scrutiny. “One of the reasons you do all this behind closed doors is because you don’t want any critics at the party,” DeMint said.

You want to bring this out and surprise people and do your pre-selling. But, Robert Rector, just about five years ago, when I was helping to fight a similar bill, provided information that was not only credible but it was very provable that there is a high cost to have amnesty. There is a high cost to have unregulated immigration and we need to go ahead. Americans are going to look at this very differently if they know it’s likely to mean they’re going to cut their Social Security and Medicare and raise their taxes which the president seems to be talking about every week.

Heritage Foundation analyst Robert Rector is in the final stages of wrapping up what is expected to be a bombshell analysis breaking down the entire cost of the Gang of Eight’s immigration reform proposal. Preliminary estimates from Rector’s and Senate Budget Committee Republican staff analyses put the Gang of Eight plan at just under $3 trillion in entitlement spending increases, but the final analysis may put the number much higher.

As the Heritage Foundation continues its work on this, the conservative hallmark has taken heat from several groups around Washington for the forthcoming report–largely because the Heritage report could very well be the poison pill that kills immigration reform.

The libertarian Cato Institute and the GOP establishment-minded Americans for Tax Reform, Grover Norquist’s group, have become unlikely allies, banding together to attack the still-unpublished Heritage analysis from Rector.

During his media tour this weekend, Rubio himself stabbed at Heritage, saying on Fox News Sunday that Rector’s forthcoming analysis was not accurate. DeMint said he trusts Rector, and added that this report coming out “shouldn’t be controversial.”

“Those who don’t think this has been done correctly should show us their analysis,” DeMint said. “The fact is, there is not any other analysis. Robert Rector has been a scholar for years. He was the one who did the data that actually ended up pushing through welfare reform back in the 1990s,” he explained. “He came out with data that was irrefutable five years ago [on immigration costs], although some are saying it needs to be combined with other types of research.”

DeMint argued that the report should be a point of open analysis of the plan: “Let’s talk about it. But let’s at least consider the cost. We hope we’ll have our report out within the next week. We’ll be writing and speaking about it a lot but Americans need to understand there’s nothing free about the proposal that’s being talked about.”

As the bill is set to be released on Tuesday, DeMint urged Americans and those in the media to “keep in mind that even if it’s in legislation that does not mean the administration will do it.”

“Over five years we passed into law that there had to be 700 miles of double layer fencing along the volatile areas of our southern border,” DeMint said. “But President Obama has ignored the law.”

There are only 30 something miles of double layer fencing that have actually been built. The law says that the federal government should support states in the enforcement of federal immigration policy, this administration has decided not to do it. So my point is this: if they promise legal status or citizenship in return for the future fixing of the immigration system, no one can count on that. That’s why this needs to be a step-by-step process where we fix the system first and earn the trust of the American people, then we consider what we’re going to do with those who are already here.

But as Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) noted in a Sunday afternoon press release, the Gang of Eight senators admitted throughout their Sunday show blitzkrieg that they want to do amnesty first, then reform the immigration system later."

by R.Crosby Lyles

Transcript:

It’s Sunday May 5th, 2013. My name is R.Crosby Lyles and this is “news from the can.”

Breaking News: Frank Porter Stansberry is at it again. In an article by the New York Times from way back in 2003 entitled “E-mail Stock Tip Tests Limits of Security Laws” Mr. Stansberry’s company Stansberry and associates investment Research apparently sent an email out to “thousands of subscribers to (his) financial newsletters”… “claiming that a certain company’s share price would double after an announcement at a summit meeting in St. Petersburg, Russia.” Twelve hundred subscribers paid about a thousand dollars apiece to learn the name of a company that processes nuclear fuel that may have seen an improvement in the price of the bomb-grade uranium it was buying from Russia to reprocess. According to the New York Times, the summit came and went and the stock price of the enrichment company rose 12% but fell well short of the performance claimed by Stansberry’s company. In 2007 Stanberry was fined $1.5 million by the SEC for fraud in connection with this email, and to date, Stansberry’s appeals have been denied.

According to Steven Nelson of the Daily caller in 2011 Stansberry had a website NewAmerica3.com that predicted dire consequences for the US economy and was basically hawking $49.50 subscriptions to his news letter. The news letter would provide ways to get rich during the economic apocalypse that Stansberry claimed was on the way. Of course Porter Stansberry has also been a guest speaker on Info-Wars with Alex Jones if that tells you anything. Remember that Alex Jones is brought to you by Genesis communication Network another purveyor of doom owned by Ted Anderson who also owns Midas Resources, Inc. a precious metals dealer. Note here, that various personalities on GCN are constantly hawking the need to invest in precious metals to hedge against an apocalyptic future. Indeed, birds of a feather, really do flock together.

Now, just the other day, while I was checking the weather on accuweather.com a thumbnail picture of President Obama with the caption, “End of Obama” stood out from the usual list of advertisements. Out of curiosity, I clicked on the thumbnail and of course I knew instantly that it was one of those endless gloom and doom monologues. You know, one of those ads with a white background that only has voice and text. Thankfully, I had the presence of mind to record it with my screen capture program. Although I don’t have sound, I do have a sped up version of the text I recorded so you can see for your self what is on it. For comparison the “End of America” video is on Youtube.

I won’t hold you in suspense, the “End of Obama” presentation is basically just a carbon copy of “The end of America” video that came out in 2011. It hits all of the right-wing economic fear mongering talking points from anti-taxation to U.S. treasury and Fed Policy, but most importantly it is hawking Gold and Silver, and some unknown fabulous investment thing that you have to pay to see. Just as a reminder one of my previous Vlogs entitled “Cults, Rackets, Jesus People, and Gold” covered the relationship between Alex Jones, Ted Anderson, Lyndon Larouche, Fear mongering, and the sales of precious metals. This latest offering from Porter Stansberry is not only a retread of a previous video in a slightly different wrapper but part of the same old scare-racket these people have been using to get your money for years. And, let me emphasize, that making money is what it is all about.

Well, that’s about it for today Sunday May 5th, 2013. My Name is R. Crosby Lyles, and this is “News from the can.”

An accelerated reprint of the ""End of Obama"" video is provided at the end of this video for proof of its controversial contents and is displayed without the original sound. It is meant to be used as a tool to skim an otherwise intractable presentation (77 minutes reduced to around 25 minutes) with questionable material interspersed throughout. ""Stansberry's End of Obama and Gold"" is not monetized and should be considered as News.

We had no idea that the ad was being aired during his show. We have made the call to Clear Channel to remove our ad immediately.""

The StopRush count for today - 2,629 Limbaugh have pulled ads

I must disclose: I am one of the many, possibly hundreds of thousands, of people protesting Limbaugh. We're everywhere - in your grocery store, at the bank, in your Facebook 'Friends' list...There are petitions, a Boycott Rush Limbaugh Facebook Group (56,500 followers), FlushRush Fight Group, a StopRush Database, a ThinkContext Limbaugh sponsor browser app, poems, lists, there's even a Daily Kos Limbaugh petition now!... it's a virtual anti-Limbaugh candy store out there. Why? The American public is done with Limbaugh's blatant racism, sexism and lgbt-hating bigotry.

Protestors are now reaching out to radio stations, the FCC and iHeart artists as well. (iHeart is owned by Clear Channel run by Bob Pittman). To be sure, Pittman is feeling the bite. Clear Channel has lost hundreds of millions since the protests began. Cumulus Radio Network also complains of losing millions to Rush smut. A rep from the company says 49 out of 50 advertisers have 'No-Rush' clauses when buying air time. There is also talk that Limbaugh may have broken a few federal FCC Laws Telecommunications Act.

The public is not going to give up. They are going to find some way to end Limbaugh's reign of hate. You just don't get to call a woman a slut and prostitute on air, for three days, and not expect consequences. He compares same-sex marriage to pedophilia and animal sex, calls children on government assisted lunches, 'serfs and waifs,' mocked and accused Michael J. Fox of faking his Parkinson Disease... The list is long and documented thanks to Media Matters going back to 2006. Au Revoir, Rush.



""As it happens we agree with your analysis of Mr. Limbaugh and his message of rancor and hate, and have asked WSB to not air our ads during his show. This is, we might add, very unusual for us in that we firmly believe in the First Amendment and the right of all to speak their minds as they see fit. But Mr. Limbaugh seems beyond the pale in his ravings, and perhaps beyond what the Founding Fathers contemplated when framing the Constitution.""(""...pale in his ravings, and perhaps beyond what the Founding Fathers contemplated."" That is rich?.)"

I never had the pleasure of seeing it before.” So said the abolitionist John Brown gazing out over the Shenandoah Valley in Virginia, on a December morning in 1859. Americans have always reacted that way to their native land. It was their great possession. Europe had history stretching back into time. America had earth, here and now all potential, paradisally green.

And if people took this bounty for granted, were too busy to stop and look, that’s where artists came in, as they regularly did in the first half of the 19th century, to advertise the New Eden: illuminate it, enhance it, edit out flaws, say in paint, “This is ours!” In front of panoramic pictures by the likes of Alfred Bierstadt and Frederic Church even citizens who rarely ventured beyond city parks or their own backyards lingered, enthralled.

The enthrallment didn’t last much into the second half of the century. And for Brown it lasted only hours. He made his comment to the jailer who was taking him, in an open cart, to the gallows to be hanged for murder, treason and inciting slave rebellion after his Harpers Ferry raid. With his death, which many consider a spark that fired the Civil War, the American landscape began to change, topographically, politically and psychologically.

That change is the subject of a perspective-altering show called “The Civil War and American Art” at the Smithsonian American Art Museum, one of many events marking the 150th anniversary of the explosive 1863 arrival, during the Civil War, of the Emancipation Proclamation. On the surface the show looks straightforward, even ordinary. We know most of the paintings and photographs; they’re classics. What we know less well is their meaning within the context of the nation’s single greatest internal catastrophe, and that’s what we learn here."

WASHINGTON -- House Speaker John Boehner posted a note on his Facebook page Wednesday explaining his decision to allow a House vote to reopen the government.

""Thank you for all of your support and encouragement,"" Boehner (R-Ohio) wrote. ""The House has fought with everything it has to convince the president to engage in bipartisan negotiations aimed at addressing our country’s debt and providing fairness for the American people under ObamaCare. Our fight will continue.""

Despite the backing of House conservatives, many of Boehner's Facebook friends weren't too keen on his decision. Boehner's Facebook fans called him an ""asshat,"" a ""sellout,"" Obama's ""patsy,"" a ""weasel piece of garbage"" and a ""Jellyfish.""

""Resign and go smoke a pack in the tanning bed,"" one wrote. ""Fuck you, RINO!!!"" wrote another. ""Don't give in to the communist,"" said one. Others called him a ""coward turncoat"" and said he ""just killed the republican party!""

Monday, in the wake of the NSA spying scandal, Cohen lashed out at his former employer as the “official network of the Obama White House.”

This isn’t exactly news to the most of us, but MSNBC’s water carrying for Obama’s massive surveillance state apparently woke Mr. Cohen up:

When it comes to issues of U.S. militarism and spying, the allegedly “progressive” MSNBC often seems closer to the “official network of the Obama White House” than anything resembling an independent channel. With a few exceptions (especially Chris Hayes [10]), MSNBC has usually reacted to expanded militarism and surveillance by downplaying the abuses or defending them.

Had McCain or Romney defeated Obama and implemented the exact same policies, treating whistleblowers like Manning and Snowden as foreign espionage agents, one would expect MSNBC hosts to be loudly denouncing the Republican abuses of authority.

Cohen then names names:

As Snowden arrived in Russia from Hong Kong, MSNBC host Ed Schultz blustered on [12] about Snowden as a “punk” and “coward.” …

MSNBC’s Melissa Harris-Perry has been condemning Snowden [14] by contrasting him with civil disobedients who “love their country” and submit to arrest – while Snowden just wants to “save his own skin [11].” …

MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow has also disappointed. After doing a typically thorough presentation on the force-down of President’s Morales’ plane, she ended her report [17] by expressing displeasure only that Washington had apparently gotten allies to go out on the limb “for nothing.”

For the most part, the left is perfectly okay with MSNBC being a branch of the Obama White House on every other issue. It is only on issues the left disagree with, like this spying business, that brings out the complaints.

MSNBC is at least being consistent.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/15/us-ivory-crush_n_4270071.html,2013-11-15 00:00:00,['Former Denver Associate Editor'],U.S. Crushes Ivory Stockpile: 5.4 Tons Crushed As Obama Seeks To End Illegal Trade,"DENVER -- Nearly 6 tons of raw and carved ivory from well over 1,000 elephants were crushed, removed from the black market in the United States' latest push to combat poaching.

Millions of dollars' worth of intricately carved figurines, bracelets and other trinkets were all fed into a rock-crushing machine Thursday at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge, rendering the pieces worthless. In as little as 10 years, experts who watched the ivory crushed said, trinkets like those could bring about the extinction of elephants.

""What was once a local or regional problem has become a global crisis,"" said U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service director Daniel Ashe. ""How will we answer the question when our grandchildren ask why there are no elephants remaining in the wild? Will they be proud of us when we say it was more important to own beautiful things than for beautiful things to roam in spectacular places?""

The condemnation of ""blood ivory"" supports an executive order by President Barack Obama to fight wildlife trafficking. The event also marked the first time in U.S. history that such a large quantity of ivory, stockpiled over 25 years, was destroyed, although selling ivory within the U.S. remains legal.

""We hear a lot about China, and concerns about the trade there are warranted, but the fact is, the United States is the second-largest market for ivory in the world,"" President and CEO of the Humane Society of the United States Wayne Pacelle said in a statement. ""Ivory trade laws in the U.S. are riddled with loopholes ... and smugglers take advantage of this deficiency.""

A September report by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence says the illicit ivory trade has grown to $10 billion and is now a major resource to fund crime and terrorism. Reports said activists claim elephant poaching helped finance al-Shabaab, the Somali terrorist group that recently attacked Kenya's Westgate mall.

Poaching also has grown increasingly brutal. Earlier this year, poachers reportedly used cyanide to kill 300 African elephants for their tusks, and some have used night-vision goggles and AK-47s.

African elephants have returned to the brink of extinction after an increase in poaching. According to a recent report by the National Intelligence Council, wildlife trafficking has doubled since 2007 and just last year, about 30,000 African elephants were slaughtered -- the most since the United Nations-backed Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) issued an ivory ban in 1989.

CITES relaxed the ban in 1997, however, to allow limited sales of ivory in Zimbabwe and later China. According to Peter Knights, the executive director of WildAid, relaxing the ban resulted in ""disaster"" and destroying the ivory is the best thing to do.

""People need to understand that this is as heinous a crime as consumption of heroin,"" Knights said. ""We don’t put heroin back on the market after we seize it, so this [crush] is the right thing to do. I think people who say otherwise are people who [support] this theory of legal supply, which we tried for 20 years, they fiddled with it and it was a disaster and we tried it with another release into China and that was a disaster, too, so you have to look at history and you have to learn its lesson."""

THOMAS ROBERTS (12/3/2013): The 113th Congress is about to go down as the least productive in our American history. CHRIS JANSING (12/3/2013): If you can believe it, only 55 bills have been signed into law this year. That makes this the least productive Congress ever. CHRIS HAYES (12/4/2013): The least productive Congress in the history of the American republic. ALAN COLMES (8/8/2013): It literally is a do-nothing Congress.

Now sure, the 113th hasn't passed the bills every Congress does, like a highway bill, or a defense bill, or a farm bill, or a budget. But, I mean, what do we need a budget for? Clearly not for highways, defense, or food. Besides, Congress did pass a bill ensuring that people can fish near dams on the Cumberland River, and they also passed deep cuts in food stamps for the poor, which is good solid governing, because the poor don't need food stamps anymore, now that they can fish near dams on the Cumberland River. Remember the old saying, ""Give a man a fish, he'll eat for a day. Take away his food stamps, maybe he won't."" (audience laughter)

And folks, I am so excited to have others report that there's been an even bigger bipartisan achievement.



FOX32 (11/18/2013): Congress is about to shell out $55 million dollars to pay for retirement benefits for a group of chimpanzees. The 300 chimps are part of a research testing facility, who are being sent to a habitat in Louisiana to live out the rest of their lives. The money will be used to provide the animals with housing, food, and medical care.

Nation, this is great news, because it means Congress can agree on a social safety net, as long as it's not for human beings. And if they're willing to reward research chimps with cushy retirement, I see no reason why we shouldn't just offer the same deal to our elderly, as long as we can use them for medical experiments first.

Face it, come on, face it, they already swallow whatever pills you put in the tray. And since we won't need chimps for research anymore, we can have them do all the things Congress refuses to pay people to do. Like rebuilding our bridges, or paving our highways. I mean, it would be so much better! Because a chimp on a tricycle is funny, but a chimp on a steamroller? Hilarious!

And come to think of it, why don't we just put the chimps in Congress?

(wild audience cheering and applause)

After all, they've got a lot of experience... they've got the experience you need — they jerk off in public and throw shit at each other. (wild audience laughter and applause)"

As mayor%2C Foxx hosted the 2012 Democratic National Convention in Charlotte

If confirmed by Senate%2C Foxx would replace the retiring Ray LaHood

Foxx%2C who is a Democrat%2C struck a bipartisan tone in remarks at the White House

WASHINGTON -- President Obama announced Monday his choice of Charlotte Mayor Anthony Foxx to be his next Transportation secretary, heralding the young mayor for revitalizing his city with critical investments in its transportation infrastructure.

Foxx, 41, raised his national profile after the Queen City hosted last year's Democratic National Convention.

Obama noted that during Foxx's time as mayor, ground was broken on the Charlotte Streetcar Project, a third parallel runway at Charlotte-Douglass International Airport was opened, and he worked to extend the LYNX light rail system to the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.

""When Anthony became mayor in 2009, Charlotte like the rest of the country was going through a bruising economic crisis,"" Obama said. ""But the city managed to turn things around ... and if you ask Anthony how that happened, he'll tell you one of the reason is that Charlotte made one of the largest investments in transportation in the city's history.""

In brief remarks at the White House on Monday afternoon, Foxx, who is a Democrat, struck a bipartisan tone.

""There is no such thing a Democratic or Republican road, bridge, port, airfield or rail system,"" Foxx said. ""We must work together, across party lines, to enhance this nation's infrastructure.""

The choice of Foxx, who is Charlotte's youngest elected mayor and the second African-American mayor in the city's history, also could help Obama dull criticism over the racial diversity of his Cabinet.

Earlier this month, Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., criticized Obama for failing to name any African Americans among his early picks for his second-term Cabinet, charging that the president ""has once again overlooked his most loyal constituency.""

And Rep. Marcia Fudge, D-Ohio, chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, also complained in a letter to Obama last month that his recent Cabinet nominees ""have hardly been reflective of this country's diversity.''

Obama was even ribbed by the comedian Conan O'Brien at Saturday's White House Correspondents Association's annual dinner in Washington over the lack of diversity in his Cabinet.

""Mr. President, your hair is so white it could be a member of your Cabinet,"" O'Brien said.

On Monday, Fudge in a statement praised Obama's pick and said that Foxx ""will surely be an asset to the President's cabinet and to this nation."" Meanwhile, Thompson said he was ""pleased with this development,"" but that he ""will continue to hold the president accountable for ensuring he has a diverse Cabinet.""

If confirmed by the Senate, Foxx would become the second African American in Obama's second-term Cabinet, joining Attorney General Eric Holder and United Nations Ambassador Susan Rice, both first term holdovers. Foxx would replace Ray LaHood, who announced earlier this year that he was stepping down as Transportation secretary once his replacement cleared the Senate.

The president has boasted of the diversity in his White House and urged critics not to judge the makeup of his Cabinet until he completed his picks. He still needs to nominate a Commerce secretary and U.S. trade representative.

Ahead of Obama's announcement Monday, White House spokesman Jay Carney said that the president is ""pleased with the individuals who have agreed to accept his nominations for positions in the Cabinet.""

""What you will see is a Cabinet that reflects the diversity of the country and the quality of people who are willing to serve their country in these important positions,"" Carney said.

Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond who studies federal nominations, said Republicans will question Foxx's short résumé on transportation issues, but predicted he'll sail through confirmation hearings. Foxx, who was first elected Charlotte's mayor in 2009, is a lawyer by training. He's served on staff of the House Judiciary Committee and in the civil rights division of the Justice Department.

""The Republicans on this kind of appointment as opposed to something like secretary of Defense are more likely to defer to the president,"" Tobias said.

If confirmed, Foxx will immediately face a budget fight and several contentious rules for consumer protection and safety.

A week of furloughs at the Federal Aviation Administration, which delayed thousands of flights, prompted Congress to allow the agency to shift around funding amid spending cuts to end the furloughs.

But the spending battle remains for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1 because the Obama administration wants to close tax loopholes while trimming spending, but congressional Republicans oppose new revenues.

The Transportation Department is also developing a consumer-protection rule dealing with how airlines market services such as baggage fees and seat assignments.

Consumer groups and travel agents are urging the department to force airlines to provide the prices for those services to the companies that allow comparisons at sites like Travelocity and Orbitz. But airlines are opposed to being forced to provide the information because comparison sites charge billions of dollars collectively each year.

Two safety rules are also pending at the FAA, in reaction to the last fatal crash of a commercial airliner in February 2009. One rule expected in August proposes to require as many training hours for co-pilots as pilots, with exceptions for military pilots and those graduating from four-year colleges. The other rule, expected in October, will require more simulator training about how to recover from a stall.

""Without question, our nation faces a number of transportation challenges that will require strong leadership and effective communication with Congress to keep our nation moving,"" said Sen. John Thune, the top Republican on the committee that will consider Foxx's nomination.

State Sen. Mark Leno (D-San Francisco) has introduced legislation that could extend the last call for alcohol in some California cities until 4 a.m.

“This legislation would allow destination cities like San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego to start local conversations about the possibility of expanding night life and the benefits it could provide the community by boosting jobs, tourism and local tax revenue,” Leno said.

Currently, the state allows the sale of alcohol from 6 a.m. to 2 a.m. for bars, nightclubs and restaurants. Leno’s bill would let cities get permission from the state Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control to allow their nightspots to extend their hours for serving alcohol.

Leno said the change could mean a boost to the California economy. He cited a study by the market research firm Technomic Inc. that found the top 100 grossing social and night life venues in the country generated $1.5 billion last year and 15 of them were in the Los Angeles area.

But all of the top 10 venues are in cities that have extended hours, including Las Vegas, New York and Miami, the firm found.

Not everyone is sold on the idea.

Leno’s proposal is “terrible,” said Alan Dymond, president of the Studio City Residents Assn. Dymond said many clubs and restaurants along Ventura Boulevard back up to homes affected by noise and traffic at closing time.

“For our members, that extension of hours would just increase the aggravation,” Dymond said.

Senate Republican leader Robert Huff of Diamond Bar said Leno’s proposal raises a lot of questions, including its effect on drunk driving rates, and needs more study.

Some of the same concerns explain the opposition to the idea by Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca, according to spokesman Steve Whitmore. People, he said, “don’t need to have two more hours for drinking.”

SB 635 is supported by industry groups, including the California Restaurant Assn. and the San Francisco Council of District Merchants.

The change could mean a lot more revenue for California businesses and would make operations easier, said Tony Palermo, the owner of Tony P’s Dockside Grill in Marina del Rey.

“A lot of people don’t want to stop [drinking] at 2 a.m. and then you become the bad guy” enforcing the curfew, said Palermo, past president of the Los Angeles chapter of the California Restaurant Assn.

Obama%27s invisibility encapsulates the delusional looking glass through which he sees the world.

Promises mean little in this world because when they%27re broken%2C Obama just redefines the promise.

Now%2C finally%2C the American people have had enough. Now%2C reality has encircled the White House.

""The buck stops here.""

There's a sustaining beauty to President Harry Truman's desk sign. In four simple words, it offers a defining purpose to an office of immense complexity -- in the end, the president holds the final responsibility.

Most presidents accept this narrative. But nearly five years into office -- after Fast and Furious, after Benghazi, after the snooping on Associated Press phone records, after the IRS political vendetta and now the Obamacare website mess, President Obama has shown his preference for a different kind of ""buck"" -- with a deliberately amorphous Constitution. By his own choice, Obama has become the ""know-nothing"" president.

To be fair, Obama's absent responsibility isn't rooted in a villainous conspiracy (call me a RINO, but I don't believe the president is an evil man). Instead, Obama's invisibility encapsulates the delusional looking glass through which he sees the world.

Welcome to the Obama Matrix -- the president's created world of absolute deniability. A world in the unwitting mold of another fictional Matrix … that of the Wachowski brothers.

The protagonists certainly sit well together.

It's obvious that Obama regards himself as ""the one"" – a presidential ""Neo"", a pure leader harassed by the emotionalism, incompetence and malevolence of others. In Obama's Matrix, the Republicans constitute ""Agent Smith"" -- arrogant malcontents driven by an inexorable anger. The American people are the cocooned humans -- requiring ""liberation"" from their ideological slumber. Valerie Jarrett is ""the Oracle"" -- the fountain of hard and necessary understanding. Everyone else? They're ""the machine"" -- the system that constricts Obama's positive intention.

By plugging himself into this Matrix of certainties, Obama has found a self-sustaining moral cause -- the belief that he's responsible for all that's politically favorable and nothing that's politically toxic. Festooned by adoring supporters and fortified behind unquestioning staff, Obama has always presumed a kind of Moses-esque self-awareness. These are the springs from which the presidential Matrix flows.

Of course, there's a big problem here.

As with ""Neo"", Obama's Matrix isn't real. In fact, it's the definition of un-reality: an imitation embraced in order to excuse absent leadership. For many years this pretense has been papered over by the GOP's fetish for political self-immolation. Nevertheless, the GOP doesn't alter the foundational truth -- Obama's Matrix is a dream world divorced from courage and facts.

Promises mean little in this world because when they're broken, Obama just redefines the promise. Take Obama's ""red lines"" in Syria. The principle was an explicit clarification that punitive military action would follow Syrian President Bashar Assad's use of WMDs. What followed was a Russian swindle that broadcast American impotence. Except, in the Obama Matrix, Obama had really won; it was the critics who were mistaken, we who lacked the intellectual sufficiency to grasp the brilliance of Obama's brain.

But now the White House has a problem. Now, finally, the American people have had enough. Now, reality has encircled the White House.

In the political storm that the health care debacle has reaped, the president and his staff are realizing that at a basic level, the ""buck"" has objective form. Slowly, they're recognizing that the shrine of plausible deniability eventually becomes implausible. Whether in business or government, leadership is about more than positive intentions -- it's about managing the consequences of choices. As the Merovingianexplains to ""Neo,"" ""I drank too much wine; now I must (use the restroom). Cause and effect.''

The president should gaze down to the Resolute Desk at which he works. Etched in its essence is a warning -- hubris portends a dangerous course. The ice is closing. If Obama wants to salvage his presidency, he must unplug himself from his Matrix of denial.

Judges on the Court of Appeals, however, would be transferred after age 70, to a State Supreme Court.

But because the Bonacic bill would have to be passed by both chambers — twice, in separately elected sessions — and then approved by voters, the earliest that it could take effect would be 2016. And that would be too late for two judges on the Court of Appeals: Chief Judge Lippman, who turns 70 in 2015, and Judge Robert S. Smith, who turns 70 in 2014.

The fate of the two bills has caused some whispers in the Capitol because Mr. Lippman is friendly with Sheldon Silver, the speaker of the Democrat-dominated Assembly. The two men grew up on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, where Mr. Silver still lives, and Mr. Silver was an ardent supporter of the judge’s nomination as chief judge by Gov. David A. Paterson in 2009.

Chief Judge Lippman, who has established himself as a solid liberal voice, declined to comment.

But Mike Whyland, a spokesman for Mr. Silver, said the friendship between the speaker and the judge had nothing to do with the proposed extension of the retirement age. “This is a broad based, politics-neutral bill that covers many judges and will be voted on by the public,” Mr. Whyland said, referring to the Weinstein measure.

Mr. Bonacic initially said he had offered his bill — which had passed the Senate once before, in 2011, but died in the Assembly — because he had heard “too many concerns from other judges that they are not included” in the Assembly version. But late last month, Mr. Bonacic suggested that he was leaning toward a compromise: allowing both bills to the Senate floor.

Still, he said, there was no consensus within the Republican conference in the Senate on the issue. “I am not so sure the people want judges serving until they are 80,” he said.

Langdon Chapman, an aide to Senator Bonacic, added that his bill, and its longer legislative timetable, was not related to Mr. Lippman’s looming retirement."

WASHINGTON -- If the federal government shuts down at midnight, it's not just federal workers who will feel the effects. Tourists visiting Washington, D.C. will also have to cope with closed doors at many major museums and monuments.

The cutest casualty may be the Smithsonian National Zoo's panda cam, which stars its five-week-old female cub; the zoo confirmed on Twitter that all of its cams ""have not been deemed essential.""

What is considered essential during a shutdown? The New York Times explains:

The Hope Diamond, all 45.5 carats of it, will remain securely guarded here at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. The Japanese giant salamanders of the National Zoo need not worry if the HVAC systems keeping their habitat just right break down — a maintenance crew will be on call.

In a blog for HuffPost DC, tour guide Canden Schwantes focuses on the bright side of a shutdown: ""Think of this as a way to see the lesser known side of D.C. and sites that are often, sadly, skipped over. Some of the best places in D.C. are the smaller, historic house museums.""

http://news.yahoo.com/menendez-says-reimbursed-donor-2-jaunts-081746547--politics.html,,[],Menendez says he reimbursed donor for 2 jaunts,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Sen. Robert Menendez's office says he reimbursed a prominent Florida political donor $58,500 on Jan. 4 of this year for the full cost of two of three trips Menendez took on the donor's plane to the Dominican Republic in 2010.

More details about the New Jersey senator's trips emerged as his office said unsubstantiated allegations that the senator engaged in sex with prostitutes in the Dominican Republic are false.

There had been no public disclosure of the two trips until now.

""The senator paid for the two trips out of his personal account and no reporting requirements apply,"" Menendez spokeswoman Tricia Enright said Wednesday night.

The FBI searched the West Palm Beach, Fla., office of the donor — eye doctor Salomon Melgen — on Tuesday night and early Wednesday, but it was unclear if the raid was related to Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat. In addition the FBI agents, investigators with the U.S. Health and Human Services Department also were seen carting boxes out of the office.

A third trip by Menendez aboard Melgen's plane — a campaign fundraising journey to the donor's residence in the Dominican Republic — took place in May 2010. That trip was reported to the Federal Election Commission as a $5,400 expenditure by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which Menendez chaired. The trip, for fundraising from the community of Americans in the region, took Menendez to Puerto Rico as well as the Dominican Republic, said Menendez's office. The $5,400 was paid to one of Melgen's companies, Vitreo Retinal Consultants.

Menendez categorized the other two trips as personal. The first was Aug. 6-9, 2010, a round trip from South Florida to the Dominican Republic. The second was Sept. 3-6, 2010, from New Jersey to the Dominican Republic and back.

Menendez could have invoked what is known as a ""friendship exemption"" regarding the two personal trips, which would have required the senator to report the travel to the Senate Ethics Committee as a gift. Instead, Menendez chose to reimburse the full cost of the two trips.

Story continues

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., turned aside questions about Menendez at a news conference Thursday, saying they should be directed to the New Jersey Democrat instead. On Tuesday — before the disclosures about the FBI raid and the trips — he had expressed skepticism about the allegations, telling reporters to consider the source.

White House press secretary Jay Carney declined to answer when asked whether the president still has full faith and confidence in Menendez. ""I don't have anything for you on that,"" Carney told reporters Thursday.

The Daily Caller, a conservative website, reported shortly before the November election that Menendez traveled on Melgen's private plane to the Dominican Republic to engage in sex with prostitutes. Some New Jersey Republicans filed a complaint with the Senate Ethics Committee last fall in the wake of the allegations by The Caller. In response, Menendez's staffers searched records for trips by the senator and found the two additional trips that hadn't been reimbursed.

On Tuesday, Menendez became chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, succeeding Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass.

At FBI headquarters in Washington, spokesman Jason Pack said the bureau ""cannot comment on the existence or status of an investigation."" Justice Department spokeswoman Tracy Schmaler also declined to comment.

Records filed in Palm Beach County show an Internal Revenue Service lien against Melgen of more than $11.1 million for unpaid taxes from 2006-09. Prior liens for taxes from 1998 to 2002 were subsequently withdrawn, records show.

Menendez's office said the accusations of engaging with prostitutes ""are manufactured by a politically motivated right-wing blog and are false.""

Menendez's office said Melgen has been a friend and political supporter of the senator for many years and said the three trips Menendez took have been ""paid for and reported appropriately."" Menendez's office later changed the statement's wording to specify that the trips had been ""paid for or reported appropriately,"" correcting the misimpression that all three trips had been publicly disclosed.

The Daily Caller began publishing stories about Menendez and Melgen on Nov. 1, when it reported that two women from the Dominican Republic said Menendez paid them for sex earlier in 2012. Prostitution is legal in the Caribbean nation.

Melgen is involved in numerous businesses, all sharing the same address in West Palm Beach, according to records filed with the Department of State in Florida.

Late Tuesday and early Wednesday, FBI agents were seen inside the West Palm Beach building, walking its halls and standing beside shelves full of files.

Melgen is listed as having an ownership interest in DRM Med Assist, which Federal Aviation Administration records show is the owner of a CL-600 Challenger plane. Flight records for the aircraft were not immediately available.

Melgen, a registered Democrat, has made $193,350 in political contributions since 1998, including $14,200 to Menendez, according to Federal Election Commission records. Menendez was chairman of the Senate Democratic Campaign Committee, which raises money for Democratic Senate candidates, from 2009-11.

Menendez, a lawyer, is a former mayor of Union City, N.J., and also served in the New Jersey state General Assembly and the New Jersey state Senate. He is divorced and has two children.

Melgen, 58, is a native of the Dominican Republic, where he earned his medical degree from the Universidad Nacional Pedro Henríquez Ureña in 1978. He has lived in the U.S. since at least 1980, holding an internship, residency and fellowship at hospitals in Connecticut, Missouri and Massachusetts, according to records filed with the Florida Department of Health.

Melgen has been licensed to practice in Florida since 1986 and purchased the West Palm Beach plot of land where he built his main office in 1991. Over the years, Melgen has become regarded as a top ophthalmologist, speaking at conferences and even operating on then-Gov. Lawton Chiles in 1997. The governor later appointed Melgen to a state panel on HMOs.

Calls to Melgen's offices Wednesday were forwarded to an answering service where receptionists told callers to try back Thursday. Calls to Melgen's home in North Palm Beach, which is appraised at $2.1 million, went unanswered.

On the website for his medical practice, Melgen writes: ""I am always asked what sets me apart from most other doctors, and I would have to say that I do not consider myself to be a 'cookbook' physician. My patients are my number one priority, and when I am looking to treat a diagnosis I try to look at all the data at hand and extrapolate the best treatment instead of solely adhering to what the current 'standard' of treatment may be.""

Bullying is used to describe behaviors ranging from rolling of the eyes to sexual assault

Victimization is a better term%2C researchers say

Educators hampered by policies that require mistreatment to be repetitive

SAN FRANCISCO – Schools that want to do a better job fighting bullying ought to start with one key step, a group of researchers said Tuesday: Stop using the term ""bullying.""

Because it's ""being used for everything from rolling eyes to 'not wanting to be your friend' to sexual assault, the word 'bullying' has really obscured our ability to focus on what's happening"" to children, said Dorothy Espelage of the University of Illinois.

Educators have been ""spinning our wheels for decades"" in a bid to treat bullying, but they're often hampered by policies that require mistreatment to be repetitive, for example, part of the classic definition of bullying. That focus also obscures whether specific acts are happening more or less, she said.

Espelage co-led a group of researchers that worked for a year to produce a new primer on bullying, released here on Tuesday at the annual meeting of the American Educational Research Association, the USA's largest education research organization. The association commissioned the research last year in the wake of several high-profile bullying cases and school shootings.

Espelage has served as an expert witness in legal cases in which a child committed suicide after being bullied. In several cases, she said, school staff members said in depositions that they were waiting for the alleged bullying behaviors to be repeated so they could treat them as bullying, in accordance with school policies. ""In some ways, our obsession with 'What is it?' has stalled us in creating safe schools,"" she said. ""The bottom line is, kids are being victimized – let's move on from that.""

A helpful way to look at the problem, she said, is to consider how colleges treat behavior such as hazing or sexual harassment. ""To call what's happening with 18-to-22-year-olds 'bullying,' when in fact some of it is criminal behavior … it's a disaster,"" she said.

Espelage and a colleague, Ron Astor of the University of Southern California, are pushing for schools to use the more simple term ""victimization.""

Astor acknowledged the irony of the idea: Speaking to a small group of reporters, he said of the booklet they produced, ""If this was titled 'Victimization,' you wouldn't be here."""
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/opinion/sunday/reality-sets-in.html,2013-11-10 00:00:00,['The Editorial Board'],Reality Sets In - The New York Times,"For about a decade, American military commanders leading the fight against Al Qaeda, the Taliban and Saddam Hussein had a blank check from Congress to buy whatever weapons and other supplies they needed. Now, the Pentagon is being forced to live with less in a new era of fiscal austerity.

With the Iraq war over and troops coming home from Afghanistan, the military budget must be reduced. The question is whether we can be smart about it. The across-the-board approach dictated by the budget reductions known as the sequester — rapid, steep, indiscriminate cuts to both bloated programs and essential ones — is the wrong way to go, causing chaos and turmoil in defense planning. Commanders say the sequester has already affected military readiness.

The Pentagon’s base budget was cut $37.2 billion in April as a result of the sequester. Barring a compromise deal between Republicans and Democrats, the Pentagon will face an additional $52 billion cut in January, bringing the total budget for 2014 down to about $475 billion. Through 2023, the cumulative defense cuts could amount to more than $1 trillion, including the reductions already made.

Reality is sinking in. It was startling, for instance, to see that the Air Force told The Wall Street Journal that it is now determined to build a new long-range bomber, a replacement for the storied B-52s and B-1s, on a “budget.” The Journal reported that an Air Force manager for the $55 billion project killed a $300,000 kitchenette for the plane because the feature was too expensive. Meanwhile, the Navy has pledged to cut the costs of building the next aircraft carrier, the John F. Kennedy, by $1.2 billion."

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Tea Party & DOJ v. AP are BOTH GOP-Fabricated Non-Scandals,"We'll debunk the IRS' extra scrutiny of Tea Party groups first. From USA Today:



According to a timeline compiled by independent IRS investigators, the IRS first began searching for Tea Party-related groups in March 2010. The policy underwent several revisions through 2011 and 2012 and now involves only organizations with ""indicators of significant amounts of political campaign intervention.""

The head of the IRS when this began in March of 2010 was Douglas Shulman, appointed by George W. Bush in 2008. He continued as chief of the IRS until just about 6 months ago - Nov. 9, 2012.

And yet Mitch McTurtle and Marco Rubio are now calling for the current acting head of the IRS to step down? That is to LoLz

The other IRS employee catching a lot of the blame for this is Lois Lerner, Director of Exempt Organizations Division. She's the one who said publicly something like, ""Sorry - I'm not too good at math."" Well, guess what - she also was appointed by Dubya back in 2005.

http://money.cnn.com/2013/09/27/news/economy/shutdown-plans/index.html,2013-09-27 00:00:00,['Jeanne Sahadi'],Government rolls out shutdown plans,"The outlines of next week's possible government shutdown have started to take shape as government agencies roll out their contingency plans.

Military service members will stay on the job but their paychecks may be delayed.

Federal museums and the National Zoo will close, so tourists will be turned away.

Most of the housing department will be furloughed, but the department promises to keep processing FHA loans.

It's impossible to say if a shutdown will happen. Congress did seem to move closer to one this weekend as Republicans and Democrats remained sharply divided.

But one thing is clear: Shutting down the government is a complex process.

(Related: How shutdown would hit one small business)

To get ready, agencies have been identifying services, programs and workers deemed essential, or ""excepted"" in official speak. Translation: Workers in the business of protecting life and property. They will continue working, though they won't be paid until after the shutdown.

Employees whose jobs are funded by money other than the annual appropriations that Congress is fighting over will keep working as well. So too will presidential appointees.

But all other programs deemed to be non-essential, or ""non-excepted,"" will be shuttered. And workers at those programs will be furloughed without pay.

Here are a few of the plans for next week in the event of a shutdown.

Defense: All active-duty military personnel, as well as active-duty reserve personnel, will stay on the job, the Pentagon said. But their Oct. 15 paycheck could be delayed if the shutdown goes past Oct. 7.

Civilian personnel engaged in essential activities will also continue working through the shutdown.

Civilian personnel involved in non-essential work will be furloughed without pay -- unless money to pay their salaries is drawn from a source other than fiscal year 2014 appropriations.

Those who work during the shutdown will be paid, but not until Congress appropriates funds to do so.

Temporary duty travel will be canceled, unless it's in direct support of the war in Afghanistan or related to safety of life and protection of property or foreign relations. In such cases, written approval is required.

For any service member killed during a shutdown, families will not get death benefits until the shutdown ended.

Federal courts and justice: Justice will continue to be served.

The court system said it will remain open for business for approximately 10 business days in the event of a shutdown.

It's able to do so on the basis of fees and funds from prior appropriations, according to an earlier report from the Congressional Research Service.

All court proceedings and deadlines will remain in effect unless otherwise advised. The judiciary said it will reassess its funding capacity on or around Oct. 15.

The Department of Justice, meanwhile, said it only plans to furlough about 15% of its 114,486-person workforce.

Health and Human Services: The Department of Health and Human Services has said it will furlough 52% its employees if there's a shutdown.

Offices to be hit hardest include the Administration for Children and Families, the Administration for Community Living and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would be affected too. But they would keep on minimal support for their outbreak investigations, processing of laboratory samples and the 24/7 emergency operations center.

The Food and Drug Administration will also continue limited activities related to high-risk recalls and other vital efforts.

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services will continue large portions of Obamacare. And the Medicare program will continue ""largely without disruption"" during the shutdown.

Housing loans: The Department of Housing and Urban Development, of which the Federal Housing Administration is a part, said it will be furloughing 96% of its workforce.

Nevertheless, on Monday it said it would continue to process FHA loans during the shutdown. But given the greatly reduced staffing levels, the underwriting and loan approval process will be slower than usual, an FHA spokesman said.

National museums: The Smithsonian Institution said its 18 museums and the National Zoo will be closed to the public in a shutdown.

It will furlough 84% of its workforce. The other 16% who will be asked to work include employees responsible for the care and protections of the facilities and collections as well as the care and feeding of the animals at the zoo.

Passports: During the last shutdown in the mid-1990s, passport offices closed. But according to the State Department's current shutdown plan, offices will remain open because they generate enough in fees to support their operation.

Any offices located in a federal building affected by the shutdown, however, may not be able to open.

Chemical spill investigations: They'll be halted.

The Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board said it will furlough 37 of its 40 staff members in a shutdown.

""There would be no ability to respond to a major incident,"" managing director Daniel Horowitz told CNN.

The board sees its mission as investigative rather than immediately life-saving, which is why it essentially will shut down until Congress appropriates funding.

NASA: Good news for crews docking at the International Space Station. NASA said it will keep on some employees during a shutdown to make sure the crews are safe. Existing satellite missions will also continue.

But any NASA activity not tied to the protection of life and property will cease during the shutdown.

That's true even if it would cost more to shut a program down than to keep it running, according to NASA guidance.

According to a Gallup poll released Wednesday, the reason most Americans disapprove of Congress isn’t because of a specific policy or bad ethical behavior but because of inaction and partisan gridlock. Americans believe that Congress is broken.

And there is no need for any banal stretch for a false equivalency to explain why that would be. The reason Congress doesn’t work is because Republican lawmakers have ceased to believe that it should. For too many of them, compromise has become synonymous with collusion. They would rather resist than work. So the wheels of government are screeching to a halt. Obstruction and bluster have replaced solutions and courage.

As the former Clinton labor secretary Robert Reich wrote last week:

“Conservative Republicans in our nation’s capital have managed to accomplish something they only dreamed of when Tea Partiers streamed into Congress at the start of 2011: They’ve basically shut Congress down. Their refusal to compromise is working just as they hoped: No jobs agenda. No budget. No grand bargain on the deficit. No background checks on guns. Nothing on climate change. No tax reform. No hike in the minimum wage. Nothing so far on immigration reform.”

On that last point at least, Congress has a chance at redemption. It may be the best chance this year — and possibly the last during the Obama administration."

""Edward Snowden's ordeal is just beginning,"" Assange says of the NSA leaker

Snowden is charged by federal prosecutors with espionage and theft of government property

""This isn't a phenomenon that is going away,"" says Assange of young, tech-savvy leakers

WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange urged the world Saturday to ""stand with"" Edward Snowden , the man who admitted leaking top-secret details about U.S. surveillance programs, according to the text of a speech posted on Twitter.

As he appealed for a ""brave country"" to step forward and offer Snowden asylum, Assange also accused U.S. President Barack Obama of betraying a generation of ""young, technically minded people.""

Assange was scheduled to speak from the balcony of the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on Saturday, but the appearance was postponed at short notice ""due to a security situation,"" WikiLeaks said on Twitter.

Wednesday marked a year since Assange sought refuge in the embassy to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he is wanted for questioning over allegations that he raped one woman and sexually molested another.

Assange has repeatedly said the allegations in Sweden are politically motivated and tied to the work of his website. Ecuador's government granted him asylum in August, but British authorities have said they will arrest him if he leaves the premises.

He wrote that Assange evolved into a ""paranoid, power-hungry, megalomaniac."" Hide Caption 5 of 5

As a result of his decision to seek refuge in the embassy, ""I have been able to work in relative safety from a U.S. espionage investigation,"" said Assange, according to the text of the speech.

""But today, Edward Snowden's ordeal is just beginning.""

Assange's words came hours after Snowden was charged by U.S. federal prosecutors with espionage and theft of government property, according to a criminal complaint unsealed in U.S. District Court in Virginia on Friday.

Snowden, 30, has admitted in interviews that he was the source behind the leak of classified documents about the NSA's surveillance programs. Those leaks were the basis of reports this month in Britain's Guardian newspaper and The Washington Post.

He is believed to be in hiding in Hong Kong. The United States has asked authorities there to detain the former National Security Agency contract analyst on a provisional arrest warrant, The Washington Post reported, citing unnamed U.S. officials.

Assange, in his published speech, said the espionage charge had come ""like clockwork,"" making Snowden the eighth ""leaker"" to be charged with that count by the Obama administration.

""Two dangerous runaway processes have taken root in the last decade, with fatal consequences for democracy,"" he said.

""Government secrecy has been expanding on a terrific scale. Simultaneously, human privacy has been secretly eradicated ... The U.S. government is spying on each and every one of us, but it is Edward Snowden who is charged with espionage for tipping us off.""

Also among the eight ""leakers"" is WikiLeaks source Bradley Manning, Assange said. Manning is being court-martialed on charges he aided U.S. enemies by leaking documents he obtained as an Army intelligence analyst.

Prosecutors: Bradley Manning 'craved' notoriety

He named the others as Barrett Brown, Jeremy Hammond, Aaron Swartz, Gottfrid Svartholm and Jacob Appelbaum.

Assange suggested Obama was the real ""traitor"" for his failure to live up to his promises of hope, change and transparency in government. And he warned that the U.S. government will lose the battle if it tries to take on the tech-savvy people now calling its actions into question.

""Edward Snowden is one of us. Bradley Manning is one of us. They are young, technically minded people from the generation that Barack Obama betrayed. They are the generation that grew up on the Internet, and were shaped by it,"" he said.

""The U.S. government is always going to need intelligence analysts and systems administrators, and they are going to have to hire them from this generation and the ones that follow it.

""One day, they will run the CIA and the FBI. This isn't a phenomenon that is going away.""

Assange added that charging Snowden ""is intended to intimidate any country that might be considering standing up for his rights"" and appealed for efforts to find asylum for him to be intensified."

The Supreme Court decided that Montana District Judge G. Todd Baugh cannot move forward with a hearing that had been scheduled for Friday at 1:30 p.m. local time to void the 31-day prison sentence that he imposed last week on Stacey Rambold.

The court’s ruling came less than an hour before the hearing in Billings was to start.

Rambold, 54, was convicted of raping a then-14-year-old student who killed herself while the case was pending. Baugh sentenced Rambold to a 15-year sentence and suspended all but 31 days of the sentence, with a credit for a single day already served in jail.

“We conclude that the stated intent of the District Court to alter the initially imposed oral sentence in today’s scheduled hearing is unlawful,” said the state Supreme Court’s ruling, which requires Baugh to issue a written judgment that aligns with his previous 31-day sentence.

“We take no position on the legality of the imposed sentence and will address the parties’ arguments in that regard on appeal,” said the ruling, which was supported by four of the court’s six justices.

Chief Justice Mike McGrath and Justice Brian Morris dissented without comment.

Baugh’s Aug. 26 sentence was widely criticized as too lenient, sparking local and national outrage. The victim’s mother criticized Baugh, who in sentencing Rambold remarked that the teenage victim was “older than her chronological age.”

The backlash apparently prompted the veteran judge to backpedal. In a court order issued this week, Baugh, 71, reasoned that his prior sentence was “illegal” because it ignored the mandatory minimum sentence of two years. Friday’s hearing, wrote Baugh, would correct the legal error.

Both prosecutors and Rambold’s defense attorneys objected to Baugh’s attempt to undo his previous sentence.

The state’s attorney general filed an emergency petition this week to prohibit Baugh’s hearing, arguing that the “proper avenue to address the illegal sentence” is an appeal before the Supreme Court.

The attorney general’s emergency petition recognized Baugh’s “effort to correct the error” but said that the correct judicial process needs to be upheld with an appeal to the Supreme Court.

Rambold’s attorneys concurred with state prosecutors, maintaining that a new sentencing hearing was inappropriate and the previous sentence should remain in effect, according to court documents.

Prosecutors filed on Wednesday a notice of appeal, which is pending before the state Supreme Court.

(CNN) —

Dear Miss America,

Thank you for reminding us what classic American beauty looks like today. For the rest of America – in case any of you have been sleeping for, say, the past two decades, or clinging to out-of-touch fashion magazines – here’s an alert: Beauty is Serena Williams and Michelle Obama. Beauty is Angelina Jolie and Marissa Mayer.

And yes, beauty is Nina Davuluri, Miss America 2014.

Courtesy of Roxanne Jones Roxanne Jones

Women’s beauty cannot be debated or dictated by others. So in tribute to women across the globe, I celebrate your beautiful brown skin, your breathtaking Bollywood dance skills, and the hard work that I’m sure you put in, not only to earn top grades and graduate from the University of Michigan with a degree in brain behavior and cognitive science, but to become the first Indian-American woman to take home the tiara. I love it.

The beauty pageant circuit is a tough act, as I learned early from my fleeting experiences as a teen who participated in several pageants. Don’t laugh, that college scholarship money is no joke. Back then, there were no other brown girls on the stage. No matter. My family and friends cheered me on and told me how beautiful I was – and I had the audacity to believe them.

Sadly, it was the talent portion that always sunk me. Painting and poetry-writing just didn’t cut it as a stage act. Lucky for me, I found journalism, but those pageants helped give me the confidence to believe that I could share the stage with anyone.

Miss America, I hope you use your crown and platform well and that you have the courage to amplify the voices of those women and girls back in your ancestral home, India, who are valiantly fighting for full equality and the right to live without fear of the brutal sexual violence that plagues that nation.

You are not the first woman of color to take the crown. It was 30 years ago that Vanessa Williams became the first black Miss America. Seven other black women and one Asian woman have won since then. And most went on to successful careers.

But whenever this happens, those pesky bigots climb out of their caves to rant and rave and spew their ignorance about why it’s not fair. Ignore them.

Former Miss California: How do we teach kids diversity is beautiful?

Clearly, those divergent voices – and I admit there are many – failed even the most basic fourth-grade geography lesson and likely couldn’t even find India on a map, which is why they mistakenly think you are Arab. Perhaps they have you confused with Rima Fakih, a Lebanese immigrant from Dearborn, Michigan, who in 2010 was the first Arab-American to win the Miss USA pageant. Must be hard keeping up with a changing world when you’ve spent so much time trying to ignore and reject all those people who look different from you.

According to the 2010 U.S. Census, there are 3.2 million people of Asian Indian descent living in the United States. Their median income for 2010 was $90,711. In fact, Indians surpassed Filipinos as the nation’s second-largest Asian population, after Chinese, the data show.

Still, some people will never accept that it is families like yours that are helping to make America a stronger nation. Don’t let them distract you on your journey. Sounds like you’re on the right track:

“I’m so happy this organization has embraced diversity,” you said, according to The Associated Press. “I’m thankful there are children watching at home who can finally relate to a new Miss America.” Asked about the negativity, you said, “I have to rise above that. I always viewed myself as first and foremost American.”

Use those haters to inspire you reach your dream to become a cardiologist, Ms. Davuluri. Reject voices that would try to define and limit you. Reject the magazine covers and fashion gurus, who may understand how to design and sell a pretty dress but have no clue about what defines a woman’s beauty, as evidenced by the consistent and blatant lack of diversity on the runways during Fashion Weeks both here and abroad.

Reject the critics – men and women – who bash women like television personality Julie Chen for getting plastic surgery after being told by her bosses nearly 20 years ago that her Asian eyes would hurt her career. Chen made her choice back then, and brava for her for starting a public debate now about Asian beauty standards.

Today, Chen looks wonderful – hard to tell from a 20-year-old photo if she had grown to be a natural beauty with her original face. But I, for one, want to live in a world where grown women have the right to decide what is best our careers and our bodies.

Was it an awful message to give women in the workplace? Yes. But it’s no different from the countless occasions throughout my career that I’ve witnessed women being told that they are too fat, too black or too Latina to succeed. In my first television job, the news director told me that I should study Diane Sawyer’s look and voice in order to be better at my job – like I was ever going to look like Diane. Thank goodness Oprah came along.

Media is a tough career where regardless of your talent, looks really are still everything – especially for us women. And to be fair, I’ve known more than a few men who’ve gone under the knife or tried extreme diets just to keep their faces in front of the camera.

But to succeed, we must deal with it; work to improve the environment for the women behind us, and move on with our lives.

There’s room on the stage for all types of beauty.

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/05/25/state-report-shows-5-bridge-had-gouges-impact-damage-months-ago/,2013-05-25 00:00:00,[],"State report shows downed bridge had gouges, impact damage months ago","Officials in Washington state performed a special inspection six months ago on the Interstate 5 bridge that collapsed because there were indications it had been struck by a different vehicle.

An inspection report released Friday by the state Department of Transportation says inspectors brought in a bucket truck to examine the structure and identified tears, deformations and gouges on the northbound side of the bridge.

In that Nov. 29, 2012, impact, an overheight truck struck a metal overhead truss on the bridge, DOT spokeswoman Broch Bender said. An inspection crew determined the bridge to be safe, with only minor repairs required. She said those minor repairs were added to an existing list of bridge maintenance items to be completed at a future date.

The inspection report also details a variety of other problems with the bridge, including vegetation growing in panels, and rust. It also summarizes a variety of parts on the bridge that have been subjected to ""high-load"" hits.

A trucker was hauling a load of drilling equipment Thursday evening when his load bumped against the steel framework over the bridge. He looked in his rearview mirror and saw the span collapse into the water behind him.

Two vehicles fell into the chilly river. The three people in those vehicles were not seriously hurt.

As authorities try to find a temporary span, motorists will have to use alternate routes during the holiday and for weeks to come.

""You cannot overstate the importance of this corridor to Washington state,"" Gov. Jay Inslee said. Traffic on I-5 and surrounding roads was backed up for miles, a situation the governor said would continue indefinitely.

Officials were looking for a temporary, pre-fabricated bridge to replace the 160-foot section that failed, Inslee said Friday. That option could be in place in weeks. Otherwise, it could be months before a replacement can be built, the governor said.

The collapse came on the north end of the four-lane bridge near Mount Vernon, about 60 miles north of Seattle.

""He looked in the mirrors and it just dropped out of sight,"" Cynthia Scott, the wife of truck driver William Scott, said from the couple's home near Spruce Grove, Alberta. ""He was just horrified.""

The truck driver works for Mullen Trucking in Alberta, the Washington State Patrol said. The tractor-trailer was hauling a housing for drilling equipment southbound when the top right front corner of the load struck several of the bridge's trusses, the patrol said.

Scott, 41, remained at the scene and cooperated with investigators. He voluntarily gave a blood sample for an alcohol test and was not arrested.

The truck made it off the bridge, but the other two vehicles went into the water about 25 feet below.

Bryce Kenning, of Mount Vernon, said the bridge seemed to explode in front of him. The 20-year-old slammed his brakes, but there was nothing he could do.

""It was like time was frozen -- like a roller coaster where you're not attached to the tracks,"" Kenning said in a phone interview.

Ed Scherbinski, vice president of Mullen Trucking, said in an interview with The Associated Press that state officials had approved of the company's plan to drive the oversize load along I-5 to Vancouver, Wash.

Mike Allende, a state Department of Transportation spokesman, confirmed the truck had a permit.

""We're still trying to figure out why it hit the bridge,"" Allende said.

State officials approved the trucking company to carry a load as high as 15 feet, 9 inches, according to the permit released by the state. However, the southbound vertical clearance on the Skagit River bridge is as little as 14 feet, 5 inches, state records show. That lowest clearance is outside of the bridge's vehicle traveling lanes, Transportation Department communications director Lars Erickson said Friday. The bridge's curved overhead girders are higher in the center of the bridge.

The bridge has a maximum clearance of about 17 feet.

The permit specifically describes the route the truck would take, though it includes a qualification that the state ""Does Not Guarantee Height Clearance.""

It's not rare for trucks to strike bridges in Washington state. The state DOT said there were 21 bridge-strikes involving trucks last year, 24 in 2011 and 14 in 2010.

There are no signs leading up to the Skagit River bridge to warn about its clearance height. State Transportation Secretary Lynn Peterson said that under federal and state standards, the clearance is tall enough to not require signage.

Inslee said it will cost $15 million to repair the bridge. The federal government has promised $1 million.

The bridge is used by an average of 71,000 vehicles a day.

A Federal Highway Administration database lists the bridge as ""functionally obsolete"" -- a category meaning that the design is outdated. But it was not classified as structurally deficient."

(CNN) - Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin will return to familiar ground.

The Fox News Channel announced Thursday that Palin will rejoin the network as a contributor, less than five months after the two parted ways.



Viewers will start seeing Palin on their screens again Monday, chairman and CEO Roger Ailes said in a statement.

He added that he had several conversations in recent weeks with Palin about the possibility of her rejoining as a contributor.

""I have great confidence in her and am pleased that she will once again add her commentary to our programming. I hope she continues to speak her mind,"" he said.

Known for her outspoken and folksy demeanor, Palin was often considered a ratings goldmine.

Palin said in the statement she was ""pleased and proud"" to return the network.

Fox and Palin split in January, after the 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee turned down an offer to renew her contract that ended in 2012, a source close to Palin told CNN.

The departure came after the two had hit a few rough patches. Since leaving Fox, Palin kept a relatively low profile, appearing at only a few major conservative gatherings.

Shortly after it became public that Palin was leaving Fox earlier this year, she said in an interview published by the conservative news outlet Breitbart that she wanted to share her message ""more broadly"" rather than ""preach to the choir.""

""The message of liberty and true hope must be understood by a larger audience,"" she said.

Palin had not been exclusive to Fox television properties. Palin and her family also starred in a one-season reality show – ""Sarah Palin's Alaska"" on TLC – and Palin appeared as a featured ""guest host"" on NBC's ""Today Show."" She spoke to CNN moments after casting her ballot in the Alaska Republican primary last March.

Her family has found their way onto other media properties: her daughter competed on ABC's ""Dancing with the Stars"" and taped a reality-style show, Lifetime's ""Life's a Tripp.""

Jesse Jackson Jr.'s lawyers is prompting questions about what federal payments the ex-congressman is receiving as he awaits sentencing Wednesday for misusing $750,000 in campaign cash.

In a court filing this month, defense lawyers said vaguely that Jackson has no income ""other than Social Security payments and Federal Employee Retirement System payments.""

His lawyers did not answer questions from the Tribune about the payments, but the newspaper found Jackson may be eligible for federal disability payments of as much as $8,700 a month — or 60 percent of his congressional pay.

The South Side Democrat reportedly has bipolar disorder. He pleaded guilty to a lengthy spending spree involving misusing about $750,000 in campaign cash. He quit Congress in November, amid an FBI and Internal Revenue Service probe, and struck a plea deal with prosecutors in February.

Jackson, 48, is too young to receive retirement benefits from Social Security. He would have to be at least 62.

His age and his tenure in Congress — almost 17 years — are short of the mark for a standard retirement annuity from the Federal Employees Retirement System, or FERS. Members of Congress can collect a pension from FERS starting at age 50 if they have completed 20 years of service, or at any age after 25 years of service, according to the Congressional Research Service.

But Jackson appears eligible for another FERS program that pays out ""disability retirement"" payments.

Under program rules, potential payments in the first year would total $8,700 a month — or $104,400 a year. The potential payments would drop to $69,600 annually in subsequent years.

Any payments are subject to income taxes, according to officials at the federal Office of Personnel Management. Citing privacy rules, OPM officials would not talk about Jackson Jr. but provided general information about FERS benefits.

Under the rules, whatever FERS ""disability retirement"" benefits a lawmaker receives are adjusted downward if he or she begins collecting Security Social disability payments.

Government agencies contacted by the Tribune would not confirm that Jackson is receiving disability money. One official who declined to discuss the matter called Jackson a ""private citizen."" Others cited privacy laws. But no expert consulted by the Tribune offered an alternative theory of what the payments might be, other than disability payments.

Prosecutors want Jackson Jr. sent to prison for four years. Defense lawyers are asking for leniency, saying he could not get suitable mental health care in prison.

Defense lawyers, in their general description of Jackson Jr.'s income, said the federal payments would be ""suspended"" if he goes to prison.

The notion that a disgraced lawmaker, staring at a possible prison term after a spending binge with campaign cash, might be collecting hefty benefits rankles some experts.

David Autor, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has written about the unsustainable explosion in disability rolls in the U.S., said the idea of a ""recently shamed-out-of-office congressman applying for public benefits"" was ""sheer chutzpah.""

Bipolar disorder is a serious impairment, Autor said, but he did not think most people with the condition applied for disability benefits since the illness is ""reasonably treatable with modern psycho pharmaceuticals.""

According to Cornell economist Richard Burkhauser, Social Security Disability Insurance rolls in the U.S. climbed from 1.2 million people in 1967 to 8.8 million in 2012 — more than a seven-fold hike.

If Jackson Jr. is collecting disability benefits, it comes in an era in which Congress has sought to rein in members who run seriously afoul of the law by taking away their pension benefits.

Separate reform measures were passed in 2007 and 2012, and Jackson Jr. voted for both of them.

Those laws, according to OPM, call for stripping both FERS pension and disability benefits upon a felon's ""final conviction"" for one of several specified offenses. ""Final conviction"" means the time for an appeal has lapsed or appeals were lost.

Craig Holman, an official with Public Citizen, a watchdog group, helped write the legislation to strip pensions from lawmakers convicted of abusing the public trust. ""I suspect Congress never even considered something like disability payments,"" he said.

When asked about the prospect of Jackson Jr. pocketing disability payments now, Holman said: ""It would seem to run contrary to the spirit of the law.""

Brittney Manchester, of the Office of Personnel Management, provided a citation from federal law on how a federal lawmaker is deemed eligible for retirement disability:

""A member who completes at least 18 months of service as a member and is found by the (OPM) to be disabled for useful and efficient service as a member (of Congress) because of disease or injury shall be retired on the member's own application.""

A lawmaker may file a disability claim within one year of ""separation from service,"" the OPM said.

OPM would not discuss Jackson Jr. without a signed waiver from him. His lawyers did not respond to a Tribune request for a waiver.

Jackson Jr., the son of civil rights leader the Rev. Jesse Jackson Sr., last earned $174,000 in office. He resigned soon after winning re-election Nov. 6 to a two-year term. Before stepping down, he had been on a medical leave of absence from Congress for more than five months, undergoing periods of treatment in Arizona and Minnesota.

Jackson's wife, Sandi, 49, a former Chicago alderman, also will be sentenced Wednesday in federal court. She, too, pleaded guilty to a felony offense, filing false tax returns.

In her case, she admitted failing to report to the IRS about $600,000 in the couple's income as the two used campaign donations to buy a Rolex watch and other luxury goods, furniture, appliances, vacations and collector's items.

Prosecutors want staggered prison terms for the couple — 18 months for her and four years for him — so their children, ages 9 and 13, would not be without a parent.

She is asking to be put on probation, while prosecutors urge that she go to prison first, then Jackson Jr. The ex-congressman has said through his lawyers that he'd like to serve his term first."

Thursday’s stunning rules change by Senate Democrats can best be described as Obamacare II: another exercise of partisan political power to permit the majority to do whatever it wants. This time, the goal was advancing its agenda unchecked through the courts and executive agencies.

With all Republican members opposed, the Senate voted 52 to 48 to invoke the “nuclear option,” allowing a majority of senators present and voting (so, not necessarily 51) to approve presidential nominees except for Supreme Court justices. For those positions, this eliminated the filibuster, which required 60 votes to proceed to an up-or-down majority vote.

This was the most dangerous restructuring of Senate rules since Thomas Jefferson wrote them. It creates a perpetual opportunity for “tyranny of the majority,” which Alexis de Tocqueville called one of the greatest threats to American democracy.

As Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.) noted, quoting former senator Arthur Vandenberg on Thursday: “If a majority of the Senate can change its rules at any time, there are no rules.” It is as if the Red Sox, finding themselves behind in the ninth, added a few innings to make sure they could defeat the Cardinals in the World Series. Future majorities could, for example, end the filibuster for legislation, removing any obstacle to tyranny of the majority.

Democrats offered flimsy excuses, many of which are untrue:

Excuse No. 1: President Obama’s appointees have been unfairly denied seats by failed cloture votes, or filibusters.

According to the Congressional Research Service, no Supreme Court nominee has been defeated by filibuster in the Senate. None. (An arguable exception is Abe Fortas’s doomed nomination as chief justice, about which President Lyndon Johnson engineered a face-saving cloture vote.)

The number of federal district judge and Cabinet nominees defeated by filibuster? Zero. Regarding sub-Cabinet nominees, there were two for President Obama, three for George W. Bush and two for Bill Clinton. That’s it.

As for appeals court judges, Republican filibusters have blocked five, but that happened only after Democrats first blocked five. Beginning in 2003, Democrats blocked 10 Bush nominees. This was the first time that a president’s circuit court nominees were blocked by the failure to obtain cloture. Republicans considered the nuclear option, decided against it, and five of the 10 were confirmed.

Excuse No. 2: President Obama’s nominees have waited too long for confirmation.

According to the Congressional Research Service, Obama’s second-term Cabinet nominees have been confirmed at about the same pace as those of Presidents Clinton and Bush.

This year, the Senate has confirmed 36 of Obama’s second-term nominees to circuit and district courts, compared with 14 for Bush at this point in 2005.

On Friday, the Senate’s executive calendar listed 54 nominees who have been waiting less than three weeks for confirmation, 16 who had waited for up to nine weeks and only eight who have been waiting more than nine weeks. Two of those eight nominees were being “held” by Democratic senators.

Excuse No. 3: Republican obstruction left the Democratic majority leader unable to act.

Only Democratic committee majorities can place nominees on the executive calendar. Only the majority leader can move their confirmation. He may do so anytime he chooses.

What if obstructionist Republicans were to place holds on 10 sub-Cabinet nominees? Under the rules that existed before Thursday, the majority leader could have filed a cloture motion on those nominees on Monday and confirmed them by Friday — unless 41 Republicans voted against cloture. Again, that has happened to only two Obama nominees for non-judicial sub-Cabinet positions and only seven times in Senate history.

In his last Senate speech, former majority leader Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) warned against destroying the filibuster, which he called the “necessary fence” against the executive and popular passions. Majority leaders could do whatever they needed to do under the rules, Byrd said.

Excuse No. 4: Republicans have unfairly blocked the president from filling vacancies on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.

In 2006, Democrats insisted on doing precisely what Republicans are asking in 2013: moving judges from courts where they are not needed to where they are needed most. They did not think this unfair then.

In 2006, Democrats on the Judiciary Committee, including Sens. Patrick Leahy, Joe Biden, Chuck Schumer and Dick Durbin, said that “under no circumstances” should new judges be confirmed to the D.C. court because its workload was half the national average and there were judicial emergencies elsewhere.

With Bush’s approval, the Senate reduced the number of seats on the D.C. Circuit by one, moving that slot to the 9th Circuit. The D.C. Circuit hears fewer cases today than it did in 2007.

So why would Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) engineer a rules change that he said in 2006 “would be the end of the Senate”? Because the vote was not about the filibuster. It was about permitting the majority to do whatever it wants.

Call it Obamacare II, for which the only cure is a referendum next November."

Panetta is ending the ban on women serving in combat in the U.S. military, potentially opening up more than 200,000 positions on the front lines and possibly also jobs with elite commando units.

Pentagon officials said Wednesday that Panetta gave the armed services until 2016 to ask for special waivers if they believe any positions should remain closed to women.

The decision specifically overturns a 1994 rule that barred women from serving with smaller ground combat units.

Panetta’s decision was seen as a recognition of women’s contributions to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Because of the demand for troops, women often found themselves on the front lines serving as drivers, medics, mechanics and in other roles when commanders attached their units to combat battalions. They didn’t receive combat decorations or other special recognition, however.

The move will also help women climb the military ranks. Female service members have struggled to gain promotions in part because of their lack of combat experience; the Pentagon’s first four-star female general, Ann Dunwoody, wasn’t promoted until 2008.

The Pentagon took an initial step in February when it opened 14,000 combat-related jobs, mostly in the Army, to female service members. The new policy would open up to women more than 200,000 combat jobs, including in Army and Marine infantry units.

Rep. Loretta Sanchez (D-Garden Grove), a member of the House Armed Services Committee and founder of the Women in the Military Caucus, praised Panetta’s decision. He is expected to step down next month, and a Senate confirmation hearing is scheduled next week for Chuck Hagel, whom President Obama has nominated as the next Pentagon chief.

“I have been a firm believer in removing the archaic combat exclusion policy for many years,” Sanchez said in a statement. “I am happy to hear the secretary will be making significant changes as part of an effort to expand opportunities for women in the military.”

But Gates says Control-Alt-Delete was a ""mistake""

The designer credited with the shortcut has deflected responsibility

Gates made comments at a recent Harvard University event

If you pressed Control-Alt-Delete to log on before reading this, Bill Gates says he's sorry.

The Microsoft founder says the triple-key login should have been made easier, à la Apple's Macs, but that a designer insisted on the more complicated step.

""We could have had a single button. But the guy who did the IBM keyboard design didn't want to give us our single button,"" Gates said Saturday during a question-and-answer session to launch a Harvard University fund-raising campaign. His comments have gained attention since a video of his Harvard Q&A was posted on YouTube on Tuesday.

Smiling, Gates tried to follow through on the thought, noting it was a basic security feature. But he eventually surrendered to common sense.

""And so we had ... we programmed at a low level that you had to ... it was a mistake,"" he said, throwing up his hands to laughter and applause from the crowd.

Gates defended innovation on the earliest Microsoft software though.

""We did some clever stuff,"" he said. ""We were able to experiment with a lot of stuff, but more on the software side than the hardware.""

Long the first interface step for PC users, Control-Alt-Delete still exists in Windows 8 as a way of either locking the computer or accessing the control panel. While the system defaults to a log-in screen, users may tweak their settings to return to the old way of logging on to Windows.

Sometimes informally called the ""three-fingered salute,"" the login required users to use both hands and was intended to avoid accidental keystrokes from rebooting a computer.

Engineer David Bradley, a designer on early IBM computers, said he invented the combination as a shortcut during development.

""I originally intended for it to be what we would now call an Easter egg -- just something we were using in development and it wouldn't be available elsewhere,"" Bradley said while appearing on a 2011 panel that included Gates. ""But then (software publishers) found out about it. They were trying to figure out how to tell somebody to start up one of their programs, and they had the answer. Just put the diskette in, hit Control-Alt-Delete, and by magic your program starts.""

He then tried to deflect what he perhaps wryly called ""credit"" for its continued use.

""It was like a five-minute job in doing it. I didn't realize that I was going to create a cultural icon when I did it,"" he said ""... I may have invented it, but I think Bill made it famous.""

A tight-lipped Gates appears to force a smile i n a video of the panel but does not respond.

Gates attended Harvard until he left during his junior year to start Microsoft with Paul Allen in 1975. While at Harvard, he lived down the hall from current Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer. Gates received an honorary degree in 2007.

Gates remains Microsoft's chairman although he stopped full-time work at the company in 2008.

During Saturday's session, Gates reflected on a variety of topics, from the philanthropy he's made his life's work since stepping back from an active role at Microsoft to his company's relationship with Apple in the early days.

That included helping keep what would become Microsoft's fiercest rival afloat in the 1990s when it was foundering.

""In the Apple II era, we were kind of friendly competitors,"" he said. ""We actually put more people on the Mac than Apple had.""

When co-founder Steve Jobs returned to Apple in 1996, ""he sort of says, 'I want this, this and this and I'll give you this, this and this.' ... We did the deal in three days,"" Gates said.

That included buying a 6% share of Apple, which lawyers convinced Gates that Microsoft shouldn't keep for antitrust reasons.

""It would have been nice if we had,"" he said."

It began with a bankruptcy sale in 1933, when a Republican businessman and presidential confidant reinvented himself as a newspaper publisher in the nation’s capital. It ended with an announcement that his descendants had sold the newspaper to an Internet wizard who lives in the Washington on the other side of the country.

In between, The Washington Post and the family collectively known as the Grahams became inseparable, indistinguishable. They were journalism royalty known around the world but remained as distinctly Washington as the cop on the beat. Which one of them was.

From Eugene Meyer to Philip L. Graham to Katharine Graham to Donald E. Graham to Katharine Weymouth, it was always a question of when power would shift from one generation to the next, not whether it would.

Until Monday. The Graham family — an icon of both Washington and journalism for the newspaper it led — had made a startling decision. The Post, they said, would be better off with somebody else.

“We have loved the paper, what it stood for, and those who produced it,” said a letter from Donald Graham, the Washington Post Co. chairman and chief executive. “But the point of our ownership has always been that it was supposed to be good for the Post.”

Timeline The major events that have shaped the Washington Post Co.

He added: “We were certain the paper would survive under our ownership, but we wanted it to do more than that. We wanted it to succeed.”

It was the same 80 years earlier, when Meyer, a wealthy native Californian, sent a representative to the steps of The Post’s former headquarters on E Street. His winning bid for the bankrupt newspaper was $825,000, and he was not disclosed as the new owner for 12 days.

He drafted the announcement of the sale and stated his intentions: “It will be conducted as an independent paper devoted to the best interests of the people of Washington and vicinity, and hopes to have their interest and support.”

By the time Meyer was 40, in 1915, his fortune was said to be in the $50 million to $60 million range. When he bought The Post, he was 57 and most recently had been chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.

He stressed the “independent” part to dispel rumors that the paper would become a mouthpiece for the Republican Party. He said seven principles would guide The Post, the last of which was: “The newspaper shall not be the ally of any special interest, but shall be fair and free and wholesome in its outlook on public affairs and public men.”

Meyer poured his fortune into The Post and was an enthusiastic cheerleader. He was said to have tried to sell a subscription to the driver before he exited a cab.

But the real change for The Post came 21 years after the purchase, when Meyer and his son-in-law Philip L. Graham bought out its morning rival, the Washington Times-Herald. “For the Post, it meant a doubling of circulation, a morning monopoly and within five years the overtaking of the traditional advertising leader in Washington, The Star,” Post reporter Chalmers Roberts wrote in a history of the paper.

Graham was brilliant and charismatic, a former Supreme Court clerk with big ambitions and serious problems. He became publisher at 31, and Meyer arranged for him to hold more stock in the company than his own daughter Katharine because, he explained to her, “no man should be in the position of working for his wife.” Mrs. Graham did not object.

“I increasingly saw my role as the tail to his kite and the more I felt overshadowed, the more it became a reality,” Katharine Graham wrote in her Pulitzer Prize-winning autobiography, “Personal History.”

Philip Graham struggled with mental illness and committed suicide in 1963; his 47-year-old widow was faced with the decision of whether to sell the paper or run it herself.

It was the beginning of a long career for Katharine Graham that coincided with — and came to symbolize — two powerful trends. The first was the role of women as leaders in American life. The second was the rise of Washington’s permanent elite, an orbit of the unelected that grew along with the federal city and exercised soft power on those who had hard power.

Graham became both the leading woman in American business and a center of connection and influence in Washington society. When Graham later penned her bestselling memoir, writer Nora Ephron wrote in a review: “The story of her journey from daughter to wife to widow to woman parallels to a surprising degree the history of women in this century.”

Graham’s legacy at The Post was defined by her choice of editor, Benjamin C. Bradlee, and by a series of journalistic crises. In 1971, a judge had ordered the New York Times to stop publishing reports about the Pentagon Papers, a secret official history of the Vietnam War. The Post obtained its own copy. “Frightened and tense, I took a big gulp and said, ‘Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead. Let’s go. Let’s publish,’ ” Graham recalled saying.

She was best known for her support of Bradlee and two reporters, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, during their reporting on the Watergate break-in. That story, which had been scoffed at by big-name reporters at The Post and elsewhere, led to the resignation of President Richard M. Nixon and became the most famous in the history of American journalism.

“It was a small group of people on the Metro staff against the world. Except we had the backing of Ben Bradlee and Katharine Graham,” said Leonard Downie Jr., who was an editor on the metropolitan staff during Watergate and served as executive editor from 1991 to 2008.

Katharine Graham later faced down a strike from the paper’s pressmen’s union in 1975, a tense period in which presses were vandalized and daily copy was ferried out by helicopter to other printing facilities.

In 1979, 33-year-old Donald E. Graham became the next generation to run The Post. “Today, as in the rest of my life, my mother has given me everything but an easy act to follow,” he said.

Donald Graham joked often about how he got his job, but he worked hard to expand what had been a life of privilege. He served in Vietnam and learned all aspects of The Post: He worked as a reporter and editor, advertising salesman, production supervisor, and in many other roles on the business and editorial staffs of The Post.

But before that, he became a police officer because, as his mother said, he wanted “to become acquainted with the city, its people, and its problems.”

As regal as Katharine Graham could be, Donald Graham was a down-to-Earth publisher with better sources in the city and the region than most of his paper’s reporters. He prided himself on knowing the names of everyone who worked in the building.

“I hated getting into an elevator with Don, because I have a terrible memory for names,” Downie said. “He knew all the people from the ninth floor to the sub-basement.”

It is impossible to overstate how close the paper’s employees felt to the owners. When reporters picked up the check for lunch or dinner with sources, the standard line was: “The Grahams are paying.”

The fifth member of the family to run the paper is Katharine Weymouth, Donald Graham’s niece and a lawyer with degrees from Harvard and Stanford. Weymouth was announced as publisher on Feb. 7, 2008.

“Our rate of success with publishers named Katharine has been outstanding,” Donald Graham said in making the announcement.

Weymouth grew up in New York City, the daughter of Katharine Graham’s daughter Lally Weymouth. The stories she recalls hearing about the Graham family involved its influence in Washington: Phil Graham helping put Lyndon B. Johnson on the Democratic ticket in 1960; Ronald Reagan turning up at her grandmother’s birthday parties.

Weymouth inherited a very different business from what Donald and Katharine Graham had been given. Morning newspapers everywhere had long functioned as near-monopolies, making enough money to insulate owners and journalists from the grim details of profit and loss.

But the Internet had derailed that model, in Washington and everywhere else.

“The increase in digital income is not nearly as great as the loss in advertising income. And that’s the problem,” Downie said. He recalled hearing worries about the trend long before Weymouth took the publisher’s job. “She did not preside over this change. The change began well before her.”

At the same annual meeting where Weymouth’s promotion was announced, the company also revealed a new round of buyouts for newsroom employees. And it said it would close one of its two printing plants.

During Weymouth’s tenure as publisher, the problems at The Post — and other papers — have worsened. Post circulation fell from 638,000 on weekdays to about 450,000 for the first six months of 2013. The newspaper’s revenue dropped as well. The company’s newspaper division took in $801 million in Weymouth’s first year as publisher and $582 million in 2012 — a decline of more than 25 percent.

Weymouth’s early tenure was also marred by a scandal over proposed “salons,” where The Post would connect high-paying business interests to government officials. In 2012, she replaced the first editor she had hired to run the newsroom, Marcus Brauchli, with Boston Globe editor Martin Baron.

Weymouth said she and Donald Graham together decided that The Post needed a new owner who was more like her great-grandfather: wealthy enough to buy the paper and make it again a private company.

“What I said to Don [was] if the journalism is the mission — and it is — then you can make an argument that The Post [Company] is no longer the best place to house The Post,” Weymouth said Monday.

Did she consider whether Katharine Graham, her grandmother, would have approved?

“It didn’t play a role. She’s not here,” Weymouth said. “Times have changed, and we need to do what we think is best for The Post.”

Weymouth will stay on as publisher, and she described herself as “actually pretty excited.” But for the first time in 80 years, the paper will be out of her family’s ultimate control.

“The Graham family legacy is not as important as The Washington Post’s legacy,” Weymouth said."

(JASON REED/Reuters)

On the walls of Jay Carney’s office: a photo of the Berlin Wall being dismantled. Snaps of his kids. His employer, President Obama, gracing the cover of his former employer, Time magazine. A tier of clocks labeled London, Baghdad, Beijing.

And below that, a framed copy of “Bee Thousand,” Carney’s favorite album by his favorite band, Guided by Voices. Those black scribbles? Lead singer Robert Pollard’s autograph.

“It’s pretty awesome,” Carney says, sounding half-proud, half-exhausted.

It’s Wednesday afternoon in the West Wing and the White House press secretary has been trundling through some of the most punishing days of his career. Benghazi and the IRS have kept Carney scrambling, and he hasn’t had much time to listen to “English Little League,” the latest album from the Ohio indie-rock band he has affectionately name-dropped in more than one news briefing.

The first time was a flub, with Carney invoking Guided by Voices guitarist Mitch Mitchell when he meant to name Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. Happens all the time.

The second time was a shout out, with Carney describing Dayton, Ohio, as “the home of the Wright brothers, the Dayton Peace Accords and Guided by Voices, the greatest rock-and-roll band in the modern era.”

No one in the press corps challenged him on the last part — “It’s not a particularly music-oriented crowd out there,” Carney says — and the high praise quickly made its way back to the band.

“Obviously the word ‘wow’ came to mind,” Pollard writes in an e-mail. “Of course, anyone who likes my music means a lot to me but it’s even a little more special when it’s coming from a very seriously high echelon of thinkers like those cats in the White House.”

These days, Pollard dodges the media in ways that Carney probably wishes he could. The 55-year-old frontman hasn’t given an interview since 2011, but evidence of his beer-soaked brilliance springs eternal.

Formed in 1983, Guided by Voices would become one of the most prolific and beloved lo-fi indie acts of the ’90s — a cult band whose cult includes Eddie Vedder, Steven Soderbergh, Chloe Sevigny, the Strokes and the White House press secretary. “English Little League” is the group’s 20th studio album, and Pollard is scheduled to release his 19th solo album, “Honey Locust Honky Tonk,” in July. Although the band doesn’t have any Washington tour dates on the calendar, should Pollard ever be invited to a beer summit in the Rose Garden, he promises to drink twice as much as the president and Carney.

Carney, who has fronted “terrible, terrible” garage bands since his adolescence, says he always has been drawn to the idea of regular dudes making extraordinary rock-and-roll. But above all, Guided by Voices songs simply make him happy.

“I just think Pollard is brilliant and funny and has a level of creativity in abundance that is just astonishing. It’s all essential listening if you can keep up with his production,” he says. “I used to until I had this job.”

Carney, 48, fell for Guided by Voices in 1995, two years after returning to Washington from Moscow, where he was reporting for Time. He was hosting a party with journalist John Heilemann when a pack of pals rolled in from the Black Cat. Carney remembers them saying, “ ‘We have just seen the greatest show ever in the history of rock-and-roll!’ ”

The next summer, Carney caught Guided by Voices on a parking lot side stage at the annual HFStival outside RFK Stadium. “Far from their best,” Carney says of the performance, but it didn’t stop him and his friends from trekking to see the band at New York’s Irving Plaza and a shabby Philadelphia club that Carney remembers as “a hallway at the end of which bands played.”

Over the years, some of Carney’s superfan travel buddies have doubled as his bandmates. They gather once every year or two under names such as the Shirlington Temples and Cash Bar Wedding to record songs that Carney promises nobody will ever hear. The lineup includes Eli Attie, a television writer and former special assistant to Bill Clinton; David Segal, a New York Times reporter and former Washington Post pop music critic; Post contributor Dave McKenna; and deputy national security adviser Antony Blinken, who helped Carney land a spot in then-Sen. Joseph Biden’s media office in 2008.

So if you look at Carney’s career path in a “Lost” sort of way, he may never have been hired as the president’s mouthpiece in 2011 had Guided by Voices not thrown down so hard at the Black Cat in 1995.

White House communications director Jennifer Palmieri taps on the door of Carney’s office and glides in wearing a smile. “Is this, like, the greatest thing ever for you?” she asks.

“This interview is going until midnight,” Carney says — but of course it won’t because the spokesman for the most powerful man on the planet has another meeting in 10 minutes. But he promises to download “English Little League” and e-mail his thoughts in the morning.

And he does: “Every GBV album contains at least a few songs I know will stay on my playlist for years. ‘Flunky Minnows’ is one of those. Kind of like ‘Unsinkable Fats Domino.’ Just another pop-rock gem. I hope they keep at it. For sheer creative abundance, Bob is in a class of his own.”

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

News that the insurance giant was considering joining a shareholder suit led by former Chief Executive Maurice “Hank” Greenberg provoked outrage and undermined AIG’s high-profile advertising campaign thanking America for the bailout.

The company’s board met Wednesday to listen to presentations about the federal suit by Greenberg’s Starr International Co., which alleges the U.S. government shortchanged AIG shareholders in a bailout that at one point had taxpayers on the hook for more than $182 billion.

Quiz: How well do you remember 2012?

AIG took about $125 billion of the money and the government received a 92% ownership stake in the company. Last month, the Treasury sold its last shares of AIG stock, formally ending the bailout with a $22.7 billion profit.

AIG said the board had a fiduciary responsibility to shareholders to consider joining the suit, a move that Starr had demanded. But the board quickly decided not to join the suit.

“In considering and ultimately refusing the demand before us, the board of directors properly and fully executed our fiduciary and legal obligations to AIG and its shareholders,” Robert S. “Steve” Miller, AIG’s chairman, said Wednesday.

“America invested in 62,000 AIG employees, and we kept our promise to rebuild this great company, repay every dollar America invested in us, and deliver a profit to those who put their trust in us,” he continued. “To date, AIG has returned $205 billion to America, including a profit of $22.7 billion. We continue to thank America for its support.”

More states taking on the issue

Vermont%2C Connecticut%2C Washington have advanced legislation

Agriculture increasingly turning to genetically altered crops

From Maine to Washington, a growing number of states are taking on the issue of genetically engineered foods, fanning the flames of a decades-old debate about whether the products are dangerous to human health.

This month, Connecticut became the first state to pass a law requiring the labeling of food made from genetically modified organisms (GMOs). In May, the Vermont House passed a similar bill, which will now be taken up by the Senate. Right to Know GMO , a self-described grass-roots coalition with members in 37 states, counts 26 states that have introduced labeling bills.

In Washington state, a referendum on GMO labeling is scheduled for November. Last November, a referendum in California failed 53-47 after the biotech industry spent nearly $45 million on opposition ads.

At the federal level, Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., introduced a bill in April – separate from the farm bill – that would direct the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to ""clearly label"" genetically engineered foods. Boxer notes she has 11 co-sponsors of the bill, which she first introduced in 2000. Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., introduced the House version.

Boxer also attached two amendments to the farm bill, one saying that the United States should join the 64 other nations, including those in the European Union, that have labeling requirements for genetically engineered foods. The other amendment requires a report in six months from several federal agency heads reviewing the labeling methods used internationally, and the ""probable impacts"" of having differing labeling requirements passed by states rather than a federal standard.

""As more and more states take action, I believe lawmakers in Washington will realize that Congress and the FDA must ensure that all Americans know what's in the food they're eating,"" Boxer said in an e-mail.

""The companies have such complete control over who can do independent research into the nature of these things and their impact that we really don't know very much,"" said Andrea Stander, executive director of Rural Vermont, a non-profit farm advocacy group. ""We don't know nearly as much as we should.""

The FDA ruled in 1992 that genetically engineered foods are not ""materially different"" from their traditional counterparts and therefore do not have to be labeled, a ruling opponents of GMOs won't accept.

Monsanto, based in St. Louis, Mo., is a leading supplier of seeds for genetically engineered crops to farmers in the United States and around the world, and a frequent target of protests against GMOs. The company has clearly stated why it is opposed to labeling, saying mandatory labeling ""could imply that food products containing these ingredients are somehow inferior to their conventional or organic counterparts.""

About 90% of the corn, cotton, soybeans and sugar beets grown in the United States are genetically engineered, according to BIO, the trade group representing Monsanto, Bayer, Dow, DuPont and other giant firms that dominate the industry.

The modifications to the DNA of seeds, which started in the mid-1990s, fall into two categories: seeds that have built-in genetic resistance to insects, forgoing the need for insecticides, and seeds that tolerate herbicides, making it possible to spray crops, such as soy beans, that are prone to weeds.

Genetic engineering is the fastest growing technology in the history of agriculture, with upward of 17 million farmers around the world using genetically altered seeds, BIO spokeswoman Karen Batra said.

The problem with requiring labels on genetically engineered foods, Batra said, is that they would imply those foods are unsafe.

""In the United States, food packaging labels are reserved to convey food safety information about allergens that might be in a food or to convey nutritional composition,"" she said. ""If the federal government were to mandate by law that a particular food product needed to be labeled that would infer it would be for a safety reason.""

D'Ambrosio also reports for The Burlington (Vt.) Free Press"

If someone wants to say, ""No, you're not white, you're a Heeb, man,"" my reaction is going to be, ""Okay, whatever.""

But I've occasionally met fellow Ashkenazi Jews who do not consider themselves white. These people point out correctly that Jews were once considered nonwhite in the United States. Of course, the same was true for many European ethnicities, including Germans and Irish. (There's a book called How Jews Became White Folks, and another called How the Irish Became White.) This has far more to do with social status than with biology, but then that's always been the way race has worked in our society.

The thing is, as an Orthodox Jew, I find the question ""Are Jews white?"" rather silly. Jews, according to Judaism, are not a race nor a subset of a race. A Jew is traditionally defined as either one who has a Jewish mother, or a non-Jew who converts to Judaism. Thus, ancestry plays a strong role in Jewish identity, but it isn't the whole picture. Wikipedia describes Jews as an ethnoreligious group, a concept largely unknown in the West but not uncommon in other parts of the world.

There are in fact Jews of all races and colors. People of African and Asian descent have converted to Judaism, or have been adopted into Jewish families and raised as Jews. (I personally know several such individuals.) There are a few historical Jewish groups who are clearly nonwhite, most notably Beta Israel (Ethiopian), Bene Israel (Indian), and Kaifeng Jews (Chinese).

Still, those are exceptions. Most Jews in the world are divided into three broad groupings: Ashkenazi, Sephardi, and Mizrahi. Ashkenazim, those with a family history in Eastern and Central Europe, tend to be relatively lighter-complexioned on average than Sephardim and Mizrahim, and since they constitute the majority of Jews in the United States, they have dominated the popular American image of the Jew.

The term Mizrahi (literally ""Oriental"") is generally applied to Jews with a family history in the Middle East and North Africa. Sephardi is a confusing term. Strictly speaking, it is used to designate Jews with a family history in Spain or Portugal. In the late 1400s, Iberian Jews who refused to convert to Christianity were expelled from the peninsula and settled in various other countries throughout Europe, Asia, North Africa, and even the New World. Because they are so widespread, Sephardi has come to be used as a virtual synonym for ""non-Ashkenazi."" While this practice is not strictly accurate, it is pervasive in the media.

Some people perceive that Ashkenazim are white but Sephardim and Mizrahim are nonwhite. A while ago, the New York Times ran an article about the debate over Christopher Columbus's ethnic origins. When it came to the hypothesis that Columbus was Jewish or of Jewish descent, it made the following curious remark (this quote isn't in the online version of the article): ""Most Jews in Southern Europe at the time were Sephardic Jews of North African descent, but preliminary analysis of Columbus's DNA suggests he was Caucasian.""

This statement shows ignorance of the fact that genetic studies suggest a close kinship between Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jews. And I have no idea where the author of this article got the idea that European Sephardim were of ""North African descent.""

The racial status of Jews ties into the racial status of Arabs and other Middle Eastern groups. Are Arabs white? According to census forms, they are. But in popular imagination, they are often distinguished from whites. Of course many Arabs show evidence of having a mixed racial background. But the same is true of Jews from the same countries. Yemenite Jews often look black or nearly black. Paula Abdul is partly of Syrian Jewish ancestry (the other part is Ashkenazi) and many people have incorrectly identified her as black.

Many anti-Zionists have seized upon the largely discredited Khazar hypothesis, which supposes that most Ashkenazim are descended from European converts, and therefore are more ethnically European than Middle Eastern. There's no question that Jews mixed to some degree with the native populations of the countries in which they settled, and European Jews are no exception, but the evidence suggests that overall Jews are still fundamentally a Middle Eastern people.

Jews and Arabs are in fact closely related, and in Israel, where the Jewish population is about half non-Ashkenazi, it is often hard to tell the two groups apart. Race may be an imprecise scientific concept, but as long as we're going to invoke racial classifications, we might as well try to be a little consistent. And classifying Jews as white but Arabs as nonwhite is the height of absurdity.

In sum, I don't care what race you consider Jews to be, if any, as long as you're consistent and show at least some knowledge and understanding of the complex history and social dynamics of the Jewish people."
http://news.yahoo.com/tea-party-targeting-southern-co-power-monopoly-144330621.html,,[],Tea party targeting Southern Co. power monopoly,"ATLANTA (AP) — The Southern Co. makes billion-dollar decisions that affect millions of people in Georgia, yet it has attracted little political scrutiny — until now.

Leaders of the Atlanta Tea Party are challenging Southern Co. subsidiary Georgia Power over the monopoly's reluctance to increase its use of solar power, the ballooning costs of building a new nuclear power plant and even its legal right to monopoly status.

The group's action in Georgia seems relatively rare among the loosely linked tea party organizations nationally.

Other tea party groups have condemned the adoption of ""smart"" utility meters — which transmit information about customer usage — due to concerns that they would intrude on customers' privacy, or have broadly backed less reliance on foreign energy. But relatively few have endorsed so specific an energy platform in their own backyards, much less promised to campaign on it.

""It certainly isn't anything personal, but one of our core values is promoting the free-market system,"" said Julianne Thompson, a co-founder of the Atlanta Tea Party.

The electricity market in Georgia is not a free market. State law gives electric utilities, including Georgia Power, exclusive rights to serve customers in designated areas of the state. Most customers cannot choose their provider.

While monopolies have more power to charge higher prices than firms in competitive markets, there are times when it makes sense to allow them if their prices are regulated.

It would be more expensive to build more than one system of electric wires or natural gas pipelines to deliver power and fuel to every home in a state. Customers are better off if just one system is built and maintained, as long as the company that runs the system is prohibited by regulators from using its monopoly power to drive up prices.

In many states, including Texas and most of the Northeast, power delivery is regulated, but customers can choose who provides their electricity. Customers in those states can choose from companies that provide such options as renewable power or a slate of pricing options, including fixed rates, rates that vary with market fluctuations, or rates that vary based on when during the day power is used.

Story continues

Georgia Power makes a natural political foil for the tea party. A 2011 poll conducted by Yale University and George Mason University found that tea party members were far more likely than Democrats, Republicans or independents to distrust central authority and strongly opposed energy policies that raise costs, even if there are other benefits.

Yale University researcher Anthony Leiserowitz, who worked on the poll, said he was not surprised local tea party supporters might challenge a monopoly.

""That totally taps into that same sense that there are these big, institutional forces against which you're a little guy and you need to rebel,"" he said.

Utility officials say they welcome the involvement of tea party groups.

""We listen carefully to the concerns and ideas of the Tea Party, as well as all other organizations that represent the diverse opinions of Georgians,"" company spokesman Jacob Hawkins said in a statement.

The tea party locally has proved successful at getting its supporters to pressure Georgia's leaders into action. Thompson's group was part of a coalition that leaned on reluctant Republicans to pass limits on Statehouse lobbying, and they are working on a voter identification and education project ahead of the 2014 elections to increase their clout and boost turnout.

Earlier this month, Debbie Dooley, another co-founder of the Atlanta Tea Party, urged the state's elected utility regulators on the Public Service Commission, all Republicans, to force Georgia Power to use more solar energy. The commission is currently debating whether to approve Georgia Power's latest plan for meeting the state's long-term energy needs.

Dooley actually wants to go much further. She says if her organization viewed it as politically possible, it would support repealing a law granting monopoly rights to utilities.

""They can protect their business and say, 'We don't want the competition.' They have veto power,"" Dooley said. ""It would be like Wal-Mart saying, 'Hey we don't want Kmart here. We don't want them to build.'""

Dooley personally endorsed a Libertarian challenger against Commissioner Stan Wise, a Republican who she said had gotten too close to Georgia Power.

But Wise said he questions how many people Dooley actually represents, and he doubts the solar projects she champions are economical.

""I just almost have to think it's a kneejerk reaction that says if it's solar, it has to be good,"" Wise said. ""And they haven't done their homework on this extraordinary level of subsidy that this program brings to the table.""

The tea party groups are also targeting Georgia Power over the rising cost to build two new nuclear reactors at Plant Vogtle. The utility's share of the project was supposed to cost $6.1 billion, but Georgia Power is seeking permission to raise its budget to $6.85 billion — and cautioned that costs may still increase.

Dooley's group is particularly peeved that Georgia lawmakers are allowing the utility to charge its customers for the project's finance costs before it produces power. This year, tea party members supported legislation from Rep. Jeff Chapman, R-Brunswick, that would trim the utility's profits if it goes over budget building the plant. Chapman's bill did not pass, though it could be considered next year.

Georgia Power argues the plant makes economic sense in the long run. The utility says the nuclear plant will be immune to swings in natural gas prices and will not be affected by limits on carbon emissions if they are enacted in the years to come.

Dooley said she supports nuclear power but wants more accountability. Under state law, Georgia Power's customers must pay for the nuclear plant unless regulators find its costs were unreasonable.

""They are guaranteed to make a profit on the cost overruns,"" Dooley said. ""What incentive is there to come in on budget, on time?""

The hour-long affair was more like a conversation between the like-minded on issues such as the ongoing budget battles and going around Congress by raising the debt ceiling by executive fiat. Anyone who remembers the non-stop confrontation directed at President Bush just a few years ago, by this same group of reporters, would not recognize them today.

Not a single reporter confronted Obama over the violent rhetoric he and his administration have been using to describe Republicans, or even the fact that as a Senator, Obama voted against raising the debt ceiling — a position he is now describing as dangerous, irresponsible and akin to hostage-taking.

In fact, in this briefing, Obama used the words “hostage, insane, ransom, nuclear bomb, chaos, disaster.”

Mark Knoller of CBS News is the only reporter that asked the president about the individual compromise spending bills the GOP have passed to fund the parks, veterans, and National Institutes of Health, among other items. Obama swatted away the question with talking points without being challenged on the fact that this veto threat means children suffering from cancer will not get treatment from the NIH.

No reporter even asked about the ObamaCare launch debacle.

Here are some of the questions that were asked:

—

Julie Pace of AP Q: Thank you, Mr. President. Obviously if Congress does pass a clean CR and a clean debt ceiling bill, those may just be short-term measures. If that happens, does your offer to negotiate with them on issues like health care and spending and deficit reduction still stand in the intervening weeks if they pass measures that are just perhaps six weeks or two months long? — Julianna Goldman. Q: Thank you, Mr. President. You laid out the economic consequences of default, but if we were to get to that point, would you prioritize and pay bondholders first to maintain the semblance of credit or — rather than Social Security recipients or military servicemen and women? And how would you go ahead and make that determination? — Sam Stein, Huffington Post. Q: Thank you, Mr. President. With Speaker Boehner so far unwilling to hold a vote on a clean CR, what assurances can you give to those affected by a shutdown who are concerned about an even longer impasse? And how worried are you personally that your preferred solution to this clean CR and sequestration levels may do harm to the nation’s economy and your second-term agenda? — Roberta Rampton. Q: Thanks. You talked a bit about the hit to credibility around the world that this impasse has caused. I’m wondering what you and your administration are telling worried foreign creditors, China and Japan, who are calling and then asking about whether the United States is going to avoid defaulting on its debts? — Ari Shapiro. Q: Thank you, Mr. President. You mentioned the Supreme Court, and the term started today with a campaign finance case that sort of picks up where Citizens United left off. You called Citizens United devastating to the public interest, so I wonder if you could weigh in on this latest case.

Respected members of the media also described the performance of their colleagues in the press corps as “pathetic.”

(CNN) —

The Mississippi man accused of making a potent toxin found in letters mailed to President Barack Obama and other officials will be held without bond pending a preliminary hearing later this week, a federal magistrate ruled Monday.

Federal authorities arrested James Everett Dutschke, 41, on Saturday on charges of possessing and using ricin after initially charging – and then clearing – another man with whom Dutschke has sometimes feuded.

Wearing an orange jumpsuit, and his hands and feet shackled as he entered the courtroom, Dutschke told Magistrate S. Allan Alexander that he understood what he had been charged with.

His attorney, George Lucas, told Alexander that they had not yet had time to go through the complaint.

Alexander agreed to order Dutschke held without bond on grounds he could be a danger to the community or could try to run.

She set a preliminary hearing for Thursday.

Both Lucas and Assistant U.S. Attorney Chad Lamar declined to comment.

While the eight-minute proceeding produced no new details, the public could learn more about the accusations when the criminal affidavit in support of the complaint is unsealed.

That is now expected to occur at the preliminary hearing, according to the Justice Department.

Dutschke’s arrest was the latest head-scratching twist in what could be a tale of small-town intrigue that blew up to become international news.

The letters – sent to Obama, Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, and Sadie Holland, a local judge, arrived April 16 and touched off anxieties in Washington and elsewhere in the wake of the bombing of the Boston Marathon. The two incidents were unconnected, officials said.

Before police settled on Dutschke as a suspect, they took into custody a Corinth, Mississippi, man named Paul Kevin Curtis, who makes his living impersonating Elvis, Buddy Holly and Randy Travis.

Curtis vehemently denied sending the letters, said he was framed and identified Dutschke as a potential culprit.

What is ricin?

The ties that bind

Dutschke used to work for Curtis’ brother at an insurance company, under the direction of Curtis’ ex-wife.

Curtis has said that while Dutschke worked for his brother, the two talked about collaborating on the publication of a book but later had a falling out.

He has accused Dutschke of stalking him online, a claim the latter has denied.

In an April 22 court hearing before the charges were dropped, Curtis said he was being framed and identified Dutschke as a potential culprit.

Dutschke told reporters last week that he did not know Curtis well.

“He’s just a little nutty,” he said. “I don’t have a relationship with him.”

The ties that bind II

So where do the lawmakers fit in?

Dutschke can be linked to Sadie Holland through her son, Democratic state representative Steve Holland.

Dutschke failed in a bid as a Republican to unseat the younger Holland.

As for Curtis, Sadie Holland presided over a 2004 assault hearing involving Curtis, who says he has been in jail “over 20 times,” but never convicted.

And Wicker?

Dutschke said he once met Wicker.

Suspect No. 1

The letters read, in part: “To see a wrong and not expose it, is to become a silent partner to its continuance.”

They were signed “I am KC and I approve this message,” a source told CNN.

Each letter had a Memphis, Tennessee, postmark and no return address.

The very next day, authorities arrested Curtis.

His attorney, Christi McCoy, said he’d been framed by someone who used several phrases Curtis likes to use on social media.

The FBI said the letters tested positive for ricin, a toxin derived from castor beans that has no known antidote.

The very next week, authorities dropped the charges against Curtis after they said they had new information.

“I think now, how many people are thrown in jail because of circumstantial evidence and someone can frame you that easily,” he told CNN last week after being cleared.

Suspect No. 2

The feds then turned their attention to Dutschke.

Agents searched his residence and former martial arts studio. Dutschke told CNN affiliate WMC-TV that he agreed to the FBI search “to help clear my name.”

“I had absolutely nothing to do with those letters,” he said.

Early Saturday, he was arrested without incident at home. He was charged with possession and use of a biological agent as a weapon in connection with the letters.

More trouble

This isn’t his only brush with the law.

Dutschke faces molestation charges in an unrelated case.

According to a grand jury indictment handed up this month and obtained by CNN, Dutschke is accused of molesting three girls under the age of 16. He has repeatedly denied the charges in interviews with local media and pleaded not guilty in court this month.

Dutschke closed his tae kwon do studio after the allegations were made public.

Dutschke was previously convicted on indecent exposure charges in another case and sentenced to 90 days in jail.

A song in his heart

As for Curtis, he told CNN he’s “just glad it’s over.”

When he learned Dutschke had been arrested, he took a deep breath and felt like “a weight had been taken off.”

“I just want to return to my kids and my music,” Curtis said.

During another interview with CNN last week, he said the public attention could “thrust him into the limelight.”

And then, at the urging of reporter Chris Cuomo, he burst into song.

A rousing rendition of Randy Travis’ “On the Other Hand.”

Gov. Peter Kinder says ""We are better than this""

(CNN) —

A rodeo stunt at the Missouri State Fair has come under criticism after a clown donned a Barack Obama mask and stuck on a broom that descended from his backside.

The stunt took place during the bull riding competition on Saturday night.

Rodeo announcer Mark Ficken, president of the Missouri Cowboy Rodeo Association and a school superintendent, announced a special guest: “President Obama.”

Another voice is heard over the loudspeaker working up the crowd and saying, “We’re going to stomp Obama now.”

“As soon as this bull comes out, Obama, don’t you move,” the second voice said. “He’s going to getcha, getcha getcha, getcha.”

“Hey, I know I’m a clown,” the second voice said. “He’s just running around acting like one. Doesn’t know he is one.”

The stunt sickened Perry Beam, who came to the fair in Sedalia with his wife and a student from Taiwan to “give him a little piece of Americana.”

Beam likened the atmosphere to a Klan rally.

Opinion: Racist taunts at Obama should worry us all

“It wasn’t clean; it wasn’t fun. It was awful; it was sickening,” Beam said, “It was racist.”

The student, Jameson Hsieh, recorded a video of the incident, but had little to say afterward.

“He didn’t say anything. We rode all the way home in silence,” said Beam, who lives 50 miles away in Higginsville. “We were just ashamed, and he didn’t ask any more questions. I think he had seen enough. It is just disgusting.”

Condemnation came from organizers and politicians alike. The Missouri State Fair Commission called it “unacceptable” and said the clown has been banned “from ever participating or performing at the Missouri State Fair again.”

“The commission reiterated that the statements and actions Saturday night were inappropriate and not in keeping with the fair’s standards,” the agency said in a written statement. “The Missouri State Fair apologizes for the unconscionable stunt.”

The board of directors at Missouri Rodeo Cowboy Association also issued an apology.

“The Sport of Rodeo is not meant to be a political platform. We are taking measures by training and educating our contract acts to prevent anything like this from ever happening again,” a statement on the group’s website said. “All Members of the Missouri Rodeo Cowboy Association are very proud of our Country and our President.”

And Republican Lt. Gov. Peter Kinder called for those responsible to be held accountable.

“I condemn the actions disrespectful to POTUS” – president of the United States – “the other night,” he said in a post to his official Twitter account. “We are better than this.”

U.S. Senator Claire McCaskill echoed Kinder.

“The state fair is funded by taxpayer dollars, and is supposed to be a place where we can all bring our families and celebrate the state that we love,” she said. “But the young Missourians who witnessed this stunt learned exactly the wrong lesson about political discourse, that somehow it’s ever acceptable to, in a public event, disrespect, taunt, and joke about harming the president of our great nation.”

(CNN) —

Dr. Mehmet Oz is being sued for injures sustained by a New Jersey man. Was this person under Dr. Oz’ care? Was he someone Dr. Oz had spoken with about a medical issue? Did Dr. Oz, in an uncharacteristic fit of anger, punch the Jersey guy?

Nope. This man is simply one of the millions of people who have watched Dr. Oz on TV over the years. So why is he suing? Because, the plaintiff claims, he was injured when he tried Dr. Oz’ home sleep remedy known as the “Knapsack Heated Rice Footsie.”

Shake your head in disbelief all you want, but this is far from the most ludicrous lawsuit we have seen in recent years.

Dean Obeidallah

Who can forget the Michigan woman who filed a lawsuit in 2011 against the producers of the film “Drive”? Her complaint alleged that she was misled by the movie’s trailer which promised “Fast and the Furious” type driving, which, alas, the film didn’t deliver.

And then there was the lawsuit filed last year against the Dallas Cowboys by a woman claiming she sustained burns on her legs. What did she say the Cowboys did wrong? She claims they failed to warn her that sitting for an extended period of time on a black bench outside the Cowboys’ stadium on a hot August day could cause burns.

More? Well, while in Tennessee, a couple sued Steak ‘n Shake after their son ingested a sauce labeled “Mega Death Hot Sauce.” It should be noted that the sauce bottle bears the image of a skull engulfed in flames.

And that brings us to Dr. Oz. On his April 17, 2012, show, he offered advice about how to sleep better. One suggestion was filling the toe of a pair of socks with uncooked rice. The socks were then to be placed in the microwave and heated until warm. However, Dr. Oz expressly warned viewers, “Don’t get it too hot, just warm.”

The heated footsie was then to be worn for 20 minutes. The reasoning being that the heated socks will cause blood to be diverted to your feet, which in turn will cool the rest of your body. As Dr. Oz explained, “you’re going to be able to sleep better because your body has to be cold in order to be sleepy.”

However, the plaintiff claims that he suffered third degree burns from this remedy. How? Well, he apparently fell asleep with the socks on and didn’t realize his feet had been burned until he woke up in the middle of night and tried to walk. The plaintiff also claims that Dr. Oz should have offered a specific warning to avoid using this remedy to people who, like him, have diabetes and hence less feeling in their feet.

Let’s be honest: These above lawsuits are at best legally questionable and at worst frivolous. But don’t blame the person seeking the money. Blame the lawyers.

Personal injury lawyers have enticed people for years with their TV commercials and ads on the walls of buses and trains telling us that if you have been wronged, you might be entitled to a big cash award or settlement. This is, of course, followed by the line: “We don’t get paid unless you do.”

So, understandably, people flock to these lawyers with complaints about every imaginable wrong seeking a payday. The lawyers then file lawsuits, hoping for a quick settlement so that they can do as little work as possible before seeing their own payday.

Full disclosure: When I practiced law, I represented corporations against lawsuits. Consequently, I’m a bit biased against plaintiffs’ lawyers. But it’s easy for even a non-corporate lawyer to see that these ridiculous lawsuits give the reputable plaintiffs’ attorneys – and, frankly, all lawyers – a black eye.

It’s not that I’m without sympathy for the growing number of lawyers out there struggling to make ends meet. The practice of law has grown increasingly competitive and challenging. I can understand the lure of taking a questionable case that will reap you some media coverage and money.

But that’s not a good enough reason to do it. Lawyers need to collectively rein in these types of cases. If they don’t, the government will do it for them under the guise of “tort reform.” The new laws that result would in all likelihood make it harder to file a lawsuit and would limit damages in personal injury cases. And this will make it even more challenging for lawyers to earn a living. Worse, these reforms may prevent some truly injured people from receiving the full compensation they deserve because of caps on damages.

As for Dr. Oz, I hope that he doesn’t settle quickly out of court. Instead, I hope they fully litigate this case. In all likelihood he will prevail. But even if the plaintiff does ultimately win, it still will have sent a clear message to plaintiffs’ attorneys who take these legally questionable cases: If you want money, you are going to have to really earn it.

An employee already has, allegedly.

The owner of Jersey Joe's Pizzeria told HuffPost Weird News today that he's not the guy in a photo circulating around the Internet, showing a white-haired man masturbating in a pizzeria kitchen -- nor is it anyone working at his establishment.

In Jersey Joe's storefront window, the humble eatery proudly displays an ""A"" rating from San Diego's Department of Environmental Health, with a score of 98 on its recent June 3 inspection.

Reporters at the shop showed Giusepp ""Jersey Joe"" Scire the photo, which was posted on the photo-sharing website 4Chan, and then Yelp.

""It is not me [in the photo] and that's not my pizzeria,"" Scire told HuffPost Weird News.

Scire said that he ""fired two guys recently"" and suggested that he might be the victim of a disgruntled ex-employee.

The bombshell dropped on Wednesday, when 4Chan users posted links to several random, unsecured webcams. That's when, those users claim, they found Scire jerking his Joe, and took screenshots. The photo shows a man in a white T-shirt and shorts sitting at a desk with his pepperoni in his hand. The backdrop is a kitchen, complete with a fridge, sink and containers that are used to keep pizzas warm.

Later in the day, a man live-streamed his experience (partial video below) confronting an employee of Jersey Joe's about the photo. The man in one of the the videos -- which doesn't show any lewd acts -- appeared to show Scire serving pizza and then becoming irate when the customer asked him about the masturbation photo.

Critics on Yelp immediately took to Jersey Joe's restaurant page to poke fun at the business.

""The white cheese pizza had an odd taste,"" one user wrote. ""Five stars for such a relaxed gentleman assisting me.""

Another user added, ""So I just watched one of their employees masturbate in the back on their unsecured camera feed."" That user added a link to the circulating photo.

In the restaurant today, Scire said he hadn't heard of the tongue-in-cheek Yelp reviews, saying, ""I'm just going to call the cops.""

As for the taste, HuffPost Weird News executive editor Buck Wolf said the white slice was ""pretty good by non-New York standards.""

Schock Claims Majority of House GOP support Cantor's DREAM Act,"In response to a question at a town hall event this week, Rep. Aaron Schock (R-IL) suggested that a majority of House Republicans support granting amnesty through a GOP version of the DREAM Act to young illegal aliens who were brought to America as minors by their parents.

Schock, a member of the whip team led by House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy, was laying out for constituents his stances on immigration and the House GOP leadership’s plan to deal with the issue later this year.

“They’re going to move one bill after another dealing with all the various issues that were contained in the Senate bill,” Schock said to the town hall, as seen in video posted on YouTube. “So first, the border security bill should be the first bill that moves in the House. I think that’s going to be an easy bill to pass. It passed out of the Homeland Security Committee with almost unanimous support. Almost every Republican and Democrat on Homeland Security voted for the House border security bill. I think that will pass the House and I think that’s a done deal and that’s done with. Then, you’re going to deal with your high-tech visas and your ag visa worker programs. I think, again, you’re going to get overwhelming bipartisan support on those provisions. I don’t know what the final language is going to look like.”

Schock’s outline of the preliminary plan matches what other member of GOP leadership have said. When he got to the third part of the plan, a DREAM Act which is currently being drafted by House Majority Leader Eric Cantor and will eventually be introduced as the KIDS Act, Schock promised there would be a vote on the DREAM Act in the House and promised it would pass with bipartisan support.

“Then you’re going to have a third bill which is going to deal with your DREAM Act kids, those who were brought here illegally by their parents,” Schock said. “I think, again, you’re going to get a bipartisan vote on a House version of the DREAM Act.”

For any immigration bill to be brought to the floor for a vote in the House, Speaker John Boehner has mandated that it must have the support of the majority of House Republicans–known as abiding by the “Hastert Rule,” meaning no bill will come to the floor for a vote without the support of the majority of the majority. For Schock to not only promise it would pass, but that there would even be a vote on the bill, says that, he–a member of the House GOP leadership’s whip team–knows or believes that a majority of House Republicans support the DREAM Act.

Schock’s office has not responded to Breitbart News’ request for comment in response to this declaration and has not publicly provided a whip list of which Republicans he and the rest of McCarthy’s whip team expect to support the amnesty for young illegal aliens.

At the town hall this week, Schock also said he supports a comprehensive immigration bill of the sort opposed by House conservatives. He also promised some kind of amnesty, although not necessarily citizenship, for all illegal aliens would come up for a vote in the House.

“The final bill, which will be the most difficult bill, will be dealing with people who are here currently illegally and the path – what is the solution for that,” Schock said. “There are people in the House who think we should find a way to grant them legal status, but not a path to citizenship. There are other people who say no, it has to be a path to citizenship. My mindset is people should come forward, have to pay a penalty and a fine, there should be a probationary period. I am not in the camp that believes people should have to leave the country in order to get in line. I just happen to believe that’s an unrealistic expectation that 11 million people are going to leave. I think it would be destructive to our economy, number one, and number two, many of them do not have a place to go back to even if they wanted to. And number three, I think it adversely affects the self-identification – if self-identifies and knows now they have to leave. I want whatever we pass to work. I want it to be a real reform bill. And I want it to be constructive to the overall process of having more legal immigration down the road.”

In response to a follow-up question from the town hall audience member who prompted Schock’s immigration remarks, Schock added that he thinks “there should be a pathway to citizenship for anybody who wants to come to America.”

“I think they ought to self-identify, I think they should pay back taxes and I think they should be on a legal probationary program,” Schock said. “So, if you break a law, if you break a law, if you do something wrong, you’re thrown out. But, I don’t think there should be anything stopping anyone who self-identifies, pays their back taxes and continues to pay taxes in our country to get in the back of the line with everyone else who wants to become an American citizen. What I don’t support is giving any kind of preferential treatment to people who are here illegally above those people who are outside our borders currently that are waiting in line.”

In New York in 1944, Christmas packages intended for American servicemen who have been listed as missing or killed in action await ""return to sender"" stamps.

Life.com pays tribute to mail carriers, other postal workers and the U.S. Postal Service in earlier times. Here, a rural Vermont mail carrier makes his rounds in subzero weather.

Story highlights Jay Parini lives in small-town Vermont, and says he will miss Saturday mail deliveries Parini: We are losing the joy of saving, re-reading letters from pen-pals, family and friends Telegraph replaced the Pony Express, he says, just as e-mails have replaced mail Parini treasures his letters of favorite writers: Who will publish collections of e-mails?

Will I get over the end of Saturday deliveries by the U.S. Postal Service? I’m sure I will. But like countless others in this country, I will miss them.

Living in rural Vermont, in a fairly isolated farmhouse overlooking the Green Mountains, I look forward to the mail, which brings news from relatives and friends, Christmas cards, bills, and – most of all – Saturday visits from Bob, who has been arriving at my house for years now, always with good cheer, local gossip and a sense that God’s in his heaven and all’s well with the world.

I remember as a child looking forward to the arrival of Mr. Mail, as my sister and I called him, on Saturday mornings. He was a dour fellow, but we liked him.

Jay Parini

We had no school on Saturdays, so all the children got to know him on that day. He was missing a front tooth, so it was probably a good thing that he rarely smiled. When he did, it was an occasion. I loved him, mostly because he brought regular letters from my pen pal in Sweden – letters with an array of strange, colorful stamps and peculiar tales from abroad.

It was an adjustment when, years later, we had to get used to Miss Fe-Mail, a young woman with masses of blond hair and red lipstick.

The mail has always kept me in touch with the world. As a young man I lived in Scotland for seven years, and loved getting two postal deliveries a day, bringing letters on blue aerograms from home. I would open those fragile blue letters very carefully, so as not to lose words. They were often scribbled in a tiny hand so the author could get as many words as possible within the aerogram’s limited boundaries.

My Scottish postman’s name was Angus, and he told me about his grandfather, who had brought three or four deliveries to every house each day. The mail was like e-mail in those days. If you lived in a city, such as London, you could really send a letter in the morning and expect it to make it across town by the afternoon. Nowadays it can take several days to get a letter from one side of Vermont to another. Sometimes I wonder if we’re still using the Pony Express.

As a boy, I read a book about the Pony Express, and had fantasies about joining it. The express started up in the mid-19th century, with relays of postal workers on horseback who would carry letters from Missouri over the Great Plains, through the Rocky Mountains, to California – and it only took about 10 days. It was the invention of the telegraph that brought this wondrous service to a halt, not unlike the advent of the Internet, which has made the postal service much less relevant to our lives.

E-mails deliver most of our joys and sorrows today, and we conduct routine business in this ephemeral form. Handwritten letters have become precious artifacts. For future biographers, the loss of real letters presents a dilemma. My bookshelf holds volumes of the collected letters of my favorite writers, and I treasure those by John Keats, Lord Byron, Dickens and others. Will anyone ever publish someone’s collected e-mails?

How Amazon could save the U.S. Postal Service

So much of our thinking is about loss, and this is one of the losses we must bear. I doubt that we’ll ever return to obsessive letter-writing, and don’t expect to get many letters from abroad, with brilliantly colored stamps bearing the visage of unknown kings, queens and other eminent people I’ve never heard of. I wonder if I’ll even know the person who brings letters to my house in the years to come.

At least my part of Vermont has Internet access. In the immediate future, the absence of Saturday postal deliveries for rural areas that lack access might have genuine consequences, hurting business and dampening the spirits for people who already feel a bit out of touch.

Everyone would like, I think, to see a robust postal service – the Post Office represents the nation at home. I still make special trips into town, a drive of several miles, to do “business” at the P.O., where I meet friends to exchange gossip, buy special editions of stamps and, for nostalgic reasons, purchase aerograms to send to friends abroad. The bustling atmosphere is cheery, especially at Christmas, when people wait in line to get their odd-shaped boxes weighed and posted.

Postal Service finances show smaller loss, but still in trouble

The postal service will always be part of our lives, and long may it live. I’m sorry about the loss of Saturdays, which may make me feel a little more isolated on weekends at my hilltop house. But who ever thought the government existed to make us happy?

Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (R) called out President Barack Obama for closing the U.S. embassy to the Vatican, questioning whether the decision was political ""retribution"" for Catholic opposition to the Affordable Care Act.

Bush tweeted about the closure on Wednesday evening:

Why would our President close our Embassy to the Vatican? Hopefully, it is not retribution for Catholic organizations opposing Obamacare. — Jeb Bush (@JebBush) November 27, 2013

Last week, the State Department announced that it would be moving the embassy from its standalone Vatican facility to a larger compound shared with the U.S. Embassy in Italy, as well as the U.S. Mission to the United Nations. According to Religion News Service, the move is anticipated to save the government $1.4 million a year.

Conservatives were quick to criticize Obama on the move.

As CNN reports, the National Republican Senatorial Committee described the relocation as ""the latest anti-religion pursuit of this Administration, a slap in the face to Catholic-Americans around the country that weakens America’s position as a global leader.""

""It's not just those who bomb churches and kill Catholics in the Middle East who are our antagonists, but it's also those who restrict our religious freedoms and want to close down our embassy to the Holy See,"" Raymond Flynn, a former envoy to the Vatican, told the National Catholic Reporter.

The administration, however, maintains that the move is not indicative of any strain on the United States' relationship with the Vatican.

According to CNN, a State Department official said the move will result in ""no reduction in diplomatic staff, there’s no reduction in ambassadors, there’s no reduction in mission.""

In a split vote, City Council members cleared the way early Wednesday for FivePoint Communities to build an extra 4,606 homes in the south Orange County city in return for constructing 688 acres of Great Park.

But the agreement is a big departure from what officials promised county voters in 2002 would be America’s next great municipal park, a bucolic landscape that would cover 1,300 acres and include forests, a lake, museums and a 60-foot-deep canyon.

In its place, county residents will get a more active space, with a sports complex twice the size of Disneyland, a wildlife corridor and an 18-hole golf course.

With the approval, FivePoint Communities now has the right to build nearly 10,000 homes around the park land, the former site of the El Toro Marine Corps base. It will be one of the region’s largest housing developments since the recession.

Final approval for the compromise came after a tense meeting, lasting nearly 10 hours, when it appeared that the eventual 3-2 vote could fracture over last-minute negotiations — including whether the city or the developer would control park operations.

To get the deal done, the developer finally agreed to give the city $10 million over time to maintain the park, starting in 2016, and an equal amount to improve the site’s main entrance.

“I will defend to the death Irvine’s ability to run its parks,” Mayor Pro Tem Jeff Lalloway vowed before the final decision.

Earlier, Mayor Steven Choi tried to draw the council together, pleading, “We are in the middle of a historic moment.” He, Christine Shea and Lalloway later voted in favor of the developer’s vision, with council members Beth Krom and Larry Agran dissenting.

To some, the decision stood as a broken promise. The new park, several residents said, lacked the museums and cultural spaces that were part of the original plan. Others said the new look seemed too “theme park-like.”

“They really are developing something that isn’t creating a great public park in any way,” Ken Smith, the New York landscape architect who spent years designing the space, said earlier this month. “It’s just sort of cheap and fast and takes up a lot of space.”

But years of spending and setbacks left city officials with few options.

In 2005, the military sold the land in an online auction to Lennar Corp., which struck a deal with Irvine to transfer about 1,300 acres to the city in return for being able to build thousands of homes. The company also paid Irvine $200 million.

City officials spent much of the money, but completed only about 230 acres of the park. Much of the land remains fenced off, dotted with old military barracks and criss-crossed by aging runways.

The real estate market crash slowed the arrival of the homes, and then Gov. Jerry Brown’s decision to eliminate local redevelopment agencies — the financial engine generating tax funds to continue construction of the park — dealt a crushing blow to Irvine’s plans.

Meanwhile, FivePoint, a Lennar spinoff, moved forward with plans to build homes around Great Park’s perimeter, and had a seller’s interest in making sure the space could be constructed.

“When you have conviction about something, you have to be patient that it will happen,” Emile Haddad, the company’s president and chief executive, said before the council meeting. “I believe this will happen.”

Case over Security Fears,"An assistant U.S. Attorney is Houston has withdrawn from a major prosecution against the Aryan Brotherhood.

The prosecutor, Jay Hileman, sent an email to one of the Brotherhood’s defense attorneys, informing him that he was no longer on the case. It is widely believed that Hileman withdrew due to concerns and his and his family’s security.

In the wake of the horrific murders of Kaufman County DA Mike McLelland and his wife, speculation, fueled by the media, has focused on the Aryan Brotherhood, a drug-trafficking crime syndicate with a significant presence in Texas. Police have not named a suspect in the murders and there is no known evidence tying the criminal gang to the murders, but the widespread media speculation of their involvement is having a dramatic ripple effect.

Hileman was part of a team bringing a major racketeering case against 34 members of the Brotherhood. An important component of the government’s case is based on testimony from a former general of the Brotherhood, who is currently under very tight security.

The Justice Department will replace Hileman with another prosecutor from Washington, DC. The U.S. Attorney’s office in Houston released the following statement:

The case currently pending in the Southern District of Texas has been and will continue to be worked by the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Texas in partnership with the Department of Justice’s Criminal Division.

The Aryan Brotherhood has morphed over the years from a prison gang to a major middleman in the drug trade. Whether or not the gang was involved in the recent murders in Kaufman County, it is clear that the most violent elements of the drug trade are now active in Texas.

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/04/01/Obamas-Enjoy-Vacation-Lifestyle-of-the-One-Percent,2013-04-01 00:00:00,['John Nolte'],The 1%: Obamas' Lavish Vacations,"In a Sunday Washington Times column, Drudge Report editor Joseph Curl takes a look at the difference between how the last two White House occupants, President Bush and President Obama, approached vacationing as president. Curl reveals that unlike Obama, Bush was concerned with public perception (especially during the war in Iraq) and made an effort to schedule holiday vacations in a way that wouldn’t take others away from their families — even a media that despised him:

“I think playing golf during a war just sends the wrong signal,” [President George W. Bush] said years later. “I don’t want some mom whose son may have recently died to see the commander in chief playing golf. I feel I owe it to the families to be in solidarity as best as I can with them.”

That’s also why Mr. Bush did two other things, without fanfare or praise. First, he never headed home to his Texas ranch until after Christmas, instead going to Camp David for a few days. That way, the hundreds of people revolving around him at all times — White House staff, Secret Service agents, reporters, photographers, all the others — could spend the holiday with their families in and around Washington, D.C. No one ever reported that — until this column.

Second, he rarely attended sporting events, although he once owned a baseball team and was a self-confessed stats junkie. His thinking there was the same: If he went to a baseball game (right down the street from the White House), his mere presence would mean hours and hours of extra security for fans.

Conversely, Obama, who never has to worry about the media turning against him (including lying for weeks about a terror attack in Libya), doesn’t give a damn about public perception — not during a recession; not even during a time when sequester cuts are being blamed for the closing of White House tours and airport control towers:

How else to explain the nonstop vacations the pair keep taking during what Mr. Obama calls the “worst financial crisis since the Great Depression”? In 2013, the First Family has already enjoyed three vacations — that’s one a month. (Sorry, Joe America, you might have to forget your week at the beach again this year, but make sure you get those taxes in on time!)

Curl closes the piece (which you will want to read in full) by making the point about how much this juxtaposition tells you about Obama. And indeed it does. But I would add that it also reveals just as much about our media.

She Is Native Of Minnesota', 'Holds Degrees Boston College', 'Uc Berkeley S Graduate School Of Journalism.']",Obama highlights common ground with Pope Francis,"WASHINGTON — When a White House speechwriter turned in a draft of a major speech on economic policy this month, President Obama sent it back with an unusual instruction: Add a reference to the pope.

The final version of the speech quoted directly from Pope Francis’ recent letter to the faithful: “How can it be that it is not a news item when an elderly homeless person dies of exposure, but it is news when the stock market loses 2 points?” he said.

The citation marked a notable development in Obama’s complex and sometimes confrontational relationship with the Roman Catholic Church: After several years of high-profile clashes with U.S. bishops, Obama is seizing the chance to highlight common ground with the bishop of Rome.

Quoting the pope isn’t likely to yield direct electoral dividends for Obama’s party — the once-vaunted “Catholic vote” largely disappeared long ago. But in a string of effusive praise, the president has made clear he sees the pope as a like-minded thinker and potentially useful ally in a crucial battle of ideas, particularly on the importance of shrinking the gulf between rich and poor, a subject Obama has pushed repeatedly but with limited success.

White House officials described the president’s praise of the pope as merely a happy coincidence with no political motives. Obama, who has never spoken to Francis, simply found the pontiff’s recent statements impressive, they said.

“It’s something that is very much on the president’s mind,” said Cecilia Muñoz, chief domestic policy advisor to the president. “And, happily for us, it’s something that’s also on the pope’s mind.”

Some Catholic leaders see a mixed blessing. The Rev. Larry Snyder, president of Catholic Charities USA, said he was pleased to see Obama, like so many others, praise the pope’s message.

He noted that the language of the president’s speeches had long echoed some Catholic social teachings and that the church and the White House had found common ground on several issues, including immigration reform and support for social service programs. White House officials emphasized that same point. But Snyder expressed wariness about thrusting Francis’ words into the political fray.

“The danger I see in it is that the pope is not a politician,” Snyder said. “When the pope speaks, there’s a consistent teaching. And the danger would be other people pick and choose, ‘I like this, but I don’t like that.’”

American presidents and politicians have a long history of doing just that. A host of Democrats have clashed with the bishops over abortion. President Reagan worked in tandem with Pope John Paul II to loosen the Soviet Union’s hold on Eastern Europe but paid little heed to U.S. bishops’ opposition to his nuclear buildup.

President George W. Bush borrowed the phrase “culture of life,” made famous by John Paul II, to discuss his antiabortion stance, without noting the pope’s teaching against the death penalty, which Bush carried out several times as governor of Texas.

Obama’s interest in the pope’s message on economic justice surfaced in early October during a television interview. In response to a question from CNBC’s John Harwood, the president said he had “been hugely impressed with the pope’s pronouncements” and Francis’ “incredible sense of empathy to the least of these, to the poor.” White House officials said aides had not prepped Obama in advance on the pope’s writings.

This month, Obama went further, saying in an interview on MSNBC that Francis was showing himself to be an “extraordinarily thoughtful and soulful messenger of peace and justice.”

Aides, who would describe White House discussions only on condition of anonymity, said Obama had talked about the pope with members of his inner circle, which includes Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, a Catholic whose brother Kevin is a priest and former high-ranking official in the archdiocese in St. Paul, Minn.

The president, the aides said, has read the ample news coverage of the pope’s activities, including reports on Francis’ apostolic exhortation on economic justice, which was his first major writing since he became head of the church in March.

Obama, a Christian who attended a Congregationalist church before coming to Washington and now occasionally attends an Episcopal church near the White House, has shown interest in Catholic thinkers and teaching before. He has said that Catholic social doctrines influenced his work as a community organizer in Chicago, and Catholic writers have discerned that influence in some of his speeches, particularly his second inaugural address.

His push for universal access to healthcare won support from some Catholic groups that was crucial to its passage. But the healthcare law has also been at the center of a long-running and difficult fight with the church.

U.S. bishops have criticized the White House for the provision in the law that requires employers — including some Catholic institutions, although not churches — to offer health insurance that covers birth control.

Although the rule exempts religiously affiliated institutions from paying directly for birth-control coverage, several religious groups argue it still violates their religious freedom. The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear one challenge to that aspect of the law, which takes effect in January.

The rift has created “major problems” in the White House’s relationship with the church, said Sister Mary Ann Walsh, spokeswoman for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. The law’s distinction between churches, which are exempt, and other institutions such as schools and hospitals creates a “two-tier” church, diminishing the status of the groups that carry out the mission Francis has been emphasizing, she said.

“President Obama and many others quote Pope Francis these days based on the pope’s concern for the poor. This concern is a core component of our religion and we should not have to compromise it to continue to serve the common good,” she said.

Some observers have noted possible personal parallels between the superstar pope and the onetime superstar politician. One is riding a tide of goodwill generated by the sort of promise of hope and change that has ebbed for the other.

“I think world leaders are impressed by someone who got into office and immediately avoided the trappings of that office,” said Michael Peppard, who teaches about politics and the papacy at Fordham University.

“People who are in power are in awe of that and have a lot of respect for that. I think Obama probably wants to tap into some of the energy, and tap into some of it for his own message.”

To others, Obama’s interest in the pope exemplifies the way some liberals, cheered by Francis’ new focus, have expressed their hope for a church that puts less emphasis on issues like abortion or gay rights and more on immigration, welfare or poverty programs.

Obama is the “preeminent example of a liberal falling in love with Francis,” said Candida Moss, a theology professor at the University of Notre Dame.

Of course, even praise for the pope’s economic liberalism comes with caveats. The day after Obama praised the pope in his speech, he made clear in the MSNBC interview that he didn’t share all of Francis’ critique of capitalist culture.

“We live in a market economy that is the greatest generator of wealth in history. We’re risk takers. We’re entrepreneurs. And we’re rugged individualists,” Obama said.

Said Moss: “It must be amazing for him to have the opportunity to say, ‘I’m a little more right wing than Pope Francis.’”

Detroit Free Press

Recording combined from 2 tapes%2C enhanced by audio engineer

Military officials%2C Secret Service agents can be heard

Engineer believes parts of tapes have been edited out

DETROIT -- John F. Kennedy arrived in Dallas on Air Force One before noon on Nov. 22, 1963. Hours later, the slain leader was being flown back to Washington, D.C., as radio communications crackled back and forth between the plane and various officials on the ground.

""The president is on board, the body is on board, and Mrs. Kennedy is on board,"" a voice said at one point, starkly describing the just sworn-in Lyndon B. Johnson and the-now dead JFK.

This month, as events, books and TV specials mark the 50th anniversary of the assassination, a new piece of evidence has Kennedy researchers buzzing.

It's an 88-minute audio recording of Air Force One radio transmissions that's described as the most complete version of those communications yet.

And it may indicate that a longer version with fresh revelations is out there somewhere.

The recording is described on the JFKFacts.org website as among the most important pieces of assassination-related evidence to surface in the past five years.

It was enhanced for sound quality and combined from two separate tapes by audio/video forensic expert Ed Primeau of Primeau Forensics in Rochester Hills, Mich.

Like anything new about the JFK assassination, the recording is bound to be pored over by those fascinated by what a majority of Americans consider an unsolved mystery.

Conspiracy theories still exist that cast suspicions on everyone from the Cubans and the Russians to the mob and even portions of the U.S. government.

Primeau believes ""100 percent"" that there was editing done to the two tapes that were used in the 88-minute version.

Primeau, 55, has been an expert witness for criminal and civil cases across the country.

In fall 2012, he was contacted by author and JFK assassination researcher Bill Kelly, who wanted technical help in combining two audiotapes of Air Force One radio transmissions: one released in the 1970s from LBJ's presidential library and a longer one that came to light a couple of years ago from the belongings of Gen. Chester Clifton, a military aide to Kennedy.

Kelly transcribed the tapes. Primeau, working off and on starting in about January, spent time enhancing the sound quality.

Brad Finegan of Primeau Forensics combined the two tapes in chronological order using Kelly's transcripts and some overlapping as guides.

Last month, Kelly presented an analysis of the tapes at a 50th anniversary assassination symposium at Duquesne University's Cyril H. Wecht Institute of Forensic Science and Law in Pittsburgh.

""The Air Force One tapes are sort of like the black box of the assassination. It has all the basic information there you want to know of what happened at the highest levels of government in the two hours after the assassination. And it all should be right there but there's some that's missing,"" says Kelly, whose website is JFKcountercoup.blogspot.com.

""Spine chilling"" is how Primeau describes listening to the tapes, which are peppered with code names like Volunteer (for LBJ) and Lace (for Jacqueline Kennedy) and urgent efforts to make arrangements for things like a lift to remove the casket from the plane in D.C.

Generals, Secret Service members and radio operators can be heard. At one point, the airborne LBJ is patched through to JFK's mother, Rose, at the Kennedy compound in Hyannisport, Mass., to offer his condolences.

Primeau believes that the LBJ and Clifton recordings are what are called safety copies that don't contain the entire radio transmissions from Air Force One. ""As I listen to the recordings, I can hear edits.""

That raises questions. ""What was taken out, who took them out and where are they?"" he asks.

It also points to the possibility that the entire record of the radio transmissions is somewhere out there, says author and former Washington Post reporter Jefferson Morley, who has led the charge to have the CIA release still-classified material on the assassination.

""It's not the tape itself. It's what the tape tells us. And what the tape tells us is that there was a longer recording of the Air Force One communications on November 22. That was never known before,"" says Morley, who's written about the new recording for the site he moderates, JFKFacts.org.

The Air Force One recording is considered significant by those still looking for a credible explanation for the JFK assassination. But new information based on fact, not speculation, also interests conspiracy debunkers.

""Aside from what I might disagree with Kelly on, it's always a good thing to try to get the historical record in better shape, to clarify the material,"" says professor John McAdams of Marquette University, whose JFK assassination website appeals to those who believe accused assassin Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone.

Primeau suspects the original source tapes of the Air Force One tapes may no longer exist. ""Will they ever surface? I don't think so. I think they're destroyed, like parts of the Watergate tapes were destroyed, permanently gone so that nobody could ever find out."""

Lew, if confirmed, would replace outgoing Secretary Tim Geithner.

The president said Thursday that he ""cannot think of a better person"" to continue Geithner's work. The announcement marked the president's fourth major nomination to date of officials for his second-term administration.

""I trust his judgment, I value his friendship. I know very few people with greater integrity,"" Obama said. The president stressed Lew's experience in both Washington and the private sector, and particularly his role presiding over ""three budget surpluses in a row"" while in the Clinton-era budget office.

But as with the prior nominations, Lew was drawing early criticism from the Republican side of the aisle.

""Jack Lew must never be secretary of Treasury,"" Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee said, calling Lew's comments nearly two years ago ""so outrageous and false"" as to disqualify him.

Sessions was referring to a bitter Senate hearing from February 2011, when Lew attempted to defend statements he and Obama had made claiming their budget blueprint would get the country to a point where ""we're not adding to the debt anymore.""

Those statements, at best, stretched the truth. The White House budget plan at the time showed the public debt (which isn't the entire debt) soaring from $11 trillion that year to nearly $19 trillion by 2021, driven by year-after-year deficits.

Yet Lew, appearing at a Senate hearing, tried to justify the claim that the government was not adding to the debt. He said the administration was merely referring to ""primary balance"" -- or federal spending that does not count interest payments.

He repeated the claim before the Senate. ""Our spending will not add to the debt,"" Lew said. ""It's an accurate statement.""

But since interest payments are in fact a gigantic part of federal spending every year, Republican senators slammed Lew as ""dishonest"" for the claim. The website PolitiFact also rated the statement ""false"" at the time.

The White House later clarified that the debt would not increase as a share of the economy.

Sessions, though, said Lew's comments stand as ""the most direct and important false assertion during my entire time in Washington.""

He said the next Treasury secretary must be able to ""look the American people in the eye and lay out an economic plan for America that will end our debt."" Sessions continued: ""Jack Lew is not that man.""

Other Republican senators said they would reserve judgment on Lew.

""It's imperative that Mr. Lew outline the administration's plans on tackling our unsustainable debt, what areas of federal spending should be cut, and what kind of reforms -- from our tax code to our entitlement programs -- are needed to get our fiscal house in order,"" Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, top Republican on the finance committee, said. He said he wants to hear more before deciding whether to support Lew.

Lew would not come into the job with the same type of financial experience as Geithner, who previously headed the New York branch of the Federal Reserve and in that role played a major role in addressing the 2008 financial crisis.

Before becoming Obama's chief of staff, Lew was director of the Office of Management and Budget, a post he also held in the Clinton administration, serving from 1998 to early 2001. While running OMB during the Clinton administration, Lew helped negotiate a balanced budget agreement with Congress, something that has eluded Washington ever since.

On Wall Street, Lew also was managing director and chief operating officer of Citi Global Wealth Management and then Citi Alternative Investments. At the start of the Obama administration, he oversaw international economic issues at the State Department.

A White House official said Lew would bring an ""impressive record of service in both the public and private sectors for over three decades and economic expertise"" to the job.

""His deep knowledge of domestic and international economic issues will enable him to take on the challenges facing our economy at home and abroad on day one,"" the official said.

Lew could be seen by some Republicans as a political figure. He clashed repeatedly with the other side of the aisle during the debt-ceiling fight of 2011.

Lew has often been described as a ""pragmatic liberal"" who understands what it takes to make a deal even as he stands by his ideological views.

""He's a political guy. He didn't get where he is today by being a shrinking violet,"" said Paul Light, a public policy professor at New York University and an acquaintance. ""But he's really a doer. He's the kind of guy you want at the table if you want to get something done.""

If confirmed, Lew would assume the post in time for the administration to battle anew with Republicans over three looming fiscal deadlines -- raising the $16.4 trillion federal borrowing limit, averting automatic spending cuts to defense and domestic programs and the expiration of a congressional resolution that has been keeping the government operating. Those events, if unresolved, would have a far greater negative effect on the economy than the ""fiscal cliff"" that Obama and Congress avoided a week ago.

Internationally, the 57-year-old Lew also will be the administration's point man on issues related to China's integration into the global economy and Europe's sovereign debt and financial struggles. The issues aren't foreign to Lew. While a deputy secretary of state early in the Obama administration, Lew managed the State Department's international economic policy portfolio.

On Thursday, Obama also gave Geithner a send-off at the White House. ""When the history books are written, Tim Geithner's going to go down as one of our finest secretaries of Treasury,"" he said.

Still, others say the Obamas have become more relaxed schmoozers, more at ease with the porous line between the political and social, more willing to reveal themselves. They have recently begun inviting more outsiders into their private living quarters, including Mr. Kushner, Steven Spielberg and Daniel Day-Lewis at the “Lincoln” dinner. At a dinner in late November to thank top campaign fund-raisers, the first couple was like a bride and groom, bantering and traveling from table to table to accept congratulations and good wishes for the years ahead, making sly jokes that guests would not repeat for publication.

Even Mr. Obama’s speech has changed a bit, close observers say. Though he still disdains Washington, he often sounds less like a disapproving outsider and more like a participant. One former aide was startled to hear Mr. Obama use “impact” as a verb, a particular tendency in the capital. Another longtime adviser said he was struck during the 2011 debt ceiling negotiations when Mr. Obama grew offended that House Speaker John A. Boehner did not return his multiple phone calls. The old Barack Obama would have thought the who-calls-whom protocol was stupid, the adviser said, but “the world that he inhabits now is the world of inside-the-Beltway maneuvering.”

In video footage of Mr. Obama as president, the contrasts can be subtle but amusing. At his first Thanksgiving turkey pardoning ceremony in 2009, the president played along, but then paused to distance himself from what he was doing and hint that he found the tradition ridiculous. “There are certain days that remind me of why I ran for this office,” he said. “And then there are moments like this — where I pardon a turkey and send it to Disneyland.” Cut to the same ceremony, three years later, and cue Mr. Obama promoting a contest over which bird to pardon and giggling just a little. “You can’t maintain your day-to-day cynicism about that stuff,” said Arun Chaudhary, the former White House videographer, because many Americans cherish White House rituals.

What Mr. Obama wants to achieve this term is pretty clear: a fiscal deal and overhauls of gun and immigration laws, steps to address climate change and less restrictive voter identification laws. But what Mrs. Obama wants is more of a mystery. In almost every appearance, she sounds warm, unpretentious notes; on Friday, she continued her Twitter banter with Ellen DeGeneres over who could do more push-ups."

He Has Covered The Supreme Court Since November']",Supreme Court to weigh in on Obama’s recess appointments,"The Supreme Court announced Monday that it will decide next term whether President Obama exceeded his constitutional authority by making appointments while the Senate was on break last year.

The case at hand involves Obama’s appointment of three members of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), but the broader issue concerns the power that presidents throughout history have used to fill their administrations in the face of Senate opposition and inaction.

The justices will review a broad ruling by a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit that upset decades of understanding about the president’s recess appointment power. The court ruled that presidents may make recess appointments only between sessions of the Senate — they generally come at the end of each year — and not when senators take an intra-session break.

Recent presidents have made appointments during both kinds of recesses.

Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr. said in a petition to the Supreme Court that the appeals court’s reading of the clause would “drastically curtail the scope of the president’s authority.”

In addition, the Supreme Court will consider a narrower question presented by the specifics of Obama’s January 2012 appointments: whether the president can make appointments when the Senate is holding pro forma sessions designed to thwart such action.

White House press secretary Jay Carney said that he was “confident” that the court will uphold Obama’s appointments and that “the issue here is about the president having the authority that all of his predecessors have had to make these recess appointments.”

Thomas J. Donohue, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, welcomed the court’s decision to hear the case. “We warned last year that by appointing these members to the NLRB in such a controversial fashion, a cloud of uncertainty covered the agency and its work,” he said.

Obama has used the recess appointments power fairly modestly compared with recent predecessors. But he went where no other president had gone in his appointment of the three NLRB members and his appointment of Richard Cordray to head the fledgling Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

Senators had gone home, but the Senate was holding pro forma sessions by convening with one senator every three days.

The White House justified appointing the NLRB members by reasoning that the Senate actually was in recess because it was not available to fulfill its advice-and-consent role by conducting business.

A challenge brought by a Pepsi bottler in the state of Washington and backed by the U.S. Chamber went to the D.C. Circuit. But in January, the unanimous panel skipped past the question of pro forma sessions for a far broader ruling.

D.C. Circuit Judge David B. Sentelle wrote that the administration’s interpretation of when recess appointments may be made would give the president “free rein to appoint his desired nominees at any time he pleases, whether that time be a weekend, lunch, or even when the Senate is in session and he is merely displeased with its inaction.”

The ruling interpreted the Constitution’s directive that “the president shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate” to apply only between sessions of the Senate, not merely when the senators are on a break, even an extended one.

The panel gave great weight to the framers’ use of “the recess” rather than “a recess.”

In addition, the panel also voted 2 to 1 that the phrase “vacancies that may happen” means only those openings that arise during the recess, not those that already exist when the recess occurs.

The ruling cast doubt on hundreds of decisions the NLRB has made in the past year, including the enforcement of collective-bargaining agreements and rulings on the rights of workers to use social media.

The government and the challengers asked the Supreme Court to take the case to settle differing interpretations of the recess appointments clause.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit agreed this year that recess appointments could come only between sessions of the Senate.

But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit came out the other way in 2005, and the Supreme Court at the time declined to review the decision.

When the constitutional clause was written, it could take weeks for senators to get to the Capitol. But partisan gridlock has made the recess appointment an important modern tool for presidents who are trying to get their nominees past a recalcitrant Senate.

In asking the justices to take the case, Verrilli said presidents have made more than 500 appointments during inter-session recesses, including “three Cabinet secretaries, five Court of Appeals judges, 10 District Court judges, a director of central intelligence, a chairman of the Federal Reserve, numerous members of multi-member boards and holders of a variety of other critical government posts.”

The pro forma sessions were pioneered by Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) to thwart President George W. Bush’s nominees. Republican senators have used them during Obama’s terms in office and have filed a brief with the court saying justices should also consider the question of pro forma sessions that the D.C. Circuit bypassed.

“The president’s claimed authority to name principal federal officers without the Senate’s consent while the chamber has declared itself in session has no basis in the Constitution,” said the brief filed by all Republican senators.

The case is National Labor Relations Board v. Noel Canning."

""The President made a wise choice and it will serve him, the Congress, and the country for the best. Katie has the great ability to listen and then bring people together, and will be able to convey the administration's message in strong but friendly terms to members of both parties.""

In a statement announcing Fallon's promotion, Obama said, ""She has the deep expertise and strong relationships required to build on the progress we've made this year and advance my top priority: creating jobs and expanding broad-based growth and opportunity for every American.""

The news of Rodriguez's departure and Fallon's promotion was first reported by Politico on Friday morning.

The move to bolster the White House legislative affairs shop is the latest in a string of personnel changes Obama is making this month, including recruiting former legislative affairs director Phil Schiliro for a temporary assignment helping oversee the troubled rollout of the Affordable Care Act health insurance exchanges. Obama also hired John Podesta, former White House chief of staff under President Bill Clinton and one of the Democratic Party's most seasoned strategists, to be a senior counselor.

Denis McDonough, the White House chief of staff, has been thinking about restructuring the legislative affairs operation to be ""more responsive to concerns on the Hill and better calibrated to promote the president's agenda,"" according to a White House official. After consulting with Obama, McDonough proposed moving Fallon into the job. She met with Obama to diagnose the White House's problems on Capitol Hill, the official said, and Obama asked her to coordinate Obama's climate change agenda and manage legislative strategy around immigration reform and the health-care law.

Fallon will begin her new assignment in January, and an aide said she plans to spend the next few weeks consulting with lawmakers about the 2014 agenda.

""Katie is whip smart, and fully understands the challenges and opportunities members of Congress face every day,"" McDonough said in a statement. ""This is an Administration committed to working with members from both parties to find common sense ways to grow the economy for all Americans. There is nobody better suited to lead our efforts on the Hill than Katie.”

Rodriguez, a former Senate aide to Hillary Rodham Clinton who joined the State Department at the start of the Obama administration, is leaving to pursue a job in the private sector.

McDonough said Rodriguez has ""helped manage some of the most complex and sensitive challenges we faced on the Hill and will be missed immensely.""

In his statement, Obama said, ""Throughout some of this year’s most contentious legislative battles, Miguel worked tirelessly to bridge the partisan divide, forge consensus, and seek out solutions that helped us move forward. As the son of immigrants, I know Miguel took particular pride in the Senate’s passage of a bipartisan, commonsense immigration reform plan — something that we are going to see through. I’m grateful for his service, and I will miss his advice and counsel."""

Some of her projects are so large she has to hire staff.

Still, Chavarria has to hop on buses to meet clients throughout Phoenix because Arizona won’t give her a driver’s license. The state considers her to be in the country illegally, even though she recently obtained a two-year reprieve from deportation under the Obama administration’s deferred action program.

She may not drive, but along with thousands of other young people who entered the country illegally, Chavarria has found a way to make a living without breaking the law.

Although federal law prohibits employers from hiring someone residing in the country illegally, there is no law prohibiting such a person from starting a business or becoming an independent contractor.

As a result, some young immigrants are forming limited liability companies or starting freelance careers — even providing jobs to U.S. citizens — as the prospect of an immigration law revamp plods along in Congress.

Ever since 1986, when employer sanctions took effect as part of the immigration overhaul signed by President Reagan, creating a company or becoming an independent contractor has been a way for people who are in the country illegally to work on a contract basis and get around immigration enforcement.

But organizers who help immigrants said the idea has taken on new life in recent years, often among tech-savvy young people who came into the country illegally or overstayed visas.

Chavarria, who was 7 when she crossed into Arizona from Mexico with her mother, said her parents told her from a young age that anything was possible in her newly adopted country.

“We’re taught as young kids that this is the land of opportunity,” she said. “They told me, ‘You could be anything you want to be if you work hard, you’re a good person, obey your parents and go to school.’”

But when she graduated from high school in Phoenix, Chavarria discovered that her lack of legal status was a roadblock to becoming a graphic designer. Although she won a scholarship, she said, she could afford to take only two classes at a time at Scottsdale Community College because she wasn’t willing to risk working with fraudulent documents to pay for school.

Congress delivered another blow to Chavarria in 2010 when it failed to pass the Dream Act, which would provide a path to legalization for young adults who were brought into the country illegally as children.

The next year, after she became more involved with the Dream Act Coalition, she discovered a way she could sell her designs to others without fear of repercussions.

How is this possible? Though the issue is complex, the answer boils down to how labor law defines employees, said Muzaffar Chishti, an expert on the intersection of labor and immigration law at the Migration Policy Institute.

For example, employees often have set hours and use equipment provided by the employer. Independent contractors make their own hours, get paid per project by submitting invoices and use their own tools. Also, someone who hires an independent contractor isn’t obligated by immigration law to verify that person’s legal status.

At a workshop hosted by immigrant rights activists, Chavarria learned about these intricacies of labor law — and how to register as a limited liability company. “I didn’t know it was possible,” Chavarria said. “And it wasn’t that hard.”

It was as easy as downloading the forms from the Internet, opening up a bank account and turning in paperwork to the state along with a $50 fee. Proof of citizenship is not required. Regulations vary, but similar procedures exist in other states. In California, the fee is a bit higher and there’s an annual minimum tax of $800, but the process is similar to Arizona’s.

It’s unclear how many entrepreneurs there are like Chavarria. Immigration experts say anecdotal evidence suggests interest in such businesses has grown in recent years as more states have adopted tougher illegal-immigration laws. But research is scant.

Indications of a trend could be found, however, in a Public Policy Institute of California report on the effects of Arizona’s 2007 mandatory E-Verify law, which forced businesses to use a federal system intended to weed out people working in the country illegally.

The study found that 25,000 workers living in Arizona illegally became self-employed in 2009. That was an 8% jump over the number a year earlier. They probably formed limited liability companies, created their own businesses or even left employers to become independent contractors.

Freddy S. Pech, 25, a Mexican national who lives in East Los Angeles, said he decided to remain an independent graphic designer rather than form a limited liability company.

“I never found the need to create an LLC. I still pay my taxes and all that,” said Pech, who came to the country legally as a child but overstayed his visa.

Erika Andiola, a well-known Arizona immigrant rights activist who recently qualified for immigration relief under the federal deferred action program, said she knows many young people in the movement who created their own companies.

She started one as a political consultant and likes to say that if she ever listed all the entrepreneurs like her on a Facebook page, she could call it “the undocu-Chamber of Commerce.”

For some, starting a business can be too challenging.

Advertisement

Andiola had urged her brother, who works in construction, to form his own company. The idea didn’t go anywhere, however, because Arizona law says only U.S. citizens can qualify for the necessary permits for his line of work.

People who come to the U.S. later in life have other obstacles, said Mary Lopez, an associate professor of economics at Occidental College in Los Angeles, who specializes in labor and immigrant entrepreneurship.

The older generation tends to be less educated and distrustful of the U.S. banking and financial system. Not so the younger generation.

“We are talking about two different generations,” Lopez said. “The longer you stay in the United States and assimilate, the more financially aware you are.”

Lillia Romo, who was brought into the U.S. illegally when she was 4, started a school to teach English as a second language in 2009 in Phoenix. She can see the generational gap between her and her mother.

“We have more resources that our parents don’t have,” she said. “We feel more comfortable in the U.S. It can be intimidating for them. For us, it is just how it is.”

Advertisement

Romo and her mother run the school together, but not for long. The 25-year-old obtained immigration relief under the deferred action program and plans to get a regular job and finish school to follow her dream of becoming a doctor for the underserved.

Chavarria also qualified for relief under the federal program this year. Although she said the program gives her peace of mind, she doesn’t want to become an employee. She likes the autonomy of having her own business.

Advertisement

Most days, a coffee shop in Phoenix serves as her office, and she charges clients $350 to $5,000 per project. The first time she contracted workers for a large campaign, an odd thought hit her: Although others couldn’t hire her, she could hire others.

She also realized that her success had a larger significance.

“They say we’re taking money and jobs and don’t pay taxes,” Chavarria said of arguments made against immigrants in the country illegally. “In reality, it’s the opposite. We pay taxes. We create jobs. I’m hiring people — U.S. citizens.”

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Though earlier this year several of the state’s textbook reviewers called for biology textbooks to discuss creationism, publishers are not complying with those requests, according to the Texas Freedom Network. The nonpartisan watchdog examined material made public by the Texas Education Agency and found that publishers are sticking with teaching evolution.

Citizens who serve on the Texas review panels are charged with making suggestions about proposed classroom texts that are being considered for the state's list of “approved” schoolbooks. While most reviewers on this year’s biology panel made routine, noncontroversial suggestions, some took issue with the fact that the proposed books did not include information about creationism while focusing on evolution.

However, information that publishers submitted to the Texas Education Agency show they are not incorporating the suggestions about ""creation science"" and plan to print books free of references to the theory of intelligent design."

Peterson was transferred this morning to the Stateville Correctional Center near Crest Hill, where he was evaluated for placement based upon factors such as his conviction, length of sentence, program needs and medical and mental health requirements.

Peterson stayed at Stateville only a few hours before being sent to his new home at Pontiac prison northeast of Bloomington, a maximum security facility that has a protective custody unit. The assignment was based upon factors such as his conviction, length of sentence, program needs and medical and mental health requirements, per Illinois Department of Correction protocol.

Officials have not said whether he has a cellmate or if he will be in solitary confinement like he had been during his jail stay.

As part of his daily routine there, he will remain in his cell for most of the day, though he will be allowed out for meals and showers. Most inmates also get about five hours of recreation time outside per week, Illinois Department of Corrections spokesman Stacey Solano said.

The Will County jail – which had held Peterson in solitary confinement since his May 2009 arrest for his own safety – had the paperwork prepared for his transfer by the time he returned from his sentencing hearing Thursday, officials said.

The sheriff’s department, which oversees the jail, kept the former Bolingbrook police sergeant segregated from the general population there amid concerns that his high-profile case and law-enforcement background would make him a target of inmates looking to build tough-guy reputations.

Jail supervisors began preparing Peterson at 8:30 a.m. and he left without incident by 9:22 a.m., officials said.

Drew Peterson wanted to make sure he was heard when he was given one last chance to speak Thursday, shortly before being sentenced to 38 years in prison for the murder of his third wife, Kathleen Savio.

Declining to speak from the defense table, where there was no microphone, the former Bolingbrook police sergeant shuffled to the witness stand in his jail-issued blue scrubs and orange shoes and began quietly.

""I hope I don't aggravate the situation,"" he turned and told the judge. Then Peterson screamed into the microphone, ""I did not kill Kathleen!"" startling almost everyone in the courtroom.

""Yes, you did!"" Savio's sister Sue Doman yelled back from the gallery, prompting Will County Circuit Judge Edward Burmila to order her out of the courtroom.

It was an odd end to a case replete with oddities and circuslike sideshows. For the next 40 minutes, Peterson cried, raged and whispered, challenged the state's attorney to look him in the eye and indulged in self-pity as he unleashed his multitudinous thoughts like a character in a Dostoevsky novel.

The 59-year-old said he expects to die in prison. Barring any successful appeal, he won't be eligible for release until he's 93.

Peterson claimed that lies and mistakes by witnesses, prosecutors and police led to his conviction, and made disparaging remarks about Savio's family, attorneys and others involved in the case. His defense attorneys called the monologue an impassioned plea for leniency, but prosecutors said it was proof that Peterson is a psychopath.

""When he got up on the stand and (in) that shrill, kinda-feminine screech that he didn't kill Kathy — that's the guy that killed Kathy,"" Will County State's Attorney James Glasgow said. ""You got a glimpse into his soul.""

But in describing himself on the stand Thursday, Peterson said he was maligned and misunderstood.

""Until this happened, I thought I was viewed as a great guy,"" Peterson said, giving a litany of public and private good deeds before announcing he planned to tattoo the phrase ""No good deed goes unpunished"" across his shoulders.

""The state took an accident and staged a homicide,"" Peterson said, before turning to the judge. ""Can I get some water?""

Once refreshed, Peterson said he had upheld the oath he swore when he became a police officer.

""I always took my job seriously, I never violated the public trust,"" he said, his voice husky with emotion before quoting one of the Ten Commandments. ""And I never beared false witness against anyone.""

""I think the only thing left to make this case run true to form,"" he told Burmila, stopping to take a tissue and wipe his nose, ""would be a cruel and unusual punishment. And I don't think anybody would care, because nobody cares. I can't believe I spent 32 years defending a constitution that allowed this to happen to me.""

It's not uncommon for a defendant to lash out against those who put them behind bars. It is rare, however, for defendant to offer a long, extemperaneous speech that both walks the court through the evidence and ilicits angry outbursts from the victims' families.

Peterson accused the state's attorney's office, state police, Savio's family and even Lifetime TV of being part of various conspiracies to wrongfully convict him. Last year, Lifetime TV aired a movie about Peterson with Rob Lowe playing the suburban police officer. Peterson said the ""ridiculous movie"" denied him a right to a fair trial and included statements he'd made to state police.

He said he took full responsibility for his press appearances, which created a media firestorm after his fourth wife, Stacy, disappeared in 2007 and included talk of a ""Win a Date with Drew"" contest on the radio.

""I'm an obnoxious man by nature, truly,"" Peterson said. ""And after 30 years as a police officer, as is normal with police officers, my defense mechanism is comedy. The media took that and capitalized on that, and my obnoxious nature shone through.""

Peterson, who smirked at the state police officers who investigated him as he was brought into the courtroom, appeared to struggle to keep his composure on the witness stand. His right hand shook at times as he held forth, clutching some papers in his left hand.

""But I want to assure the court that at no time did I want to portray any insensitivity about Kathy's death,"" he said, turning to address Burmila. ""That was not my intention.""

Peterson also took aim at Glasgow, who tapped his fingers at the prosecutors table and at one point asked a colleague ""Is he done?"" during Peterson's speech."
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jonathan-weiler/chief-justice-roberts-and_b_3503768.html,2013-06-26 12:08:33-04:00,"['Director Of Undergraduate Studies In Global Studies', 'Unc Chapel Hill']",Chief Justice Roberts and the Right-Wing Majority's True Colors,"When John Roberts came before the Senate in 2005 for confirmation as Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, many scribes penned encomiums to this undeniably conservative, but seemingly eminently reasonable and restrained judge. Writing in the New Yorker, Hendrick Hertzberg expressed concerns about Roberts views once he reached the high court. But he also allowed that Roberts was ""not, it appears, a hater; nor is he even a particularly rigid ideologue. Unlike Justices Scalia and Thomas, Roberts does not project a sense of resentful beleaguerment.""

Roberts, of course, worked assiduously to cultivate that image, famously insisting during his opening remarks before the Senate that he was merely an umpire calling balls and strikes and enforcing the rules of the game, not making them up. Then-Senator Biden did point out to Roberts that different umps had different strike zones and it was fair to ask Roberts a little bit about what his was. Roberts, an evidently highly intelligent and polished man, sailed through those hearings.

All of this, mind you, was obvious BS even at the time, to anyone paying attention. As I wrote during the confirmation hearings:

""Roberts' career is characterized not so much by a generalized fealty to judicial restraint, but to a highly selective version thereof, one that consistently favors powerful interests over the less advantaged and that appears consistently to advance the preferred conservative agenda of the day. According to [a report by the Alliance for Justice]: ""one can discern that Judge Roberts holds a troublingly limited view of the federal government's authority to enact key worker, civil rights and environmental safeguards and a similarly troublingly narrow view of the vital role of our courts and our government play in safeguarding our individual rights, especially civil and women's rights....these views, taken together, could produce a government with less power to protect ordinary people and give ordinary people less power to protect themselves from abuse by government and other powerful interests.""

This is, of course, precisely who Roberts has turned out to be. In order to arrive at yesterday's opinion, which the seasoned legal observer Paul Campos described as a ""travesty... of basic legal reasoning,"" Roberts had to create a new legal doctrine out of whole cloth. The Chief Justice insisted that the portions of the Voting Rights Act struck down yesterday violated the ""fundamental principle of equal sovereignty of the states."" The eminent jurist Richard Posner responded by saying ""this is a principle of constitutional law of which I have never heard"" because, in fact, ""there is no such principle.""

In fact, the toner cartridge was barely dry on Roberts' execrable opinion yesterday when several states announced that previously blocked voter suppression laws would go into force immediately, including in Texas -- where hundreds of thousands of voters might now be adversely affected -- and Mississippi.

Writing in the Nation, Ari Berman rightly denounced the Court's right-wing majority in a post yesterday titled, ""What the Supreme Court doesn't understand about the Voting Rights Act."" And in the piece itself, Berman quoted from Justice Ginsburg's dissent -- ""The sad irony of today's decision lies in its utter failure to grasp why the VRA has proven so effective."" The sentiments are understandable -- and in Ginsburg's case, perhaps professionally prudent -- but the premises are wrong. The right-wing majority understands precisely how the VRA has been effective. That is why they gutted it. There is no misunderstanding, no well-intentioned but misguided application of the law. They are neither dumb nor naïve. They are merely without conscience. When Chief Justice Roberts extolled the progress of the past fifty years in justifying his decision to try to undermine that progress, the irony should have been lost on no one, since the conservative movement has worked ceaselessly to try to roll back and reverse that progress. (Remember Trent Lott, former Senate Majority leader, lamenting in 2002 how much better things would have been if Strom Thurmond's vision of a segregated America had prevailed?)

As Adam Serwer wrote yesterday, Roberts has worked hard to avoid being painted with that brush. Serwer reminded readers that during oral arguments in February in the Shelby v. Holder case -- the one the Court ruled on -- Scalia blurted out that the Voting Rights Act represented the ""perpetuation of racial entitlement."" One needs to step back for a moment to appreciate just how extraordinary and revealing that statement was. Roberts himself appears to have been a determined opponent of the VRA since he was a young lawyer in the Reagan Justice Department in the early 1980s (so much for his claim that the long passage of time now provides a justification for gutting the law). But Roberts doesn't project an air of ""resentful beleaguerment."" And just as it's become a favored trick of the contemporary right to pretend to admire Martin Luther King while trying to undermine everything he stood for, so the clever and cunning Roberts knew enough in his Shelby opinion to pretend to extol the virtues of a law he has long wanted to bury. He's tried to put a ""moderate"" face on what has been a consistently extremist agenda, but it's that agenda, including rolling back civil rights protections to the maximum possible extent -- that animates Roberts and his cronies' jurisprudence (and see Rick Hasen's discussion about why Roberts thought it might be politically prudent to hold off on killing affirmative action for the time being). Emily Bazelon, in Slate, described Roberts as a ""stealth conservative"" who has successfully concealed his political agenda. That gig should have been up before he ever reached the high court.

But yesterday should have removed the last shred of doubt. Roberts is a Stepford judge -- the tip of the spear of the conservative movement's three decade long march through the judiciary -- a robotic ideologue ceaselessly committed to undermining legal protections for the vulnerable while further stacking the deck in favor of the already-powerful. There's no principle here -- no respect for judicial restraint, or original intent or limited government or any of the other nonsense by which right-wingers try to defend their judicial ""philosophy."" Only a remorseless attack on common decency for the sake of enriching and empowering their ideological allies."

Robert F. McDonnell proposed Tuesday an ambitious overhaul of how Virginia pays for roads, rail and transit, including eliminating the gas tax and replacing it with an increase in the sales tax.

The overall plan, which would raise an estimated $3.1 billion over five years, also would increase vehicle-registration fees and add an annual $100 charge for drivers of alternative-fuel cars. McDonnell’s proposal calls for a increase in the state’s sales tax from 5 percent to 5.8 percent and projects using $1 billion in Internet sales tax revenue from legislation pending in Congress.

As he enters his last year in office, McDonnell is aiming to solve a problem that has stumped his recent predecessors: getting a tax-averse state to pay for one of the nation’s largest and most congested transportation systems — one that will run out of money by 2017.

The term-limited Republican ran for office promising not to raise taxes, but he said Tuesday that new revenue must be part of the solution. His plan also calls for devoting a greater share of existing state money to transportation.

An increase in the sales tax could be a hard sell, especially in the GOP-dominated House of Delegates, whose members are all up for reelection this year. And Democrats oppose any shifting of existing money that would affect services such as education.

“We simply cannot continue to do what we have always done and expect this problem to go away,” McDonnell said. “If we stick to the old means of funding transportation, we will find ourselves having the same debates and facing the same revenue shortfalls over and over again.”

With more cars getting better mileage or using alternative fuels, he said, the flat, per-gallon gas tax no longer brings in enough money to bankroll “a safe, efficient and sustainable transportation network.”

The General Assembly is expected to take up the plan during this year’s legislative session, which begins Wednesday. If it passes, Virginia would become the first state in the country to get rid of its gas tax.

Roads are particularly congested in Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads, and planning and transportation experts have said those transportation woes threaten to stall the commonwealth’s economy.

In making his pitch, McDonnell linked his transportation plan to the state’s growth. He said that the gas tax is outdated and that although it is the largest source of maintenance funding, it does not generate enough revenue to cover the costs.

Sen. Timothy M. Kaine (D), McDonnell’s immediate predecessor, tried to solve the problem by creating regional transportation authorities to impose taxes and fees. That fix fell apart after the Virginia Supreme Court ruled in 2008 that the authorities would be unconstitutional. Before that, under then-Gov. Mark R. Warner (D), voters rejected a transportation referendum that would have levied an additional 0.5-cent sales tax on eastern and Northern Virginia to fund $5 billion in regional projects over 20 years.

McDonnell’s plan, based largely on a bill proposed by Del. Timothy D. Hugo (R-Fairfax), would maintain the 17.5-cent gas tax on diesel fuel; motorists would still have to pay the federal 18.4-cent-per-gallon levy on gas. Hugo will co-sponsor the governor’s bill in the House along with Speaker William J. Howell (R-Stafford).

Long viewed among states as a reliable source of revenue, the gas tax has brought in less money in recent years because of improved fuel efficiency and the advent of alternative-fuel vehicles. Virginia has not adjusted its gas tax for inflation in decades, leading to flat revenue, but the sales tax has continued to generate more money for state coffers. (The gas tax in Maryland and the District is 23.5 cents per gallon for regular fuel.)

Virginia is one of 27 states to tax alternative-fuel vehicles as a source of revenue for transportation improvements, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Several states also charge a flat fee, rather than a sales tax, to operate a vehicle powered by alternative fuels.

Some anti-tax advocates are balking at McDonnell’s measure. Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, said the plan “fails in its goal to prioritize transportation spending while avoiding tax increases.”

Norquist weighed in on Virginia’s transportation problem last month, warning legislators that “indexing” the gas tax to inflation — an idea McDonnell floated — would violate the anti-tax pledge they signed. On Tuesday, Norquist called for McDonnell to lower the sales tax increase, include diesel fuel in the elimination of the gas tax, nix his proposed $15 increase in vehicle-registration fees and direct more general-fund revenue toward infrastructure.

As legislators learned the details of the plan before the legislative session, which will be followed by a busy campaign season, it was unclear how politically viable the plan might be. Del. Benjamin L. Cline (R-Rockbridge), who co-chairs the legislature’s conservative caucus, said in a statement that he is ready to work with the governor but wants a “revenue-neutral” approach.

Howell was skeptical just weeks ago that lawmakers could tackle transportation this session but is now pushing the bill.

“The discussion opened up on transportation not that long ago,” he said Tuesday. “I was dubious about being able to put it together. But there’s been a lot of meetings, a lot of people meeting together, thrashing things out, and I think we’ve got a good package.” He added: “The gasoline tax, I’ve always felt was a dinosaur tax. It’s a tax that’s losing its value every year.”

But Del. Vivian E. Watts (D-Fairfax), a former state transportation secretary who attended the governor’s announcement, said the plan does not include enough money, particularly for construction. She said the state needs to pump about $1 billion a year into transportation.

“This package significantly shifts the burden of paying for our transportation needs to the backs of just Virginia residents and lets the interstate driver off the hook,” Watts said, noting that the state wouldn’t receive revenue from drivers who just fill up in the commonwealth.

McDonnell’s plan assumes $1 billion in Internet sales tax revenue over five years, contingent on federal legislation being approved. Legislation that would give states the authority to make online retailers collect sales taxes has not progressed, despite bipartisan coalitions of support on Capitol Hill and among governors. One measure, the Marketplace Fairness Act, is also backed by Amazon, Best Buy and several other major Web merchants.

“We are hopeful it’s going to go further this time,” said David French, senior vice president of government relations at the National Retail Federation, which backs the effort. One possibility, he said, is that an online sales tax measure could move this year as part of a broader tax reform effort.

Despite the criticism, Robert Puentes of the Brookings Institution called McDonnell’s plan “bold.” “The proposal to get rid of the state gasoline tax is unprecedented, that’s for sure,” he said. “It seems like it would take much longer [to get done] than the time he has left. There’s a lot to chew on.”

http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/07/06/19317652-wisconsin-governor-signs-new-abortion-restrictions-into-law,2013-07-06 00:00:00,"[""Brendan O'Brien""]",Wisconsin governor signs new abortion restrictions into law,"MILWAUKEE -- Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker signed into law on Friday new abortion restrictions that opponents said could lead to the closing of two of the state's four abortion clinics.

Opponents of the law, which goes into effect Monday, July 8, filed a federal lawsuit challenging it.

The law requires women to undergo an ultrasound before they get an abortion and doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of their clinics.

""This bill improves a woman's ability to make an informed choice that will protect her physical and mental health now and in the future,"" said Tom Evenson, a spokesman for the governor.

According to Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin and Affiliated Medical Services, which are the state's two abortion providers, the law could prompt the closing of abortion clinics in Appleton and Milwaukee because doctors there do not have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital.

The two providers filed a lawsuit in Madison federal court on Friday arguing that the law fails to protect the due process and equal protection rights that women who are seeking an abortion have under the Constitution.

Admitting privileges ""won't make women safer and, in fact, could jeopardize their health by depriving women in Wisconsin access to safe, high-quality healthcare,"" said obstetrician-gynecologist Anne Davis in a statement released by Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin.

The law requires an ultrasound be performed on a pregnant woman at least 24 hours before an abortion, a requirement that can be waived if the pregnancy is the result of sexual assault or incest.

Results of the ultrasound including images, a description of the fetus and a visualization of the fetal heartbeat must be offered to the woman. The woman can decline the results.

Anti-abortion activists have turned to enacting new restrictions on abortion at the state level after the Supreme Court's 1973 decision legalizing the procedure nationally in Roe v. Wade.

Wisconsin is the third state this week to move toward more restrictions on abortion after a Texas House committee and the North Carolina Senate both approved measures.

On Monday, the battle in Texas over proposed restrictions on abortion resumes with a public hearing in the Senate, where Democrat Wendy Davis staged a filibuster last month to stall the Republican-backed measure.

Wisconsin is one of eight states requiring a doctor to have admitting privileges, but measures in Mississippi and Alabama are blocked in court, according to data published July 1 by the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit organization that supports abortion rights.

Legal challenges are also blocking ultrasound abortion laws in Oklahoma and North Carolina, two of the 12 states with that type of measure in place, the Guttmacher Institute said.

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/12/05/Softball-Obama-Matthews,2013-12-05 00:00:00,['Ben Shapiro'],Date Night: Chris Matthews Tosses Softballs to Obama,"With President Obama’s approval ratings sinking thanks to the failing Obamacare rollout and the unpopular nuclear deal with Iran, Obama broke the media emergency glass to access the MSNBC host Chris Matthews. Matthews, who has compared Obama to Jesus and Henry V, and said that he was “the perfect American,” tossed Obama softball after softball, to which Obama gave stock answer after stock answer.

Matthews began by asking Obama about young people not signing up for health insurance. Obama said they should. Obama then made this stunning statement: “Sometimes on your station, MSNBC, I’ve been blasted for being too willing to compromise.” This nonsense passed without question from Matthews, who obviously was not in the mood to blast the president with anything but waves of hot love.

Matthews asked a question about National Security Agency surveillance. President Obama defended NSA activities, stating, “The NSA actually does a very good job about not engaging in domestic surveillance, not reading people’s emails.” He then added, wrongly, that outside of American borders, the NSA was “not constrained by laws.”

But that did not prompt a follow-on from Matthews. Instead, Matthews played a clip of John F. Kennedy speaking at American University, obviously attempting to link Obama with JFK. “”How do we get back to that confidence that we can solve our man-made problems and other problems?” Matthews drooled. Obama responded, “I have that confidence,” explaining that America was “on the brink of energy independence,” and stating that America is “still the envy of the world.”

Then Obama turned to the attack, stating that “Congress” is the big problem, since it “spends too much time worrying about the next election and not enough time worrying about the next generation.” Which part of the Congress? Obama explained: “The challenge we’ve got is we’ve got a faction of the Republican Party that sees compromise as a dirty word, that has moved so far to the right that it would be difficult for a Ronald Reagan to win the nomination of the Republican Party at this point.”

Matthews never uttered a word of disagreement. Instead, with all the subtly of a sledgehammer, Matthews goaded Obama on: “You’ve got three and a half more years to deal with this situation.”

And Obama took the bait, stating that in order for big things to happen, he had to have a Congressional majority. “The only thing that’s stopping [progress on issues like immigration] at this point is…a faction in the House Republican Party that is resistant,” Obama stated. He added that he believes that Republicans have “got to be embarrassed.”

Matthews, in full-on history professor mode, then turned to a 1964 poll showing that Americans believed that the federal government did the right thing most of the time. With forlorn hope in his eyes, he asked Obama, “What’s going to arrest that decline in that faith in you doing the right thing?” Obama solemnly intoned, “the cynicism and the skepticism is deep.”

Which brought the interview to the Bash Bush segment. Talking about the glories of the federal government, Obama praised the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Craig Fugate. “He’s really doing a good job, unlike his predecessor,” Matthews agreed, apparently referring to former FEMA head Michael Brown. Obama, picking up on the Bush-bashing, referred back to President Bush’s infamous statement that Brown had done a “heckuva job” in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina: Fugate, Obama said, was “doing a heckuva job.” That meant, Obama continued, that the federal government was great at doing things, but that the media never covered those wonderful accomplishments – an odd contention given the media’s nonstop coverage of the Obama administration’s handling of Hurricane Sandy just before Election 2012.

But that wasn’t Obama’s point. He wanted to argue that the media wasn’t paying attention to FEMA but was paying attention to the IRS scandal, in which the IRS targeted Tea Party 501(c)(4) organizations. The IRS had targeted those organizations, Obama explained, for “bureaucratic reasons,” and “suddenly everybody is outraged.” Matthews nodded, “501(c)4 law is tricky to begin with.”

Obama continued, “There are a couple million people working for the federal government…Someone at this very moment is screwing something up.” But Obama said that he’d try to rein in all of these nefarious actors: “I have to consistently push…how can we do things better?” He then called for “reorganiziation” of the government, saying that it was designed in 1934-35.

In completing his longwinded answer about why Americans had lost confidence in government, Obama blamed Ronald Reagan, who said government was the problem. That notion, Obama said, was damaging to the country: “Government’s not somebody else. Government’s us.”

Smiling warmly, Matthews then asked, “Let’s talk about the chief executive, you.” He continued, “There’s all kinds of theories about how to be president…There should have been a CEO assigned by you…to oversee the rollout of healthcare.” He finished, “It seemed like there wasn’t a strong, top-down authority structure from you…What is your system?”

Obama said that the failure of Obamacare’s rollout was an outlier. The government, he insisted, had worked beautifully in all of its other aspects under his administration.:”It is important to distinguish between this particular project, where it is obvious that we needed additional controls in place because it didn’t deliver on time the way we wanted, and how we’ve managed incredibly complex problems over the past five years.” Obama then said he’d hold “every cabinet member accountable” – although apparently not Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius – and then laughably added, “I have an open door policy where I want people to be bringing me bad news on time so we can fix things. The challenge I think we have going forward is not so much my personal management style…it actually has to do with what I referred to earlier. We have these big agencies.” That open door policy has meant that according to the White House, Obama was out of the loop on the IRS scandal, the DOJ’s targeting of journalists, the security situation in Libya, and every other scandal undergone by the administration.

Then the interview got truly bad. Matthews read a Twitter question: “What can we do to stop #GOP rigging the vote state by state to disenfranchise our voters & destroy our democracy?”

Without challenging the premise of the question, Matthews then stated, “Everybody knows the game, Republicans often admit the game.” Obama answered by blasting voter ID laws.

Just before the commercial break, Obama wrapped up in typical Obama style: he blamed everyone else. “You may agree with me or disagree with me, but don’t make the mistake of thinking it all ends with me,” he said.

MSNBC then cut to break by playing a segment from Obama’s 2004 speech at the Democratic National Convention in a blatant effort to breathe some magic into the wilting commander-in-chief.

Back from break, the awkward date continued. MSNBC played a clip of Obama saying he would run for president in 2007, followed by a clip of a slightly-less-frazzled Matthews, who proclaimed, “This is going to be remembered as a great day in American politics.”

Fast forward six years. Matthews hadn’t changed. He proceeded to ask Obama about his newfound focus on income inequality – and then he said that as a Roman Catholic, he found Obama’s redistributionism “So resonant with what the Holy Father…would say.”

Obama then blessed the Pope, stating, “I think Pope Francis is showing himself to be an extraordinarily thoughtful and soulful messenger of peace and justice.”

Finally, Obama turned to the role of government. As it turns out, Obama thinks the government can do virtually everything. Whether “creating the internet” or “curing diseases,” Obama stated, “there are some things we do better together, and we should take pride as a nation in our ability to work in concert.” He said that all of America’s future rested on American buying into the notion of government handling all of our big problems: “In fact the big challenges we have…those are not things that Chris Matthews or Barack Obama can solve for ourselves. By necessity we’re going to have to do those together. If we can at least agree on that…then we can figure out the specific policies and that’s where we can compromise or negotiate.” He then added, as an afterthought, “I won’t compromise” regarding the implementation of Obamacare.

Matthews, thoroughly pleased with how the interview was going, asked President Obama to answer “a little question you might not like to answer”: Hillary or Biden? Obama demurred, but stated that Biden would “go down in history as one of the best vice presidents ever.”

With the interview winding down, Matthews asked Obama the truly substantive question Americans were dying to hear answered: what’s the most important quality in being president? Obama gave his stock answer: “A sense of connection with the American people.” He then compared himself to Lincoln, FDR, Truman, and Kennedy, and added, “The interesting thing about now having been president for five years is it makes you humble as opposed to cockier about what you as an individual can do. You recognize that you’re part of a sweep of history, and your job is to push the boulder up the hill a little bit.”

Matthews finally asked Obama about running for office, praising him to the skies for sticking to politics after losing a Congressional race in 2000. “How many kids here want to go into politics. Are they right?” Matthews asked.

That essay question allowed Obama to wax poetic: “It continues to be a way to serve that I think can be noble. It’s hard. It can be frustrating, you have to have a thick skin.” He then said that he understood why Americans would join a nonprofit or start a business, noting, “We’re not completely government centered.” Then he said that he found it rewarding when people came up to him and said, “My kid’s alive because you passed that healthcare bill.” Really. “It’s pretty hard to get greater satisfaction than that,” he concluded.

The panel of Joy Reid, Howard Fineman, and David Corn then attempted to spin Obama back to the halcyon days of 2007, before he was president, with all three labeling Obama warm, open, and idealistic. Perhaps the only honest moment came from Fineman, who observed that Obama had now moved “from Superman to Sisyphus.”

An Iraq War combat veteran is hoping for a pardon from Gov. Scott Walker so he can become a police officer. But Walker is refusing to budge from his practice of not issuing any pardons.

That's right. No pardons. Ever.

Eric Pizer returned from Iraq in 2004 after serving 2 tours with the Marines. 2 days after his return he went to the help a friend involved in a fight by trying to break it up and wound up being charged with battery. He pleaded no contest, served 2 years of probation and paid over $7000 in medical bills after punching a man in the nose.

Now, 9 years later and with an associate degree in criminal justice, he wants to become a police officer. His felony conviction prevents that.



A pardon would not erase the conviction but it would restore Pizer's right to possess a firearm, which he needs to become a police officer.

Scott Walker, when asked about the pardon request, suggested Pizer find another career (sorry, I saw it this weekend on the tee vee machine, but for the life of me can't find it today).

Another more in depth article can be found here.

It's interesting that Walker, who never put on a uniform to serve his country and currently hides behind the most massive security detail in Wisconsin history while pretending to be ""unintimidated"", would refuse to aid a decorated Marine veteran. Also interesting to note is that one of his associates is getting out of prison early after stealing tens of thousands of dollars from a veterans fund put under his care and supervision by Scott Walker while he was Milwaukee County Executive. Interesting to note that this early release was ordered by the state Department of Corrections headed by a Walker appointee.

This one case is being highlighted in the press because this man seems to be someone who qualifies to have a pardon considered. A one-time offense which, he pled ""no contest"" to in order to avoid the expense and difficulty of a trial isn't part of a pattern of criminal or violent behavior. That the incident occurred 2 days after his return from his second deployment after a night of drinking.

Walkers ""no pardon"" policy, regardless of merit, is the problem here. There are people who deserve consideration and this man is only one of them.

Stay tuned for further episodes of Cruelty and Heartlessness, starting Scott Walker, a show continuously running in Wisconsin since January 2011. We're hoping for a cancellation at the end of 2014.

Happy Holidays all!

Credit... Gillian Laub for The New York Times

Bodrova and Leong had both studied Vygotsky, and they discussed whether some of his methods might help improve the climate of these classrooms. For Vygotsky, the real purpose of early-childhood education was not to learn content, like the letters of the alphabet or the names of shapes and colors and animals. The point was to learn how to think. When children enter preschool, Vygotsky wrote, they are “slaves to their environment,” unable to control their reactions or direct their interests, responding to whatever shiny objects are put in front of them. Accordingly, the most important goal of prekindergarten is to teach children how to master their thoughts. And the best way for children to do that, Vygotsky believed, especially at this early age, is to employ various tools, tricks and habits that train the mind to work at a higher level. So Tools of the Mind students learn to use “private speech” — to talk to themselves as they do a difficult task (like, say, forming the letter W), to help themselves remember what step comes next (down, up, down, up). They use “mediators”: physical objects that remind them how to do a particular task, like CD-size cards, one with a pair of lips and one with an ear, that signify whose turn it is to read aloud in Buddy Reading and whose turn it is to listen. But more than anything, they use play.

Most of Vygotsky’s counterparts in the field of child psychology, including influential figures like Jean Piaget and Maria Montessori, held that imaginary play was an immature form of expression, a preliminary stage of development. But Vygotsky maintained that at 4 or 5, a child’s ability to play creatively with other children was in fact a better gauge of her future academic success than any other indicator, including her vocabulary, her counting skills or her knowledge of the alphabet. Dramatic play, he said, was the training ground where children learned to regulate themselves, to conquer their own unruly minds. In the United States, we often associate play with freedom, but to Vygotsky, dramatic play was actually the arena where children’s actions were most tightly restricted. When a young boy is acting out the role of a daddy making breakfast, he is limited by all the rules of daddy-ness. Some of those limitations come from his playmates: if he starts acting like a baby (or a policeman or a dinosaur) in the middle of making breakfast, the other children will be sure to steer him back to the eggs and bacon. But even beyond that explicit peer pressure, Vygotsky would say, the child is guided by the basic principles of play. Make-believe isn’t as stimulating and satisfying — it simply isn’t as much fun — if you don’t stick to your role. And when children follow the rules of make-believe and push one another to follow those rules, he said, they develop important habits of self-control.

Bodrova and Leong drew on research conducted by some of Vygotsky’s followers that showed that children acting out a dramatic scene can control their impulses much better than they can in nonplay situations. In one experiment, 4-year-old children were first asked to stand still for as long as they could. They typically did not make it past a minute. But when the kids played a make-believe game in which they were guards at a factory, they were able to stand at attention for more than four minutes. In another experiment, prekindergarten-age children were asked to memorize a list of unrelated words. Then they played “grocery store” and were asked to memorize a similar list of words — this time, though, as a shopping list. In the play situation, on average, the children were able to remember twice as many words. Bodrova and Leong say they see the same effect in Tools of the Mind classrooms: when their students spend more time on dramatic play, not only does their level of self-control improve, but so do their language skills.

In the past, when psychologists (or parents or teachers or priests) tried to improve children’s self-control, they used the principles of behaviorism, reinforcing good and bad behaviors with rewards and punishments. The message to kids was that terrible things would happen if they didn’t control their impulses, and the role of adults, whether parents or preschool teachers, was to train children by praising them for their positive self-control (“Look at how well Cindy is sitting!”) and criticizing them for their lapses. And in most American prekindergartens and kindergartens, behaviorism, in some form, is still the dominant method. But Bodrova and Leong say that those “external reinforcement systems” create “other-directed regulation” — good behavior done not from some internal sense of control but for the approval of others, to avoid punishment and win praise and treats. And that, they say, is a kind of regulation that is not particularly valuable or lasting. Children learn only how to be obedient, how to follow orders, not how to understand and regulate their own impulses. The ultimate goal of Tools of the Mind is not emotional or physical self-regulation; it is cognitive self-regulation — not the ability to avoid grabbing a toy from the kid next to you (though that’s an important first step), but the much more subtle ability to avoid falling for a deceptively attractive wrong answer on a test or to concentrate on an arduous mental task. And those abilities are more difficult to affect by other-directed regulation. Because the abilities are more abstract, they are less likely to be elicited by rewards. Kids are rarely able to organize their thoughts better in order to get an ice-cream cone.

As a result, many practices that most prekindergarten teachers consider essential are more or less banned from Tools of the Mind classrooms. There are no gold stars, no telling the class that they are all going to have to wait until Jimmy is quiet; even timeouts are discouraged. When there is a conflict — when, say, Billy grabs a toy from Jamal — the Tools of the Mind teacher’s first questions are supposed to be: What was it in the classroom that made it hard for Billy to control himself? And what mediators could help him do better next time? The teacher does remind Billy that there is a rule and he broke it, but she doesn’t make a big deal out of the incident. “We pretty much try not to use this whole concept of misbehavior,” Bodrova told me. “These kids are not born criminals. Even if they do something that is completely out of bounds, they do it because they can’t stop themselves.”

There are not yet firm experimental data that prove that Tools of the Mind works. But two early studies that began in the late 1990s in Denver showed some promising results: After a year in the program, students did significantly better than a similar group on basic measures of literacy ability. And more recent studies, including one overseen by Adele Diamond, a professor at the University of British Columbia who is one of the most prominent researchers in the field of cognitive self-control, have shown that Tools students consistently score higher on tests requiring executive function. Angela Duckworth told me that when she read Diamond’s report, which was published in Science in 2007, “I got very excited.” Her failed 2003 study had persuaded her that the usual approach to self-control in early-childhood education, a brief intervention here or there, wouldn’t work. But Tools of the Mind was clearly a different strategy. “It’s an immersion approach,” she said. “It’s not that these kids are pulled out and they do self-control for half an hour a day. Everything is about self-regulation, every single moment. Everything about the culture that the classroom creates reinforces that.”"

John McCain throws a damper on Dodgers’ pool party,"SAN DIEGO — Jon Stewart really needs to be the one writing this column. Ladies and gentlemen, and baseball fans of all ages, we present to you: The Los Angeles Dodgers vs. Sen. John McCain.

No spoof.

The issue that gripped America on Friday: Did the Dodgers commit a breach of etiquette by jumping in the Arizona Diamondbacks’ pool to celebrate the National League West championship?

Was this truly a matter of great importance in these United States? Must have been, because the senior senator from Arizona took to Twitter to let his position be known, in no uncertain terms.

“No-class act by a bunch of overpaid, immature, arrogant, spoiled brats!” The tweet included a link to an Arizona Republic column with this headline: “The Dodgers are idiots.”

It is common for elected officials to let a staff member mind their Twitter accounts. We immediately wondered whether an over-eager intern and frustrated Diamondbacks fan sent out the tweet in McCain’s name.

Advertisement

Nope.

“His tweets are all him,” McCain spokesman Brian Rogers said.

Advertisement

That this is even an issue is beyond ridiculous. In 2004, the St. Louis Cardinals clinched the NL Central in Milwaukee, then celebrated by taking turns going down Bernie Brewer’s slide. The Brewers did not throw a fit. Also, Twitter and MLB Network did not exist to dispense outrage at warp speed.

What the Dodgers did on Thursday was not akin to clinching in San Francisco, then defacing the statue of Willie Mays. The Dodgers did not deface, destroy or damage anything. They did not plant their flag on Arizona’s field.

Advertisement

They jumped into a pool, to which the Diamondbacks sell tickets for fans to enter every day. The Dodgers did not bring lounge chairs and beach balls with them. The Diamondbacks had nothing to clean up but a few drops of water on a pool deck, and a few wounded egos in their clubhouse.

Oh, and they had to retrieve a stray blue belt, the one Scott Van Slyke took off before he jumped in, then forgot to pick up on the way out.

The San Diego Padres do not have a pool beyond right field. They do have a beach beyond center field.

“If we won it here, would the Padres be mad if we jumped the fence and made sand castles?” Dodgers Manager Don Mattingly said.

Advertisement

On the day after the splash heard ‘round the world, the Dodgers insisted they did not act with malice or disrespect. Michael Young called the pool party “harmless,” Nick Punto called it “fun,” and J.P. Howell compared it to “egging someone’s house.”

So, at worst, a silly prank.

Advertisement

“You get caught up in the moment,” Andre Ethier said. “You do dumb things. We won the West, and that is getting overlooked.”

That is true, sadly, but that is not the most unfortunate outcome.

Advertisement

The most unfortunate outcome is that the Dodgers players appeared to keep a more level head than the senior senator from Arizona.

Not on Twitter, where Brian Wilson responded in kind.

Advertisement

“Senator McComplain knows a thing or two about coming in second and watching someone take a plunge in the pool (I mean poll),” Wilson tweeted.

However, in the Dodgers clubhouse Friday, there was more offense taken to what McCain said than to what any of the Arizona players said.

Advertisement

“I’m going to assume he was speaking as a fan and not as a public servant,” Young said.

Ethier said it was one thing to criticize the act of jumping in the pool — “Maybe some of his constituents were complaining to him, wondering if he could do something,” Ethier said — quite another to label the players as overpaid, immature, arrogant and spoiled.

Advertisement

“That’s over the line,” said Ethier, who lives in Arizona.

“It is absolutely absurd that he would even comment on that,” said Mark Ellis, who also lives in Arizona. “I would have thought he would know better than that. He doesn’t know any of us. The whole thing is absolutely ridiculous.

Advertisement

“To call us overpaid? Come on. Coming from a politician?”

Young said he would welcome the chance to meet with McCain, to explain how players are heavily involved in charities in the cities in which they play, and in their hometowns.

Advertisement

“I’d like to change his tune that we’re spoiled,” Young said. “I’ve never had the pleasure of meeting him. I’d love to.”

The rest of the Dodgers would just as soon return to taking on baseball teams, not senior senators.

Jodean Elliot-Blakeslee, a 69-year-old physician from Boise, has been missing since Sept. 21, when she and friend Amelia Linkert did not return from a camping trip. The body of Linkert, 63, was found four days later, but Blakeslee remains missing. Park officials asked for and received a waiver to keep 10 highly-trained rangers on hand for the search, in addition to a three-person skeleton crew, although none know if they will be paid.

[pullquote]

“The shutdown has certainly complicated things, and we’re all on non-pay status at this point,” Ted Stout, chief of interpretation and education at the monument, told FoxNews.com. “There’s a lot of questions as to how this all works, questions as to whether or not we’ll be paid … It’s another complicating factor.”

Despite uncertainty from Washington, Stout's boss, Craters of the Moon National Monument & Preserve Superintendent Dan Buckley, told FoxNews.com his team insisted on continuing the search, which is now focused on an area of the park known as Derelict Lava Flow.

""I’m proud of them for stepping up and saying we need to continue the search,” Buckley said. “We’re working closely with the family and we’d love to see this thing come to closure — today if we could.”

On Monday, relatives of Blakeslee called on experienced hikers to join the search in central and eastern Idaho, where rugged topography and unpredictable weather can make conditions difficult.

“We realize the chance of Dr. Jo surviving in temperatures that have dipped below freezing are slim,” the statement read. “However, we are not ruling out the outside chance that she has found shelter in a cave or under vegetation. Either way, we are committed to bringing her home and are actively recruiting volunteers with backcountry experience to keep the search going.”

Due to the treacherous terrain, relatives asked that volunteers be able to hike up to 12 miles and climb at least 1,000 feet on rocky slopes.

Teresa Hampton, a friend of Elliott-Blakeslee, told the Idaho Statesman that she received a few calls early Tuesday from volunteers seeking to join the search effort.

“The government shutdown does put another wrinkle into this situation,” Hampton told the newspaper. “It’s another challenge, but it’s not one that can’t be overcome.”

Meanwhile, the search in remote Washington state for Kristopher Zitzewitz, missing in the Gofford Pinchot National Forest, has been suspended pending further information that could aid the effort.

Skamania County Undersheriff Dave Cox told FoxNews.com that in national forests inside the state, the local county sheriff has lead jurisdiction in such searches. Cox said his department sometimes gets specialized help from U.S. Forest Service crews though it has not in the current cases.

“Even though the Forest Service is shut down, we are able to continue,” Cox said. “The federal government shutdown has not hampered the ability of the Skamania County Sheriff’s Office to perform search operations as we normally would.”

Zitzewitz, of Portland, Ore., was last seen in the Big Lava Bed in the Gifford Pinchot National Forest in southwestern Washington. He and a friend, Caleb Richie, were looking for caves in the area when they became separated on Saturday. Richie made it out safely.

Anothher hiker missing in a separate case, Alejandrea Wilson, was found by the Skamania County Sheriff's Department in waist-deep snow but alive earlier this week. Wilson was hiking the Pacific Crest Trail, a path from Mexico to Canada that cuts through seven national forests or parks."

“There was absolutely no reason, whatsoever, for this administration to block access to the World War Two Memorial or the Lincoln Memorial. It’s never ever been done in a government shutdown prior to this administration doing so.”

Look, Rep. Paul Broun, we've already decided that Texas Republican Louie Gohmert is America's Dumbest Congressman. You don't have to keep trying so hard There are at least two problems with this.

1. The Lincoln Memorial was indeed closed during a previous government shutdown in 1995. That one was also caused by Republicans trying to extract concessions from a Democratic president. Broun should remember it well, since he ran for Congress the following year. (He lost.)

2. The World War II Memorial was completed in 2004, and so did not exist during any previous shutdowns. While this renders Broun's statement technically true, it is true in the same way as saying ""Abraham Lincoln never dined at Chipotle"" is true. Neither statement makes a particularly intriguing point.

Paul Broun is running for the U.S. Senate this time around, possibly because Paul Broun has been running for things for over 20 years and is bored with being a mere congressman. He is also known for being the congressman who thinks evolution, embryology and the Big Bang Theory are lies from the pit of Hell. Observing that monuments were never closed during time periods in which they did not exist is precisely the level of insight Mr. Broun typically brings to conversations; observing things that are flatly and provably untrue is just the usual conservative model for pandering to the base."

The additional guidelines created by the agency were part of a timeline, obtained by Fox News, from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, which is looking into the controversial IRS practice. IRS officials apologized Friday for the scrutiny, but new information suggests senior leaders were apprised of the effort as early as 2011 despite public denials from the top.

Republican lawmakers have vowed to investigate and hold hearings, calling the revelations deeply troubling.

""The conclusion that the IRS came to is that they did have agents who were engaged in intimidation of political groups,"" Michigan Rep. Mike Rogers told ""Fox News Sunday."" ""I don't care if you're a conservative, a liberal, a Democrat or a Republican, this should send a chill up your spine. It needs to have a full investigation.""

The House Ways and Means Committee plans to hold a hearing Friday, Fox News has learned. A top Democrat -- Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus -- also said Monday that his committee would launch a ""full investigation"" into the matter.

""These actions by the IRS are an outrageous abuse of power and a breach of the public's trust. Targeting groups based on their political views is not only inappropriate but it is intolerable,"" the Montana Democrat said in a statement. ""Americans expect the IRS to do its job without passion or prejudice. We need to get to the bottom of what happened here. ... The IRS will now be the ones put under additional scrutiny.""

President Obama weighed in as well, saying at a press conference Monday that if the reports are true, ""then that's outrageous and there's no place for it -- and they have to be held fully accountable.""

Obama said he first found out about the practice on Friday. He said that if agents behaved in a partisan fashion, ""I've got no patience with it. I will not tolerate it.""

The internal IG timeline shows a unit in the agency was looking at Tea Party and ""patriot"" groups dating back to early 2010. But it shows that list of criteria drastically expanding by the time a June 2011 briefing was held. It then included groups focused on government spending, government debt, taxes, and education on ways to ""make America a better place to live."" It even flagged groups whose file included criticism of ""how the country is being run.""

By early 2012, the criteria were updated to include organizations involved in ""limiting/expanding government,"" education on the Constitution and Bill of Rights, and social economic reform.

Taken together, the findings of the IG and the initial admissions by the IRS Friday are fueling complaints from Republicans on Capitol Hill.

Evidence that the IRS was flagging such groups in 2011 was included in a draft inspector general's report obtained Saturday by Fox News and other news organizations and expected to be released in full later this week.

That information seemingly contradicts public statements by IRS Commissioner Douglas Shulman, who told congressional investigators in March 2011 that specific groups were not being targeted.

Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins on Sunday also called the IRS activities chilling and said she was disappointed that President Obama had not condemned the actions.

""This is truly outrageous and it contributes to the profound distrust that the American people have in government,"" Collins told CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""It is absolutely chilling that the IRS was singling out conservative groups for extra review. And I think that it's very disappointing that the president hasn't personally condemned this.""

At about the same time, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney released a statement saying: ""If the inspector general finds that there were any rules broken or that conduct of government officials did not meet the standards required of them, the president expects that swift and appropriate steps will be taken to address any misconduct.""

Michigan Republican Rep. Dave Camp, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said Friday his committee will hold a hearing on the issue.

The IRS said Friday that it was sorry for what it called the ""inappropriate"" targeting of the conservative groups during the 2012 elections.

Lois G. Lerner, who heads the IRS division that oversees tax-exempt organizations, said the practice was initiated by low-level workers in Cincinnati and was not motivated by political bias.

But on June 29, 2011, Lerner found out that such groups were being targeted, according to the inspector general's report.

She was told at a meeting that groups with ""Tea Party,"" ""Patriot"" or ""9/12 Project"" in their names were being flagged for additional and often burdensome scrutiny, the report states.

The 9/12 Project is a group started by conservative TV personality Glenn Beck.

Collins also said she does not believe the activity was limited to ""a couple of rogue IRS employees.""

""After all,"" she added, ""groups with `progressive' in their names were not targeted similarly.""

USA TODAY Review%3A **1/2 stars out of four

Stars%3A Channing Tatum%2C Jamie Foxx%2C Maggie Gyllenhaal%2C Richard Jenkins%2C James Woods%2C Jason Clarke

Rated PG-13%3B Runtime%3A 2 hours%2C 11 minutes%3B Opens in select cities Thursday and nationwide Friday

""Tour's over,"" yells a shotgun-toting terrorist who takes a group of Washington, D.C., visitors hostage in the preposterous White House Down.

But the fireworks have just begun.

With its well-choreographed mayhem, Down (* * ½ out of four; rated PG-13, opens in select cities Thursday and nationwide Friday) is an over-the top, Die Hard-style thriller that will make pulses race more than the recent, similarly themed Olympus Has Fallen. While director Roland Emmerich (Independence Day) piles on outlandish scenarios, the chemistry of the lead actors mitigates the contrived setup and numbing explosions.

Just after President James Sawyer (Jamie Foxx) announces his plan to pull American troops out of the Middle East, an insurrection plot is set in motion.

After serving heroically in Afghanistan, John Cale (Channing Tatum) works as a police officer assigned to security for Speaker of the House Raphelson (Richard Jenkins). Cale is endearing thanks to his self-deprecating humor, low-key swagger and commitment to regain the love of his estranged 11-year-old daughter, Emily (Joey King). It also helps that he braves a legion of guerrillas to single-handedly protect the president, even after getting turned down for a spot in the Secret Service.

To ensure that this $150 million movie makes a killing overseas, the terrorists are homegrown. A motley crew of Americans unaffiliated with any ideology — other than wanting to blow stuff up — takes over POTUS' stately home and wreaks havoc.

Sawyer is overtly Obama-esque: He's an inspiring orator, a levelheaded leader and a devoted family man, and he is criticized for being too scholarly. He's even a former smoker. But this is Hollywood's D.C., so when enough has clearly become enough, the commander in chief whips off his wingtips, slips into athletic shoes and lobs a rocket launcher at the bad guys.

Foxx has just the right blend of dignity, smarts and affability to make us want to vote for him. Tatum is a consistently likable Everyman who proves his mettle à la Bruce Willis in the Die Hard movies — with less smirking.

Maggie Gyllenhaal plays Carol Finnerty, a Secret Service official who rejects Cale as a job applicant, despite his war-hero status, mostly because he got C's in college. Cue mass audience sympathy. Making him even more lovable, Cale has brought Emily along for a White House tour following his interview. That's why they're in the house, so to speak, when the rebels take over.

All disbelief must be checked at the theater door. Emmerich's White House has less security than the tiniest airport pre-9/11. A janitor is actually packing bombs, as are the alleged repairmen working in the president's private theater. A crowd watches a car chase with Cale and Sawyer in a presidential limo being shot at by rebels on the White House lawn.

None of the actions taken by administration officials during the takeover make a lick of sense. So it's best to simply sit back and enjoy the camaraderie of Tatum and Foxx as they narrowly avert disaster.

Who can resist a war hero willing to risk everything to protect his adorable daughter and his high-minded president in one movie? It's popcorn patriotism at its finest."

Mitchell Professor At Georgetown University Law Center. He Is Also The Legal Affairs Correspondent For The Nation', 'A Regular Contributor To The New York Review Of Books.']",Don’t let DOMA fool you — the Supreme Court is restricting your rights,"David Cole is a professor of constitutional law and criminal justice at Georgetown University Law Center and a fellow at the Open Society Foundation.

The Supreme Court’s 5 to 4 decision to strike down a key part of the Defense of Marriage Act was undeniably historic, a victory not just for gay rights advocates but for anyone committed to advancing equal rights in America.

It was also an anomaly.

For all the celebration Wednesday — and who will forget the Gay Men’s Chorus of Washingtonsinging the national anthem outside the court? — the underlying theme of the Supreme Court’s term was not the recognition of rights, but their dilution. Time and again, in closely divided decisions on issues as disparate as antitrust law, privacy and discrimination, the court either watered down rights or made it difficult or impossible to enforce them effectively. (Unless, of course, you are a white college applicant challenging affirmative action.)

In two cases, the justices made it impossible for plaintiffs alleging serious violations of federal law even to have their claims heard. In Clapper v. Amnesty International, the court denied a constitutional challenge to the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, which vastly expanded the National Security Agency’s surveillance powers. This law authorizes the recently disclosed surveillance programs, which involve the interception of international e-mails, phone conversations and social-network communications. The act permits surveillance without having to show that the target is suspected of anything, thereby jettisoning the bedrock requirement of the Fourth Amendment. The plaintiffs in Clapper included lawyers, human rights advocates and journalists, all of whom communicated frequently with people overseas whom the government was likely to be targeting under the statute, and therefore had to take expensive and burdensome measures to preserve the confidentiality of their communications.

With a majority comprised of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Samuel A. Alito Jr., Anthony M. Kennedy, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, the Supreme Court ruled that the plaintiffs’ claims could not be heard because they could not show that they had actually been subjected to the surveillance. The catch: The surveillance is conducted in secret, so no one can be certain that he or she is subject to it.

In a second case, American Express Co. v. Italian Colors Restaurant , the same five justices ruled that corporations can insulate themselves from liability for violating federal law by inserting clauses in their contracts that prohibit class-action arbitration. A group of small merchants argued that American Express had violated antitrust laws by using its monopoly power to charge credit card fees 30 percent higher than those of its competitors. But American Express had used the same monopoly power to draft a form contract that directed all legal disputes into arbitration — and then forbade arbitration on a class-wide basis. The merchants argued that because antitrust claims are so expensive to prove, they are not worth pursuing on an individual basis and can be vindicated only through collective, class-wide proceedings.

The Supreme Court previously ruled that contracts may require arbitration rather than court litigation only if the arbitration proceeding provides an adequate forum for individuals to vindicate their rights. In Italian Colors, the court’s majority conceded that requiring individual arbitrations would make it too expensive to challenge American Express’s conduct, but, as Justice Elena Kagan paraphrased the majority’s response in her dissent: “Too darn bad.”

In three other closely divided decisions, the court’s conservative justices made equality rights decidedly harder to enforce. In Shelby County v. Holder, the court invalidated a key provision of the 1965 Voting Rights Act that required select states with a history of discrimination to clear any changes in their voting arrangements with the federal government ahead of time, by showing that the changes would not dilute the rights of minority voters. This preclearance requirement was the most effective part of the law because it prevented discriminatory actions from taking effect in the first place, rather than requiring victims to later sue in court, where challenges are often so expensive and time-consuming that they cannot adequately address many discriminatory voting practices.

The court previously upheld the preclearance requirement four times, but on Tuesday the conservative majority broke with years of precedent and concluded that the rights of states are more important than the equal voting rights of minority citizens.

In a pair of less-noticed decisions released the day before Shelby County, the court, once again by 5 to 4votes, issued employer-friendly, worker-hostile interpretations of Title VII, the section of the Civil Rights Act that prohibits discrimination in employment. In both cases, the court rejected long-standing interpretations of the law by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. In University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar, the court imposed a more demanding standard on “retaliation” claims, brought when an employer responds to a discrimination complaint by punishing the employee for raising the issue.

And in Vance v. Ball State University, the court narrowed the definition of “supervisors” under Title VII, thereby reducing employers’ responsibility for racial and sexual harassment in the workplace. Title VII says employers are more responsible for harassment from supervisors than from co-workers, and the EEOC had sensibly defined “supervisor” as a person with the authority to direct another’s daily work. But the court’s conservatives limited “supervisors” to those who have the formal authority to hire, fire, and grant or deny promotions, a much narrower group. The ruling means that victims of harassment by supervisors who lack such formal authority will be significantly less protected.

The justices also curtailed our rights against the police. In Maryland v. King, the court ruled that the state can take DNA samples from arrestees without a warrant or any basis for suspicion. It reasoned that DNA samples, like fingerprints, are taken for identification purposes, not to investigate a crime, and so don’t have to meet the “individualized suspicion” standard that applies to investigatory searches. But as Justice Scalia pointed out in a dissent joined by Justices Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, DNA samples are not taken to identify arrestees but to investigate whether they are responsible for some other crime.

The practice of taking DNA samples, if strictly limited to identifying characteristics and not used to determine an individual’s genetic traits, may seem reasonable enough, as the intrusion is minor. But allowing sweeping searches without individualized suspicion runs contrary to the court’s long-standing Fourth Amendment rules.

Meanwhile, in Salinas v. Texas, the court’s conservative majority ruled, paradoxically, that Americans’ right to remain silent won’t be protected unless they speak up. The court decided that if someone refuses to answer potentially incriminating questions, it’s perfectly permissible for the state to use that refusal in a criminal trial, as long as the questions were asked outside the trial or an interrogation in custody. The result is that individuals who believe they have a right to remain silent (having been so informed by countless television shows) and exercise it will be punished for doing so.

Of course, the high court was not uniformly hostile to individual rights. In addition to striking down the Defense of Marriage Act’s limits on federal marriage benefits, it also gave a partial victory to Abigail Fisher, a white applicant who challenged the University of Texas’s affirmative action plan; in that case, the court compromised, concluding that the lower courts had not subjected the university’s plan to sufficient scrutiny, and sent the case back for further review. But of course that ruling, issued in the name of equal protection, actually limits efforts to remove barriers for minorities.

The larger pattern is clear: This term, the Roberts court regularly favored restricting people’s rights or, more insidiously, limiting their ability to enforce those rights.

Almost all these rulings were 5 to 4 decisions, most divided along familiar ideological lines. The close votes reflect the fact that there were reasonable arguments to be made on both sides. But courts play an essential role in safeguarding individual rights, and in this term, the Supreme Court repeatedly did the opposite. Congress could, of course, fix many of the problems through legislation — but leaving the protection of individual rights to a polarized and partisan institution offers cold comfort.

Updated at 2:35 p.m. ET on Friday 5/31



(CNN) – In the early days of President Barack Obama's sweeping new health care law, Douglas Shulman, then the commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service, was cleared to visit the White House 157 times over three years, official visitor logs show.

More than 50 of Douglas Shulman's scheduled visits are described as ""health care meetings"" or ""health care reform meetings,"" according to the visitor logs. Arrival times are only listed for 11 of his visits, and it's not unusual for a person to appear on the visitor logs - which are derived from Secret Service clearance lists - without actually having visited the White House. The majority of the visits were set to be held in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, which houses office suites for administration aides.



The IRS, which has come under fire for its admitted targeting of conservative groups applying to become tax exempt, is responsible for enforcing many of the new rules associated with Obamacare, which was signed into law on March 23, 2010.

Official White House visitor logs show Shulman's scheduled White House visits came between October 2009 and December 2012. Shulman was appointed by President Bush in 2008 and left the post in November 2012. On Fox News Thursday, Shulman's predecessor Mark Everson stated he'd only visited the White House once during his tenure as IRS commissioner, though visitor logs for the Bush administration aren't available publically online.

According to an inspector general report from earlier this May, March 2010 was the month IRS agents began filtering applications for tax-exempt status using the words ""tea party"" and ""patriot."" The agency experienced a flood of new applications after the Supreme Court decision in the Citizens United case that opened the door to increased corporate and private political spending.

Of Shulman's meetings recorded in the visitor logs, 40 listed his ""visitee"" as Nancy Ann DeParle, who acted as the director of the White House Office of Health Reform until 2011, when she moved into the role of deputy chief of staff for policy. Fifty-four visit records list Sarah Fenn as Shulman's ""visitee."" Fenn is listed as a staff assistant in 2010 White House salary records. In 2011 she's described as ""assistant counsel of ethics.""

Five visits listed Obama as the ""visitee.""

The president's health care law created a massive new workload for the IRS, which is charged with issuing and enforcing rules related to Obamacare. The agency's tasks include collecting information for employers and insurers; figuring out who qualified for subsidies or Medicaid, determining who must pay a penalty for not obtaining insurance, and penalizing employers that don't provide affordable coverage to their employees.

""Tax provisions included in the Affordable Care Act represent the largest set of tax law changes the IRS has had to implement in more than 20 years,"" the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration noted in a recent report.

The ACA has some 500 provisions, and more than 40 amend or add provisions to the tax code, according to the report.

In congressional testimony earlier this month, Shulman was quizzed on his visits to the White House. He attributed one visit to taking his children to the annual Easter egg roll hosted by the president and first lady, but said at no point did he talk to anyone at the White House about the agency's tax exempt rules. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney backed up that claim last week, saying ""An IRS commissioner appropriately has - or his designees have - meetings on matters of policy all the time, but not discussions about enforcement or applications for tax exempt status.""

Speaking in separate testimony before the Senate Finance Committee, Shulman said that he was aware of some aspects of his agency's targeting of conservative groups in the spring of 2012, and took what he called the correct action of ensuring the situation would be independently reviewed.

But he denied full awareness of what was happening at the time, saying subordinates failed to inform him of the details.

Top White House officials say they knew nothing of the targeting when it occurred. General Counsel Kathryn Ruemmler learned of the pending inspector general's report on April 24, 2013, according to Carney. She later informed other top Obama aides, including chief of staff Denis McDonough.

Carney insisted no one - including Ruemmler and McDonough - told Obama anything about the inspector general's pending report before media reports about it began appearing on May 10.

Obamas and Clintons visit Kennedy grave site at Arlington National Cemetery

WASHINGTON — President Obama paid tribute Wednesday to Democratic predecessor Bill Clinton, and both of them honored a presidential icon, John F. Kennedy.

As a bugler played taps, Obama, Clinton and spouses Michelle Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton stood with hands over hearts before the eternal flame that illuminates Kennedy's grave at Arlington National Cemetery.

The solemn ceremony and other events began a series of memorials across the nation leading into Friday, the 50th anniversary of the assassination that transformed American politics and culture.

Before the Arlington visit, Obama awarded Clinton and 15 other Americans the Presidential Medal of Freedom, created 50 years ago by President Kennedy. Other recipients included television legend Oprah Winfrey, country music artist Loretta Lynn, women's rights leader Gloria Steinem,

baseball great Ernie Banks and the late pioneering astronaut Sally Ride.

""These are the men and women who in their extraordinary lives remind us all of the beauty of the human spirit, the values that define us as Americans, the potential that lives inside of all of us,"" Obama said during a ceremony at the White House, echoing Kennedy's reasons for establishing the award.

""John F. Kennedy stands for posterity as he did in life — young and bold and daring,"" Obama said later in the day at a dinner honoring current and former Medal of Freedom recipients. ""He stays with us in our imagination not because he left us too soon, but because he embodied the character of the people that he led.""

The delegation to the Kennedy grave site in Arlington included members of the Kennedy family, as well as a former official who may soon seek the presidency herself: former first lady and secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.

At the site, Obama and Bill Clinton escorted Ethel Kennedy, widow of slain JFK brother Robert F. Kennedy. Each president held one of her hands and helped her climb some stairs.

During a wordless ceremony on a sunny but chilly day, the Obamas and the Clintons placed a wreath before the twin graves of President Kennedy and wife Jacqueline.

Jack Schlossberg, a grandson of President Kennedy, greeted dignitaries as they arrived at the grave site.

The presidential couples later greeted members of the family. ""Good to see you,"" Obama told one group amid smiles and hugs. The president and first lady also read some of the inscriptions etched into a memorial at the grave site.

The Obamas and the Clintons rode to the cemetery in the same limousine; they left separately.

Months before his death, Kennedy had visited Arlington House at the cemetery, a spot just above his future grave. He reputedly said, ""I could stay here forever.""

Jacqueline Kennedy made the decision to put the eternal flame at her husband's resting place.

Like their presidential predecessors, Obama and Clinton have often paid homage to the memory of the charismatic Kennedy.

The Kennedy family gave Obama crucial support during his 2008 presidential campaign. The endorsement of Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., the late president's brother, helped Obama win that year's Democratic primary race over Hillary Clinton. Edward Kennedy is also buried at the Arlington grave site.

This year, Obama made Caroline Kennedy, JFK's daughter, the ambassador to Japan.

During a June 19 speech in Berlin — site of of Kennedy's ""Ich bin ein Berliner"" speech of 1963, just months before his death — Obama said his predecessor's words ""are timeless because they call upon us to care more about things than just our own self-comfort, about our own city, about our own country.""

Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign featured pictures of him as a 16-year-old member of Boys Nation shaking hands with President Kennedy in 1963, casting it as a symbolic passing of the torch.

Even Republican presidents have hailed the Kennedy mystique. President Reagan, for example, cited JFK's support for tax cuts.

Obama's Republican predecessor, George W. Bush, cultivated Edward Kennedy's support on education and other issues. Bush invited Edward Kennedy and members of his family to the screening of a film about JFK's handling of the Cuban Missile Crisis.

During the Presidential Medal of Freedom ceremony in the East Room, Obama praised Clinton for a journey that took him from a small town in Arkansas to the White House and cited his predecessor's post-presidential humanitarian work, saying, ""He doesn't stop.""

The current president also thanked Clinton for his ""advice and counsel ... on and off the golf course.""

Referencing Hillary Clinton, Obama joked to the former president: ""Of course, I am most grateful for his patience during the endless travels of my secretary of State.""

Other Presidential Medal of Freedom recipients hailed from the worlds of politics, entertainment, science, civil rights, and the arts.

Winfrey, whose talk show transformed television interviews, reached ""the pinnacle of the entertainment universe,"" Obama said of his fellow Chicagoan and longtime political supporter.

""In more than 4,500 episodes of her show, her message was always, 'you can,'"" Obama said.

In addition to Clinton, Obama honored other political leaders. He hailed the ""visionary work"" of former senator Richard Lugar, R-Ind., to reduce global stockpiles of nuclear weapons, describing it as the ""destruction of Cold War arsenals.""

The late Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, lost an arm and earned a Medal of Honor in World War II, and went on to become the second-longest-serving senator in U.S. history.

Civil and human rights played a large role in the Medal of Freedom ceremony.

Steinem, the feminist who began professional life as a journalist, ""awakened a vast and often skeptical public to problems like domestic violence, the lack of affordable child care, (and) unfair hiring practices,"" Obama said.

The Rev. C.T. Vivian, a close adviser to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., was ""among the first to be in on the action"" during the civil rights struggles of the 1960s, from lunch counters to freedom rides to Selma, Obama said.

Another civil rights activist, the late Bayard Rustin, organized the 1963 March on Washington. Obama pointed out that history has sometimes denied Rustin due credit because he was an openly gay man.

Judge Patricia Wald was the first woman to sit on the U.S.Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C.

Lynn, often called the queen of country music, ""gave voice to a generation, singing what no one wanted to talk about and saying what no one wanted to think about,"" Obama said. She is, literally, a Coal Miner's Daughter, the title of a 1980 biographical film about her life.

Jazz legend Arturo Sandoval learned to play the trumpet in communist Cuba, where listening to music on the Voice of America could be dangerous, Obama said.

Obama noted that baseball Hall of Famer Ernie Banks — ""Mr. Cub"" — came up through the old Negro League, joined the Chicago Cubs as their first African-American player, and became famous for his infectious enthusiasm as well as his 512 home runs.

Former University of North Carolina basketball coach Dean Smith — a hoops innovator, winner of 879 games — helped integrate a restaurant and neighborhood in Chapel Hill and recruited the school's first African-American athlete during the 1960s, the president said.

Science was also honored at the Medal of Freedom ceremony.

Nobel Prize-winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman ""basically invented the study of human decision making,"" Obama said.

Environmental scientist Mario Molina, another Nobel Prize winner, has defined the dangers of carbon emissions, the president said.

Another honoree had a direct connection to John Kennedy: Ben Bradlee was a neighbor of JFK's and covered his presidency for Newsweek magazine. Bradlee later was editor of The Washington Post, making it a national political force through coverage of the Pentagon Papers and Watergate."

Warren introducing her student loan bill.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren introduced her first bill, a simple proposal to give students the same loan rates as the nation's biggest banks. Her proposal would allow the cut-rate loans for students for one year, to give Congress the time to come to agreement on a long-term solution to interest rates. Federal Stafford subsidized loan rates for new students are set to double on July 1 to 6.8 percent.

Here's a snippet from her floor speech introducing the bill.



“Some people say that we can’t afford to help our kids through school by keeping student loan interest rates low,” said Senator Warren. “But right now, as I speak, the federal government offers far lower interest rates on loans, every single day–they just don’t do it for everyone. Right now, a big bank can get a loan through the Federal Reserve discount window at a rate of about 0.75%. But this summer a student who is trying to get a loan to go to college will pay almost 7%. In other words, the federal government is going to charge students interest rates that are nine times higher than the rates for the biggest banks–the same banks that destroyed millions of jobs and nearly broke this economy. That isn’t right. And that is why I’m introducing legislation today to give students the same deal that we give to the big banks.” “Big banks get a great deal when they borrow money from the Fed,” Senator Warren continued. “In effect, the American taxpayer is investing in those banks. We should make the same kind of investment in our young people who are trying to get an education. Lend them the money and make them to pay it back, but give our kids a break on the interest they pay. Let’s Bank on Students… Unlike the big banks, students don’t have armies of lobbyists and lawyers. They have only their voices. And they call on us to do what is right.”

Sen. Warren is selling herself a little short, there. Students don't just have their voices. They have Elizabeth Warren's voice, too. That's a damned good thing.

There’s always a chance. Because, you know, it’s new. Also, the bar is low, since some people believe the departing 112th Congress was the worst in history, because of its stupendous lack of productivity and a favorability rating that once polled lower than the idea of a Communist takeover of America.

On the very last day the Republican-led House of Representatives was in session, the Republican governor of New Jersey, Chris Christie, announced it was “why the American people hate Congress.” This was after Speaker John Boehner failed to bring up a bill providing aid to the victims of the megastorm Sandy. Disaster relief joined a long list of bills that the 112th Congress could not get its act together to approve, along with reforming the farm subsidies and rescuing the Postal Service. Those particular pieces of legislation were all written and passed by the Senate, a group that’s generally less proactive than a mummy.

Ah, the House. To be fair, it takes a lot of effort to vote to repeal Obamacare 33 times.

Posner has made news again, this time by voicing second thoughts about his 2007 decision to uphold Indiana’s voter ID law.

The ruling was later affirmed by a 6 to 3 vote of the Supreme Court. But Posner says, in a new book, that the Indiana law was of “a type . . . now widely regarded as a means of voter suppression rather than of fraud prevention.” In recent interviews, the judge chalked up his mistake to the plaintiff’s lawyers’ failure to present “strong indications that requiring additional voter identification would actually disenfranchise people entitled to vote.”

Some critics of voter ID laws may revel in Posner’s confession. I wish he’d kept his mouth shut. Not because I’m a fan of voter ID laws — I’m not — but because Posner’s casual mea culpa is improper behavior for a sitting federal judge.

The Code of Conduct for United States Judges discourages members of the bench from opining on the issues of the day. They may “speak, write, lecture, and teach on both law-related and nonlegal subjects,” as long as that doesn’t “detract from the dignity of the judge’s office” or “reflect adversely on the judge’s impartiality,” among other caveats.

Not the clearest line, to be sure — it has proved flexible enough to accommodate Posner’s vast opus, which, over the years, has included dozens of books and articles on subjects ranging from antitrust to sex, as well as a popular blog. HuffPost Live calls Posner “the premier American public intellectual” of our time.

Yet however blurry that line may be, by publicly recanting one of his decisions while still on the bench, Posner has finally crossed it.

His comments amount to intervention in a live political, and legal, issue, cloaked — whether or not he intends it — in the authority of his judicial office. Indeed, his comments carry the authority of someone who previously considered the matter in court and has now switched sides. It’s as if Harry Blackmun, the author of Roe v. Wade, came out against abortion rights while still a justice.

It doesn’t help matters that Posner’s confession of error contained a gratuitious slap at the losing lawyers or that it hinged on a vague notion of how the Indiana law, and others like it, are now “regarded.” As it happens, opinion polls consistently show that voter ID laws are popular among voters of both parties.

When I presented this data to Posner, he replied by e-mail, “That’s not my impression. I believe that all but one of the photo ID identification laws were passed by state legislatures that are Republican controlled.”

He and I could debate this forever. But that’s just the point — judges shouldn’t engage in the hurly-burly of political argument. It fosters the impression, corrosive to the rule of law, that there is no difference between a judicial process and a legislative one.

Posner isn’t overly troubled by such considerations. “I would like to see more realism about judges,” he said. Their rulings are not Olympian pronouncements but the products of factors ranging from black-letter law to personal opinion. He said he sees no reason for judges to be “bashful” about admitting mistakes.

This is a standard theme for Posner. Of course, it poses a contradiction: If it is realistic to be skeptical about judges’ capacity for deciding cases objectively, why should we trust their subsequent claims of error?

Posnerian realism is not quite the insight that he seems to think it is. As a wise philosopher said centuries ago, “Out of the crooked timber of humanity, no straight thing was ever made.” And that includes the rule of law.

I suppose Posner’s constant commentary makes his court more transparent, in the sense that it gives lawyers and potential litigants more information about his thinking. It’s just not the sort of transparency traditionally associated with a legitimate judicial process.

Would federal courts enjoy a better reputation if every judge spouted his views as freely as Posner does? A worse reputation? Before you answer, consider this less-publicized selection from his recent comments: “I don’t really share the widespread concern with surveillance by the NSA,” he told the Huffington Post. “If they want to read my emails, they’re welcome.”

The best judges maximize their impartiality, actual and perceived, even at the cost of self-restraint in their public statements. They do so because the public is entitled to a judicial process that earnestly aspires to fairness and objectivity, however elusive those goals might be. They understand that there is a fine line between realism and cynicism.

They understand that the American people give them $185,000 a year, plus life tenure, power and prestige, to be public servants — not public intellectuals.

The federal minimum wage is %247.25 %28less for some seasonal workers%29

California is set to raise its minimum wage to %2410%2C the highest in the nation

Advocates want a national %2415/hour minimum wage

California's recent decision to raise its minimum wage to $10 an hour by 2016 — a higher minimum rate than any other state has now — may add momentum to the drive for higher hourly rates in at least eight other states in 2014.

New Jersey could become the fifth state this year to increase its state minimum wage if voters approve a measure on Nov. 5 that would boost the hourly rate by $1, to $8.25.

In states as varied as Alaska, Idaho, Massachusetts and South Dakota, advocates are pushing to put minimum wage hikes on state ballots in 2014. Meanwhile, elected officials are leading the charge in Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, and the District of Columbia.

The action at the state level comes as organized labor and liberal groups have backed a wave of strikes by fast-food workers in cities across the country to put a spotlight on hourly wages. Advocates are pressing for a national $15 hourly wage, more than twice the $7.25 federal minimum wage.

States cannot set a minimum wage that is lower than the federal standard, but they are free to establish a higher one. Washington state currently has the highest state minimum wage at $9.19; followed by Oregon ($8.95) and Vermont ($8.60). Connecticut, the District of Columbia and Illinois all have a state minimum of $8.25. In addition, some 120 cities have enacted ""living wages"" that set a minimum standard for businesses that receive city contracts. City minimums range from $9 to $16 an hour.

Under California's plan, the state minimum wage would rise from $8 an hour to $9 an hour on July 1, 2014, and then jump again to $10 an hour on Jan. 1, 2016. Less than 2 percent of California workers who receive an hourly wage make the federal minimum of $7.25 or less (some seasonal employees and other workers are can be paid less than the minimum wage). The state with the highest proportion of minimum wage workers is Idaho, with nearly 8 percent, according to the U.S. Bureau

of Labor Statistics.

Will $10 be model for other states?

California's passage of a $10 minimum wage ""will set the bar for what other states will aim for,"" said Paul Sonn, legal co-director of the National Employment Law Project (NELP), an organization that spearheads a Raise the Minimum Wage campaign.



Momentum at the state level is increasing as efforts to increase the federal hourly wage have gone nowhere. Congress last raised the minimum wage in 2007. Democrats in Congress have called for raising the federal minimum wage to $10.10 per hour by 2015, higher than President Barack Obama's call for a $9 hourly wage, but it's unlikely the GOP-controlled House will approve it.

""Once again, California is leading the effort to rebuild our middle class,"" California Assemblyman Luis Alejo, a Democrat, said after the Assembly approved his bill to increase the minimum wage.

Raising the minimum wage is a politically polarizing issue. President Obama and other proponents of a higher federal minimum wage say that while companies are making record profits, the lowest-paid workers have seen their purchasing power plummet because the federal wage floor hasn't kept pace with inflation. If it had, the hourly rate would be $10.74. They say raising the minimum wage will give the economy a boost by putting more money into the pockets of people who are likely to spend it.

But opponents, including Republican House Speaker John Boehner and many business groups, argue that employers won't be able to afford the higher hourly wage and will have to lay off workers. Most businesses that hire minimum wage workers are not big corporations, they say, but rather independently-owned franchises and small businesses that operate on narrow profit margins.

""Many entrepreneurs in our state are just now starting to see signs of recovery by hiring and expanding their businesses, and this bill will cause many to halt those plans immediately,"" said John Kabateck, executive director of the National Federation of Independent Business/California. The group estimated that raising the state minimum wage to $9.25 would lead to the loss of 68,000 California jobs over a 10-year period.

Popular at ballot box

Minimum wage hikes have been popular with voters: Since 1998, proposed increases have been on statewide ballots 10 times in nine states, and all of them were successful. That's one of the reasons Democrats are expected to keep the issue alive for the 2014 midterm elections, when 36 governorships and legislative seats in 46 statehouses will be contested along with U.S. congressional races.

""From an electoral perspective, Democrats want the minimum wage to hang around for a while,"" said Mike Saltsman, a research director at the Employment Policies Institute, a conservative nonprofit think tank. Saltsman has written op-eds to dispute what his group calls myths about the minimum wage, including that higher wages will reduce poverty and stimulate the economy.

The group also recently ran full-page newspapers ads during the fast food strike, warning that higher wages could prompt more automation. ""Why Robots Could Soon Replace Fast Food Workers Demanding a Higher Minimum Wage,"" the headline in an ad in the Wall Street Journal said. The full-page ad in USA Today showed a touch-screen device replacing a worker.

Saltsman said that protestors' call for a $15 hourly rate is ""a bargaining tactic"" so that a $10 hourly rate will seem reasonable to voters and policymakers. But increasing the rate from $7.25 to $10 is still a 40 percent bump, he said.

While the institute and national employer groups, like the National Restaurant Association, have been outspoken opponents of a minimum wage hike, some businesses, large and small, have come out in support of higher hourly rates, arguing if workers earn more, they can spend more, namely on their products.

Top officials at Costco and Starbucks both have called for a higher minimum wage. Meanwhile, a poll earlier this spring showed nearly 70 percent of small business owners support raising the minimum wage as a way to help the economy.

Northeast Sees Most 2013 Action

Nearly a dozen states this year considered setting a state minimum wage above the federal rate, but besides California, only three did so:

• New York raised its minimum hourly rate to $9 from $7.25. The rate will rise to $8 by the end of 2013, $8.75 by the end of 2014, and $9 by the end of 2015.

• Connecticut's minimum wage will go to $9 an hour from $8.25, starting with a bump to $8.70 Jan. 1, followed by a second increase on Jan. 1, 2015.

• Rhode Island increased its minimum hourly rate to $8 per hour, from $7.75, beginning Jan. 1.

When these laws take effect, 20 states and the District of Columbia will have hourly rates that are higher than the federal minimum.

State lawmakers in New Jersey approved raising the minimum wage to $8.50, but the increase was vetoed by Republican Gov. Chris Christie and then put on this November's ballot for voters to consider. Christie said he supported a higher wage, but opposed including automatic annual adjustments for inflation, known as ""indexing.""

Ten other states already use indexing: Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, Ohio, Oregon, Vermont and Washington. In all of them except Vermont, voters approved the measure with the automatic hike.

Christie's Democratic challenger Barbara Buono has criticized him for vetoing the minimum wage increase. ""For a working parent making $7.25 an hour, life isn't about living. It's about surviving,"" Buono, a state senator from Middlesex County, said as part of her economic plan.

New Jersey is one of two states this November that will elect a governor and state lawmakers (Virginia is the other) and the only one with a statewide minimum wage question.

Thanks so much for the note regarding Labor Day - you have always been timely with these, unlike some of your predecessors.

You and I are going to part ways today. I had a great ""gig"" here in the regional office - I had a great boss, great co-workers, I was still learning a good bit, and the good days were always outweighing the bad days. I was pretty certain (after my first 5 years) that I could outlast any administration the governor could appoint. I had no problem with the Martin administration - he was a man of science and no extremist.

Between your inappropriate mission statement, the dismantling of the Division of Water Quality, and HB74 (along with a few other gems from this session's NCGA), I see no reason to continue here - because my own mission - to assist all citizens and protect those that don't have a voice, would be compromised.

I was a good regulator - I had a bit of distrust for both sides of the aisle - which made me regulate evenly and with common sense and fair judgment. Over the past 24 years I've had the privilege to have worked with some of the most intelligent, articulate, and respected environmental scientists and engineers - I'd put them up against my friends in the private sector any day of the week. But the disdain for them (and me) by this administration is too much to bear.

When you pushed our reasonable, right-leaning WQ Director out, I knew we were in trouble. When you guys (and they are mostly guys...) pushed out a very thoughtful and judicial Environmental Management Commission chair, I knew we were moving into a sand pit that we weren't going to dig out of easily. When you, along with your ""great Tom Reeder"", decided to cleave off the stormwater programs and move it to Land Resources, who have never been trained for such..nor do they much care about WQ, I knew it was time to leave. I'm sure the 401 Water Quality program is next (especially since you said we should be more like TX and SC).

I'm all about customer service (as the majority of employees in DWQ are, and have always been), but that just seems to be a smokescreen for a very extremist republican agenda.

Likely there will be some uptick in the business environment in the next few years (mainly because the economy has started to recover from the disaster your friends on Wall Street created). But when the hot summers and the drought years come back, and we get fish kills again, and maybe there's fracking going on in the sandhills - it will be the fine folks at DENR who will get blamed for the chaos. The politicians and their appointees, that did the dismantling and created the chaos, will be long gone. We know the drill.

For my brothers and sisters in the Division of WATER QUALITY (the so called ""seat warmers"") who don't have the option to be able to move on, due to various obligations and a destroyed economy, let me leave you with a video I pilfered from the internet 'cause I didn't have the tools to make my own.

You can view this while I gather up my toothbrush and grab my loincloth to start heading out the door.

Thanks,

He Has More Than Years Experience As A Pollster', 'Political Consultant. His New Book Is']",America's willful blindness -- Obama is a divider not a unifier,"The much discussed Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, which was released Thursday morning, shows a sharply divided America. Not much new there.

Half of those surveyed think that the across-the-board spending cuts that went into effect on Friday with the sequester will be too severe. And a smaller proportion of Americans say that they are necessary to reduce the deficit. Democrats would, unsurprisingly, prefer a plan that had fewer cuts and a majority of Republicans and independents show support for the cuts even if they do think the sequester is a bad idea (which they do).

To be sure, the impact of the sequester on the American psyche vis-à-vis economic outlook is a valuable addition to the budget battle discussion. But the finding that I see as most crucial in this poll is one that I have heard little about.

[pullquote]

As Neil King Jr. writes, “By a more than 2-to-1 margin, poll participants say Mr. Obama is doing more than the GOP to unify the country in a bipartisan way. The poll found 48% of respondents saw Mr. Obama as trying to unify the country, compared with 22% who said that of Republicans and 37% who said that of the Democratic Party.”

More On This... Despite Washington angst, officials appear resigned to sequester cuts

That the electorate believes the president to be a unifying force for the country, and by no small amount, is completely incongruous with his actions on the campaign trail, through the fiscal cliff dispute, his inauguration speech, his State of the Union speech and now during the sequester negotiations.

Recent comments from President Obama include, “Republican leaders will not collect a ransom in exchange for not crashing the American economy” during a press conference on the debt ceiling in mid-January. And in his inaugural address while discussing climate change, he called Republicans neocons who don’t understand that “enduring peace and lasting security do not require perpetual war.” These are hardly the statements of a man working towards a united America.

Indeed, the president’s relentless engagement in identity politics – on the basis of race, gender, religion, and economic standing – has made him far from the bipartisan, solution-driven president he promised to be.

President Obama told Americans that we “have to break the habit of negotiating through crisis over and over again” and while I agree with the sentiment behind his statement, he has certainly not held up his end of the bargain.

Earlier last week, Speaker Boehner said, “Mr. President, you got your tax increase. It’s time to cut spending here in Washington.” And Speaker Boehner is right – it’s what the country needs and the American people want.

But history told us that there would be no last minute arrival of a compromising, balanced Obama. We are seeing a President Obama who is riding high on the popularity of his social policies and continually eschewing the importance of finding meaningful and substantive compromises with the GOP on the economy. This is not the mark of a unifying force, but a president who is clearly playing a partisan agenda.

What’s more is that the results of this survey continue to show a wildly out of control GOP. Though there were flashes of moderation in the wake of Romney’s loss from key players like Governor Jindal and Senator Rubio, but still only 22 percent of those surveyed think that the Republicans are trying to unify the country.

In light of this, the popularity of New Jersey's Republican Gov. Chris Christie is hardly surprising. A conservative politician in policy choices has been able to become a bipartisan force because he embraced the president when he came to hurricane ravaged New Jersey and because he has agreed to take ObamaCare Medicaid expansion.

It is a very scary reality that the most divisive president in recent history is viewed as a unifier. The American people have been starved of the kind of bipartisan, compromising lawmaking that we need to the point that they believe a man who has done nothing but divide them is working for their best interest above his own agenda.

Nothing could be further from the truth."

The University of Minnesota's Eric Ostermeier tallied up all of the words Palin uttered during her three years on Fox News, and, knowing that she made $3 million over that time, made this conclusion:

A Smart Politics review of the more than 150 FOX broadcasts in which Sarah Palin appeared as a paid commentator from 2010 through 2012 finds that she spoke 189,221 words on air during this span, for an average pay rate of $15.85 per word.

That's what a lot of people would consider a decent sum for an hour's worth of work, let alone a 7-minute hit with Neil Cavuto. But it's definitely a lot less than what people like Bill O'Reilly, who pulls down a purported $20 million a year, take home per word.

Palin's most frequent interviewers were Sean Hannity --perhaps the network's most hard-line Republican host -- and Greta Van Susteren, whose husband was an adviser to the former governor.

WASHINGTON -- Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) announced on Monday another amendment to throw a wrench into the Senate's comprehensive immigration reform bill: tying it to voter ID.

The amendment, which he first announced on Twitter, is unlikely to make it into the eventual bill. Cruz voted three times -- once in the Judiciary Committee and twice on the Senate floor -- against moving the ""gang of eight"" bill forward even for debate, and is considered unwinnable as a ""yes"" vote for the legislation as a whole.

Still, he has attempted to add his own touches to the bill, such as stripping it of its path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. The most recent amendment would touch on the equally contentious issue of whether would-be voters should be required to show identification to prove their citizenship before registering to vote.

I'll file amendment to immigration bill that permits states to require ID before registering voters & close this hole in fed statutory law. — Senator Ted Cruz (@SenTedCruz) June 17, 2013

The Supreme Court ruled earlier Monday that states cannot require people to prove their U.S. citizenship before using a federal voter registration system.

UPDATE: 6:30 p.m. -- Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) announced an amendment later Monday aimed at addressing voter ID issues brought up by the Supreme Court ruling. According to a statement, his ""Secure the Vote"" amendment is meant to ensure immigrants do not vote until they become citizens -- they are already banned from doing so -- by providing ""new procedures to enable states to check that individuals gaining status or a work visa are not illegally registered to vote.""

""Not only would this amendment prevent voter fraud, it would also clear up the problem created by today's Supreme Court decision,"" Paul said in a statement. ""My amendment requires states to check citizenship before registering people to vote in federal elections."""

(CNN) - The feuding between Republicans Chris Christie and Rand Paul continued Tuesday as the senator from Kentucky cautioned the governor from New Jersey was picking a fight with the wrong guy.

In an interview on CNN's ""The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer,"" Paul defended himself against Christie's most recent allegations that the senator was bringing home too much money for his state.



""This is the king of bacon talking about bacon,"" Paul said about Christie. Both are considered potential 2016 contenders for the Republican presidential nomination.

Earlier in the day, the outspoken governor chastised Kentucky for taking more federal money than New Jersey, saying the Blue Grass state gets back $1.51 on every dollar it sends to Washington, while the Garden State receives 61 cents.

""So if Senator Paul wants to start looking at where he's going to cut spending to afford defense, maybe he should start cutting the pork barrel spending that he brings home to Kentucky,"" Christie told reporters Tuesday in Little Ferry.

Paul pointed to Kentucky's two military bases as reasons why the state may get more money from the government.

""What does he want to do, shut down military bases in Kentucky?"" he said.

Fort Campbell and Fort Knox, both Army bases, are located in Kentucky. New Jersey itself is home to a large joint military base that houses the McGuire Air Force base; Naval Air Engineering Station Lakehurst; and Fort Dix, an Army base.

""In order to have enough money for national defense, which I think is a priority for the government, you have to be willing to cut spending in other places,"" Paul continued. ""And Governor Christie and others have been part of this 'gimme gimme gimme','give me all this money.'""

He was referring to Christie's requests for federal relief aid after Superstorm Sandy slammed into the Northeast last fall. Congress ultimately passed more than $50 billion in aid to the states affected by the storm.

But Paul said the aid should have been appropriated ""in a responsible way."" The senator blasted Christie for the same reason on Sunday, saying Christie and others were ""bankrupting"" the government.

Throwing more fuel on the fire, Paul said Tuesday that Christie should be careful about choosing his battles.

""It's not helping the party for him to pick a war with me. It's a big mistake. It's not very smart. And it's not a good way to grow the party,"" Paul said, adding that the Republican Party is ""shrinking"" in the Northeast. ""Why would he want to pick a fight with the one guy who has a chance to grow the party by appealing to the youth and appealing to people who would like to see a more moderate and less aggressive foreign policy?""

Asked if the feud is a preview of a potential fight for the GOP presidential nomination in 2016, Paul responded: ""Who knows?""

Their spat first started on Thursday when Christie bashed libertarian-leaning lawmakers, like Paul, who oppose some of the National Security Agency's surveillance programs.

""These esoteric, intellectual debates – I want them to come to New Jersey and sit across from the widows and orphans and have that conversation,"" Christie said during a Republican governors forum in Colorado, referring to those who lost loved ones on 9/11. ""And they won't. That's a lot tougher conversation to have.""

Paul hit back on Sunday attacking Christie on Superstorm Sandy aid. But Christie further defended his argument on Tuesday.

""If you ask me a question, I give an answer,"" Christie said. ""You know, his response seems that he has something personal against me, but that's okay. He can just get in line on that front.""

Another Republican from the Northeast joined Christie in his criticism over the weekend. Rep. Peter King, R-New York, chided Paul for saying NSA leaker Edward Snowden was performing an act of civil disobedience when he revealed the massive snooping programs.

""This is the anti-war, left-wing Democrats of the 1960s that nominated George McGovern and destroyed their party for almost 20 years. I don't want that happening to our party,"" King told CNN's Candy Crowley on ""State of the Union.""

King also says he's mulling a potential 2016 presidential bid.

But Paul brushed off the line of attack, saying Tuesday more Americans would side with him in the debate.

""I don't think the Bill of Rights is esoteric, I don't think the Fourth Amendment is esoteric and I think the idea that we should have a right to privacy is not esoteric,"" he said on CNN.

President Obama awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor, to 16 recipients Wednesday morning, recognizing the achievements of a diverse group of Americans ranging from Ernie Banks and Benjamin C. Bradlee to Bill Clinton and Oprah Winfrey.

Before bestowing the medals, Obama paid tribute to each recipient, saving his comments on Clinton for last and expressing gratitude for the former president’s advice and counsel, as well as his work to help the victims of natural disasters after he left office.

The ceremony in the East Room of the White House honored “individuals who have made especially meritorious contributions to the security or national interests of the United States, to world peace, or to cultural or other significant public or private endeavors,” the White House said.

Since the medal was established 50 years ago by President John F. Kennedy, “more than 500 exceptional individuals from all corners of society” have received the award, according to the White House.

“I hope we carry away from this a reminder of what JFK understood to be the essence of the American spirit,” Obama said at the end of Wednesday’s ceremony. “Some of us may be less talented, but we all have the opportunity to serve and to open people’s hearts and minds in our smaller orbits. So I hope that everybody’s been inspired as I have been, participating in being with these people here today.”

Winfrey began her career as a broadcast journalist, but she is best known for her 25 years as the host of “The Oprah Winfrey Show.” She received the Bob Hope Humanitarian Award in 2002 and a Kennedy Center Honor in 2010. Jerome Delay/AP Wait 1 second to continue.

This year’s recipients included three Americans who were recognized posthumously: Daniel K. Inouye, a Democratic senator from Hawaii who received the Medal of Honor for his service in World War II; Sally K. Ride, the first American woman astronaut to travel into space; and Bayard Rustin, an openly gay African American civil rights leader who promoted nonviolent protest alongside the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Inouye and Ride died last year; Rustin died in 1987.

Bradlee, 92, the legendary former executive editor of The Washington Post, “oversaw coverage of the Watergate scandal, successfully challenged the federal government over the right to publish the Pentagon Papers, and guided the newspaper through some of its most challenging moments,” the White House said in announcing the awards.

Banks, 82, who played for 19 years with the Chicago Cubs, was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1977, his first year of eligibility. Known as “Mr. Cub,” he was widely recognized for his enthusiasm for baseball; “Let’s play two!” became his typical catchphrase before a game.

Clinton, 67, who served two terms as president, from 1993 to 2001, later “established the Clinton Foundation to improve global health, strengthen economies, promote health and wellness, and protect the environment,” the White House said.

Winfrey, 59, renowned as a broadcast journalist and actress, was recognized for her long involvement in philanthropic causes and efforts to expand opportunities for young women. She has won numerous other honors during her career, including the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award in 2011 and a Kennedy Center Honor in 2010.

Other awardees Wednesday included Daniel Kahneman, a pioneering scholar of psychology; Richard G. Lugar, a former Republican senator from Indiana; Loretta Lynn, a country music star; Mario Molina, a chemist and environmental scientist; Arturo Sandoval, a jazz trumpeter, pianist and composer originally from Cuba; Dean Smith, head coach of the University of North Carolina basketball team from 1961 to 1997; Gloria Steinem, a renowned feminist writer, magazine founder and activist for women’s rights; Cordy Tindell “C.T.” Vivian, a civil rights leader, minister and author; and Patricia Wald, a trailblazing federal judge who later served on the International Criminal Tribunal in The Hague.

In honoring Kahneman, who applied cognitive psychology to economic analysis and won a Nobel Prize in economics in 2002, Obama drew laughter when he said: “Now, all of us have moments when we look back and wonder, what the heck was I thinking? I have that -- quite a bit.” He said Kahneman “basically invented the study of human decision-making,” adding: “He has also been called an expert on irrational behavior, so I’m sure that he could shed some light on Washington.”

Obama noted that Bradlee served in the Navy during World War II and fought in more than a dozen Pacific battles.

“Since joining The Washington Post 65 years ago, he transformed that newspaper into one of the finest in the world,” Obama said. “And with Ben in charge, The Post published the Pentagon Papers, revealing the true history of America’s involvement in Vietnam, exposed Watergate, unleashed a new era of investigative journalism, holding America’s leaders accountable and reminding us that our freedom as a nation rests on our freedom of the press.”

Referring to Bradlee’s trademark banker shirts, Obama remarked: “And I also indicated to Ben, he can pull off those shirts, and I can’t. He always looks so cool in them.”

Honoring Winfrey, the president noted that early in her career, “her bosses told her she should change her name to Susie.” He went on: “I have to pause here to say, I got the same advice. Oh, they didn’t say I should be named Susie, but they suggested I should change my name.”

Obama said the talk-show icon was “living proof” of her own can-do spirit, having risen “from a childhood of poverty and abuse to the pinnacle of the entertainment universe.”

Of Clinton, Obama said: “As president, he proved that with the right choices, you could grow the economy, lift people out of poverty, we could shrink our deficits and still invest in our families, our health, our schools, in science, technology. In other words, we can go further when we look out for each other.”

Since leaving office, Obama said, Clinton has “helped lead relief efforts after the Asian tsunami, Hurricane Katrina, the Haiti earthquake. His foundation and global initiative have helped to save or improve the lives of literally hundreds of millions of people.”

Referring to Clinton’s wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, who headed the State Department during his first term, Obama added: “And, of course, I am most grateful for his patience during the endless travels of my secretary of state.”"

For the month of December, two-thirds of the Fox News primetime lineup came in second to MSNBC (in the critical 25-54 year old demographic). The Rachel Maddow Show's monthly average came in 4% above the formidable Fox fixture, Sean Hannity. Lawrence O'Donnell had an even better advantage of 11% over his weaker competition, Greta Van Susteren.

This was a stark difference from last year when Hannity comfortably led Maddow by 46% and Van Susteren outpaced O'Donnell by the same amount. Those leads have now completely evaporated. Only Bill O'Reilly has managed to keep his fat head above water, although his 69% December 2011 lead over Ed Schultz was cut nearly in half in 2012 to 40%.

December 2012 was an affirmation of the superior performance MSNBC has shown since the election in November. Maddow and O'Donnell have consistently defeated Hannity and Van Susteren since President Obama did the same thing to Mitt Romney. This can no longer be explained away by Fox defenders as mere depression on the part of conservative viewers who tuned out after an electoral spanking. That excuse may have made sense for a week or two, but not a full two months later with high profile news events like the ""fiscal cliff,"" new cabinet appointments, Benghazi hearings, the Petraeus scandal, and the Newtown school shooting dominating news coverage.

Happy New Year:

Fox may have to get used to coming in second, or maybe even third if CNN's new president, Jeff Zucker, is able to get that network out of idle. And if MSNBC is smart they will start to firm up their schedule with new shows and dynamic personalities. For instance, they should quickly axe the Hardball rerun at 7:00pm, perhaps moving Schultz to that time slot. Then put in his place a leadin to Maddow that takes advantage of the smart brand of analysis and commentary that she and O'Donnell represent. That would tie up their primetime package and boost the network's reputation generally, which would help draw viewers to other dayparts.

Unsolicited programming advice for MSNBC:

Poach comedian/pundit John Fugelsang from Current TV and pair him up with MSNBC contributor Joy-Ann Reid for a combo news and entertainment hybrid to launch the evening block. A news program that intelligently presents serious issues with a sense of humor could be a compelling option that would ease their audience into a deeper dialog as the night progresses."

There’s no deadline. We want to get this done, and we want to get this done right,” another House leadership aide said.

You've got to love these two paragraphs from Chris Frates' National Journal piece on how Republican leadership is spinning their decision against moving forward with immigration reform:Actually, it's more like John Boehner decided against letting immigration reform come up for a vote because he was afraid doing so would cost him his job. The issue wasn't that it wouldn't pass the House—it's that it would pass, but mainly with Democratic votes. A majority of Republicans would have voted against it, and then next thing they would have done would have been to remove John Boehner from the speaker's office—probably even before President Obama signed the legislation into law.

That's why Boehner hasn't let immigration reform move forward. And that's why the real drama isn't whether the House can pass immigration reform, it's whether John Boehner will ever allow it to pass immigration reform—and, if he does, whether he'll figure out a way to save his job. I wouldn't be surprised if Boehner privately wants to see the Senate bill pass, but his private aspirations don't mean a thing if he can't deliver results.

Perhaps the jam-packed legislative calendar this fall will actually put enough balls in the air to create an opening for immigration reform, in which case Boehner will have pulled off the feat of both getting immigration reform done and keeping his job. But that's a pretty big if, and so far he hasn't been willing to take a personal risk in order to accomplish immigration reform.

One last thing worth noting: If Boehner fails, it won't be entirely accurate to say Republicans refused to address immigration reform, because they have. Earlier this year, they voted nearly unanimously in favor of Steve King's proposal to require President Obama to deport DREAM Act children. And that means that if Republicans don't change course this fall, Steve King really will be the face of Republican immigration policy, not just in tone, but also in substance."

The (Westchester County, N.Y.) Journal News

Army sergeant charged earlier this week with secretly photographing women at the academy

Commencement address is Hagel%27s first as defense secretary

Hagel served in Vietnam with the Army

WEST POINT, N.Y. -- Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel told the 215th graduating class of the U.S. Military Academy that they are taking on a new responsibility to uphold the military values of accountability and leadership — and warned them of the need to stop the ""scourge"" of sexual assault in the military.

""You made a courageous decision to offer yourself for a very purposeful life,"" Hagel said, as a steady rain fell over a sea of cadets in gray uniforms.

Hagel used his brief remarks to pointedly condemn the widespread sexual misconduct that has plagued the military and West Point in recent months, a day after President Barack Obama delivered a similar edict to U.S. Naval Academy graduates.

""Sexual harassment and sexual assault in the military are a profound betrayal -- a profound betrayal -- of sacred oaths and sacred trust,"" Hagel said. ""This scourge must be stamped out. We are all accountable in ensuring this happens.""

""You must be the generation of leaders that stop it,"" he added.

The message comes amid a new report showing that as many as 26,000 military service members may have been sexually assaulted last year and that thousands of victims are unwilling to come forward despite new oversight and assistance programs. The estimate was based largely on anonymous surveys.

The challenge is particularly poignant for the West Point crowd, because earlier in the week an Army sergeant was charged with secretly photographing and videotaping at least a dozen women at the academy, including in a bathroom.

Sgt. 1st Class Michael McClendon is facing charges of dereliction of duty, mistreatment, entering a women's bathroom without notice, and taking and possessing inappropriate photos and videos of at least a dozen women who were naked or in various states of undress.

Hagel, who gave his first commencement address as secretary of defense, said the graduates join the armed forces at a time of ""historic transformation"" for the military and for the world.

""The Army you enter today is emerging … and in many ways it's recovering from more than a decade of war in Iraq and Afghanistan.""

""A new Army is being shaped and … you will have the responsibility of helping shape it,"" he said.

The graduating class of 2013 will enter an armed forces constrained by budget cuts and fewer soldiers, and in an environment plagued by alcohol and drug abuse and suicide in addition to sexual misconduct.

An Army veteran who served in Vietnam and a former senator from Nebraska, Hagel also reflected on lessons he learned during his time in the military.

Tactics, techniques and training have changed in the decades since he served the Army, but the basic principles of character and courage remain the same, he said.

The wet weather and the solemn tone of the commencement address didn't lessen the sense of joy for the cadets' families, who cheered as their sons and daughters received diplomas in Michie Stadium.

Vincent Franchino, 21, of Stony Point, N.Y., was quickly surrounded by a dozen relatives – including his 87-year-old grandmother -- after the traditional hat toss marked the ceremony's end.

""It's a roller-coaster ride of emotions,"" he said, reflecting on his four years at West Point.

Fatigue, anxiety and pride commingled on this cold and rainy day of celebration, Franchino said. But most of all, he felt excited to embark on his next steps: Traveling the world and then heading to Fort Rucker, Ala., where he will take up a post at the U.S. Army Aviation Center of Excellence.

He acknowledged the cloud that the video tape scandal cast over an otherwise cheerful day.

""Personally, it sucks that we have to go through this and that this is in our ranks,"" he said.

Yet ""it makes me more aware of what I have to do"" as a second lieutenant in the Army, he said.

""I always knew that I wanted to return something to the nation from what I've been given. I've always wanted to give back, and this is the best way I think I can give back.""

(CNN) —

One hundred and sixty-five years ago, in Coloma, California, a carpenter named James W. Marshall built a sawmill to harness the power of the American River. Below the waterwheel, he saw flakes of metal where the spent water flowed. Marshall marked the moment saying, “I have found it.” He had discovered gold in California and more: For the next century, our nation would mine its future in the Golden State.

By the 1950s, California had manufactured an optimistic nation’s dreams, brought them to life in the steel and smoke of industry and then captured them on celluloid. Business bloomed in deserts, nourishing one of the world’s great economies. A green Eden of farmland, the Central Valley where the sun shone 300 days a year, grew one third of America’s produce. Innovation followed discovery: Silicon, it turned out, was even more valuable than gold.

California’s public sector also boomed. The state built a web of roads, bridges and aqueducts that shamed their Roman inventors. It funded world-class universities to prepare beach boys and California girls for lives of endless promise.

CNN Alex Castellanos

To see where the rest of the country would be in 20 years, we could look at California. But the roads to success and failure are often almost the same.

As the state gorged on its success, California’s transportation arteries grew clogged. The public sector’s blood began to thicken.

Californians moved faster, their problems grew more complex and their demands on government accelerated. The state’s aging public sector could not respond with matching dynamism and flexibility.

Even as the state poured more money into education, transportation and public safety, it delivered less value in them. Government grew larger and more expensive, with less and less to show for it. Finally, when the housing bubble collapsed, state revenue did too. California’s river of gold dried up. The waterwheel would not turn.

Today, California owes hundreds of billions: $300 billion alone in pension obligations. Even after Gov. Jerry Brown’s effort to pay down $28 billion of immediate debt, California’s liabilities for retiree pensions and health care exceed what it spends for all state programs combined.

California’s future looks anything but golden. Taxpayers who don’t want to be left footing the bills are in exodus. The state’s politics is as paralyzing as Washington’s. To see our nation’s bright future in 20 years, can we still look at California?

Maybe so. Sometimes, the first green shoots emerge in the forest where everything burned.

Gavin Newsom is difficult to classify. Tall, slim and rakishly elegant, he could be the American reincarnation of British actor David Niven. A contradictory combination of left and right, he is a liberal hero for legalizing gay marriage in his city and a liberal villain for reforming its overly generous welfare cash payment program.

The 45-year-old Newsom, a Democrat who is now California’s lieutenant governor, is more than a government theorist, however. He owns 17 small businesses with about 1,000 employees. His confederation includes three wineries that make luscious, fruit-forward elixirs. In business, he is a swashbuckling entrepreneur whose motto is “anyone who is not failing isn’t trying hard enough.” What is most revolutionary about Newsom is that in government, he’s an entrepreneur as well.

When Newsom became mayor of San Francisco, he found a city with little money to meet social needs and behind Estonia and South Korea in digital governance. His push to modernize San Francisco without expanding its dysfunctional public sector is the launching point of his new book, “Citizenville.” It is a fertile garden of original thinking.

The lieutenant governor argues that government’s biggest problem is not that it is misguided but that it is archaic. Newsom cites open-source software pioneer Tim O’Reilly’s analogy for government. “We think of government as a vending machine: You put money in, services come out.” When something goes wrong, Newsom points out, we shake the vending machine out of frustration. If we feed it more money, it is to little effect: Vending machines are not particularly innovative or adaptive.

Our government is still built on that model, Newsom reports, the outdated, industrial-age paradigm of the factory, though everything else in our personal lives and our private sector has moved past it. Simultaneously, an explosion of technology, social media and e-commerce has created a more informed and empowered citizenry.

A “citizenville,” Newsom writes, now has the power and connectivity to solve problems in new ways, e.g., determining where tax dollars are spent, how crime is fought and where garbage trucks go. Speaking through their laptops and iPhones, people are increasingly able to organize themselves and solve social problems, independent of the old, creaky, public-sector industrial plant.

“Technology changes the very nature of government – from a top-down entity to a bottom-up one. From one-way hierarchy to two-way democracy. From vending machine to the cloud,” he explains.

If we open the doors of government to the private sector and make data accessible, we can jump-start a new era of social innovation. Open up the doors of government satellite data and you get Google Earth. Give Web designers in Chicago and Oakland access to public police data, and they create innovative crime-mapping tools that prevent muggings. Invent a digital “currency” to reward citizens for participating in their own governance, and small town decision-making becomes as interesting and involving as Farmville. “The future is sharing – open data, open participation, open source, open everything,” Newsom writes. “And it must happen at every level.”

Our old, marbled shrines to bureaucracy have grown unserviceable and unaffordable. Can we continue to justify them when mayors are using Twitter to address constituent needs instead?

The lesson: The public sector no longer has a monopoly on government. We are in a new world of revolutionary and empowering technologies. Americans aren’t waiting for Washington or Sacramento to reinvent government for the next century; they are creating an app for that. With it, they are creating a new path for democratic vitality. Now, people-to-people government is an alternative to one that flowed only to people from the state.

With new tools and technologies, Newsom contends, it is time to redefine “government” to seize the opportunities of a new day. Would we still rather be governed the old way, top down, politically and artificially by plant managers? Or bottom-up, authentically, naturally and organically, through our own decision making and handiwork?

Perhaps this has been the promise of the American experiment in self-government all along, and we have only been waiting for the powerful and democratizing technology of the communications age to seize it.

Once more, when we need it most, maybe California has discovered gold again.

(Pool/Getty Images)

Throughout his time in office, President Obama has opened many outside-the-Beltway speeches with a suggestion that he, too, feels like an outsider in the nation’s baffling, frustrating capital city. He shouts to the audience about how good it is to be wherever he is that day — Cleveland, Miami, San Francisco. Then he takes pokes at the town where great success in his chosen profession has brought him.

“It is good to be out of Washington,” he often says — a line that, in good times and in bad, always generates warm, sympathetic applause.

Changing Washington may not have come off as Obama promised. But for the president and his supporters, the city has been an object of contempt they can believe in.

Now, though, Obama has raised the possibility that he might remain a resident of the capital after his lease on 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. expires in January 2017.

In an interview this week with Barbara Walters of ABC News, Obama and the first lady, Michelle, said they may live in Washington beyond their time in the White House to allow their younger daughter, Sasha, to graduate from Sidwell Friends School.

Sasha would be a high school sophomore at the end of the president’s second term, giving the family a couple years to enjoy, or endure, Washington as private citizens.

“We gotta make sure that she’s doing well . . . until she goes off to college,” Obama told Walters, according to an advance transcript of the interview, which aired Friday night. “Sasha will have a big say in where we are.”

For a couple who celebrate the city of Chicago as often as they skewer Washington’s nasty political culture, the suggestion that they may stick around past the constitutionally mandated time is surprising. And it highlights the reality that despite the cloistered and well-supported lifestyle of the American presidency, the Obamas are in some ways working parents who face a set of decisions not unfamiliar to others their age.

Obama would be the first former president to remain in Washington post-presidency since the dying Woodrow Wilson more than nine decades ago. A former president is an easy political target, and to stay in Washington is to be a close-range one as well. The journey from leader of the free world to the person most to blame for the early problems of a new administration is as short as a walk across Lafayette Square.

Most find it best to be far from the scene of the alleged crimes when the accusations start flying. George W. Bush, who moved back to Texas and began painting, was relatively well-served by that distance when Obama pointed often to his predecessor as the cause of the economic and fiscal problems his administration faced early on.

Sticking around is “a terrible idea and I can’t imagine it will last very long,” said Stephen Hess, a presidential scholar at the Brookings Institution. “Once you’re in Washington you are somehow connected to every problem that your predecessor is going to be confronting. And you will be asked to say something each time your name comes up, given that you will have reporters camping out on your doorstep.”

This, in part, is the reason many former presidents don’t flee just Washington, but public life entirely.

Ronald Reagan and Lyndon B. Johnson vanished onto beloved ranches in California and Texas, the former to enjoy his last years in a pretty valley north of Santa Barbara and the latter to lament what might have been if not for Vietnam.

Both men were getting on in years by the time they left office. Younger occupants such as Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton remained active on the world stage after their presidencies rather than in the tiny arena that is official Washington.

As for the Obamas, “they are still trying to figure it out,” said Josh Earnest, the White House principal deputy press secretary. “It is certainly something they have been thinking about, and that is evident in the answer they gave.”

Earnest said the decision will likely be made late in the president’s term and pivot largely on Sasha, who is 12 and in seventh grade. Malia, 15, a high school sophomore, will have left for college by then.

“I think it is school and Sasha being able to keep her social group as much as possible — that is what is most important to them,” Earnest said.

The Obamas have kept their home in Chicago’s Hyde Park neighborhood, staying there on some visits home. Their departure was always meant to be temporary. As Valerie Jarrett, a close family friend and senior adviser to Obama, said as the family decamped for Washington, “It is really not goodbye. Rather, Chicago will say, ‘See you soon.’ ”

Michelle Obama, if not her husband, has raised the prospect of picking up post-White House life somewhere other than the city where she grew up. Last year, she said on two occasions that the family may not return to Chicago, as much as she loves the city.

“While I like going back to Chicago — I like to see the lake — this is home now because this is where we’ve built our lives,” Michelle Obama told USA Today in May 2012. “And when it’s time to leave, we’ll build it somewhere else.”

The Obamas’ frequent knocks of Washington have focused on the politics — the K Street money and the 24-hour punditry, the partisanship on Capitol Hill and the culture of point-scoring, which the president and his predecessors have said comes at the expense of the country.

Obama’s message about the city: Hate the players, not the playground. But how much Obama and his family like Washington as a place is a bit of a mystery .

At the start of Obama’s presidency, the first couple dined out with some frequency, not only on special occasions such as anniversaries but also for regular date nights. The Obamas seemed to embrace the city as much as the city embraced the new administration in the afterglow of a historic election.

Those nights out have become less common, and off-hours Obama now leaves the White House most regularly for the fairway-to-green seclusion of 18 holes at Andrews Air Force Base.

So what would private life in Washington look like for an ex-president?

That is hard to say, given that the most recent precedent is Wilson, who remained in town after his presidency ended in 1921 largely because he was suffering the debilitating aftereffects of a stroke.

One unknown is what Obama, who will be 55 when he leaves office, will want to do after his presidency.

There are law schools where he could pick up his teaching career — a vocation he says has informed his presidency — and any private home the couple may choose would certainly have a place for him to hide away and write the inevitable memoir of his presidency, even if his presidential records and library would be somewhere else.

That work could take the couple through Sasha’s graduation — and then, perhaps, far from a city traditionally full of transients who find it hard to love it.

“It’s just not a very congenial place to hang out,” Hess said."

A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit unanimously declared unconstitutional a 2002 law that required the State Department to record Israel as the birthplace of Jerusalem-born citizens despite a long-standing position in the executive branch of strict neutrality toward sovereignty of the disputed city.

At stake in the case was a question of governmental authority over foreign policy: Does the president have the sole right to decide on what terms foreign nations are recognized?

Though the United States has recognized the sovereignty of Israel since it declared independence in 1948, no president has ever taken a position on Jerusalem. Israel considers the city its political and spiritual capital, while Palestinians seek to make East Jerusalem the capital of a future country.

The case was brought by the family of Menachem Binyamin Zivotofsky, now 10, born to American parents in Jerusalem. When his mother applied for a passport for him with the birthplace as “Jerusalem, Israel,” the U.S. Consulate listed only “Jerusalem.”

Zivotofsky was born weeks after Congress passed the passport provision in September 2002 as part of a foreign relations appropriations bill.

But when President George W. Bush signed the law, he issued an executive statement asserting that the policy on Jerusalem, if construed as mandatory rather than advisory, would “impermissibly interfere” with the president’s constitutional authority in matters of foreign affairs.

The secretary of State has never enforced the policy, arguing that it intrudes upon presidential powers.

The Court of Appeals agreed in its ruling, stating that the law was a political act that infringed upon the president’s exclusive recognition power in the Constitution.

The law “is not, as Zivotofsky asserts, legislation that simply — and neutrally — regulates the form and content of a passport,” Circuit Judge Karen Henderson wrote in her opinion. “Congress plainly intended to force the State Department to deviate from its decades-long position of neutrality” toward Jerusalem.

Several groups swiftly decried the decision.

The Anti-Defamation League, which combats anti-Semitism, wrote in a statement that it was “deeply disappointed” by the news.

“The court has effectively given a stamp of approval to the offensive State Department policy that singles out Israel for ‘special’ treatment,” it wrote.

In a statement, the Orthodox Union, an umbrella group of Orthodox Jewish congregations, called Jerusalem “the eternal and indivisible capital of the State of Israel” and said it would support an appeal of the ruling to the Supreme Court.

Congress has long demanded recognition of Israel’s sovereign control over Jerusalem. In 1995, it passed a law requiring that the United States move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, an act that has since been suspended on a semiannual basis by the president for national security reasons.

The Zivotofsky case has already visited the Supreme Court once, to determine whether it was a “nonjusticiable political question” rather than a legal one. In 2012, the high court held that the case could be tried.

(CNN) —

The U.S. Justice Department will not seek the death penalty for U.S. intelligence leaker Edward Snowden, Attorney General Eric Holder wrote to Russian authorities in a letter dated July 23.

In the letter, Holder says Snowden’s arguments for temporary asylum in Russia are without merit.

Snowden is seeking asylum because he claims he will be tortured and face the death penalty if returned to the United States.

But the death penalty is not an option given the current charges against Snowden, and even if additional charges are filed, the United States would still not seek capital punishment, Holder wrote.

Once back in the United States, Snowden would not be tortured and would face a civilian trial with a lawyer appointed to him, the attorney general wrote.

“We believe that these assurances eliminate these asserted grounds for Mr. Snowden’s claim that he should be treated as a refugee or granted asylum,” Holder wrote.

Snowden did not access ‘crown jewels’ of NSA intel, official says

He also said it is untrue that Snowden cannot travel because his U.S. passport was revoked. Snowden is still a U.S. citizen and is eligible for a limited-validity passport that would authorize a direct return to the United States.

“The United States is willing to immediately issue such a passport to Mr. Snowden,” Holder wrote.

Father asks Obama to rein in Holder

In a letter released Friday, Snowden’s father called on President Barack Obama to order Holder to dismiss the criminal complaint filed against his son.

Lon Snowden defended his son’s actions, comparing them to acts of civil disobedience.

“We are also appalled at your administration’s scorn for due process, the rule of law, fairness and the presumption of innocence as regards Edward,” the letter said.

Earlier in the day, Lon Snowden said on NBC’s “Today” that Snowden did the right thing by leaking U.S. intelligence and helping Americans see the truth.

“I think my son, when he takes his final breath, whether it’s today or 100 years from now, (will) be comfortable with what he did,” he said. “He did what he knew was right. He shared the truth with the American people. What we choose to do with it is up to us as a people.”

Lon Snowden expressed his disappointment with the recent House vote that continued funding for the spy program that Edward Snowden exposed.

There is a need for a strong intelligence community, Lon Snowden said, but many who voted for continued funding for the program are really looking out for the special interests that will benefit.

“It’s all about the money,” he said.

The father said he has not been in direct contact with his son, but there has been indirect contact through intermediaries.

The intermediaries do not include WikiLeaks, Lon Snowden said, but he added that he is thankful to that group for aiding his son.

“I’m thankful for anybody at this point that is providing him with assistance to keep him safe and secure,” he said.

U.S., Russian officials continue talks

Meanwhile, the Kremlin said that the Russian security agency FSB is talking to American officials.

“The situation around Snowden is not being discussed at the top level. There’s a discussion between heads of FSB and FBI,” the Kremlin press office said.

A spokesman for Vladimir Putin said the Russian president “expressed a firm intention to not allow” further damage to U.S. interests, including a pledge by Snowden not to release any more intelligence. “And I have no doubt this is how it will be, no matter how the situation develops,” the spokesman said, according to the Russian news agency RIA Novosti.

The many mysteries of Snowden’s transit zone

Snowden isn’t yet allowed to step outside the Moscow airport where he’s been confined for weeks. He is waiting for permission to stay elsewhere in Russia while his request for temporary asylum is considered.

He has been searching for a place to settle after the United States charged him with espionage.

The former National Security Agency contractor, who admitted last month to revealing sweeping U.S. electronic surveillance programs to the news media, left Hong Kong for Moscow on June 23.

Snowden may remain stuck in the transit area for weeks and maybe months, the head of Russia’s migration service, Vladimir Volokh, told the Russian news agency Interfax. The maximum length of time Snowden can spend at the airport is six months, he said.

The bill approved largely along party lines would prohibit abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy, with limited exceptions to save the life of the mother or in cases of rape or incest, so long as they have been reported to law enforcement.

The final vote was 228 to 196. Six Republicans voted against the measure, while as many Democrats voted for it.

The 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision allowed abortions until a fetus is viable outside the womb, generally considered to be at 24 weeks. The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals last month struck down an Arizona law that also would have banned abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Other states with Republican-led legislatures have also pushed new abortion restrictions.

House Democrats protested the measure as unconstitutional and a new assault by the GOP on women’s reproductive rights in what they call a “war on women.”

The Democratic-controlled Senate is unlikely to take up the measure. The White House said advisors would recommend President Obama veto the bill if it were to pass, calling the legislation “a direct challenge to Roe vs. Wade” that “shows contempt for women’s health and rights, the role doctors play in their patients’ healthcare decisions, and the Constitution.”

Republican leaders, though, said it was needed legislation after a Philadelphia abortion doctor was convicted on three counts of first-degree murder for killing babies after they were delivered.

“After this Kermit Gosnell trial and some of the horrific acts that were going on, [the] vast majority of the American people believe in the substance of this bill, and so do I,” House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) told reporters Tuesday.

Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) said the Gosnell case was a “red herring.” “What Dr. Gosnell did was murder, plain and simple,” he said. “And as horrible as everything Dr. Gosnell did was, it was murder, it was illegal, and it has nothing to do with what we’re discussing.”

The bill was amended last week to make an exception for pregnancy caused by rape or incest, after a hearing in which its sponsor, Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.), sparked an uproar when he argued against such a provision, saying that “the incidence of rape resulting in pregnancy are very low.”

Democrats tied the statement to one from Missouri Senate candidate Todd Akin last year about what he called “legitimate rape,” which hurt the party’s image in a key swing constituency: moderate women.

“I just find it astonishing to hear a phrase repeated that the incidence of pregnancy from rape is low,” said Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-San Jose). “The idea that the Republican men on this committee think they can tell the women of America that they have to carry to term the product of a rape is outrageous.”

Democrats also said the exceptions added by Republicans still fell short, because they apply only when the rape or incest has been reported, and women often are reluctant to report the crimes.

“I thought we had established this last fall with the election. Americans are tired of Congress taking up extreme and divisive legislation targeted at women’s health,” Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.) said at a news conference before the vote. “Many of our Republican colleagues don’t seem to have gotten that message.”

A recent Gallup poll found that Americans’ views on abortion had changed little after the Gosnell trial, with 78% saying it should be legal under certain circumstances, compared with 20% who said it should be illegal in all circumstances.

Republican leaders sought better public faces for the legislation Tuesday after Franks’ comments. Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.) led an initial floor debate on a procedural motion tied to the bill. Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) took the lead for the party in the final floor debate, during which eight of the 11 Republican speakers were women. There are 19 Republican women in the House, none of whom serve on the Judiciary Committee that first considered the bill.

We Respond.,"Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker made himself a household name when in 2011 he worked with his legislative allies to strip collective bargaining rights from public workers. At the time he said this would help the state create jobs, but later told his donors it was part of a “divide and conquer” strategy to destroy his opposition.

Over the next two and a half years, Gov. Walker worked around the clock to make life harder for Wisconsin workers: killing the state earned income tax credit, using relief for foreclosure fraud victims to plug holes in his budget, cutting the state’s BadgerCare health insurance program, shifting funds from public to private education, banning cities and towns from making their own sick days ordinances, and attempting to end same-day voter registration and enact strict voter ID laws.

He is now making a name for himself by passing the back for his state’s job crisis, arresting people for singing, and for wanting really badly to be president.

So when Gov. Scott Walker, who has worked around the clock to destroy the labor movement in Wisconsin, tweeted “Happy Labor Day!” yesterday, the responses came fast and uniformly furious.

At Working America, we hypothesized that maybe Gov. Walker was confused about what Labor Day was. Labor Day celebrates all that has been accomplished by workers who have banded together for a better life; accomplishments like fair wages, sick days, health care, voting rights, and corporate accountability. Accomplishments that Gov. Walker has made a career of rolling back.

We decided to respond to Gov. Walker’s Labor Day tweet by borrowing a phrase from The Princess Bride’s Inigo Montoya. Retweet if you agree.

USA TODAY

Members of Congress and watchdog groups have pressed justices to allow cameras

Lawmakers also want justices to adopt code of ethics

Chief Justice Roberts says court is most transparent branch of government

WASHINGTON — A year-long string of controversial cases the general public couldn't see at all, or hear until later, has increased pressure on the Supreme Court to consider lifting the veil on its proceedings.

Since the end of the court's blockbuster term in late June, members of Congress and watchdog groups have urged the justices to allow cameras into the courtroom for the first time, broadcast live audio of their proceedings and adopt a binding code of ethics.

Many of the demands come from Democrats and liberal interest groups concerned about the court's conservative tilt. Though they are not likely to prompt Chief Justice John Roberts and his colleagues to make immediate changes, they could eventually help loosen up an institution that guards its privacy and autonomy.

""There have been baby steps taken to make the court more transparent, but it is still in many respects the least transparent branch of the three branches of government,"" says Doug Kendall, president of the Constitutional Accountability Center.

Same-day audio from court arguments has been released in a few cases, beginning with Bush v. Gore in 2000. Same-day written transcripts have been made available to the public since 2006.

Roberts, who became chief justice in 2005, has argued that the judiciary is the most transparent branch of government. ""Everything we do that has an impact is done in public,"" he said in 2011. ""Our decisions are out there.""

When the court held oral arguments during its recent term on same-sex marriage, voting rights and affirmative action, only a few hundred people were able to watch. Many were lawyers, journalists, guests of the court and those who could afford to pay others to hold their place in line.

For the historic gay marriage cases, the court broke with its normal policy and released audio transcripts later in the day. That was the first time in a year that members of the public didn't have to wait until week's end to hear the justices in action. Before 2010, except in rare cases, they had to wait until the end of the term.

When it came time to issue decisions on the term's major cases, Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., urged that live audio be distributed, to no avail. Days later, he and Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, introduced legislation calling once again for cameras in the court.

The high court's approval rating in a recent USA TODAY poll hit 43%, an eight-year low.

Ultimately, it won't be poll ratings, public pressure or congressional action that moves the nation's highest court, but the preferences of its nine justices.

""How do you second-guess a court that's supreme?"" says Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch, a conservative group that investigates and prosecutes government corruption.

CAMERAS PRESENT CHALLENGES

Over the past quarter-century, the court has moved in fits and starts toward more openness.

Two pilot programs have inserted cameras into some lower federal courts. The latest three-year pilot, set to conclude next year in 14 district courts, from Florida to Washington and from Massachusetts to Guam, got off to a slow start and has been beset by the refusal of many lawyers and clients to have their civil cases filmed.

Nevertheless, no mishaps have been reported when the parties do agree, and the introduction of court-operated cameras has gone smoothly, says Kansas District Court Judge Julie Robinson, who heads a committee of the Judicial Conference of the United States that will examine the results.

""What I'm hearing is that people almost forget the cameras are there. We don't really think about them,"" Robinson says. ""We have now become an institution that makes our records transparent. Why not make our proceedings at the trial level transparent?""

The appellate level should be even simpler, advocates argue. Already, the appellate courts in the 2nd and 9th Circuits — covering 12 states from Vermont to Hawaii, including California and New York — permit cameras. At the Supreme Court, oral arguments are a simple, hour-long give-and-take between lawyers and justices.

That hasn't stopped the justices from remaining opposed to cameras — even those, such as Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, who voiced support for the idea originally.

Cameras ""present all sorts of challenges,"" Roberts said in 2011. He mentioned the potential impact on lawyers and judges — who, he said, ""fall into grandstanding with a couple of hundred people in the courtroom.""

Justice Anthony Kennedy said in New York last month, ""My colleagues and I are not immune from the instinct to grab a headline, and I don't want to think that my colleague asked a question for the benefit of the press. I don't want to introduce that insidious dynamic between myself and my colleagues.""

In an interview with USA TODAY, liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said cameras could give Americans the misimpression that everything depends on the oral arguments, rather than the reams of legal briefs, lower court rulings and historic precedents the justices read and research.

""The notion that it's a contest between two advocates, and the better one is going to win, is totally, totally false,"" she said.

The cable network C-SPAN has fought for decades without success to get its cameras into the Supreme Court. At a Senate hearing in 2005, its founder, Brian Lamb, said, ""The judiciary has become the invisible branch of our national government as far as television news coverage is concerned, and increasingly, as far as the public is concerned.""

Bruce Collins, the network's general counsel, says the justices limit the amount of public access they will allow. ""The founding fathers put limits on all the rights, including the right of free speech,"" he says. ""The Constitution is satisfied when you have seats in the courtroom for the general public.""

But those seats are hard to come by. The court fits about 400 people, but many of the seats are reserved for members of the Supreme Court bar, friends and family, journalists and others. For the most popular cases, members of the public must wait in long lines for hours or even days. Most of those who do get in can stay only a few minutes before making room for others.

Even the court's marble plaza remains off limits to demonstrators, who must stay on the sidewalk. When a district judge ruled in June that the court's ban on protests there was unconstitutional, the court quickly issued a regulation to replace it.

'WE DO FOLLOW THE RULES'

The debates and decisions of the court aren't all that interest lawmakers and watchdog groups. They also want increased access to the justices' financial disclosure statements and a more intensive focus on ethical behavior.

Fueling those demands are some questionable actions by justices, ranging from speeches at fundraising events to refusals to recuse themselves from cases. Liberal groups cite appearances at quasi-political events by Justices Antonin Scalia and Samuel Alito as examples. Conservatives mounted an unsuccessful effort to get Kagan to recuse herself from last year's case on President Obama's health care law, citing her prior work as U.S. solicitor general; liberals sought to pressure Justice Clarence Thomas off the case because of his wife's political activities.

The justices' actions in those and other cases do not require justification. That's because the justices, unlike lower court judges, are not legally bound by a code of conduct.

""The guidelines contained in the code exist to ensure that the public has faith that judicial decision-making is based solely on the facts and the law, not politics and outside interests,"" Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y., said upon introducing legislation, along with Sens. Chris Murphy, D-Conn.; Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn.; and Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., that would require the court to adopt a code of ethics.

Roberts and several other justices have said they routinely consult the Code of Conduct for United States Judges without being legally bound by it. Because there is no higher court, any ethics code would have to be self-enforced.

Even though the justices abide by congressional directives — such as by filing annual financial disclosure forms and limiting their outside income and receipt of gifts — it is not clear that Congress even has that power over the court.

""At the end of the day, no compilation of ethical rules can guarantee integrity,"" Roberts wrote in his 2011 year-end report. ""Judges must exercise both constant vigilance and good judgment to fulfill the obligations they have all taken since the beginning of the Republic.""

Justices Kennedy and Stephen Breyer made those points to a congressional panel in 2011. Breyer said he consults seven volumes of ethics to decide such matters as when to step aside in a case. Unlike the lower courts, he noted, the Supreme Court has no way to replace a judge who recuses himself.

""We do follow the rules. They do apply,"" Breyer said. But a battle between the branches over legislation, he said, ""produces heat and not too much light.""

That's not good enough for government watchdog groups that wrote to Roberts in June, urging that the justices post their financial disclosure forms online as soon as they are finished. Reporters must request printed copies of those reports from the Administrative Office of the United States Courts.

""The justices are on notice that members of Congress, as well as certain organizations, have raised concerns,"" says Nan Aron, president of the liberal Alliance for Justice. ""This is a problem peculiar to the Supreme Court."""

She Received The Pulitzer Prize For Commentary In']",Kathleen Parker: Obama’s race remarks exacerbate tensions,"If I had a son, he would look like Christopher Lane, the 22-year-old Australian baseball player shot dead while jogging in Oklahoma.

If I had a father, he’d look like Delbert Belton, the 88-year-old World War II veteran beaten to death in Spokane, Wash.

And yes, if I had a son, he’d look like the white teenager who police say drove the getaway car in the Oklahoma killing.

These are all true statements if we identify ourselves and each other only by the color of our skin, which increasingly seems to be the case. Even our president has done so.

Barack Obama helped lead the way when he identified himself with the parents of Trayvon Martin, shot by George Zimmerman in the neighborhood-watch catastrophe with which all are familiar. Stepping out from his usual duties of drawing meaningless red lines in the Syrian sand, the president splashed red paint across the American landscape:

1 of 68 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Tom Toles draws Obama View Photos A collection of cartoons of the president. Caption A collection of cartoons of the president. Wait 1 second to continue.

“If I had a son, he’d look like Trayvon.”

In so saying, he essentially gave permission for all to identify themselves by race with the victim or the accused. How sad, as we approach the 50th anniversary of the march Martin Luther King Jr. led on Washington, that even the president resorts to judging not by the content of one’s character but by the color of his skin — the antithesis of the great dream King articulated.

Obama went even further after the Zimmerman verdict, expressing his identification not as leader of a racially diverse nation — or as the son of a white mother — but as a black man who remembers women clutching their purses tighter when he entered an elevator and being followed in department stores. All because he was black?

Even today, I am followed when I go to the second floor of a boutique in Georgetown. Apparently, store policy requires that an attendant be upstairs when a shopper is. The way department store clerks follow me around, you’d think my face was plastered on a “Wanted for Shoplifting” poster. This is especially so if I’m dressed like a slob.

In my 20s, I conducted an experiment when I had the opposite problem. No clerk would help me. It occurred to me that my ratty jeans and T-shirt might be the problem, so I went home, changed into a dress, and returned. You’d have thought I was a honey bun in a beehive. Just for fun, I bought a $38,000 purse. (That’s a joke.)

Was the clerk prejudiced? You bet. But like it or not, the way we present ourselves to the world affects the way we are treated. Thus it has always been. I’m betting that few women today clutch their purses tighter when a well-groomed man, black or white, enters the elevator. A punk wearing his britches around his rump and telegraphing attitude? Even Jesse Jackson — or Eminem — might feel a tingle of discomfort.

Nothing is fair about profiling, but one’s treatment by a stranger is not always necessarily linked to one’s racial or ethnic history. Sometimes it’s just . . . you.

The killings leading the news the past several days have been horrific in their apparent randomness. Were they racially motivated? Had the perps been white and the victims black, would Obama have identified with them? More to immediate concerns, did the president’s identification with Trayvon Martin nourish the killing passions of these youths?

Hard to say with any certainty, though one of those charged in the Oklahoma shooting apparently tweeted some messages this summer that unmistakenly convey racial animus toward whites. They might be dismissed as Twitter nonsense — but for the dead body.

We do know this much for certain: Had the races been reversed, the usual suspects would have had much to say. White teens beat up an elderly black veteran and leave him for dead? White teens shoot a talented black athlete visiting from another country?

Riots.

I make these observations not to exacerbate a problem but in the hope that we can stop this craziness before things escalate. The conversation-about-race that pundits keep insisting we need to have should end where it began. Maybe in his remarks on the 50th anniversary of the greatest peaceful demonstration in history, Obama can remind Americans that if we had sons and fathers, they’d look like Christopher Lane and Delbert Belton as well as Trayvon Martin.

Victim in chief is no role for a president.

But this morning, Sandy Rios did something that hit way below the belt even by AFR standards. On her daily morning show, Rios claimed that Hillary Clinton is lying about her recent health problems, including the blood clot found on her brain. As if that wasn't bad enough, she claimed the whole story was a plot straight out of Saul Alinsky's playbook. People for the American Way got a clip.



She’s out of the hospital, so they say, but did anybody see that yesterday? They saw pictures of her riding in the car, a camera caught her, she looked perfectly happy, laughing. Leaving the hospital but there had been no report that she had left the hospital and then suddenly the State Department issues a statement, ‘oh yes she’s out of the hospital.’ This has been a bizarre story to me. I would be lying if I said I wasn’t one of the skeptics, I am a skeptic, I’m a huge skeptic. Let me just give you the exaggerated claims here. The National Enquirer printed a story saying that Hillary Clinton is having a ‘brain cancer drama.’ And then of course we’ve had detailed reports of this blood clot that supposedly happened as a result of a fall which supposedly happened as a result of a terrible flu which that had caught. I read an article in the Washington Post just a couple of days ago where her two doctors, and I’m sorry I can do this because I’m a girl, they are both women and they have these very strong female names and I say to myself: you know what, I just, I’m sorry, I just—do you know that the doctors have refused to make statements? They have not been allowed to ask questions, it’s just been statements from the State Department reporting how dreadfully awful, terrible the disease, that Hillary Clinton has is. I think the point I want to make is that Hillary Clinton has a long history. Many of us remember what a liar she is. She sat at the feet of Saul Alinsky, she wrote her master’s thesis on how to do propaganda and lie; I see her finger prints on Benghazi, I see her finger prints on this illness. I have to say this is like the ‘Boy that Cried Wolf,’ when you lie that many times in your life, when you won’t testify in all of these scandals with your family, when you destroy women that your husband’s been involved in by lying about them, when you create this vast right-wing conspiracy, then who can believe you when you say you’re sick? I’m sorry, I’m not there.

Listen to the whole show here

Sick. Absolutely sick. Even for a network that actively promoted the smear that Christopher Stevens brought his beating on himself because he was supposedly an openly gay ambassador in a Muslim country, this is just disgusting. Can you imagine what would happen if someone from our side suggested a prominent conservative was faking an injury?

Tell Rios what you think of her idiocy on her Facebook."

Law enforcement agencies in Southern California have reported few similar problems -- until now.

In the last several days, there have been several reports of such group crime waves in South L.A., Hollywood, San Bernardino and Victorville. Long Beach police are bracing for another one Friday.

These so-called bash mobs of “flash mob” crime waves are organized through social media and have been a problem in Chicago, Philadelphia and Washington. In April, 28 Chicago youths were arrested on suspicion of attacking pedestrians along the city’s famed Magnificent Mile. Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn signed legislation in May enacting stiffer penalties for people who text or use social media to organize mob attacks.

Long Beach police warned in a statement that participants could face severe penalties.

“The mere participation in such an event can result in felony charges including conspiracy, and are punishable by imprisonment in the state prison,” according to the statement.

Police said they feared bash mob organizers planned to hit Long Beach at 2 p.m.

Long Beach experienced such a gathering July 9, when more than 100 people descended on stretches of downtown in an organized, sudden crime rampage.

On Monday, a group of unruly young people broke off from hundreds gathered for a Trayvon Martin prayer vigil and rushed into a Wal-Mart on Crenshaw Boulevard, where they tossed merchandise and tried to break into a jewelry display case.

In Hollywood on Tuesday night, a flash mob of thieves rushed down Hollywood Boulevard, stealing phones, knocking over tourists and vandalizing shops, according to police, who said it may have been related to the George Zimmerman verdict. Twelve people — 11 juveniles and one 18-year-old -- were arrested on suspicion of robbery.

On Wednesday night in Victorville, authorities arrested 17 people after a group allegedly tried to force its way into the Mall of Victor Valley.

After weeks of speculating (and speculating), the first lady's second cover for the fashion glossy has arrived -- and it's absolutely stunning. As expected, photographer Annie Leibovitz shot Michelle, who wore a blue and purple Reed Krakoff sheath plucked straight from her very own closet. The green background, the cool color palette and the choice to wear Reed Krakoff definitely reminded us of FLOTUS' official portrait.

Vogue's fashion editor Tonne Goodman led the team styling Mrs. O and the president, who appears in a photo inside the mag with the first lady. Also in the editorial? A third shot of Michelle wearing an elegant Michael Kors ball skirt and sweater. To accompany the shoot, the first couple was interviewed by Jonathan Van Meter, discussing parenting, marriage and their duties while presiding in the White House. Of course, since this is Vogue, they also talked fashion.

“If you’re comfortable in your clothes it’s easy to connect with people and make them feel comfortable as well,” Michelle said.

FLOTUS certainly looks comfortable on her new Vogue cover, which includes her three second term signatures: bangs, Reed Krakoff, and, of course, her amazingly toned arms. Last time she covered the style bible, Michelle's designer of choice was Jason Wu -- with another Reed Krakoff pick this time around, it's clear we've entered a new era of FLOTUS fashion.

But they have had limited success: Only seven states have such measures in place, including California, Connecticut and Maryland; the most recent state to adopt such a law is Hawaii, which did so in 2006.

“Pretty much all of the energy, all of the momentum, has been to restrict abortion, which makes what could potentially happen in New York so interesting,” said Elizabeth Nash, state issues manager at the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights. “There’s no other state that’s even contemplating this right now.”

In most statehouses, the push by lawmakers has been in the opposite direction. The past two years has seen more provisions adopted at the state level to restrict abortion rights than in any two-year period in decades, according to the Guttmacher Institute; last year, 19 states adopted 43 new provisions restricting abortion access, while not a single significant measure was adopted to expand access to abortion or to comprehensive sex education.

“It’s an extraordinary moment in terms of the degree to which there is government interference in a woman’s ability to make these basic health care decisions,” said Andrea Miller, the president of NARAL Pro-Choice New York. “For New York to be able to send a signal, a hopeful sign, a sense of the turning of the tide, we think is really important.”

Abortion rights advocates say that even though the Roe decision supersedes state law, some doctors are hesitant to perform late-term abortions when a woman’s health is at risk because the criminal statutes remain on the books.

“Doctors and hospitals shouldn’t be reading criminal laws to determine what types of health services they can offer and provide to their patients,” said M. Tracey Brooks, the president of Family Planning Advocates of New York State.

For Mr. Cuomo, the debate over passing a new abortion law presents an opportunity to appeal to women as well as to liberals, who have sought action in Albany without success since Eliot Spitzer made a similar proposal when he was governor. But it also poses a challenge to the coalition of Republicans and a few Democrats that controls the State Senate, the chamber that has in the past stood as the primary obstacle to passing abortion legislation in the capital."

Brown wins 30-day extension to cut prison crowding,"SACRAMENTO -- Three federal judges have given California Gov. Jerry Brown a 30-day extension on their order to reduce prison crowding, buying time for confidential talks between lawyers for the state and those representing inmates.

The order, delivered Tuesday afternoon, was well-received by prisoners’ lawyers, who had largely been left out of negotiations between Brown and the Legislature over prison-crowding solutions.

“We’re always willing to try and negotiate an agreement that will benefit the state and the prisoners,” said Don Specter, lead attorney for the Prison Law Office. He said he did not believe a one-month delay in reducing prison crowding would make a big difference in the 23-year-old litigation.

Brown’s lawyers had asked the federal courts for a three-year delay in the Dec. 31 deadline to remove roughly 9,600 inmates from California’s overcrowded prison system, where medical and psychiatric care is so poor that incarceration has been deemed unconstitutionally cruel. The governor offered to use that time to invest in community probation and rehabilitation programs, with the aim of reducing the number of repeat offenders being sent to prison.

The judges directed lawyers for the state and for prisoners to immediately begin confidential talks, and to report back by Oct. 21. In the meantime, the deadline to reduce crowding has been pushed to Jan. 27.

Both sides are directed to discuss “a durable solution to the prison crowding problem,” including California’s three-strike laws, detention of juveniles, the elderly and medically infirm, as well as the detention of individuals on federal immigration holds. The judges are also requiring lawyers from both sides to discuss early release of low-risk prisoners, and “any other means, including relocation within the state” that have been offered as solutions.

As part of those talks, the judges’ order said, “the parties may also discuss any necessary or desirable extension” of the population cap, “as well as any other matters they deem appropriate.”

When the Justice Department began investigating possible leaks of classified information about North Korea in 2009, investigators did more than obtain telephone records of a working journalist suspected of receiving the secret material.

They used security badge access records to track the reporter’s comings and goings from the State Department, according to a newly obtained court affidavit. They traced the timing of his calls with a State Department security adviser suspected of sharing the classified report. They obtained a search warrant for the reporter’s personal e-mails.

The case of Stephen Jin-Woo Kim, the government adviser, and James Rosen, the chief Washington correspondent for Fox News, bears striking similarities to a sweeping leaks investigation disclosed last week in which federal investigators obtained records over two months of more than 20 telephone lines assigned to the Associated Press.

At a time when President Obama’s administration is under renewed scrutiny for an unprecedented number of leak investigations, the Kim case provides a rare glimpse into the inner workings of one such probe.

Court documents in the Kim case reveal how deeply investigators explored the private communications of a working journalist — and raise the question of how often journalists have been investigated as closely as Rosen was in 2010. The case also raises new concerns among critics of government secrecy about the possible stifling effect of these investigations on a critical element of press freedom: the exchange of information between reporters and their sources.

“Search warrants like these have a severe chilling effect on the free flow of important information to the public,” said First Amendment lawyer Charles Tobin, who has represented the Associated Press, but not in the current case. “That’s a very dangerous road to go down.”

Obama last week defended the Justice Department’s handling of the investigation involving the AP, which is focused on who leaked information to the news organization about a foiled plot involving the al-Qaeda affiliate in Yemen. AP executives and First Amendment watchdogs have criticized the Justice Department in part for the broad scope of the phone records it secretly subpoenaed from AP offices in Washington, Hartford, Conn., and New York.

“The latest events show an expansion of this law enforcement technique,” said attorney Abbe Lowell, who is defending Kim on federal charges filed in 2010 that he disclosed national defense information. A trial is possible as soon as 2014. “Individual reporters or small time periods have turned into 20 [telephone] lines and months of records with no obvious attempt to be targeted or narrow.”

The president said press freedoms must be balanced against the protection of U.S. personnel overseas. According to the office of Ronald Machen Jr., the U.S. attorney for the District, its prosecutors followed federal regulations by first seeking the information through other means before subpoenaing media phone records. Machen’s office is investigating both the Kim and AP cases. The Justice Department said in a statement that in both cases it had abided by “all applicable laws, regulations, and longstanding Department of Justice policies intended to safeguard the First Amendment interests of the press in reporting the news and the public in receiving it.”

The Obama administration has pursued more such cases than all previous administrations combined, including one against a former CIA official charged with leaking U.S. intelligence on Iran and another against a former FBI contract linguist who pleaded guilty to leaking to a blogger.

The Kim case began in June 2009, when Rosen reported that U.S. intelligence officials were warning that North Korea was likely to respond to United Nations sanctions with more nuclear tests. The CIA had learned the information, Rosen wrote, from sources inside North Korea.

The story was published online the same day that a top-secret report was made available to a small circle within the intelligence community — including Kim, who at the time was a State Department arms expert with security clearance.

FBI investigators used the security-badge data, phone records and e-mail exchanges to build a case that Kim shared the report with Rosen soon after receiving it, court records show.

In the documents, FBI agent Reginald Reyes described in detail how Kim and Rosen moved in and out of the State Department headquarters at 2201 C St. NW a few hours before the story was published on June 11, 2009.

“Mr. Kim departed DoS at or around 12:02 p.m. followed shortly thereafter by the reporter at or around 12:03 p.m.,” Reyes wrote. Next, the agent said, “Mr. Kim returned to DoS at or around 12:26 p.m. followed shortly thereafter by the reporter at or around 12:30 p.m.”

The activity, Reyes wrote in an affidavit, suggested a “face-to-face” meeting between the two men. “Within a few hours after those nearly simultaneous exits and entries at DoS, the June 2009 article was published on the Internet,” he wrote.

The court documents don’t name Rosen, but his identity was confirmed by several officials, and he is the author of the article at the center of the investigation. Rosen and a spokeswoman for Fox News did not return phone and e-mail messages seeking comment.

Reyes wrote that there was evidence Rosen had broken the law, “at the very least, either as an aider, abettor and/or co-conspirator.” That fact distinguishes his case from the probe of the AP, in which the news organization is not the likely target.

Using italics for emphasis, Reyes explained how Rosen allegedly used a “covert communications plan” and quoted from an e-mail exchange between Rosen and Kim that seems to describe a secret system for passing along information.

In the exchange, Rosen used the alias “Leo” to address Kim and called himself “Alex,” an apparent reference to Alexander Butterfield, the man best known for running the secret recording system in the Nixon White House, according to the affidavit.

Rosen instructed Kim to send him coded signals on his Google account, according to a quote from his e-mail in the affidavit: “One asterisk means to contact them, or that previously suggested plans for communication are to proceed as agreed; two asterisks means the opposite.”

He also wrote, according to the affidavit: “What I am interested in, as you might expect, is breaking news ahead of my competitors” including “what intelligence is picking up.” And: “I’d love to see some internal State Department analyses.”

Court documents show abundant evidence gathered from Kim’s office computer and phone records, but investigators said they needed to go a step further to build their case, seizing two days’ worth of Rosen’s personal e-mails — and all of his e-mail exchanges with Kim.

Privacy protections limit searching or seizing a reporter’s work, but not when there is evidence that the journalist broke the law against unauthorized leaks. A federal judge signed off on the search warrant — agreeing that there was probable cause that Rosen was a co-conspirator.

Machen’s office said in a statement that it is limited in commenting on an open case, but that the government “exhausted all reasonable non-media alternatives for collecting the evidence” before seeking a search warrant.

However, it remains an open question whether it’s ever illegal, given the First Amendment’s protection of press freedom, for a reporter to solicit information. No reporter, including Rosen, has been prosecuted for doing so.

In the hours before Rosen’s story was published, Kim was one of more than 95 people who saw the intelligence report through a classified database, according to court documents.

Kim’s phone records showed that seven calls lasting from 18 seconds to more than 11 minutes were placed between Kim’s desk telephone and Rosen’s cellphone and desk phone at the State Department, according to the court documents. Investigators pulled at least two months of phone records from Kim’s desk and found 36 calls with numbers associated with Rosen.

Investigators also scrutinized computer records and found that someone who had logged in with Kim’s user profile viewed the classified report “at or around” the same time two calls were placed from his desk phone to Rosen, according to the documents.

Two months later on an August evening, diplomatic security secretly entered Kim’s office and found a copy of Rosen’s article next to his computer. Kim, who worked in a secure facility, was subject to daily office inspections. The Fox News article was also in “plain view” during follow-up visits in late September.

Kim initially told the FBI in an interview that month that he had met the reporter in March but had not had contact since. Later, Kim admitted to additional contacts, according to the affidavit.

He Has Covered The Pentagon', 'Served As The Berlin Bureau Chief', 'Reported More Than Countries. He Joined The Washington Post In']",Navy Secretary Mabus expects bribery scandal to widen,"Navy Secretary Ray Mabus said Friday that he bluntly told criminal investigators to pursue a widening bribery scandal “wherever it leads” and that he expects more people to get swept up in a case that has already tarred several senior officers and exposed an international, multimillion-dollar fraud scheme.

“I certainly don’t think we’ve seen the end of it,” Mabus told reporters at the Pentagon in his first public comments on the scandal since it came to light in September. “I would rather get bad headlines than let bad people get away.”

Mabus, the Navy’s top civilian official since 2009, spoke a day after he held an unusual video conference with the Navy’s fleet commanders and other admirals around the world to emphasize the need to uphold ethical standards and prevent contracting fraud. With the scandal showing no sign of abating, he also has ordered several reviews and an audit into how the Navy pays for port services.

The Navy has been tarnished by a succession of embarrassing revelations over the past three months about its relationship with a major foreign defense contractor, Singapore-based Glenn Defense Marine Asia, that has provided port services to U.S. ships and submarines in the Pacific for a quarter-century.

So far, two Navy commanders have been arrested and charged with taking bribes from the company in the form of cash, luxury travel and prostitutes. Two captains have been suspended or reassigned by the Navy. And two admirals who work in Navy intelligence have had their access to classified materials suspended while investigators scrutinize their possible involvement.

In addition, a senior agent with the Naval Criminal Investigative Service pleaded guilty in federal court this week to taking bribes in exchange for leaking inside information to Glenn Defense Marine about the progress of multiple federal probes targeting the firm. Prosecutors estimate that the government was cheated out of more than $20 million by the alleged fraud scheme.

The president of Glenn Defense Marine, Leonard Glenn Francis — a Malaysian national known as “Fat Leonard” in Navy circles — was arrested in September along with another executive during a sting operation. Francis has pleaded not guilty in federal court and is being held without bail in California.

At his news conference, Mabus shed some new light on the apprehensions. He said investigators lured Francis from Singapore to San Diego to meet with Navy officials by planting false information in law enforcement databases indicating that the probes targeting the firm had fizzled and that no charges would be brought. The investigators suspected, correctly, that the rogue NCIS agent would feed the false information to Francis and make him think it was safe to travel to the United States to seek more business from the Navy.

Mabus said other NCIS agents began investigating Glenn Defense Marine in May 2010, “based on suspicious claims and invoices the company submitted to the Navy, claims that internal processes Navy had set up helped reveal.”

Federal court records filed by prosecutors assert that the initial investigation stalled for lack of evidence and because the rogue NCIS agent and Navy officers taking bribes advised Francis how to dodge the inquiry.

Despite lingering suspicions, the Navy continued to sign lucrative business deals with Glenn Defense Marine, including a $1 million no-bid contract extension in July. Mabus defended the arrangements, saying Navy contracting officials were intentionally not told about the law enforcement investigation. He also said that suspending contracts with the company while the probe was still unfolding would have tipped it off “that something was wrong.”

The scandal is just one in a flurry of misconduct cases involving senior military officials that have dogged the Defense Department over the past year.

On Thursday, the Air Force released an investigative report documenting how a two-star general in charge of nuclear weapons repeatedly drank too much and consorted with suspicious foreign women during an embarrassing four-day business trip to Moscow in July.

In October, the Navy relieved a three-star admiral from his post as deputy commander of the U.S. Strategic Command, which oversees all nuclear-armed missiles, bombers and submarines. In that case, Vice Adm. Tim Giardina was allegedly caught using counterfeit gambling chips during a visit to a casino.

Mabus said the misbehavior was limited to a “few” people in the service, but at the same time expressed frustration by saying that there was only so much the Navy could do to prevent some officers from acting badly.

“This not only goes against all the ethics rules that we have, these few people that are alleged to have done these things; this goes against everything you should have learned at home,” he said. “I mean, everybody knows it’s wrong to take a bribe. Everybody knows it’s wrong to get paid to give a contract.”"

According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Story highlights NEW: Senate approves Nina Pillard 51-44 to serve on federal appeals court in Washington Republicans are angry over rules change that weakens their hand in opposing nominations The new rules imposed by majority Democrats aim to speed up confirmation Overnight session forced by GOP is one way to express frustration and slow the process

(CNN) —

Frustrated Republicans are retaliating for a Democratic play to weaken their hand in opposing presidential nominations, forcing an all-night session into Thursday’s early hours.

Votes on judicial and other appointments took place early Thursday morning, part of the fallout after the Democratic majority enforced a rule change to expedite consideration of appointments, the so-called nuclear option.

Until last month, longstanding Senate rules required a supermajority of 60 votes to break a filibuster over a presidential nominee. Republicans fiercely opposed the change, which now allows the majority Democrats to break filibusters with 51 votes.

Democrats, who hold a 55-45 advantage in the Senate, said Republicans had abused the filibuster privilege around President Barack Obama’s nominations, and the only way for him to staff his second-term administration promptly and move stalled judicial appointments was to speed things up through a rules change.

“The Obama administration and its allies have done just about everything to get what they want, one way or the other – even fundamentally altering the contours of our democracy when they couldn’t get their way playing by the rules,” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said in floor remarks Wednesday. “We saw the culmination of that with the majority leader’s power grab in the Senate last month.”

5 ways life changes in the Senate after nuclear option

Republicans are requiring the marathon session if Democrats want to clear a long list of nominees before leaving for vacation next week.

GOP escalation of the rules fight renewed attention to sharp partisan wrangling one day after lawmakers trumpeted a compromise House-Senate budget proposal brokered across party lines.

The first vote in the extended session came shortly after 1 a.m. ET as the Senate approved 51-44 Nina Pillard’s nomination on the federal appeals court in Washington. For some, the appointment has been a steppingstone to the Supreme Court.

The Senate will continue plowing through the backlog of nominees later Thursday. Senators will vote on the confirmation of Chai Rachel Feldblum to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

Senate Democrats began enforcing the “nuclear option” this week, stoking Republican ire.

All-nighters could continue for days. Democratic leaders said they were prepared to stay in session virtually around the clock through Saturday night to confirm a list of 10 nominees to a variety of senior posts.

They range from lesser-known appointments – such as Patricia Wald to the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board – to critical positions – such as Jeh Johnson to be homeland security secretary.

There are also several federal district court judge appointments on the list as well as nominees to Pentagon posts and the State Department.

Customarily, Senate leaders work together so the chamber can conduct its business during more regular hours. But because of strict parliamentary rules, it’s easy for just one senator to hold things up.

In this case, the whole GOP conference is upset.

What’s the nuclear option?

So why are they working overnights?

According to Senate rules, a certain number of hours of debate can still be demanded by any senator once a filibuster is broken.

Known as “post-cloture debate time” in Senate parlance, up to eight hours of debate time is allowed for nine of the 10 nominees on Majority Leader Harry Reid’s list. For Johnson, the homeland security nominee, debate can last for 30 hours.

Typically, Senate leaders would agree to allow that debate time to run with the Senate out of session. But Republicans are angry about the changes to the filibuster rules and are requiring the Senate to stay in session.

Reid accused Republicans of obstructionism.

“It is hard to imagine a more pointless exercise than spending an entire day waiting for a vote whose outcome we already know,” Reid said about the Pillard nomination. “But Republicans insist on wasting time simply for the sake of wasting time. It’s no wonder Americans overwhelmingly support the changes Democrats made to the rules last month in order to make the Senate work again.”"

""I believe it is imperative to establish higher standards that reflect our respect for the sanctity of life,"" Abbott said in fundraising email.

In a dramatic ruling, the Supreme Court on June 27 threw out a Texas abortion access law in a victory to supporters of abortion rights who argued it would have shuttered all but a handful of clinics in the state.

With the Supreme Court hearing on the Texas law approaching, Whole Woman's Health -- which is challenging the law -- held a gathering at a San Antonio clinic on February 9, 2016.

David Daleiden, the other defendant in the indictment over the videos, speaks to media and supporters after turning himself in the following day in Houston. Daleiden and Sandra Merritt are charged with tampering with a governmental record, a felony punishable by up to 20 years in prison. Both have pleaded not guilty.

Texas again became the focus of the abortion debate after a group produced a series of videos depicting Planned Parenthood officials appearing to talk about the price of fetal tissue. But an investigation into the allegations backfired on the accusers when prosecutors cleared Planned Parenthood -- and instead indicted two people involved in making the video. Above, one of the two defendants, Sandra Merritt, right, hugs a supporter after appearing in court to post bond on February 3, 2016.

In July 2015, Erica Canaut, center, and other anti-abortion activists rallied on the steps of the Texas Capitol to condemn the use of tissue samples obtained from aborted fetuses for medical research.

The following month, college students and abortion-rights activists rallied on the steps of the Texas Capitol as the legislature met on February 26, 2015.

On the 42nd anniversary of Roe v. Wade -- January 22, 2015 -- Evan Keimig of Houston, left, and Brandan Solcher of Sugarland, Texas, wear Vatican flags in front of the U.S. Capitol following a ""March for Life"" protest.

Meanwhile, Wendy Davis' 2013 filibuster propelled her to the Democratic Party's nomination for Texas governor. Here, she listens as Houston City Council member Ellen Cohen speaks about the law in October 2014, just weeks before Davis was defeated by Republican Greg Abbott.

As the Texas case wound its way through the courts, a group from Texas joined an anti-abortion demonstration on the Mall in Washington on January 22, 2014 -- the 41st anniversary of the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion.

Three days later, on October 31, 2013, the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the federal district judge's decision. Here, a woman holds her rosary beads as she prays on the sidewalk across the street from Planned Parenthood in Fort Worth, Texas.

On October 28, 2013, the day before the legislation was scheduled to take effect, a federal judge ruled that parts of it were unconstitutional. Above, state troopers look on as a group in Austin, Texas, protests the law.

Davis said she was speaking for families whose ""personal relationships with their doctor and their Creator"" would be violated by the bill.

Opponents of the bill sat in the gallery holding hangers. Among the changes Davis and others opposed: requiring abortion clinics to become ambulatory surgical center and requiring doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals.

In preparation for hours of speaking, Davis wore a pair of pink sneakers in place of her dress shoes. Her shoes became a symbol for abortion-rights activists.

It took not one but two special leglative sessions for the measure to pass; the first attempt was blocked following a lengthy filibuster by sneaker-wearing Sen. Wendy Davis in a near empty Senate chamber.

Texas has long been a hotbed of abortion protests, but the issue drew national attention in 2013 when new abortion restrictions were debated and then passed in the legislature. Above, opponents of the measure walk around supporters at the Capitol.

Story highlights NEW: The case would head next to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans U.S. District Judge Lee Yeakel strikes down the law's admitting privileges requirement He delivers a somewhat mixed verdict on medication-induced abortions ""Today's decision will not stop our ongoing efforts to protect life,"" says Gov. Perry

(CNN) —

A federal judge struck down key parts of a new Texas abortion law, considered among the most restrictive in the country, on Monday, one day before they were scheduled to take effect.

The lawsuit – filed in U.S. District Court in Austin by Planned Parenthood on behalf of more than a dozen women’s health care providers across Texas – alleged the law violates the constitutional rights of women and puts unreasonable demands on doctors who perform abortions.

The lawsuit specifically targets requirements under the new law that doctors obtain admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic at which they’re providing abortion services, and usage controls on RU486, a drug that induces abortions.

U.S. District Judge Lee Yeakel blocked the law’s admitting privileges requirement, arguing that it “places a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus and is thus an undue burden to her.”

He also blocked a part of the law that deals with medication-induced abortions but allowed restrictions on the same issue to move forward. Provisions such as requiring strict use under Food and Drug Administration protocol and mandatory follow-up visits remain in place.

“The medication-abortion provisions may not be enforced against any physician who determines, in appropriate medical judgment, to perform a medication-abortion using the off-label protocol for the preservation of the life or health of the mother,” Yeakel wrote.

Abortion-rights groups say the judge did not go far enough on the issue of medication-induced abortion, believing doctors should be able to use it with few restrictions.

“Today’s ruling marks an important victory for Texas women and sends a clear message to lawmakers: it is unconstitutional for politicians to pass laws that take personal, private decisions away from women and their doctors,” Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said in a statement.

“While this ruling protects access to safe and legal abortion for women in many parts of the state, part of this ruling will make it impossible for many women to access medication abortion, which is safe and effective early in pregnancy,” she said.

Conservative groups were disappointed by the ruling.

“Blocking this law only puts vulnerable women in greater danger. We are very disturbed that a judge would partially block a law that is grounded in the latest science and in common sense,” said Anna Higgins, director of the Center for Human Dignity at the Family Research Council.

The bill originally failed to gain approval because of a Democratic filibuster led by state Sen. Wendy Davis. Texas Gov. Rick Perry then called the legislature into a second special session to continue consideration of the bill.

In response to the judge’s ruling, Perry vowed he and others will keep fighting.

If the state decides to appeal, the case would head next to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans.

“Today’s decision will not stop our ongoing efforts to protect life and ensure the women of our state aren’t exposed to any more of the abortion-mill horror stories that have made headlines recently,” the governor said.

He added: “We will continue fighting to implement the laws passed by the duly-elected officials of our state, laws that reflect the will and values of Texans.”

Separately, the law prohibits abortions past 20 weeks of gestation. That ban takes effect, as scheduled, on Tuesday.

He Left The Post In April']",Republican Party could learn a lot from the Democrats of 1989,"The Republicans of 2013 look a lot like the Democrats of 1989 — shut out of the presidency, beholden to a shrinking base and on the wrong side of major demographic shifts in the country.

That’s the argument two longtime Democratic strategists — Bill Galston and Elaine Kamarck — make in an essay titled “The New Politics of Evasion” in the fall edition of Democracy: A Journal of Ideas. For any Republican hoping to win back the White House in 2016, it’s an absolute must-read.

What Galston and Kamarck set out to do is revisit a famed essay they wrote in 1989 about their own side’s political and policy failing, titled “The Politics of Evasion: Democrats and the Presidency.”

In that first essay, Galston and Kamarck write, “we debunked the views of our Democratic colleagues who hoped, as do so many Republicans today, that their fortunes would start looking up when a popular two-term President passed from the scene, and we laid out the kinds of changes the party would have to embrace if it wished to regain its competitiveness in presidential elections.”

The diagnoses and proposed prescriptions the duo outlined for Democrats almost a quarter-century ago also apply to Republicans today.

First, what’s wrong. Galston and Kamarck broke the Democrats’ problems into three basic “myths”: the myth of “liberal fundamentalism,” the myth of “mobilization” and the myth of “the congressional bastion.”

The first myth centered on the idea that Democrats had come up short at the presidential level in 1980, 1984 and 1988 because the candidates they had nominated — Jimmy Carter, Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis — were insufficient adherents to liberal orthodoxy. If only the party had nominated a “true liberal,” the argument went, they would have won. Sound familiar? The critique from many within the GOP over the past two elections is that neither John McCain nor Mitt Romney were dyed-in-the-wool conservatives, and that had the party nominated someone like, say, Rick Santorum, it might have won.

The second myth — of mobilization — is all about demographics. In the 1980s, Democrats insisted that if only blacks and Hispanics would vote in numbers commensurate with their share of the population, the party’s nominee would win. They didn’t, and Democrats didn’t win. Fast-forward to today and some within the Republican Party are making that same losing argument about consolidating the white vote. “[T]he Republicans’ demographic problem is the mirror image of the one that Democrats faced a quarter-century ago,” Galston and Kamarck write. “Back then there weren’t enough minorities to make the Democrats’ electoral strategy work; today, there aren’t enough whites to make the Republican strategy viable. The same long-cycle trends that gradually helped Democrats are now hurting Republicans.”

This demographic myth is perhaps the most dangerous for Republicans as they seek a way back to the White House in 2016. Remember that the white vote as a percentage of the overall electorate has declined in every presidential election since 1992. As GOP strategist Pete Wehner has noted, if Romney had carried the white vote by 20 points — as he did in 2012— with the demographic makeup of the country as it was in 2000, he would be president today. But, he’s not.

The final myth is that of the “congressional bastion,” the idea that if the party out of the White House still controls a chamber of Congress and/or a number of state and local offices then it’s evidence that all is well and major change isn’t required. This is the most prevalent argument you hear from Republicans today; yes, the party has lost two presidential elections in convincing fashion, but the fact that it retains control of the House and has a chance to retake the Senate majority in 2014 are a testament to the continued strength of the GOP’s messaging. But, holding a House majority in a deeply gerrymandered set of districts is not the same as winning a national presidential election. And the 2012 election proved that the massive gains the GOP made in the 2010 midterms are more the exception than the rule.

The diagnosis by Galston and Kamarck of what ails the Republican Party is not new; Wehner and former George W. Bush speechwriter Michael Gerson wrote a terrific piece for Commentary magazine this past spring entitled “How to Save the Republican Party” that makes many of the same arguments.

The problem for smart Republican strategists is not figuring out what’s wrong, but developing a real and pragmatic plan to fix it. Democrats fixed their problems of the 1980s with one man: Bill Clinton.

“There’s no substitute for a leader with the guts to break with outdated party orthodoxy, as Clinton did on trade, fiscal policy, welfare and crime among other issues,” Galston and Kamarck write. “And he did more than that: In that famous Sister Souljah episode, he spoke out against a tendency in the party’s base that crossed the line from protest to extremism.”

The obvious analog to Clinton in the modern Republican Party is former Florida governor Jeb Bush. Bush, like Clinton, spent much of his formative life as a governor and, on issues ranging from education to immigration, has shown a willingness to break from Republican orthodoxy and the party’s base.

Unlike Clinton, who long signaled his plan to run for president in advance of the 1992 race, Bush remains an elusive figure when it comes to his future plans. If Bush decides against a bid, there is no other obvious figure who fits the Clinton-circa-1992 mold, although Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) probably has the most chance to remake the Republican coalition among those candidates expected to run.

History has a way of repeating itself. Republicans would do well to realize that the Democratic Party of 1989 has many lessons to teach the GOP of today. And they would do well to realize it sooner rather than later."
http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2013/06/16/immigration-bill-shaping-up-but-fate-still-uncertain/,2013-06-16 00:00:00,"['Tampa Tim', 'Rudy Nyc', 'The', 'Compassionate', 'Gop Solution', 'Posted By']","Immigration bill shaping up, but fate still uncertain","8 years ago

(CNN) – While the future of immigration reform is still in question, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a member of the bipartisan Gang of Eight, predicted the Senate will pass the bill with 70 votes or more.

“I think we're going to have a political breakthrough, that Congress is going to pass immigration reform. I think we're going to get plus 70 votes,” he said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “I've never been more optimistic about it.”



His GOP colleague in the Gang of Eight, Sen. Marco Rubio, doesn't sound quite as confident. The senator from Florida maintains the bill is almost in “perfect shape” but reiterated it needs tweaks to its border security provisions.

Meanwhile, a Democratic member of their bipartisan group, Sen. Bob Menendez, said those changes must not undermine one of the bill’s main provisions, which offers a pathway to citizenship.

The Senate voted last week to begin debate on the bill, and senators have already started filing amendments to the legislation. But the measure’s fate hangs on whether Republicans can find a solution that can win favor among enough representatives in the GOP-controlled House.

Rubio has been aggressive in stating that he may withdraw support from his own bill if the measure does not include language that would further boost border security and enforcement–a requirement for many conservatives.

The Republican senator said “95, 96% of the bill is in perfect shape and ready to go, but there are elements that need to be improved.”

“The vast majority of Americans and conservative Republicans are prepared to support immigration reform, but only if we can ensure we're not going to have another wave of illegal immigration in the future,” he said on ABC’s “This Week.”

Menendez, however, suggested Democrats have already made big compromises, saying the bill adds $6.5 billion in funds for border security and includes senators from border states as authors of the bill. (Republican Sens. Jeff Flake and John McCain of Arizona are part of the Gang of Eight.)

“There are critics of our bill in which - 10 angels could come swearing from above that this is the best legislation for America, and they would say the angels lie. So, those I can never solve or satisfy,” Menendez said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”

The New Jersey Democrat said his party is open to changes in the border plan, but maintained he “cannot support” a requirement that the border be certified secure before undocumented immigrants are allowed to begin their pathway to citizenship.

Senators rejected such a proposal last week by Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, who wanted to delay the legalization process for millions until the Department of Homeland Security could certify it had effective control over the southern border for six months.

But others in the House still favor a similar effort and may pursue that as an option should the bill pass the Senate.

“We're going to have triggers that can never be achieved in terms of border security as an impediment to the pathway to legalization and citizenship,” Menendez said, fervently disagreeing with the idea.

In the end, he said, he thinks the bill will get enough votes to pass and will win over his colleagues on the other side of Capitol Hill.

“When we hit 60 votes, which we will, I have no doubt that other people will want to be on the right side of history, and that will send a very strong message to the House,” he said.

For his part, Graham cautioned that if Congress doesn't pass reform, Republicans will have little chance of taking back the White House in 2016.

""We're in a demographic death spiral as a party, and the only way we can get back in good graces with the Hispanic community, in my view, is pass comprehensive immigration reform,"" he said on NBC.

He Sketches The Foolish', 'The Fallacious', 'The Felonious In Politics.']",Dana Milbank: Senators turn the tables on Caymans investor Jack Lew,"President Obama won reelection in part by beating up on his opponent for receiving big corporate payouts in exchange for dubious work and for socking away money in tax havens such as the Cayman Islands.

So it’s a bit, well, rich that Obama chose as his new Treasury secretary a man who received a big corporate payout for dubious work and who socked away money in the Cayman Islands.

This awkward fact pattern forced a role reversal Wednesday on Capitol Hill, as Obama’s nominee, Jack Lew, came before the Senate Finance Committee for his confirmation hearing. Republicans expressed outrage about his compensation and his investment — in other words, giving him the Mitt Romney treatment. And Chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.), an outspoken foe of offshore tax havens, helped Lew defend himself.

In Washington, where you stand on an issue depends on where you sit.

Lew, who was White House chief of staff while Obama’s campaign was pummeling Romney over his pay and taxes, received a $945,000 bonus in January 2009 after a brief tenure at Citigroup — just as the bank announced huge losses and took a taxpayer bailout. Lew also invested $56,000 in a Citigroup venture-capital fund registered in the Cayman Islands — registered in the very building, in fact, that Obama labeled “the largest tax scam in the world.”

Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) pressed Lew to “explain why it might be morally acceptable to take close to a million dollars out of a company that was functionally insolvent and about to receive a billion dollars of taxpayers’ support.”

Grassley also asked Lew to justify investing his money in one of the 12,000 businesses based in Ugland House, a five-floor building in Grand Cayman. “There’s a certain hypocrisy in what the president says about other taxpayers and then your appointment,” the senator observed.

Lew’s explanation was Romneyesque. “I was an employee in the private sector compensated in a manner consistent with other people who did the kind of work that I did in the industry,” he said, justifying his payout. As for his offshore investment: “I reported all income that I earned. I paid all taxes due.”

In a sense, none of this matters. Lew’s confirmation isn’t in doubt, a fact supported by the way he sauntered down the hall to his hearing in the Dirksen Senate Office Building, hands in pockets. His answers were often vague but cheerful sentiments (“I would look forward to working with you and others on a bipartisan basis to think through these ideas”).

Lew’s best defense on the Caymans matter was that he lost money on the investment, so there were no taxes to be avoided. But this only proves that he wasn’t necessarily good at selecting tax havens. And his plum job at Citigroup, which Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) said has been called “a political trophy position,” is a fine example of the revolving door between government work and private-sector lucre.

Obama frequently mentioned Ugland House on the campaign trail in 2008. Baucus held a hearing on it that year, saying that the place had “a lot to do with tax evasion” and the $345 billion gap “between the taxes legally owed and the taxes timely paid.”

But on Wednesday, it was the Republicans’ turn to display a poster of Ugland House, a modern white structure with palm trees in front. “Mr. Lew,” said Sen. Pat Roberts (Kan.), savoring the irony, “welcome to what some of the press have described as the Grand Cayman Ugland House rehab and restoration hearings.”

This time, it was Baucus’s task to inoculate Lew against charges that he was associated with the very structure Baucus had identified with tax evasion. “Did you know at the time it was Cayman?” he asked. “When did you divest? . . . Did you pay taxes on that investment?”

Lew’s claims that he didn’t know where the fund was based and that he lost money on the investment didn’t quiet the Republican questioners.

“It’s no wonder that maybe you and the president haven’t proposed legislative solutions to what you consider, or what the president considers, a tax scam,” Grassley observed.

Lew argued that “the tax code should be constructed to encourage investment in the United States.”

“Ugland House ought to be shut down?” Grassley asked.

“Senator, I am actually not familiar with Ugland House,” the witness pleaded. “I understand there are a lot of things that happen there.”

Yes, and, according to the man who nominated Lew, these things are tax scams.

Jerry Brown when he signed them last month, according to a USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll.

The groups differ most on allowing immigrants without legal status to obtain driver’s licenses and practice law.

Nearly 69% of Latino voters but only 44% of whites support the new driving privilege law. The split was sharper on whether those who are in the country illegally should be allowed to become attorneys, with 65% of Latino voters in favor but only 26% of whites.

Neither law gained majority support among all voters.

To win over a growing Latino electorate, California politicians will continue to push for immigrant-friendly legislation, analysts predicted. The poll shows that 61% of Latinos approve of Brown’s performance, compared with 51% of whites.

“Latino voters are a life preserver for Jerry Brown, and in California they’re a very, very big life preserver, and that goes back to the relative import of cultural and social issues,” said Dan Schnur, director of Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at USC.

The bipartisan poll reached 1,503 registered California voters by telephone. It was conducted Oct. 30 through Nov. 5 by two polling firms, one Democratic and one Republican. The margin of error overall is 3.1 percentage points, higher for subgroups such as Latinos.

Brown signed 11 immigrant-related measures this fall, but none generated as much controversy as the long-debated driver’s license bill. The licenses will be marked “DP,” for driving privilege.

Overall, 49% support the license law, with 47% opposed. Support was greater for granting licenses without a distinguishing mark, with 51% in favor, 46% opposed.

A decade ago, polls showed that most California voters disapproved of driver’s licenses for immigrants who are in the country illegally, an issue that contributed to Gov. Gray Davis’ recall. But the state’s demographics have shifted, with Latinos now making up 23% of voters. Whites are also more likely to support the licenses than they were in the past.

“There are two factors at play. One is how much of that change is driven by the Latino population getting larger, and two is how much is driven by white voters changing their minds?” said David Kanevsky of American Viewpoint, the Republican firm that conducted the poll for the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences and the Los Angeles Times, along with the Democratic firm Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research.

As a group, white voters are still less enthusiastic about pro-immigrant measures than Latinos are, drawing the line at rights they see as reserved for citizens.

“It just suggests the population is both divided and not particularly motivated really in a positive way by these measures,” said Drew Lieberman of Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research.

Two-thirds of white voters are opposed to allowing holders of green cards to serve on juries, with 44% of Latinos opposed. Overall, only 35% of voters supported the measure, which was vetoed by Brown. A majority of whites support a new law allowing those with green cards to serve as poll workers.

More than 50% of Latino voters but only 44% of white voters support the Trust Act, which limits cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities. Overall, 48% of voters approve of the law, which Brown signed after vetoing a similar measure last year.

The USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll also showed broad support from whites and Latinos for new laws protecting immigrant whistle-blowers from employer retaliation and granting overtime pay to domestic workers.

“Californians are extremely welcoming and supportive of undocumented immigrants and their families, but they still have concerns about those individuals who have committed crimes,” Schnur said.

Denis Nolan, a retired tutor in Daly City, is in favor of driver’s licenses for immigrants without legal status. Many of them are driving anyway, Nolan said, and he would rather have them pass a driving test.

Nolan, a Democrat, would not allow those immigrants to become attorneys, though he is not opposed to green card holders serving on juries. One minor crime should not trigger deportation, but a series of them might be enough, he said.

“If local law enforcement felt that someone was a danger, even if it wasn’t a major crime, they should be held accountable,” said Nolan, 75, who is white. “There’s a benefit in deporting them. I think our jails are too full already.”

As the great-grandson of Mexican immigrants, Ralph Guerrero did not have firsthand experience with the problems faced by immigrants without legal status. Then he met his wife, whose parents crossed the border from Mexico and lived in the United States illegally until receiving amnesty in 1986.

Guerrero, 35, an administrative assistant from Victorville, supports extending many privileges to immigrants who are in the country illegally, including driver’s licenses without distinguishing marks, admission to the bar and serving on a jury.

“This whole country is built off of immigration. Besides Native Americans, everybody is an immigrant,” said Guerrero, a Democrat. “More power to them. Let them come, and give them the opportunity for freedom, just like everyone else who’s stepped into this country.”

Whittier resident Susan B. Pasillas is among the 28% who identify themselves as Latino and oppose the new driving privileges for immigrants lacking legal status.

“If you’re here illegally in a country, I don’t see how you’re entitled to any kind of benefits,” said Pasillas, 55, a Republican who works for a packaging company and who traces part of her ancestry to Mexico.

Eric Lund, a maintenance technician from Crescent City, does not accept the argument that immigrants should get driver’s licenses because they drive anyway.

“To me that’s like saying people are going to murder, so why not make murder legal?” said Lund, 59, a Republican whose great-grandparents immigrated from Sweden. “It’s illegal. It’s right or wrong.”

But Pasillas and Lund say that some of the estimated 11 million immigrants who are in the country illegally should have a chance to become legal residents.

“I don’t think deportation is even possible,” Lund said. “They’re human beings. It’s very complicated.”

The new chair of the House of Representatives science committee has drafted a bill that, in effect, would replace peer review at the National Science Foundation (NSF) with a set of funding criteria chosen by Congress. For good measure, it would also set in motion a process to determine whether the same criteria should be adopted by every other federal science agency. The legislation, being worked up by Representative Lamar Smith (R-TX), represents the latest—and bluntest—attack on NSF by congressional Republicans seeking to halt what they believe is frivolous and wasteful research being funded in the social sciences. Last month, Senator Tom Coburn (R-OK) successfully attached language to a 2013 spending bill that prohibits NSF from funding any political science research for the rest of the fiscal year unless its director certifies that it pertains to economic development or national security. Smith's draft bill, called the ""High Quality Research Act,"" would apply similar language to NSF's entire research portfolio across all the disciplines that it supports.

Researchers know that human activities including fossil fuel use, agriculture and land use have been the dominant causes of increased concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere over the past 250 years. In addition, aerosols and land surface changes are also altering the Earth's climate, making it extremely likely1 that human activities have had a net warming effect since 17502. These human-caused changes to the climate system, and their consequences, provide much of the impetus for the National Science Foundation's (NSF) climate change research. Researchers funded by NSF have discovered signs of a changing climate in nearly every corner of the globe, from the icy expanses of Earth's polar regions to its equatorial ecosystems. Our planet's climate affects--and is affected by--the sky, land, ice, sea, life and the people found on it. To piece together the entire puzzle of climate change--what we know, what we still have to learn and what humankind can do to prepare for the future--we must study all of the physical, natural and human systems that contribute to and interact with Earth's climate system. As researchers piece together the climate puzzle, they are revolutionizing the way we understand the Earth system as a whole. Researchers have realized that they must reach across disciplinary boundaries to study questions that extend beyond any one field of science or engineering. In fact, because of the complexity of Earth's climate, this research involves contributions from nearly every field of science, math and engineering.

Republicans finally are doing something about the increasing conflict between science and their own political ideologies and beliefs. They're trying to stop such science from happening. As explained by Jeffrey Mervis of Science Magazine:Of course, the Republicans claim it's about cutting waste and duplicative research, and ensuring that the funded science has value. Because it's not scientists who would know what scientific research has value, it's Congress. Which is an interesting position for Republicans to take, given their supposed antipathy to government. Or maybe that antipathy is limited to government regulating the Republicans' corporate owners. But here's one clear area where Congressional Republicans might consider scientific research of little value:

The science proving human-caused climate change is overwhelming. Republicans overwhelmingly ignore and deny what the science proves. So, with scientific reality so consistently demonstrating a liberal bias, the Republicans are trying to legislate that science away."
http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2013/02/ex-san-diego-mayor-who-gambled-away-1-billion-remorseful.html,,[],Ex-San Diego mayor who gambled away $1 billion remorseful,"Maureen O'Connor was the first female mayor of San Diego. But when she left public life, she spent countless hours seated in front of video-poker machines, authorities said.

Over a nine-year period, she wagered an estimated $1 billion, including millions from a charity set up by her late husband, who founded Jack in the Box.

That was the portrait that emerged in court Thursday as the frail former mayor tearfully acknowledged she skimmed more than $2 million from a charity founded by her late husband, Robert O. Peterson.

O'Connor, 66, admitted in a plea deal that she had a gambling addiction and is nearly destitute. Her lawyer, prominent defense attorney Eugene Iredale, suggested that a brain tumor may have impaired her reasoning; he gave reporters copies of her brain scan from a 2011 surgery.

O'Connor's rapidly declining medical condition ""renders it highly improbable — if not impossible — that she could be brought to trial,"" according to court documents filed by federal prosecutors.

""This is a sad day for the city of San Diego,"" said Assistant U.S. Atty. Phillip Halpern. ""Maureen O'Connor was born and raised in this town. She rose from humble origins.... She dedicated much of her life, personal and professional, to improving this city.""

The $1-billion gambling binge stretched from 2000 to 2009, according to court documents. In 2008 and 2009, when the fortune she had inherited was not enough, she began taking from the R.P. Foundation to cover her losses.

Despite being ahead more than $1 billion at one point, O'Connor ""suffered even larger gambling losses,"" according to prosecutors. Her net loss, Iredale said, was about $13 million.

She was considered such a high roller that Las Vegas casinos would send a private jet to pick her up in San Diego. Records show that O'Connor won $100,000 at the Barona casino in San Diego County, while at roughly the same time she needed to cash a $100,000 check at the Bellagio in Las Vegas.

Those who knew the former political doyenne said she had become a recluse, inscrutable even to those she counted as friends.

""I considered myself one of her closest friends, but I would call her and she wouldn't return my call,"" said lawyer Louis Wolfsheimer. ""I didn't want anything from her, just to know how she was. But it looked like she was becoming reclusive.""

In a bargain with prosecutors, O'Connor agreed to repay $2,088,000 to the R.P. Foundation started by Peterson, which supported charities such as City of Hope, San Diego Hospice, and the Alzheimer's Assn., and was driven into insolvency in 2009 by O'Connor's misappropriation of funds, prosecutors said.

""I never meant to hurt the city,"" an emotional O'Connor told reporters gathered at a restaurant close to the federal courthouse. She promised to repay the foundation but declined to answer questions.

Prosecutors agreed to defer prosecution for two years. If O'Connor violates no further laws and makes restitution, the charge of making illegal financial transactions may be dismissed. Under the agreement, O'Connor acknowledged her guilt but was allowed to plead not guilty.

If convicted, O'Connor could have faced a maximum 10-year prison sentence and a fine of up to $250,000.

As part of her plea agreement, O'Connor agreed to settle ""all tax liability resulting from her receipt"" of money from the foundation. She also agreed to seek treatment for her gambling addiction.

Although she is currently without income or a bank account, O'Connor's economic status could reverse if she wins a civil lawsuit filed against a German bank involved in the 2005 purchase of a resort in Mendocino County that O'Connor had purchased in 1998.

O'Connor sold the Heritage House for $19.5 million but has alleged that she was the victim of fraud in the sale. A settlement or victory at trial could provide the millions needed to pay restitution to the foundation and also the tax liabilities involved with the misallocation of its funds.

""No figure, regardless of how much good they've done or how much they've given to charity, can escape criminal liability with impunity,"" said U.S. Atty. Laura Duffy.

One of O'Connor's major worries, defense attorney Iredale said, ""is fear of losing her reputation.""

President Barack Obama said media coverage could determine future of bipartisanship

Howard Kurtz: Fox News, Rush Limbaugh have influence, but White House has bigger voice

He says conservative media gained support because of belief established media leaned left

I never realized that the conservative media were so eye-poppingly powerful.

So mighty, in fact, that liberal politicians can't seem to stop talking about how they are running roughshod over the country.

My response: Can we please stop the whining?

Howard Kurtz

The latest to rant about the right is Al Gore. The former vice president told Charlie Rose that President Barack Obama had been cautious, and when the CBS anchor asked whether there was ""a very hostile environment for progressive ideas,"" Gore had his culprit ready:

""Fox News and right-wing talk radio. In Tennessee there's an old saying if you see a turtle on a fence post you can be pretty sure it didn't get there by itself. And the fact that we have 24/7 propaganda masquerading as news, it does have an impact.""

OK, Gore doesn't like Fox. So he started what he hoped would be a liberal counterweight in Current TV, spent millions on such stars as Keith Olbermann, and ... the channel flopped. It was such a failure that he just sold it to Al Jazeera for an estimated personal take of $100 million.

Leave aside the obvious contradiction of a climate change crusader selling to a network largely financed by the petrodollar kingdom of Qatar. Whatever you think of Fox, Rupert Murdoch's network has been a financial success and Current TV was anything but. Isn't that the free market at work?

Obama often invokes the conservative media, most recently in an interview with The New Republic. Asked about working with Republicans in his second term, the president said: ""One of the biggest factors is going to be how the media shapes debates. If a Republican member of Congress is not punished on Fox News or by Rush Limbaugh for working with a Democrat on a bill of common interest, then you'll see more of them doing it.""

Now it's true that Fox or Limbaugh can boost or batter any lawmaker, and that they can help drive a controversy into the broader mainstream media. But we're talking here about the president of the United States. He has an army, a navy and a bunch of nuclear weapons, not to mention an ability to command the airwaves at a moment's notice. And he's complaining about a cable channel and a radio talk-show host?

Limbaugh later offered this response: ""If Fox News and I are the only thing keeping the Republicans from caving to Barack Obama on every issue, I'm not paid enough.""

I have been through this before. It was on my ""Reliable Sources"" program, in the fall of 2009, that the White House declared war on Fox News. Anita Dunn, then the White House communications director, called Fox ""the communications arm of the Republican Party"" and said, ""It is not really a news network anymore.""

The resulting furor gave Fox months of fodder and was widely judged a tactical misstep that if anything elevated the network's role.

There are times when many Fox programs, including in the nonopinion hours, appear to be on a jihad against the administration. And these days, MSNBC can be counted on to defend the Democrats almost around the clock.

But let's face it: These are cable channels with relatively modest audiences, and their impact is sometimes exaggerated inside the Beltway echo chamber. After all, Obama handily won re-election despite the best efforts of Sean Hannity and Limbaugh.

What liberals sometimes forget is that the conservative media took root because many Americans felt the fourth estate was too left-wing. ABC, NBC, CBS, NPR, The New York Times and The Washington Post all strive for fairness, in my view, but there is little question that they have a social and cultural outlook that leans to the left. Collectively, they have far more weight than Fox, talk radio and The Wall Street Journal editorial page.

Right-wing pundits make a convenient foil, but at times Obama seems to magnify their importance. After all, he's got the biggest bully pulpit of all."

Their original story has been wiped from their website and replaced with one dripping with left-wing spin to the point you’d think it was a press release from the Obama campaign.

Unfortunately for the Times, there are a lot of websites that republish their work the minute it’s posted. That means it lives forever, even after they’ve killed it.

It’s unfortunate for them, but very fortunate for those of us who like to expose how media bias works.

The original piece contains this paragraph:

Romney told reporters Monday night that his remarks were “not elegantly stated” and were “spoken off the cuff.” But he says Obama’s approach is “attractive to people who are not paying taxes.”

In the new piece that paragraph reads like this:

Mr. Romney addressed the video, somewhat awkwardly, at a fund-raiser Monday night in Costa Mesa, Calif., summoning reporters with a few moments’ notice to walk through the Segerstrom Center for the Arts, which was filled with guests sipping drinks at tables elegantly draped in blue cloths.

The first one simply conveys facts, the second one adds commentary designed to paint a picture of bumbling with “somewhat awkwardly” and of elitism with “guests sipping drinks at tables elegantly draped in blue cloths.”

But it doesn’t end there.

The original reads:

Jim Messina, Obama’s campaign manager, said in a statement Monday evening that it was “shocking” that Romney would “go behind closed doors” to describe nearly half of the country in such terms.

Again, straightforward reporting. But the new version reads quite differently:

Mr. Romney, who has been under fire for releasing only two years of his tax returns, was quickly attacked by the Obama campaign. Jim Messina, Mr. Obama’s campaign manager, said in a statement Monday evening that it was “shocking” that Mr. Romney would “go behind closed doors” to describe nearly half of the country in such terms.

Weird how, in a story that has absolutely nothing to do with tax returns, the Times feels the need to editorialize about Romney’s tax returns. The only people “firing” at Romney for his tax returns are on the payroll of the Obama campaign and “journalists” who write things like this that read as if they’re padding their resume for a position in a second term.

The new version of the story has nearly double the words as the original and is full of editorializing of the sort listed above. The original reads like a news story.

In a tale of two stories, the former “new” version is committed to attacking Mitt Romney and reelected the President, the latter is simply committed to conveying facts. That’s probably why the former has been scrubbed from the Times‘ website and latter exists."

http://news.yahoo.com/andrew-johnson-worst-president-american-history-110208446.html,,[],Is Andrew Johnson the worst president in American history?,"Today marks the birthday of perhaps the most-maligned president in American history. But was Andrew Johnson really that bad, or just the target of some second-guessing historians?

Andrew Johnson’s impeachment trial.

Johnson was born on December 29, 1808 in North Carolina. He served in the Senate and the House and as governor, and then military governor, of Tennessee. It was when he was serving as military governor that Abraham Lincoln asked him to replace Hannibal Hamlin as vice president in the 1864 campaign. A Democrat, Johnson switched parties for the election.

Already an enigma because of his well-known independent streak and his earlier support of slavery, Johnson turned heads when he was apparently drunk at his own inauguration in 1865. (Another theory was that Johnson was ill and he hadn’t been known for drinking in public.)

Johnson suddenly found himself as president when Lincoln died just after starting his second term. His policies during Reconstruction were controversial and caused his newfound party to impeach him in 1868. Johnson kept his job by one vote in a Senate trial.

In his official biography on the White House website, Johnson’s term is summed up politely.

“Although an honest and honorable man, Andrew Johnson was one of the most unfortunate of presidents. Arrayed against him were the Radical Republicans in Congress, brilliantly led and ruthless in their tactics. Johnson was no match for them,” says a bio prepared by Michael Beschloss and Hugh Sidey.

Looking back at historians who have ranked Johnson (and other presidents) since 1948, he appears to be the one president who has suffered at the hands of revisionist history—either because more facts are available about his term, or because his place in the history of race relations has been re-evaluated.

In 1948, historian Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. ranked Johnson as a middle-of-the-pack president: a respected 19th out of 29 presidents.

Since then, some presidents have risen in the eyes of historians, like James K. Polk and Andrew Jackson.

Story continues

Andrew Johnson’s ratings have plummeted like a rock. In a recent 2010 Siena College survey, Johnson was called the worst president in history. A 2011 survey from a British academic institute ranked Johnson as 36th out of 40 presidents.

In general, two presidents who died early in their terms—William Henry Harrison and James Garfield—aren’t considered in presidential rankings.

Johnson has been tossed into the bottom rung of presidents, including James Buchanan (who served before Lincoln), Franklin Pierce (who preceded Buchanan), and Warren Harding.

Buchanan, Pierce, and Harding have always been considered really bad presidents by historians. Andrew Johnson has taken the place of Ulysses S. Grant, who has received an upgrade from “bad” to “mediocre” in recent years.

In Johnson’s case, Lincoln was a tough act to follow, and his failed role in obstructing much of the GOP’s Reconstruction plans was a tough pill for historians to swallow.

After becoming president, Johnson fought with his own Cabinet and party members over the scope of readmitting secessionist states and the voting rights of blacks.

Johnson favored a very lenient version of Reconstruction and state control over who could vote, according to their race. He also openly opposed the 14th Amendment.

Although Johnson had supported an end to slavery in the 1860s, he was a white supremacist. “This is a country for white men, and by God, as long as I am President, it shall be a government for white men,” he wrote in 1866.

In the end, the Radical Republicans won control over Reconstruction and Johnson became a pariah.

Johnson vetoed the Civil Rights Bill, but Congress overrode the veto in an unprecedented move.

Somehow, Johnson survived the impeachment trial, possibly because there was no vice president to replace him, and moderates feared Benjamin Wade, the Senate president pro tempore who would have replaced Johnson.

The Radical Republicans also eventually failed, and Reconstruction had ended within a decade. Racial discrimination continued on into the middle of the following century.

And not everyone is convinced Johnson was a one-dimensional figure.

Dr. Robert Orr, a historian in North Carolina, told a local newspaper in 2008 that “the modern hostility to Andrew Johnson, I believe, mostly comes from comments he made that are racially insensitive.”

Among historians today, James Buchanan is the one president who is consistently ranked as low as Johnson. Buchanan’s seeming indifference to the onset of the Civil War, and his own failings as a president, were monumental."

But as much as congressional Republicans are enjoying their schadenfreude, they would be well advised to think long and hard about their next steps. Even the most cursory look at opinion polls or focus groups reveals that the public is convinced we have an ineffectual and out-of-touch Congress that spends too much time backbiting, grandstanding, and Monday-morning quarterbacking while the country’s problems fester. Arguably, showboating for the cameras and holding hearings are what Congress does best; the temptation is unavoidable.

This is coming from same guy who on May 14th wrote a piece titled While Republicans Rant about Benghazi and IRS, Public Mostly Yawns "" indicating that poll numbers are showing the faux scandals to be having zero impact on President Obama.

Well, a journalist-pollster with integrity would leave the story at that, right? But no. In this day and age there is no such thing as simply reporting facts and leaving them be. Charlie Cook dispenses this ""advise"" to GOP for no other stated reason than to brign President Obama's poll numbers down just so history can be repeated.

If the facts don't fit your narrative, why, gin up your own ""facts""!!

The lowest week of Gallup polling thus far for Obama was 40 percent, occurring in August and October of 2011. Arguably, he is due for a dip, given that each of his modern predecessors has dropped into the 30s or below. Presidents Ford, Reagan, and Clinton each hit a low point of 37 percent. President George W. Bush’s low ebb was 31 percent; Nixon’s was 27 percent; Carter’s was 28 percent; and George H.W. Bush’s was 29 percent.

Charlie Cook is after all twiddling his thumbs waiting to see which ""scandals"" real or ginned up """" because "".""

Well, in Charlie Cook's warped mind that ""something"" can only be negative which must be induced to occur if it doesn't do so naturally. Yeah...

This is a more virulent version of the diatribe we heard last year in the run up to the 2012 elections, No President has been re-elected with Unemployment rates above 7%, then 8%, Enthusiasm gap, Obama 2008 coalition was a fluke, blah blah blah!

But reading that piece made me sick. As sequester takes it's horrible toll on many vulnerable people who've been rendered invisible; as GOP House votes to deny those same people access to healthcare (however imperfect it is); as the conservative movement rabidly tears our commonweal apart, our Journalists focus on meta, on inducing bloodsport so their little historical boxes can be ticked. Really, Charlie?...

This is the media cauldron within which Democrats are trying to govern these United States of America. PATHETIC!

A New York appeals court on Tuesday ruled that the city Board of Health exceeded its legal authority and acted unconstitutionally when it tried to put a size limit on soft drinks served in city restaurants.

""The Board of Health overstepped the boundaries of its lawfully delegated authority,"" the court said in its decision.

The state Supreme Court Appellate Division, with its opinion, upheld an earlier ruling that stopped the ban from taking effect in March. The rule would stop many eateries from selling non-diet soda and other sugar-laden beverages in containers bigger than 16 ounces.

The beverage industry and other opponents say the measure is riddled with exceptions, unfair and ineffective.

The city's law department has promised an appeal. ""Today's decision is a temporary setback, and we plan to appeal this decision as we continue the fight against the obesity epidemic,"" Mayor Michael Bloomberg said in a statement.

In its unanimous opinion, the four-judge panel said Tuesday that the health board was acting too much like a legislature when it created the limit. The judges wrote that while the board had the power to ban ""inherently harmful"" foodstuffs from being served to the public, sweetened beverages didn't fall into that category. They also said the board appeared to have crafted much of the new rules based on political or economic considerations, rather than health concerns.

New York's effort to cap soda portions has drawn national attention, whether from diet companies lauding it as a groundbreaking step in America's war on extra weight or from late-night TV hosts ribbing Bloomberg as a nutrition nanny.

The drinks limit follows other Bloomberg efforts to nudge New Yorkers into better diets. His administration has forced chain restaurants to post calorie counts on menus, barred artificial trans fats from restaurant fare and challenged food manufacturers to use less salt.

prev Image 2 of 2

A federal judge will seek to unravel an art mystery and determine the rightful owner of a napkin-sized painting by French impressionist Pierre-Auguste Renoir that a Virginia woman says she bought at a flea market for $7.

The ownership is in dispute after documents were uncovered showing a Baltimore museum reported the painting stolen more than 60 years ago.

The painting has been seized by the FBI, and the federal government filed an action last month in U.S. District Court in Alexandria asking a judge to determine who should keep the painting.

Among the contenders is a Lovettsville woman, Marcia ""Martha"" Fuqua, who has told the FBI that she bought the painting at a West Virginia flea market in late 2009 for $7 and stored it in a plastic trash bag for two years before having it authenticated as a genuine Renoir.

Last year, Fuqua planned to have the painting sold at auction, where it was expected to fetch at least $75,000. But the auction was postponed after it was learned that the Baltimore Museum of Art reported the painting stolen in 1951. Records show an insurer, the Fireman's Fund, paid a $2,500 claim on the theft.

The insurer says it is now the rightful owner, based on payment of that claim.

According to an appraisal commissioned by the FBI, Renoir painted ""Paysage bords de Seine,"" or On the Shore of the Seine, on a linen napkin in 1879 on the spot at a riverside restaurant for his mistress.

The appraiser says the Renoir's value is about $22,000, much less than the auction house estimated, because Renoir's paintings have fallen out of favor with some art collectors who consider them old fashioned and because questions about the painting's ownership and possible theft diminish its value to collectors.

Fuqua, who had managed to remain anonymous until the court case was filed, told the FBI under penalty of perjury that she bought the painting at a flea market in Harpers Ferry, W. Va., never believing the painting to be a true Renoir, even though a plate reading ""RENOIR"" is attached to the frame. She describes herself as an ""innocent buyer"" and questions the FBI's authority to seize the painting.

""Because I am not an art historian, collector, appraiser, or dealer, I lacked the expertise to identify the Renoir Painting's authenticity, origins or previous ownership history,"" she wrote.

On Friday, The Washington Post reported that Fuqua's 84-year-old mother, who operated an art school for decades in Fairfax County under the name Marcia Fouquet, is an artist who specialized in reproducing paintings from Renoir and other masters. The Post said Fouquet had artistic links to Baltimore in the 1950s, when the painting was stolen, and graduated from Goucher College with a fine arts degree in 1952.

A man who identified himself as Fuqua's brother, Owen M. Fuqua, told the Post that the painting had been in the family for 50 or 60 years and that ""all I know is my sister didn't just go buy it at a flea market.""

The man later retracted his story, and ultimately said it was another person using his name who gave the initial interview.

Efforts by the AP Friday to reach Martha and Owen Fuqua Friday were unsuccessful. Martha Fuqua's lawyer did not return a call Friday seeking comment.

The FBI has an ongoing investigation, according to spokeswoman Lindsay Godwin.

Meanwhile, U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema ordered all parties seeking to claim ownership of the painting to make their case in written pleadings later this month."

Lawmakers hit the Sunday morning talk shows days before a possible government default

GOP Sens. Graham and Paul criticize Democrats%27 proposal

Sens. Collins and Klobuchar believe a compromise is possible

WASHINGTON — After several days of on again-off again negotiations at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, the fiscal crisis gripping Washington now hangs on whether two men can broker a deal: The Senate Republican and Democratic leaders.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., closed Sunday's Senate session saying he was ""optimistic"" that talks he has been having with Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., can lead to an end of the federal government shutdown and an increase in the nation's debt limit.

Many in the Capitol are looking to the talks between Reid and McConnell as the last, best hope for a deal after the House of Representatives abandoned talks Saturday morning. The two met Saturday, and Reid said they would continue talking throughout the day Sunday to seek a resolution.

""Americans want Congress to do its job. … That's all they're asking us to do,"" Reid said. ""I'm confident and hopeful that will be accomplished.""

McConnell could be the one to cut a deal, according to Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn.

""Republicans are very unified behind McConnell,"" Corker said. ""We probably have one or two outliers, but other than that, people are really unified behind him taking the lead on these negotiations.""

Reid and Corker's optimism, however, didn't seem universally shared. Two Republican senators said a deal to end the partial government shutdown and raise the debt limit to avoid default appears unlikely.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said on ABC's This Week that a Democratic proposal to increase spending beyond limits set by automatic budget cuts — known as sequestration -- cannot be supported by Republicans.

He doesn't anticipate a deal by the Oct. 17 deadline, when the nation's debt limit kicks in.

""I don't see one,"" Graham said. ""If you break spending caps, you're not going to get any Republicans in the Senate.""

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., agreed, saying on CNN's State of the Union that exceeding the sequestration limits is ""a real big step in the wrong direction.""

Some top Democrats were just as pessimistic.

David Plouffe, a former senior adviser to President Obama, said the nation is dangerously close to default. ""I think the notion that somehow this is going to be easily solved this week is completely false,"" Plouffe said on This Week.

Plouffe put the odds of a deal by Thursday at ""no better than 50/50. And so I think the country needs to prepare that this could go on for a while.""

However, Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., said a compromise was possible.

Collins, whose proposal to end the standoff was rejected Saturday by Reid, said on CNN that talks continue between Republican and Democrats.

""We're continuing to talk,"" Collins said. ""And I'm still hopeful that at least we sparked a dialogue that did not exist before we put out a plan.""

Klobuchar, also appearing on CNN, said the Collins' plan has jump-started negotiations.

""I see this as a positive framework going forward,"" Klobuchar said. ""And we need that right now.""

Collins' plan would extend the debt ceiling to January and reopen the government through March, as well as delay an unpopular tax on medical devices under the Affordable Care Act.

Coming somewhere in between the dire and dream of a deal was Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. Appearing on CBS' Face the Nation, McCain said he was encouraged that negotiations continued, but he warned Democrats, who he suggested hold the upper hand, not to ""humiliate"" Republicans.

""We should be sitting down,"" McCain said. ""And the president should be engaged. And the Democrats, they better understand something. What goes around comes around. And if they try to humiliate Republicans, things change in American politics. And I know what it's like to be in the majority and in the minority. And it won't be forgotten. Now's the time to be magnanimous and sit down and get this thing done."""

Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli II on Wednesday condemned an anti-Semitic joke told by a Republican activist who spoke before him at a rally this week.

“I wasn’t there, but I heard about it that night, and, obviously, I think it was inappropriate and certainly unfortunate and something, if I’d heard it at the time, I’d have spoken to right there,” Cuccinelli, the Republican nominee for Virginia governor, told reporters after a candidates’ forum in Richmond on Wednesday morning.

But the incident put a spotlight on a GOP organizer who has close ties to Cuccinelli and who has helped steer the state party to the right this year.

John Whitbeck, the chairman of Virginia’s 10th Congressional District Republican Committee, is one of a half-dozen district leaders who pushed for a nominating convention over a primary this year. The move all but assured that Cuccinelli would win the nomination over Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling because conservative activists are more likely to attend a convention.

Whitbeck was also among those who took the dais to formally nominate Cuccinelli at the May convention.

At a rally Tuesday in Sterling, attended by Cuccinelli and conservative talk radio host Mark Levin, Whitbeck warmed up the crowd with a joke that made use of a stereotype about Jews. He described “the head of the Jewish faith” as presenting the pope with “the bill for the Last Supper.”

Democrats pounced on the chance to assail Cuccinelli for the company he keeps. Cuccinelli’s top strategist, Chris LaCivita, initially remarked, “I don’t even know who that guy is,” but he later said he did not mean to suggest that Cuccinelli and Whitbeck don’t know each other.

Cuccinelli, who is in a hard-fought race against Democrat Terry McAuliffe, was asked Wednesday if he knew about Whitbeck’s joke when he took the stage a few moments after it was delivered. He replied, “I didn’t know about it until last night.”

Whitbeck, a Leesburg lawyer, ran unsuccessfully in 2011 for the state House seat now held by Del. J. Randall Minchew (R-Loudoun). Until this week, Whitbeck was also seen as a leading candidate to run for state Sen. Mark R. Herring’s (D-Loudoun) seat if Herring is elected to succeed Cuccinelli as attorney general.

Asked about the joke at the Sterling event, Whitbeck said: “I heard it in church one day. The priest told it one day. I was at Mass. It was my daughter’s first day at Communion, I think. I thought, you know, I gotta do something, so I ran up there and told my story.”

Whitbeck has not responded to subsequent requests for comment on the reaction to his joke. He told the Loudoun Times-Mirror on Wednesday: “I did not tell an anti-Semitic joke. I told a joke I heard from a priest at a church service,” and then he said the controversy had been “wholly manufactured” by liberal groups.

Others defended Whitbeck and suggested that the joke was told in a moment of poor judgment.

“I’ve always known John to be a good-natured individual that people appreciate and who is a hard worker,” said Beau Correll, a member of the 10th Congressional District Republican Committee.

Not just Democrats and liberal groups have been critical of the remarks.

“It is not funny,” said Bobbie Kilberg, the president and chief executive of the Northern Virginia Technology Council and an active player in state Republican politics. Kilberg is Jewish. “It is totally inappropriate, and it is offensive. I conveyed that to him in an e-mail last night. I have not heard back.”

Ronald Halber, executive director of the Jewish Community Relations Council, also took Whitbeck to task.

“Clearly, it was inappropriate and an offensive remark,” said Halber, whose nonpartisan group represents more than 100 Jewish organizations in the Washington area. “It really has no place in civil discourse. It shows really bad judgment. I don’t understand why Mr. Whitbeck thought that picking fun or making stereotypes about a certain group would be a good opening act when [someone’s] running for governor.”

But Halber also praised the Cuccinellli campaign’s quick response.

“We are very appreciative that Ken Cuccinelli’s campaign denounced it right away after it happened,” Halber said. “That’s a good thing.”

The move to hold a convention that Whitbeck was a part of was seen as a turning point for the state Republican Party, a key victory in an internal battle between conservatives and moderates for control of the party.

But the switch to a convention also led to the selection of Chesapeake minister E.W. Jackson as the nominee for lieutenant governor. Jackson, who won an upset victory over six other candidates at the convention in Richmond, is popular with grass-roots conservatives but has a history of controversial comments about gays and abortion, among other subjects.

Story highlights Jackie Speier: If you commit sexual assault in the military, you'll probably get away with it Speier: Service members who report attack face ridicule, demotion, refusal to be heard Sex assault scandal at Lackland base shows how trainees are preyed upon, she says Speier wants sex assault cases tried in impartial military office to ensure justice

Editor’s Note: Democratic U.S. Rep. Jackie Speier represents the 12th District of California. She is also the honorary chair of Protect Our Defenders, an organization that supports women and men in uniform who have been raped or sexually assaulted by fellow service members. Those who wish to share their stories can do so at Protect Our Defenders. Watch Rep. Speier talk about the issue with Carol Costello on CNN Newsroom on Thursday in the 9 a.m. hour.

(CNN) —

If you serve in the U.S. military and you rape or sexually assault a fellow service member, chances are you won’t be punished. In fact, you have an estimated 86.5% chance of keeping your crime a secret and a 92% chance of avoiding a court-martial.

These disturbing statistics illustrate an ongoing epidemic of rape and sexual assault in the military that Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta believes amounted to 19,000 incidents just in 2010. A culture of acceptance combined with few prosecutions against assailants and the conflicted chain of command structure discourages victims from reporting crimes.

Service members who report being sexually assaulted by a commanding officer or military colleague do so at their own peril. They face ridicule, demotion, investigation that includes a review of their sexual history and even involuntary discharge.

Betrayal of Trust? Allegations of rape at West Point, Annapolis

In 2006, when Marine Lt. Elle Helmer reported to her commander that a superior officer assaulted and raped her the night before, her colonel discouraged her from obtaining a rape kit. In spite of his objections, she sought a thorough medical investigation.

Helmer appealed to her rapist’s supervisor, who still refused to press charges or significantly punish the assailant. He said, “You’re from Colorado – you’re tough. You need to pick yourself up and dust yourself off. … I can’t babysit you all of the time.”

Rape victims say military labels them ‘crazy’

Jackie Speier

Instead of Helmer’s attacker being prosecuted, she became the subject of investigation and prosecution. She was ultimately forced to leave the Marine Corps. Her rapist remains a Marine in good standing.

Elle’s story is featured in the documentary “The Invisible War,” which will be screened in five major cities for a week, starting Friday.

The powerful film includes interviews with former U.S. service men and women who were raped by co-workers or superior officers. The survivors explain that they felt the greatest betrayal was from the military itself and the conflicted chain of command structure that did not protect them from avoidable harm or support their need for justice.

Victim testimony from a widespread and ongoing sex scandal at Lackland Air Force base in San Antonio, Texas, sheds light on another tragic component of the epidemic: Service members are trained to follow the orders of all superior officers, no matter what.

Two of the women who have come forward were called over an intercom shortly after they graduated from basic training and asked to leave their dorm to meet their instructors, an unusual order. The victims told a military court that they were lured to a dark supply room where two instructors engaged them in sexual acts.

“I didn’t know what to think or what to do,” one woman, an airman first class, said when a prosecutor asked what she was thinking as her training instructor performed oral sex on her.

Female service members sue U.S. military for alleged rape, sexual assault

“I was frozen,” she said. Thirty-five instructors have been removed from their jobs during the past year at Lackland, but the military refuses to disclose how many are accused of sexual assault. We know that four military training instructors have already been charged with sexual misconduct with at least 24 trainees. One of the instructors is charged with having sexual contact with 10 women, including sodomy and rape.

Another, Staff Sgt. Peter Vega-Maldonado, admitted in a plea bargain to having sex with one woman. His punishment is 90 days in jail, 30 days of hard labor, reduction in rank and forfeiture of $500 a month in pay for four months. He will be forced to leave the Air Force but without a bad-conduct discharge.

After striking this deal with prosecutors, Vega testified that he actually had improper contact with 10 trainees. He is not immune to further prosecution, but his admission of guilt cannot be used against him in future procedures. Each victim will have to come forward, and the prosecution will have to start from scratch.

I have called for a congressional hearing to investigate the systemic abuse of power at Lackland Air Force Base.

It is clear that the inherent conflicts within the chain of command structure are at the core of the epidemic of military rape and sexual assault.

Last fall, I introduced bipartisan legislation that would create a path to justice for service men and women who are victims of rape or sexual assault. H.R. 3435, the Sexual Assault Training Oversight and Prevention Act (STOP Act), has 125 co-sponsors. It would take these cases out of the normal chain of command and place the jurisdiction, still within the military, in the hands of an impartial office staffed by experts – both military and civilian.

Right now, it is far too easy for a sexual predator in the military to rape or sexually assault a fellow service member and get away with it. Until these crimes are taken seriously and assailants are punished as the felons they are, the epidemic will continue.

Victims of military rape deserve justice

We should not have to hear another story like Elle Helmer’s, watch another movie like “The Invisible War,” and have to investigate yet another scandal like the one at Lackland Air Force Base.

In the words of Defense Secretary Panetta, “One assault is one too many.”

Assembly Bill 10 would increase the state's minimum wage for the first time in six years. It passed the Assembly Labor and Employment Committee on a party-line vote, with majority Democrats in support.

""This bill goes to the heart of economic security,"" testified Mitch Seaman of the California Labor Federation. ""For workers, the minimum wage is all that's keeping you from sinking further down as the economy moves on without you.""

Eighteen states have a minimum wage above the federal level of $7.25 an hour, led by Washington at $9.19 an hour and then Oregon at $8.95. Ten of those states provide for annual, inflation-adjusted increases.

California's wage ranks fifth-highest in the country and also trails the minimum required in Vermont and Nevada, although employers in Nevada can pay $1 an hour less than their state's $8.25 minimum if they provide health insurance benefits to workers.

The California bill, which now advances to the Assembly floor, would raise the minimum wage to $8.25 in 2014, $8.75 in 2015 and $9.25 in 2016. Each year after, it would go up based on the annual increase in the Consumer Price Index.

The bill is opposed by all the state's major employer organizations, including the California Restaurant Association, Western Growers Association, California Grocers Association and state chapter of the National Federation of Independent Businesses.

Another opponent, the California Chamber of Commerce, has placed the bill on its annual ""job killer"" list, which includes legislation it most aggressively seeks to defeat.

Matt Sutton of the restaurant association said an increase in the minimum wage would benefit only its employees who earn tips, as the added cost would force operators to hold down wages for hourly employees to absorb the mandated increases for tipped workers.

""A minimum-wage increase is going to do nothing but harm my business,"" testified Joe Thompson, a Sacramento restaurant operator.

Assemblyman Luis Alejo, D-Salinas, the bill's author, countered that no evidence shows that higher minimum wages have done economic harm in Oregon or in San Francisco, which has a citywide minimum of $10.24.

""There's been no adverse impact to jobs,"" he said.

Alejo said the state's failure to increase its minimum wage for six years has led communities to begin taking matters into their own hands. In addition to San Francisco, San Jose implemented a $10 per hour minimum wage last month, and Sacramento is considering similar action.

Assemblyman Jimmy Gomez, D-Los Angeles, said that his parents worked ""four to five jobs a week"" to make ends meet and always impressed upon their children the importance of having a job to avoid becoming a burden on the government.

That philosophy falls apart when a job pays so little that it does not ""fulfill its purpose"" of allowing workers to get by without government subsidies or programs, he said.

Assemblyman Jeff Gorell, R-Camarillo, is the only legislator on the committee who represents any part of Ventura County. He cast one of the two no votes on the measure.

Johnson is a former high-ranking Pentagon official who was key in the repeal of ""don't ask, don't tell.""

Below, more from the AP:

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama has chosen former Pentagon lawyer Jeh (jay) Johnson as the new secretary of the Homeland Security Department.

Obama plans to announce Johnson's nomination Friday. He must be confirmed by the Senate before taking over the post most recently held by Janet Napolitano (neh-pahl-ih-TAN'-oh). Napolitano stepped down in August to become president of the University of California system.

A senior administration official on Thursday confirmed Johnson's selection, first reported by The Daily Beast. The official said Obama chose Johnson because of his experience as a national security leader.

The official was not authorized to speak about the nomination on the record and spoke on condition of anonymity.

Misunderstanding, misstatements and all the classic contortions of partisan message management surround the sequester, the term for the $85 billion in ugly and largely irrational federal spending cuts set by law to begin Friday.

What is the non-budget wonk to make of this? Who is responsible? What really happened?

The finger-pointing began during the third presidential debate last fall, on Oct. 22, when President Obama blamed Congress. “The sequester is not something that I’ve proposed,” Obama said. “It is something that Congress has proposed.”

The White House chief of staff at the time, Jack Lew, who had been budget director during the negotiations that set up the sequester in 2011, backed up the president two days later.

“There was an insistence on the part of Republicans in Congress for there to be some automatic trigger,” Lew said while campaigning in Florida. It “was very much rooted in the Republican congressional insistence that there be an automatic measure.”

The president and Lew had this wrong. My extensive reporting for my book “The Price of Politics” shows that the automatic spending cuts were initiated by the White House and were the brainchild of Lew and White House congressional relations chief Rob Nabors — probably the foremost experts on budget issues in the senior ranks of the federal government.

Obama personally approved of the plan for Lew and Nabors to propose the sequester to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.). They did so at 2:30 p.m. July 27, 2011, according to interviews with two senior White House aides who were directly involved.

Nabors has told others that they checked with the president before going to see Reid. A mandatory sequester was the only action-forcing mechanism they could devise. Nabors has said, “We didn’t actually think it would be that hard to convince them” — Reid and the Republicans — to adopt the sequester. “It really was the only thing we had. There was not a lot of other options left on the table.”

A majority of Republicans did vote for the Budget Control Act that summer, which included the sequester. Key Republican staffers said they didn’t even initially know what a sequester was — because the concept stemmed from the budget wars of the 1980s, when they were not in government.

At the Feb. 13 Senate Finance Committee hearing on Lew’s nomination to become Treasury secretary, Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) asked Lew about the account in my book: “Woodward credits you with originating the plan for sequestration. Was he right or wrong?”

“It’s a little more complicated than that,” Lew responded, “and even in his account, it was a little more complicated than that. We were in a negotiation where the failure would have meant the default of the government of the United States.”

One is to avoid the $1.2 trillion in spending cuts included in sequestration and another is raising the country’s debt ceiling. Here is a look at some of the issues involved in these two fiscal challenges. Sequester If Congress and Obama can’t reach a deal to avoid sequestration, then the country would see budget cuts of $1.2 trillion through 2021. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has said that the defense cuts would be a “disaster.” But if you look at this graph, the blow isn't as bad as the military has faced in the past. Even if the sequestration was implemented, the drop in spending would be less than the military experienced after the Korean, Vietnam or Cold wars. The Center for Strategic and International Studies Wait 1 second to continue.

“Did you make the suggestion?” Burr asked.

“Well, what I did was said that with all other options closed, we needed to look for an option where we could agree on how to resolve our differences. And we went back to the 1984 plan that Senator [Phil] Gramm and Senator [Warren] Rudman worked on and said that that would be a basis for having a consequence that would be so unacceptable to everyone that we would be able to get action.”

In other words, yes.

But then Burr asked about the president’s statement during the presidential debate, that the Republicans originated it.

Lew, being a good lawyer and a loyal presidential adviser, then shifted to denial mode: “Senator, the demand for an enforcement mechanism was not something that the administration was pushing at that moment.”

That statement was not accurate.

On Tuesday, Obama appeared at the White House with a group of police officers and firefighters to denounce the sequester as a “meat-cleaver approach” that would jeopardize military readiness and investments in education, energy and readiness. He also said it would cost jobs. But, the president said, the substitute would have to include new revenue through tax reform.

At noon that same day, White House press secretary Jay Carney shifted position and accepted sequester paternity.

“The sequester was something that was discussed,” Carney said. Walking back the earlier statements, he added carefully, “and as has been reported, it was an idea that the White House put forward.”

This was an acknowledgment that the president and Lew had been wrong.

Why does this matter?

First, months of White House dissembling further eroded any semblance of trust between Obama and congressional Republicans. (The Republicans are by no means blameless and have had their own episodes of denial and bald-faced message management.)

Second, Lew testified during his confirmation hearing that the Republicans would not go along with new revenue in the portion of the deficit-reduction plan that became the sequester. Reinforcing Lew’s point, a senior White House official said Friday, “The sequester was an option we were forced to take because the Republicans would not do tax increases.”

In fact, the final deal reached between Vice President Biden and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) in 2011 included an agreement that there would be no tax increases in the sequester in exchange for what the president was insisting on: an agreement that the nation’s debt ceiling would be increased for 18 months, so Obama would not have to go through another such negotiation in 2012, when he was running for reelection.

So when the president asks that a substitute for the sequester include not just spending cuts but also new revenue, he is moving the goal posts. His call for a balanced approach is reasonable, and he makes a strong case that those in the top income brackets could and should pay more. But that was not the deal he made."

Separately, Mr. Young has also been accused of taking hunting trips between 2001 and 2007, paid for by some outside party, that were not reported in financial disclosure reports that are required to be filed with Congress.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation had previously examined these allegations, concluding that any wrongdoing did not merit criminal charges. But it did refer its findings to the Ethics Committee, hinting that it believed Mr. Young may at least have broken House rules.

A spokesman for Mr. Young, who has served as Alaska’s only House member since 1973, said Tuesday that he “has cooperated with the committee and will continue to do so.” A spokesman for the Ethics Committee, which had begun its own investigation even before the F.B.I. referral, would not say if the ethics review touched on other possible improper actions by Mr. Young.

The investigation into Mr. Andrews, who has served in the House since 1990, relates to his use of campaign money to pay for personal trips to Scotland and Los Angeles in 2011, and for a party for his daughter’s graduation in June 2011, among other possible abuses, according to an initial review of the matter by the Office of Congressional Ethics, which referred its findings to the Ethics Committee last year.

Records turned up during the initial investigation show that Mr. Andrews used $16,574 from his political action committee to buy four business-class plane tickets for himself, his wife and his two daughters to attend a wedding in Scotland."

President Obama asked Holder last week to investigate the matter involving Fox reporter James Rosen, who in 2009 was reporting on North Korea’s efforts to acquire a nuclear weapon.



Holder “signed off on the affidavit,” Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, told “Fox News Sunday.” “This would be a good time for a special counsel or independent counsel. ... This is clearly an overreach.”



The Justice Department search warrant stated investigators had probable cause to think Rosen had violated the federal Espionage Act and that he might have aided or abetted others or was a co-conspirator.



“James Rosen is a lot of things, but not a criminal co-conspirator,” Graham said.



The disparity about whether the Justice Department contacted Fox News about the investigation became more clear this weekend when an official for Fox News said parent company News Corp. was notified by letter in 2010 about an investigation. But Fox News was not directly notified, and the letter was never passed down to the network. Email was not included in that notification.

""While we don't take issue with the DOJ's account that they sent a notice to News Corp, we do not have a record of ever having received it,"" said a News Corp. spokesperson. ""We are looking into this matter.""

Holder has already recused himself from an investigation into the Justice Department looking into the phone records of the Associated Press, related to a May 2012 story that included information about a foiled plot in Yemen to bomb a U.S.-bound airliner.



That Holder approved the Justice Department searches appears to contradict earlier statements before Congress in which he said accessing reporters’ phone logs was “not something I’ve ever been involved in, nor would I think is a wise policy.”



Graham also called for a special counsel to investigate the IRS flagging Tea Party groups and other politically conservative-leaning organizations seeking tax-exempt status.

Later on the show, Illinois Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin disagreed with Graham, following most congressional Democrats and Republicans who want more time for their own investigations and point out a special prosecutor would be appointed by the Justice Department.

""I heard Senator Graham call for special counsel,” said Durbin, the Senate assistant majority leader. “I'm not ready to do this at this point. I'd like to know if Holder has any conflict in here beyond what we've heard when it comes to the Fox case.”

Last week, Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Richard Neal was among those who argued against having a special prosecutor.

""The history of Congress with special prosecutors has not worked very well,"" he said. ""The history of it with Congress is that it went well beyond what was fully intended. The investigations really became endless and boundless, and that's the imminent danger here."""

After Barack Obama’s speech and Marco Rubio’s rebuttal, we should have heard from Kim Peters.

The 47-year-old single mother, who has been more or less unemployed since the start of the Great Recession, wore fuzzy Shrek slippers as she watched the president’s State of the Union address Tuesday night from the middle of an empty living room south of Atlanta.

If the country and the president could have peered back at her through her small TV, they would have seen the piles of black trash bags, full of clothes, in the corners of the room. They haven’t been unpacked since she was evicted from her last apartment. They would have seen the worry in her eyes – felt the panic that wakes her up at 3 a.m. and makes her wonder how long it will be before she and her 7-year-old daughter end up homeless. Full story

Granderson: Rubio must have missed the year of the woman

ESPN LZ Granderson, who writes a weekly column for CNN.com, is a senior writer and columnist for ESPN the Magazine and ESPN.com

You would think that in the shadow of a general election dubbed “Year of the Woman,” the last thing any Republican in Washington would want to do is tick off women.

And while the Violence Against Women Act passed in the Senate by a healthy bipartisan majority a few hours before President Obama’s State of the Union address, the fact that 22 senators – all Republicans, all men – voted against it should be troubling to GOP leaders.

And perhaps the most troubling aspect of that is Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, the so-called savior of the Republican Party, was one of those Republican men.

Just think: A few hours before Rubio was to deliver a message reflecting a new Republican Party, he casts a vote that screams more of the same. Full story

Welch: Obama’s ‘do-something’ plan for ‘have-nothing’ government

Matt Welch is editor-in-chief of Reason and co-author of ""The Declaration of Independents: How Libertarian Politics Can Fix What's Wrong With America.""

The two most memorable lines of President Barack Obama’s fourth State of the Union address were the ad-libbed: “Get it done” (which doesn’t appear in the remarks as prepared), and the emotional “They deserve a vote,” concerning victims of gun violence.

As exasperated appeals for an obstructionist Congress to get off its duff, the exhortations provided emotional catnip for Democrats. For the rest of us, however, they were sobering reminders of what governing liberalism has deteriorated into: content-free calls to take action for action’s sake.

Consumers of national governance are within their rights to ask just what we’ve gotten in return for ballooning the cost of the stuff since 2000. The answer may lie in not just what the president said, but what he has assumed we’ve already forgotten. Full story

It is sometimes said of a great actor that he could hold an audience spellbound while reading a laundry list. This is essentially what President Obama tried to do on Tuesday night. As State of the Union addresses go, his was artless. It lacked inspired phrases or compelling narrative. Save for the energy he gave it at key moments, it was pedestrian.

It was also very important.

It was important because with it, Obama returned in earnest to the work of governing. Having won a clear victory in November, and having spent the intervening months putting out the wildfires our Congress likes to set, he delivered word Tuesday night that he had a clear and full agenda for his second term.

Slaughter: Obama dares Congress to get the job done

Anne-Marie Slaughter is a former director of policy planning in the U.S. State Department and a professor of politics and international affairs at Princeton University.

The hallmark of the 2013 State of the Union address was progressive pragmatism.

Time and again, President Obama punctuated his proposals with the refrain: “We should be able to get that done.” After his call for “bipartisan, comprehensive tax reform that encourages job creation and helps bring down the deficit,” he said: “We can get this done,” and later, “That’s what we can do together.”

When he proposed the addition of three more urban manufacturing hubs and asked Congress “to help create a network of 15 of these hubs and guarantee that the next revolution in manufacturing is made right here in America,” he added: “We can get that done.” Full story

Coleman: Where was the foreign policy?

Council on Foreign Relations Isobel Coleman is the author of ""Paradise Beneath Her Feet"" and a senior fellow for U.S. foreign policy at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.

President Obama’s State of the Union address predictably focused on his domestic priorities.

Immigration reform, a laundry list of economic initiatives including infrastructure improvements (Fix it First), clean energy, some manufacturing innovation, a bit of educational reform and the rhetorical high point of his speech – gun control.

As in years past, foreign policy made up only about 15% of the speech, but even within that usual limited attention, Tuesday night’s address pointed to few new directions.

On Afghanistan – America’s longest war – Obama expressed just a continued commitment to bringing the troops home, ending “our war” while theirs continues. On Iran, there was a single sentence reiterating the need for a diplomatic solution, which makes me think that a big diplomatic push is not likely. Full story

USATODAY

New laws include retail marijuana sales in Colorado

Minimum wage increases take effect in 13 states

Connecticut has some new gun-control laws in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook massacre

If you're a pale 17-year-old in Illinois, get your indoor tanning sessions in now. Starting Wednesday, they're strictly forbidden.

A new state law takes effect Jan. 1 that bans anyone under 18 from using tanning salons in the Land of Lincoln. Illinois becomes the sixth state to keep teens out of the facilities, part of a growing trend of regulating tanning facilities to help reduce the risk of skin cancer, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL), a Denver-based group that tracks lawmaking.

The new measure is one of an estimated 40,000 new laws, regulations and resolutions approved by state legislatures in 2013, many of which take effect Jan. 1. Among them:

• Arkansas voters must now show a photo ID at polling places, while Virginia voters for the first time will be able to register online.

• In Colorado, 16-year-olds will be able to pre-register to vote, but must still wait until they're 18 to vote.

• California students must be allowed to play school sports and use school bathrooms ""consistent with their gender identity,"" regardless of their birth identity.

• In Oregon, new mothers will now be able to take their placentas home from the hospital — some experts say ingesting it has positive health benefits. Another new state law bans smoking in motor vehicles when children are present.

Minimum-wage increases take effect in four northeastern states: Connecticut's rises to $8.70 an hour; New Jersey's to $8.25; and New York's and Rhode Island's to $8. In nine other states, the minimum wage rises automatically because it's indexed to inflation.

Perhaps most significantly, Colorado adults age 21 or older will be able on Wednesday to buy up to an ounce of marijuana for recreational use from a state-licensed retail store. Marijuana advocates expect many of the new stores to be up and running by then, and observers say the new Colorado regulations are a sign of things to come.

""I think state legislatures will be faced with the marijuana issue"" in 2014, says Jane Carroll Andrade, NCSL's spokeswoman.

In Washington state, regulators are combing through more than 2,000 applications for similar stores after voters approved a similar measure in 2012, says Paul Armentano, deputy director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML). He expects the first Washington stores to open in a few months.

""Other states are watching Colorado and Washington because it will continue to come up,"" Andrade says.

Armentano, who likens these developments to the state-led reversal of Prohibition in the 1930s, says a dozen states are due to debate marijuana legalization measures in the coming year or so. ""The genie's out of the bottle and it's simply not going back in.""

Many new state laws take effect 90 days after they're signed, but a few states, like California, Colorado, Illinois and Oregon, get extra attention this time of year because traditionally many laws in these states take effect on Jan. 1.

As a result, life changes a bit more radically for Illinois residents each new year: On Wednesday, in addition to the tanning measure, they'll find that they can now return a pet or be reimbursed for veterinary costs if an illness was not disclosed by the seller. So-called ""lemon pets"" laws already exist in 21 states, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association.

Also in Illinois: Anyone who flicks a cigarette butt on a street or sidewalk could be fined at least $50 for littering; police must receive training on the psychological and physiological effects of stun guns, and penalties are now tougher for inciting a violent flash mob or riot via social media.

Illinois also becomes the 13th state to prohibit handheld cellphones while driving. Meanwhile, school districts on Jan. 1 will be able to install cameras on school buses to photograph drivers who pass them when buses are stopped. And school-based sex education must include information about both abstinence and contraception.

Illinois is also home to tough new laws prohibiting unmanned aerial drones. Come Wednesday, it'll be illegal to use a drone to interfere with hunters or fishermen — and police must get a warrant to use a drone for surveillance, except in cases of terrorism or if a suspect is fleeing a crime scene. Even with the warrant, police must destroy information gathered within 30 days unless it's linked to a crime, says Ed Yohnka of the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois.

Lawmakers in both parties overwhelmingly passed the new surveillance prohibition, he says. ""They understood that it was something that could occur in the relatively near future, and so there was a desire to get on top of it.""
