Mr. Obama, dressed in shirt sleeves, was showered with cheers by the visibly energized students and a cadre of New York politicians as he took the podium at Pathways in Technology Early College High School. “Hello Brooklyn,” he said, before starting into his argument for creating more schools like the one he was visiting, casting them as essential in preparing the next generation for competition in a shrinking world marketplace.

“This country should be doing everything in our power to give more kids the chance to go to schools just like this one,” the president said, calling the school, known as P-Tech, a ticket into the middle class.

“In previous generations, America’s standing economically was so much higher than everybody else’s that we didn’t have a lot of competition,” he added. “Now, you’ve got billions of people from Beijing to Bangalore to Moscow, all of whom are competing with you directly. And they’re — those countries are working every day, to out-educate and outcompete us.”"

USA TODAY Collegiate Correspondent

Donya Nasser thought she had maxed out on federal student loans going into her freshman year of college. Unaware that her mother was eligible for a federal Parent PLUS loan, Nasser took out a private loan for $14,000.

""We ended up getting a private loan because we just didn't understand the process, because my mom hadn't gone to college before,"" says Nasser, a junior at St. John's University.

Nasser learned a year later that her mother could have taken out a federal Parent PLUS loan at a much lower interest rate, a miscommunication that will likely cost her thousands of dollars.

The Department of Education is launching a new initiative this fall to help students like Nasser avoid those types of missteps. In this case, the Obama administration will be focusing on the other end of the process: repayment.

The department will soon begin proactively reaching out to struggling student borrowers to make them aware of the various federal repayment and forgiveness programs available to them.

""Even as we work to bring down costs for current and future students, we have got to offer students who already have debt the chance to actually repay it,"" President Obama said during a speech at the University of Buffalo in August, when he announced an array of policy initiatives to lower the cost of college.

There are currently about 1.6 million students enrolled in income-based repayment programs, which allow borrowers to pay back their loans as a percentage of their disposable income. At the same time, 2.1 million borrowers are in default, many of which might have been eligible for a federal program.

""I think a big majority of students don't know about paying back their loans or programs that are out there because we never see the information on campus,"" says Joshua Carter, a junior at the University of Texas at El Paso who will graduate with $30,000 in loans.

Greg Young, a 28-year-old doctoral student at the University of Buffalo, was thinking about applying to a federal repayment program after he graduated from the College of Saint Rose in 2007.

""Frankly, I was really confused in trying to figure out which one was the best, and I wasn't sure where I could get some advice on it,"" he says.

Young was able to defer his loans because he went back to school, but will probably need a federal repayment program to help pay off his $40,000 of debt.

""I think this education campaign is really great because I don't think the information is out there,"" Young says about the Obama administration's new outreach.

Betsy Mayotte, director of regulatory compliance at the non-profit American Student Assistance, says that informing borrowers about repayment options is only half the battle.

The process of applying to a repayment program can be cumbersome, she says, and the Department of Education simply doesn't have the resources to guide everyone through it.

Nasser says she might want to apply for a repayment or forgiveness program but doesn't have the ""slightest clue"" where to start.

""Especially if you are a first-generation student, you don't ever go through a workshop that explains to you, this is how you are going to pay for college,"" she says.

By being proactive instead of reactive, the Department of Education hopes to help struggling students avoid defaulting or paying more than is necessary.

Mayotte just hopes the e-mails and phone calls don't get lost in transmission.

""Borrowers that are past due get a ton of phone calls and they get a ton of mail, and a lot of the time they don't answer the phone and they don't open the mail,"" Mayotte says.

Jonathan Dame is a senior at Boston College."

http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/10/26/in-iowa-speech-ted-cruz-warns-democrats-on-shutdown/,2013-10-26 00:00:00,"[""Ed O'Keefe"", 'Reporter Focused On Congress', 'National Politics', 'The Federal Government']","In Iowa speech, Ted Cruz warns Democrats on shutdown","He warned that the decision by Senate Democrats to repeatedly vote together against GOP-backed budget proposals -- including a measure that Cruz claimed would repeal the congressional exemption from the new health-care law -- means that vulnerable House and Senate Democrats will suffer political consequences during next year’s midterm elections.

“I promise you, come October and November of 2014, we’re going to see TV commercials all over this country of Democrats who voted to give themselves a special exemption to Obamacare that their constituents don’t get and there are going to be some Democratic members of Congress and of the Senate who are suddenly going to be experiencing the joys of the private health-care system,” Cruz told the crowd.

The comments suggest that Cruz is preparing to take an even more active role in calling out his Democratic colleagues for actions taken during the shutdown -- even though Democrts have generally emerged victorious from the standoff, at least according to public opinion polls. Any new effort by Cruz to blunt Senate Democrats would be notable since he is a vice chairman of the National Senatorial Campaign Committee and has been criticized by some for doing little to help bolster the party’s chances of retaking the Senate next year.

The senator delivered a series of well-worn jokes and zingers heard before on the Senate floor or in similar speeches in other early-primary states, including South Carolina.

Promising a sellout crowd of 600 people that he wouldn’t speak for as long as he did during his recent 21-hour marathon filibuster-like speech on the Senate floor, Cruz began by joking that “Twenty-one hours is a long time. That’s almost as long as it takes to sign up on the Obamacare Web site.”

As he did during a similar state party function in South Carolina in May, Cruz avoided using a lectern and instead paced the stage with a wireless microphone pinned to his necktie. He began by chastising the Obama administration for being “bent on violating every constitutional protection."" He retold the life story of his father, Rafael Cruz, a Cuban immigrant. And he repeatedly poked fun at “conventional wisdom” emanating from Washington.

Unlike previous addresses, however, Cruz was accompanied Friday night by his wife, Heidi Nelson Cruz, a rare political trip for her outside of Texas. The joint appearance came just days after a high-profile New York Times profile that discussed the couple's relationship and finances and her work for Goldman Sachs.

Looking beyond the health-care fight, Cruz at one point discussed the need for Republicans to focus much more intently on economic growth.

“If we don’t have growth, we can’t achieve anything,” he told the crowd. Arguing that even modest economic growth could generate trillions of dollars in tax revenues and deficit reduction, he said “That’s what the Republican Party needs to be about. We need to be about economic growth all the time, every day, that’s how we turn the country around.”

In a nod to the growing power and popularity of grassroots conservatives, he listed five instances in the past year where a groundswell of conservative support helped blunt Obama administration policies: During a filibuster by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) against U.S. drone policy; during the Senate debate over gun control; during the summer's immigration debate; when Republicans joined Democrats in raising concerns about President Obama's plans in Syria; and most recently during the government shutdown.

Cruz eagerly sought to harness that grassroots support by asking people in the crowd to use their cellphones to text the word “growth” to a number tied to his political organization -- a modern-age way to collect the names and numbers of potential political supporters. He made a similar request during his South Carolina speech in May.

That request, plus Cruz's appearance in the state that hosts the first presidential caucuses, will once again fuel speculation about his political future. He demurred when asked afterward by reporters whether the trip was in preparation for a presidential bid.

The visit was Cruz's third to Iowa this year, but his longest yet. He arrived Friday afternoon in time for his speech and on Saturday plans to join Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) on the congressman’s annual pheasant hunt and “Defenders of Freedom” fundraiser in Akron and Le Mars, two towns in the conservative northwest corner of the state. He will fly home Sunday to celebrate the birthday of his 3-year old daughter.

Cruz is not the only would-be GOP presidential candidate spending time in Iowa these days. Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), who was the 2012 Republican vice presidential candidate, will be in the state next month to attend a fundraiser for Republican Gov. Terry Branstad. And Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) made a well-received trip to the state last spring shortly after he mounted a filibuster in opposition to domestic spying programs.

In answers to Finance Committee questions, Mr. Froman said on May 17 that he still held those assets but would sell them off within 90 days of confirmation as trade representative.

Mr. Grassley said the president once called the Ugland House “the biggest tax scam in the world.”

“Yet he nominated two top advisers in a row who invested in the Ugland House,” Mr. Grassley said. “He also nominated a commerce secretary with significant offshore income.”

Mr. Froman’s 2009 financial disclosure forms showed holdings in three different Citigroup accounts that maximize profits through “carried interest,” a tax loophole that allows private equity and hedge fund managers to claim compensation as capital gains, thus paying a lower tax rate than if that pay is taxed as income.

Mr. Froman received a $2 million payout from Citigroup to waive his holdings in the India Infrastructure Carried Interest Plan and from another investment called the Sustainable Investments Carry LP. Another account, Citi Infrastructure Investors Carried LP, showed $1 million to $5 million in assets in 2009. Those assets were transferred to his wife, Nancy Goodman, who has promised to divest them as soon as he is confirmed. But White House officials say their value in his latest financial disclosure was revised to zero because of fund performance.

As the financial industry went into a tailspin, Mr. Froman received a bonus in 2008 of $2.75 million, based on his performance the year before. In 2009, his bonus for 2008 work was $2.25 million. The justification for these bonuses given to the committee was “normal industry practice.”"
http://news.yahoo.com/house-approves-bill-preventing-shutdown-march-27-191449292--finance.html,,[],House approves bill preventing shutdown March 27,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Republican-controlled House approved legislation Wednesday to prevent a government shutdown on March 27 and blunt the impact of newly imposed spending cuts on the Defense Department.

The 267-151 vote sent the measure to the Senate, where Democrats hope to give additional Cabinet agencies similar flexibility in implementing their shares of the $85 billion in spending cuts required to take effect by the end of the budget year.

Republicans said the measure was essential to keep the government operating smoothly after current funding expires on March 27.

Democrats who opposed the measure protested the embedded spending cuts and criticized Republicans for refusing to replace some of them with tax loophole closings.

Ironically, the measure underscored joint efforts by the Obama administration and congressional Republicans to ease the impact of short-term spending cuts that kicked in with dire White House warnings a few days ago. At the same time, both are eager to pocket the full savings for deficit reduction as they pivot to a new clash over Medicare next week, when House Republicans and Senate Democrats are expected to unveil rival budgets.

The overall size of the cuts in the no-shutdown spending bill remains in place: $85 billion in reductions through the end of the budget year on Sept. 30, half from defense and half from domestic programs as diverse as education, parks and payments to doctors and hospitals treating Medicare patients.

But legislation drafted by House Republicans to prevent a government shutdown on March 27 also gives the Pentagon and the Veterans Affairs Department flexibility to allocate cuts that no agency currently has.

Senate Democrats seem likely to agree to the flexibility if it can be expanded to include other agencies, according to several officials who described closed-door talks that also involved the White House. Among the candidates are the departments of Homeland Security, Transportation, Justice and State. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity, saying they were not authorized to disclose details.

Story continues

The move marks a reversal for President Barack Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., both of whom spoke dismissively in recent days of Republican plans for flexibility in administering the cuts.

""The problem is when you're cutting $85 billion in seven months, which represents over a 10 percent cut in the defense budget in seven months, there's no smart way to do that,"" the president said Feb. 26 in Newport News, Va.

""You don't want to have to choose between, Let's see, do I close funding for the disabled kid or the poor kid? Do I close this Navy shipyard or some other one?""

Asked last week whether he would agree to flexibility, Reid said: ""No, why would I? I don't have a reason to do so.""

Pentagon officials embraced flexibility even before the measure came to a vote in the House.

The difference for the Navy is ""almost night and day,"" the service's top uniformed officer told Congress on Tuesday. With flexibility, said Adm. Jonathan Greenert, the chief of naval operations, work could proceed on the overhaul of two aircraft carriers and construction on a third, all projects that the Pentagon had said would be curtailed without any changes.

The Pentagon did not immediately say whether it also would be able to order the USS Harry S. Truman to the Persian Gulf region, a mission it announced earlier would fall victim to the cuts.

Whatever the eventual impact of the spending cuts, the long-running struggle between the parties over deficits soon will shift to rival budgets under preparation by House Republicans and Senate Democrats.

Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., chairman of the House Budget Committee, told reporters his plan would make relatively modest changes compared with last year's blueprint, yet project an end to federal deficits in a decade's time. The plan leaves in place $600 billion in higher taxes on the wealthy that Congress approved on New Year's Day over the objection of many rank and file Republicans.

Republican officials said had disclosed on Tuesday that Ryan had decided against accelerating plans for a highly controversial overhaul of Medicare, the program that provides health care for people aged 65 and older. Several members of the rank and file have said in recent days Ryan was considering a budget that would implement far-reaching changes beginning in less than a decade.

The Republican proposal would give future retirees a choice between the existing program and one that provides beneficiaries a voucher for their care. In its previous forms, it also capped the overall cost of the program.

Republicans say their approach would help ensure the survival of Medicare for future retirees.

Democrats say it would end the guarantee of health care coverage for seniors that has existed since the 1960s by imposing steadily higher costs on beneficiaries.

Ryan's suggestion to accelerate the overhaul drew objections from some Republicans because it would have meant reversing a pledge the party has made to leave Medicare generally unchanged for anyone currently aged 55 and older.

The switch had few if any supporters at a closed-door leadership meeting earlier in the week, according to Republicans who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the session.

One lawmaker not at the session, Rep. Mike Simpson of Idaho, told reporters on Tuesday there was concern among some Republicans that incumbents and candidates in swing seats could be harmed in the 2014 elections. ""You've told people you'd be doing one thing"" and then changing the pledge, he said.

Democrats are poised to attack Republicans over their plans regardless.

Even before reports first surfaced of a possible change in the Republican timetable, Reid told reporters, ""Republicans plan to make more extreme cuts to Medicare and Medicaid, education, medical research. They are in an untenable position.""

Obama has proposed cuts totaling $400 billion or more to Medicare and other health care benefit programs but has refused to accept the type of change that Republicans seek.

In his State of the Union address last month, the president said he wants to reduce taxpayer subsidies to prescription drug companies, impose higher costs on wealthier seniors and make payments to providers based on ""the quality of care seniors receive"" rather than the number of tests.

""I am open to additional reforms from both parties, so long as they don't violate the guarantee of a secure retirement,"" he said.

But in his first post-campaign interview, the former Massachusetts governor did not shy away Sunday from his criticism of President Obama and said he hoped to help the Republican Party regain its footing — from a distance.

“I recognize that as the guy who lost the election, I’m not in a position to tell everybody else how to win,” Romney told “Fox News Sunday” host Chris Wallace. “They’re not going to listen and I don’t have the credibility to do that anyway. But I still care. And I still believe that there are principles that we need to stand for.”

Criticizing the stalemate on the sequester — $85 billion in automatic spending cuts that are slated to go into effect because Democrats and Republicans could not reach an agreement — the former GOP nominee accused the president of “campaigning” by flying around the country “berating Republicans” instead of pulling aside Democrats and a few Republicans to cut a deal.

“It kills me not to be there, not to be in the White House doing what needs to be done,” Romney told Wallace. “The president is the leader of the nation. The president brings people together, does the deals, does the trades, knocks the heads together; the president leads. And I don’t see that kind of leadership happening right now.”

Romney said the nation was in the midst of “a golden moment” to fix its fiscal problems but was watching it “slip away with politics.” Obama, he charged, has been more interested in winning a political victory than resolving the issue: “This is America we’re talking about at a critical time,” he said, “You know, Nero is fiddling.”

Since his loss in November, Romney has largely faded from public view—retreating to his oceanfront home in La Jolla and enjoying outings with his grandchildren at the beach, Disneyland and local parks. Sources close to the former governor say he is still weighing his next steps but has turned his energy toward the charitable foundation that he founded with his wife, Ann. They have renamed it the Romney Foundation for Children to focus on the plight of poor children around the world.

When on the East Coast, Romney has been working out of the Boston offices of Solamere, the venture capital firm founded by his son Tagg and his former campaign finance director Spencer Zwick. He has told friends that he intends to help out at Solamere, as well at the businesses of three of his other sons, who work in real estate development.

Reflecting on the 2012 campaign, Romney told Wallace that he and his team had not done an effective job reaching out to minority voters, which he called “a real mistake.” He did not apologize for his assertion to donors last fall that Obama had won the election by giving “gifts” to key groups, including African Americans, Latinos and young people.

The remarks drew criticism from many of Romney’s fellow Republicans, in part because they were reminiscent of his controversial comment at a private Florida fundraiser that 47% of Americans were looking for handouts and weren’t likely to vote for him.

“The president had the power of incumbency. Obamacare was very attractive, particularly to those without health insurance. And they came out in large numbers to vote,” Romney told Wallace when asked about the “gifts” comment.

When Wallace noted that the former Massachusetts governor had been “roasted” by members of his party over the remarks, and asked if that hurt, Romney said he wasn’t “going to second-guess what other people have to say.”

“I don’t look back. I look forward,” he said.

Putting an end to a swirl of speculation earlier this year, Ann Romney said she was never formally approached by the Republican Party about running for the Massachusetts U.S. Senate seat vacated by Secretary of State John Kerry. “Not a chance,” she told Wallace when asked if she’d considered running. “I’m enjoying life.”

She did confirm, however, that she considered taking a spot on “Dancing With the Stars” and “would’ve loved to have done it.”

But, she said, “I am turning 64, and I started thinking about it — I’m not really as flexible as I should be.”

The selection of Dorothy Hamill as a contestant, she said, confirmed that she had made the right decision. “I thought, oh my gosh, am I glad I didn’t do that! I wouldn’t want to compete against Dorothy!”

Four problems - The four problems were (1) their likely voter model generally, which according to Newport ""was at least 1 point more towards Romney than the average of other polls that were using some time of likely voter model,"" (2) under-representation, within census regions, of the Eastern versus the Central times zones and the Pacific versus the Mountain Time zones, (3) the use of a series of yes/no questions to measure race, which distorted the weighting process and led to an over-representation of some white voters and (4) the use of non-standard ""listed landline"" sampling instead of random digit dial samples led to older and more heavily Republican pool of respondents. [Gallup] Sound familiar? Not to say we told you so, but we reported extensively on the last two problems in June 2012 and March 2013.

Dana Milbank:

A good indication of House Republicans’ mind-set came last week, when Rep. John Boehner’s spokesman wrote on the House speaker’s official blog that a speech by Obama on student loans was an attempt “to change the subject from its growing list of scandals.” It’s telling that the GOP leadership would view a student loan event as a distraction from scandals but wouldn’t see the obsession with scandals as a distraction from pocketbook issues. As The Post’s Paul Kane reported Tuesday, House Republicans haven’t passed much ambitious legislation this year after they “disintegrated into squabbling factions, no longer able to agree on — much less execute — some of the most basic government functions.” One of the few things that unite them is the investigation of scandals. A few weeks ago, Heritage Action for America, an influential conservative group, suggested that House Republicans focus on investigations and avoid legislation that could divide them.

The Republicans not only can't govern, they are not even interested in trying. it's becoming so obvious, even some of the Villagers are beginning to see it.

Greg Sargent:

If current obstructionism continues, Dems may exercise the nuclear option and change the rules by simple majority to nix filibusters of nominations. With the showdown escalating, the battle is already being treated as a he-said-she-said argument in which there’s no real way to settle the core question of whether what we’re seeing from Republicans is something new and different. For example, the New York Times noted without comment the other day: “Republicans deny being slow to confirm the president’s choices for his cabinet and the courts.” Yes, but are they right, or wrong? It is not easy to conclusively determine whether GOP obstructionism is unprecedented. But there are some data points we can look at.

For instance, Dr. Sheldon Goldman, a professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts who focuses on judicial nominations, has developed what he calls an “Index of Obstruction and Delay” designed to measure levels of obstructionism. In research that will be released in a July article he co-authored for Judicature Journal, he has calculated that the level of obstruction of Obama circuit court nominees during the last Congress was unprecedented. Goldman calculates his Index of Obstruction and Delay by adding together the number of unconfirmed nominations, plus the number of nominations that took more than 180 days to confirm (not including nominations towards the end of a given Congress) and dividing that by the total number of nominations. During the last Congress, Goldman calculates, the Index of Obstruction and Delay for Obama circuit court nominations was 0.9524. “That’s the highest that’s ever been recorded,” he tells me. “In this last Congress it approached total obstruction or delay.”

Republican obstructionism isn't opinion, it's fact."

Metaphor? Yes.

Rep. Greg Walden’s absence from the Anaheim gathering exemplified the shadow the Capitol standoff has cast across grass-roots Republicans eying next year’s elections. In Anaheim, as in Washington, the mood among Republicans seemed to meld support for the goals of GOP congressional leaders and an expectation that Republicans would pay a price for them.

Everyone at the event, from congressional Republicans on down, was trying to push blame for the shutdown onto Democrats, in defiance of national polls showing more Americans blame Republicans than President Obama or his party.

“I sure wish I could be with you in person, but as you’ve seen, a few things are going on in Washington as we fight to stand up for our Republican principles,” Walden, who represents a district in Oregon, said on the video played to a few hundred delegates.

“Getting anything done has been incredibly difficult as we have a president and a Democratically-controlled Senate who refuse even to even negotiate and work with Republicans to fund the government and make changes to Obamacare. Even on important nonpartisan issues like cancer funding and keeping the World War II memorial open to World War II veterans, the Democrats refuse to budge.”

He echoed what Sharon Day, co-chair of the Republican National Committee, had said a day earlier when she was asked if the federal government shutdown would harm Republican chances next year. She angrily denounced President Obama and Harry Reid, the Democratic leader of the Senate, for their tactics and what she described as efforts to bait Republicans.

“If you look at it, they have truly become the ‘party of no’ in this battle,” she said, using a sobriquet frequently flung at Republicans. “I’d like to see the president and I’d like to see Harry Reid stop throwing around statements and comments that are not helpful and I’d like them to sit down and compromise. …

“If you remember, it was the senators who didn’t show up to work on the bill while the Republican Congress worked till midnight. It was the president that played golf while the Republican Congress individuals continued to work and try to find solutions.”

Inevitably, however, she turned to the impact.

“Does it have an impact? I guess it will have an impact,” she said, her body language implying the fallout would be negative: “But the right thing is what I believe -- what the Congress is doing is trying to find solutions, unlike the president and Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi who just simply say, ‘I want it all, I want it now and I don’t care what your compromises are, I’m not even going to show up to work and do my job.’”

Jim Brulte, the state Republican Party chairman, declined to say whether he thought Republicans would pay for the shutdown. But an analogy he drew — the fact that President George H. W.

“For anyone to suggest that they know what’s going to happen in November of 2014 based on what’s happening in October of 2013 is either a prophet or a fool,” he said. “And I may be one, but I try not to be either of them.”

But in his first post-campaign interview, the former Massachusetts governor did not shy away Sunday from his criticism of President Obama and said he hoped to help the Republican Party regain its footing — from a distance.

“I recognize that as the guy who lost the election, I’m not in a position to tell everybody else how to win,” Romney told “Fox News Sunday” host Chris Wallace. “They’re not going to listen and I don’t have the credibility to do that anyway. But I still care. And I still believe that there are principles that we need to stand for.”

Criticizing the stalemate on the sequester — $85 billion in automatic spending cuts that are slated to go into effect because Democrats and Republicans could not reach an agreement — the former GOP nominee accused the president of “campaigning” by flying around the country “berating Republicans” instead of pulling aside Democrats and a few Republicans to cut a deal.

“It kills me not to be there, not to be in the White House doing what needs to be done,” Romney told Wallace. “The president is the leader of the nation. The president brings people together, does the deals, does the trades, knocks the heads together; the president leads. And I don’t see that kind of leadership happening right now.”

Romney said the nation was in the midst of “a golden moment” to fix its fiscal problems but was watching it “slip away with politics.” Obama, he charged, has been more interested in winning a political victory than resolving the issue: “This is America we’re talking about at a critical time,” he said, “You know, Nero is fiddling.”

Since his loss in November, Romney has largely faded from public view—retreating to his oceanfront home in La Jolla and enjoying outings with his grandchildren at the beach, Disneyland and local parks. Sources close to the former governor say he is still weighing his next steps but has turned his energy toward the charitable foundation that he founded with his wife, Ann. They have renamed it the Romney Foundation for Children to focus on the plight of poor children around the world.

When on the East Coast, Romney has been working out of the Boston offices of Solamere, the venture capital firm founded by his son Tagg and his former campaign finance director Spencer Zwick. He has told friends that he intends to help out at Solamere, as well at the businesses of three of his other sons, who work in real estate development.

Reflecting on the 2012 campaign, Romney told Wallace that he and his team had not done an effective job reaching out to minority voters, which he called “a real mistake.” He did not apologize for his assertion to donors last fall that Obama had won the election by giving “gifts” to key groups, including African Americans, Latinos and young people.

The remarks drew criticism from many of Romney’s fellow Republicans, in part because they were reminiscent of his controversial comment at a private Florida fundraiser that 47% of Americans were looking for handouts and weren’t likely to vote for him.

“The president had the power of incumbency. Obamacare was very attractive, particularly to those without health insurance. And they came out in large numbers to vote,” Romney told Wallace when asked about the “gifts” comment.

When Wallace noted that the former Massachusetts governor had been “roasted” by members of his party over the remarks, and asked if that hurt, Romney said he wasn’t “going to second-guess what other people have to say.”

“I don’t look back. I look forward,” he said.

Putting an end to a swirl of speculation earlier this year, Ann Romney said she was never formally approached by the Republican Party about running for the Massachusetts U.S. Senate seat vacated by Secretary of State John Kerry. “Not a chance,” she told Wallace when asked if she’d considered running. “I’m enjoying life.”

She did confirm, however, that she considered taking a spot on “Dancing With the Stars” and “would’ve loved to have done it.”

But, she said, “I am turning 64, and I started thinking about it — I’m not really as flexible as I should be.”

The selection of Dorothy Hamill as a contestant, she said, confirmed that she had made the right decision. “I thought, oh my gosh, am I glad I didn’t do that! I wouldn’t want to compete against Dorothy!”

Now, they've released the second part, and boy, it's a doozy for the GOP.



In a sign of the political hangover congressional Republicans are suffering in the wake of the government shutdown, three-quarters of Americans in a new national poll say that most GOP members of Congress don't deserve to be re-elected. A CNN/ORC International survey released Monday also found a majority saying that the Republicans' policies are too extreme. And according to the poll, Democrats have an 8-point advantage over the Republicans in an early indicator in the battle for control of Congress. But with more than a year to go until the 2014 midterm elections, there's plenty of time for these numbers to change. .... More than seven in 10 questioned in the survey said that most members of Congress don't deserve to be re-elected, with nearly four in 10 saying even their own representative doesn't deserve a return ticket to Washington next year. Both figures are hovering around all-time highs in CNN polling. ""Although incumbent members of Congress of both parties are not very popular, the shutdown seems to have only affected views of GOP incumbents,"" CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said. Three-fourths of people questioned in the survey said that most congressional Republicans don't deserved to be re-elected, 21 percentage points higher than the 54% who say most Democrats don't deserve another term in office. Only one in five say most Republicans deserve to be re-elected; 42% say the same thing about Democrats on Capitol Hill.

Deserve re-election?



Yes No

Dem 40% 56%

GOP 20% 76%

Now, this question was asked of all Americans, and NOT of registered voters (and obviously not of likely voters). The CNN pollask it of registered voters as well, and from the smaller sample, registered voters were slightly more angry at both parties. Here, I've put it in chart form.Of note, that 40% for Democrats among registered voters is actually not the worst we've seen in recent history. The August 2010 numbers had only 36% of registered voters saying Democrats deserved re-election to Congress. However, that 20% for the GOP is thein the poll's history by far, surpassing the previous low of just 31%, taken back in August 2011 during the last debt ceiling fight.

This is now spilling over into the generic ballot question as well.



Fifty percent of registered voters questioned said they would vote for the Democrat in their district, with 42% backing the Republican. The 8-point Democratic margin in the CNN poll is the same as in a recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey and close to the 9-point advantage for the Democrats in the generic ballot in a recent Quinnipiac University poll. ""We're a long way away from saying that the Democrats have a chance to regain control of the House,"" Holland cautioned. ""There is more than a year to go before any votes are actually cast and the 'generic ballot' question is not necessarily a good predictor of the actual outcome of 435 separate elections. A year before the 2010 midterms, for example, the Democrats held a 6-point lead on the generic ballot."" The Republicans eventually won back control of the House in 2010, thanks to a historic 63-seat pickup.

So again, while the signs look good now, they looked good for Democrats as well in 2010, and we all know the misery that followed. The generic ballot question almost always overestimates how well Democrats will do an entire year out from the actual election. Notice in 2006, a good year for Democrats, it only overestimated by a tiny bit. But in the midterm years good for the GOP, like 2002 and 2010, anyone thinking we were going to do OK because of the generic ballot question was in for a rude awakening. So recent history tells us that even if 2014 turns out to be a good year for Democrats, the generic ballot question STILL overestimates how well we're going to do a year ahead, but only by a little.

Notice in the 2010 average of the polls, on October 21, 2009 (exactly 4 years ago), Democrats held a 45%-39.5% advantage on the generic ballot question. And then a year later, a massive 63-seat loss in the House, with Republicans actually getting 51.6% of the vote, and Democrats only getting 44.8% of the vote.

So, while this poll is good news, don't you dare take anything for granted just yet."
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/06/opinion/krugman-obama-gets-real.html,2013-12-06 00:00:00,['Paul Krugman'],Obama Gets Real - The New York Times,"Much of the media commentary on President Obama’s big inequality speech was cynical. You know the drill: it’s yet another “reboot” that will go nowhere; none of it will have any effect on policy, and so on. But before we talk about the speech’s possible political impact or lack thereof, shouldn’t we look at the substance? Was what the president said true? Was it new? If the answer to these questions is yes — and it is — then what he said deserves a serious hearing.

And once you realize that, you also realize that the speech may matter a lot more than the cynics imagine.

First, about those truths: Mr. Obama laid out a disturbing — and, unfortunately, all too accurate — vision of an America losing touch with its own ideals, an erstwhile land of opportunity becoming a class-ridden society. Not only do we have an ever-growing gap between a wealthy minority and the rest of the nation; we also, he declared, have declining mobility, as it becomes harder and harder for the poor and even the middle class to move up the economic ladder. And he linked rising inequality with falling mobility, asserting that Horatio Alger stories are becoming rare precisely because the rich and the rest are now so far apart.

This isn’t entirely new terrain for Mr. Obama. What struck me about this speech, however, was what he had to say about the sources of rising inequality. Much of our political and pundit class remains devoted to the notion that rising inequality, to the extent that it’s an issue at all, is all about workers lacking the right skills and education. But the president now seems to accept progressive arguments that education is at best one of a number of concerns, that America’s growing class inequality largely reflects political choices, like the failure to raise the minimum wage along with inflation and productivity."

Moving Right,"Even if all the hidden money funneled into campaigns through private 501(c) organizations had come from businesses — unlikely given the contributions by noncorporate groups like Planned Parenthood and the N.R.A. — corporate spending would not reach $400 million, still a small share of the total.

Perhaps this should not be surprising. For companies, spending on elections can be risky. Business executives might prefer lobbying, where they spend far more than on campaign contributions, not because the limits are more relaxed but because swaying legislators on both sides of the aisle is more effective at getting what they want. And such lobbying is less likely to kindle anger among consumers, shareholders and other constituents than spending to change the outcome of elections.

“While Citizens alters the ability of corporations to contribute to campaigns, it does not alter their substantial risk in doing so,” the political scientists Wendy L. Hansen, Michael Rocca and Brittany Ortiz of the University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, argued in a recent study.

Still, corporations’ reluctance to open their checkbooks suggests an intriguing alternative explanation for the rise of Republicans who are willing to defy their will: companies may have spent too little. Their money was swamped by that of big individual donors who are more ideologically extreme. In 2012, the top 0.1 percent of donors contributed more than 44 percent of all campaign contributions. In 1980 their share of contributions was less than 10 percent.

Corporations have a pro-Republican bias, of course. But it is not quite as extreme as pop culture would have it, and is certainly less pronounced than organized labor’s pro-Democrat leanings.

Effective lobbying requires both Republican and Democratic friends. Political action committees run by businesses are known for spreading money on both sides of the partisan divide. They give to incumbents. They choose winners. They show little partisan loyalty.

In the 2006 elections, when the G.O.P. controlled Congress, corporate PACs gave 65 percent of their money to Republicans. In 2008 and 2010, after the Democrats had swept both the House and Senate, they split their contributions roughly fifty-fifty."

Story highlights During the 2012 race, Mitt Romney was criticized for calling Russia the United States' top ""geopolitical foe"" Romney was also haunted by an op-ed about the auto industry entitled ""Let Detroit Go Bankrupt"" Now, Russia has granted temporary asylum to NSA leaker Edward Snowden and the City of Detroit is bankrupt But Romney was also hurt in his 2012 White House bid by other controversies like his ""47 percent"" comments

(CNN) —

If Mitt Romney were to write a bumper sticker slogan for the past month, it would probably be, “Detroit DID go bankrupt. Russia IS a geopolitical foe.”

Reality isn’t quite so simple as to perfectly apply recent developments on Detroit and Russia to the American debate in 2012, but neither were Romney’s arguments on the car industry and on Russia. That didn’t stop Democrats and pundits from using them to beat Romney down.

And it would be a good retort to Joe Biden’s often-repeated 2012 bumper sticker slogan: “Osama bin Laden is dead and General Motors is alive!”

Biden used the phrase to simultaneously flaunt what the Obama administration accomplished in the war on terror and hit Romney for his position against the auto bailout.

Romney had different ideas than the president about the war on terror, and he also had outspoken ideas on Russia, which he told Wolf Blitzer on CNN in March of 2012 was “without question our number one geopolitical foe.”

His statement drew snickers in Washington and complaints in foreign policy circles that he was stuck in the Cold War.

Archives: Hillary Clinton criticizes Romney’s remarks on Russia

“You don’t call Russia our No. 1 enemy – not al Qaeda, Russia – unless you’re still stuck in a Cold War mind warp,” President Barack Obama said at the Democratic National Convention last September.

The president probably still wouldn’t call Russia this country’s top foe. But now that Russia has given NSA leaker Edward Snowden a year of asylum, and the two countries can’t find accord on Syria or Iran, he might choose not to put the line in his convention speech.

Snowden asylum could cancel planned Obama-Putin talks

“Now is the time to fundamentally rethink our relationship with Putin’s Russia,” Sen. John McCain said upon hearing news of Snowden’s asylum. “We need to deal with the Russia that is, not the Russia we might wish for. We cannot allow today’s action by [Russian President Vladimir Putin] to stand without serious repercussions.”

“Russia has stabbed us in the back,” said Sen. Chuck Schumer, the New York Democrat. He called on Obama to protest by demanding the upcoming G-20 summit for world economic powers be moved away from Russia.

Biden’s slogan, “General Motors is alive!” drew a direct contrast between the candidates on the auto bailout that Obama engineered after initial action by President George W. Bush.

Romney’s much-cited New York Times op-ed argued the car industry should be shepherded into a managed bankruptcy and not propped up with taxpayer dollars.

The headline of Romney’s op-ed in November 2008 was “Let Detroit Go Bankrupt.” That headline followed him all the way to November of 2012 when he lost the election.

Romney’s argument in the opinion piece was directed at the car industry, but it foreshadowed last month’s news that the Detroit the city, once the powerhouse of the American economy, was going bankrupt.

“[W]e refused to throw in the towel and do nothing,” Obama said in a video message in October of 2012. “We refused to let Detroit go bankrupt, I bet on American workers, and American ingenuity and three years later that bet is paying off in a big way.”

A conservative might apply the high labor costs Romney cited as part of the downfall for the auto industry to the cost of government worker pension plans that have helped put the city in trouble.

How to deal with promises made to public employees is an issue Americans will face in the coming decades in places far flung from the Motor City.

Hatch: After Detroit, replace public pensions

The federal government has made pretty clear there won’t be any sort of bailout for the city of Detroit like there was for the auto industry that lives there.

Campaigns are full of little moments like the Detroit and Russia storylines that may have worked against Romney. They add up. More damaging for Romney than either the Detroit op-ed or the Russia as a foe storyline was his statement to fundraisers about giving up on the 47% of Americans who would not vote for him no matter what.

This week we also got the most in-depth explanation from Romney on those comments in the form of a book excerpt from Washington Post writer Dan Balz. Romney said he was misunderstood.

In politics, eight months is an eternity. It’s enough time for the Romneys to welcome four new grandchildren into the world. How Detroit and Russia and the 47% factored into 2012 are interesting historical questions, but the national dialogue has moved on. Romney is retired from national politics and the pundits and press have moved on to the 2016 parlor game.

Pollak'],"Obama's Strongest Opposition May Come from Within–over Spoils, not Principle","I have seen more powerful men than Barack Obama fall. I worked in South Africa during Thabo Mbeki’s presidency, when the ruling African National Congress (ANC) won 70% of the vote and earned the power to change his country’s constitution unilaterally. In 2005, I watched from the gallery as he told Parliament he was dismissing his deputy, Jacob Zuma, over allegations of corruption stemming from a lucrative arms deal.

Two years later, Mbeki was ousted by his party and forced to resign his presidency of the country. Zuma is now president, and the ruling party is both fractured by rivalries and weakened by the growing strength of the opposition Democratic Alliance. The growing current of dissent in South Africa is not, primarily, over principles or policies but over clashes over the spoils of power in a time of economic stagnation and turmoil.

President Obama holds unprecedented sway over his own party–and yet the first signs of internal tension are already bursting into the open. The news that he has turned his campaign into a permanent, non-profit organizing outfit to push for his policies has been greeted with frustration by members of the Democratic National Committee, who see the new “Organizing for Action” group as a competitor for fundraising dollars and power.

The Hill reports on the open dissatisfaction at the DNC:

DNC members said they were caught off guard when the leaders of the president’s reelection team announced Obama for America was morphing into Organizing for Action (OFA), a nonprofit group that can take unlimited “soft money” donations….While the new group will seek to go toe to toe with GOP outside groups like Crossroads GPS, some Democrats aren’t pleased that Obama didn’t fold his powerful grassroots operation back into the DNC.

The looming fights over spending, deficits and debts also threatens the coalition that re-elected President Obama. The Obama administration designed a sequester whose non-defense cuts would scare as many voters and interest groups as possible. It expected that sequester to be canceled; now there is a strong chance that it may go through. If it does, interest groups and lobbies may find themselves fighting each other–and Obama.

Many of the president’s strongest backers were prepared to wait until the election was over to demand their money’s worth. Hollywood, for example, watched the defeat of the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) in frustration–and patiently waited for Obama to return to office. Now, having won its tax benefits in the fiscal cliff talks, it may revive SOPA again.

Yet it will have to compete with other interest groups in the Democrats’ coalition, who believe that the president was not aggressive enough in his first term and are no longer willing to accept the idea that compromise with Republicans is necessary. The rush to redeem promises made by Obama to each of these constituencies will likely increase friction within Democratic ranks–just as Republicans are pressing their case on debt.

That is why the most important opposition to Obama may come from within–some on matters of principle, such as the loose alliance of liberal and pro-Israel groups opposing Chuck Hagel’s nomination for Secretary of Defense; and others on pure self-interest. Republican opposition will still be critical, especially given the effective veto the House still holds. But it will likely be given a boost by Democrats’ own greed and impatience."
http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/18/politics/inauguration-music/index.html,2013-01-18 00:00:00,"['Denise Quan', 'Jack Hannah']","From Sinatra to Aretha, the role of music in the inauguration","Story highlights Popular music has been part of the presidential inauguration for decades John F. Kennedy asked Frank Sinatra to produce his inaugural celebration in 1961 Beyonce, James Taylor and others will perform this year at Monday's ceremony

Many Americans recall the image of Barack Obama standing on the steps of the Capitol as he was sworn in as the 44th president of the United States in 2009.

But they also remember Aretha Franklin, and how she belted out “My Country, ‘Tis of Thee” wearing an enormous bow that threatened to engulf her entire head.

Later that night, Beyonce crooned “At Last” while the Obamas took their first spin on the dance floor as POTUS and FLOTUS.

This time, Beyonce will perform the national anthem, with Kelly Clarkson singing “My Country, ‘Tis of Thee” and James Taylor doing the honors on “America the Beautiful.”

Inaugural events have spotlighted the intersection of politics, pop culture and music since the early ‘60s, said David Gergen, director of the Center for Public Leadership at Harvard University.

“The person that really changed the nature of inaugural music was John Kennedy, because he was a friend with many in Hollywood – especially Frank Sinatra,” said Gergen, also a CNN contributor. “Sinatra came in and co-produced one of the great shows at an inauguration … and that became sort of the standard.”

Who will be there: Celebrities flock to D.C. for inauguration

Kennedy was 43 when he was elected. Bill Clinton and Obama were also in their 40s for their first terms in the Oval Office.

“The younger the president, the more we see a connection to pop culture and to music,” said Phil Gallo, senior correspondent for Billboard. “So Kennedy, you have it. Nixon, you don’t.”

At Richard Nixon’s first inauguration in 1969, the crowd was treated to “This is My Country” performed by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir of Salt Lake City, according to the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies.

Gallo believes you can learn a lot about a commander in chief by the musical acts he chooses to spotlight. “George W. Bush loved to portray himself as a Texas rancher. Therefore, what’s a Texas rancher listen to? Country.” So Brooks & Dunn and Clint Black headlined his first inaugural celebration in 2001.

In 1977, Jimmy Carter looked to his regional roots for inspiration. “Jimmy Carter, he was a Georgian,” Gallo explains. “At that time, that meant the stars of Southern rock. So the Allman Brothers are in the White House.”

Sometimes the musicians are joined on stage by the president himself.

In 1989, George H.W. Bush strummed a guitar with B.B. King at one of his inaugural galas, while in 1993, Clinton grabbed a saxophone for a duet with the E Street Band’s Clarence Clemons. But even they were upstaged by the five members of Fleetwood Mac, who famously reunited to perform their megahit that became Clinton’s campaign song, “Don’t Stop.”

Frontman Lindsey Buckingham recalls the mood that night. “It was extremely exhilarating and exciting to do a song that you’ve done a million times, but doing it in a completely different context. As we were going out with the tag, ‘Don’t you look back, don’t you look back,’ Bill comes up, and Hillary comes up and shakes our hands. It was just one of those experiences you’ll never forget.”

Lessons in style from Michelle Obama

That one performance caused Fleetwood Mac members to rethink old grievances with each other.

“Oddly enough, it did act as the catalyst for me to sort of reconsider my options, shall we say, and the band got back together,” Buckingham chuckled.

This year’s festivities include a Kids’ Inaugural Concert on Saturday and two official balls on Monday night. Performers for those events include Katy Perry, Brad Paisley, Alicia Keys, Marc Anthony, Stevie Wonder and Smokey Robinson – a mix of pop, country, R & B, Latin, rock and old-school hitmakers.

Gallo says Obama’s lineup is deliberately inclusive to reflect his campaign agenda – but it could just as easily reflect the playlist of the first family.

“It almost looks more like they booked it by looking at the iPod of Barack and Michelle, and then looking at the iPod of their daughters.”

Expect Obama’s second-term events to be more celebratory than his first-term functions.

“The first time around, we heard songs that had a message that you wouldn’t have heard in previous inaugurations – ‘A Change is Gonna Come,’ ‘We Shall Overcome.’ We had people reflecting on the civil rights movement, the fact that we had our first African-American president,” said Gallo. “Now, I think it’ll be a little more up-tempo, a little peppier. People want a bit of a diversion as we start to think about the next four years.”

Gergen doesn’t disagree. “Presidents often choose to make statements about who they are, and what their hopes and aspirations are through the music, through the inaugural address, through the people they bring together there.”

Schultz had been trying for months to rouse the country into thinking hard about why our political system has run aground. “We can’t do this too many more times,” he said, referring to crises like the fiscal cliff. “We are sapping the country’s spirit. Our political system is broken.” He blamed, among other things, the practice of gerrymandering and the big money flowing into campaigns.

He’s right. The incentives to put country over party have vanished. Elected officials who cross party leaders get stripped of their committee assignments — as happened to four Republican legislators this week who were not viewed as “team players.” The combination of gerrymandered districts and a primary system that empowers a small coterie of party hard-liners has meant that representatives and senators who don’t toe the party line get booted out of office. Mickey Edwards, the former congressman from Oklahoma, has written a book, “The Parties Versus The People,” in which he proposes that we move to an open primary system, where all candidates, of every persuasion, run — with the top two finishers facing off in the general election. That would help loosen the grip party extremists now have on their representatives.

Thursday night, after I got home, I had a phone conversation with Scott Rigell, a Virginia Republican who first won election in 2010 by campaigning as a modern-day fiscal conservative. That is to say, he believed, as he told me, “that we have a spending problem not a revenue problem.”

But after he got to Congress, he dug deeper, and came to what he calls “a data-driven, analytic conclusion.” Namely: spending cuts alone could not eliminate the deficit. The country needed more tax revenue as well. He showed his data to everyone he could on his side of the aisle. They nodded politely and continued to insist on not raising taxes. Rigell did not revert back, however. “We have to have the courage to critique and refine our own platform,” he said. “That isn’t weakness. It is intellectual honesty.”

I asked him if he had been punished by leadership for his courageous views. “No,” he said.

Give them time, I thought."

Democrats try to lump GOP candidates under Tea Party banner

The movement began by focusing on economic and tax issues%2C not social issues

Republicans say they should focus on their common ground%2C not labels

The failure of Tea Party-backed candidates in Tuesday's election shows that Democrats have been successful in making the Tea Party label a negative for Republicans, even if it isn't always clear what being a Tea Party candidate means.

Exit polls in Virginia, where Republican Ken Cucinelli lost to Democrat Terry McAuliffe, show 42% of voters had a negative opinion of the Tea Party movement. Those voters went overwhelmingly for McAuliffe. A Tea Party-affiliated Republican in Alabama, Dean Young, lost a congressional primary against Bradley Byrne, who was backed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other business interests. In New Jersey, voters re-elected Republican Gov. Chris Christie by a landslide while expressing dislike of both the Republican Party (57%) and the Tea Party movement (45%), exit polls show.

Democrats touted those results in a conference call Wednesday. ""The Republican brand and the Tea Party brand are one and the same and people do not like either,'' said Mo Elleithee, Democratic National Committee spokesman.""There is no distinction in the mind of voters.''

By emphasizing the Tea Party ties of social conservatives such as Cuccinelli, Young, and former Missouri congressman Todd Akin, Democrats are able to blur the distinction between the limited government/less spending origins of the Tea Party and the staunch opposition to gay marriage and abortion of Republican conservatives.

Democrats conflate the Tea Party and the GOP ""because they see that it hurts us,'' says Keli Carender, national grass-roots director of the Tea Party Patriots. ""Social issues are so hot button that it's easy for Democrats to make them the main point when they're talking about somebody.''

October's government shutdown was pushed by Tea Party leaders Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, but supported by a majority of congressional Republicans — further eroding the distinction between the Tea Party and the GOP.

Tea Party principles had been ""perverted'' by Republicans in Washington who ""use that theory just to try to enhance themselves politically,'' Christie, a critic of the shutdown, said this week on CNN. Republicans should have been emphasizing instead their success in cutting government spending through the sequester, which imposed automatic spending cuts, he said.

""The core of the Tea Party movement, as I understand it, I think is very consistent with good conservative Republicanism,'' Christie said in the CNN interview. ""But some of the stuff that's happened of late down in Washington I think is not even consistent with what a lot of the real folks who started the Tea Party movement would agree with.''

The Tea Party is blurry by definition because it's a movement, not a party, says Adam Brandon of the Tea Party group Freedom Works. ""The Tea Party is an easy punching bag ... from the left and it's a punching bag from the right. There's no one out there really defending it,'' he says. ""It's too easy to fall into a situation where if you're a challenger you're automatically a Tea Party candidate, (or) if you're not handpicked by the establishment you're a Tea Party candidate.''

What works instead, Brandon says, is for Republicans to avoid labels and talk about cutting spending and taxes, the Tea Party's core issues. ""Even if people have a negative view of the Tea Party, they have a positive view of all these issues we're talking about.''

Rob Collins, chief strategist for the Senate GOP's 2014 campaign operation, said Democrats' focus on GOP divisions is overstated. ""It's not so much an ideological rift, it's more of a tactical rift. Strategically, we all want the same thing,"" he told reporters this week.

But Collins acknowledged that the GOP is facing pressure not only from grass-roots activists and outside groups that are attempting to harness them, but also increasingly from its mainstream constituencies such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the business lobby .

""There's a whole lot of folks out there that are Tea Party and then there's — call them what you want — the elites, the D.C.-based leaders of folks … and those are different creatures,"" Collins said. ""In order for us to win in the fall and also elect the right candidate, we need the Tea Party, we need the business crowd, we need everybody pulling on the same oar.""

That may not happen, Carender says. If voters now see little distinction between Republicans and Tea Partiers, they should wait until 2014 when the conflict between establishment GOP and grass-roots-backed candidates will make the distinctions clear, she says. ""There's going to be some serious primary battles going on.''

Sessions: 'Jack Lew Must Never Be Secretary of Treasury',"On Wednesday, the Ranking Member of the Senate Budget Committee Jeff Sessions (R-AL) said he plans to vigorously oppose President Barack Obama’s Treasury Secretary nominee Jack Lew.

“Jack Lew must never be Secretary of Treasury,” said Mr. Sessions in a statement. “His testimony before the Senate Budget Committee less than two years ago was so outrageous and false that it alone disqualifies.”

On Feb. 13, 2011, Mr. Lew appeared on CNN’s State of the Union with Candy Crowley and said of Mr. Obama’s proposed budget:

Our budget will get us, over the next several years, to the point where we can look the American people in the eye and say we’re not adding to the debt anymore; we’re spending money that we have each year, and then we can work on bringing down our national debt.

During Senate testimony, Mr. Sessions blasted Mr. Lew’s false statement and said he was “flatly in error”:

Lew, who is a former director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), has at times displayed a striking level of ignorance over how the budgetary process operates.

During the Crowley interview, Mr. Lew said that the reason Mr. Obama has failed to pass a budget in the Senate is because such bills can be filibustered. But as anyone familiar with the process knows, budgets are considered “privileged,” meaning they do not require a filibuster-proof majority 60 votes and can instead be passed with a simple majority.

Mr. Lew repeated the elementary error to NBC’s David Gregory. “One of the things about the United States Senate that I think the American people don’t realize,” said Mr. Lew confidently, “is that it takes 60 votes, not 50, to pass something.”

One would think the former head of OMB–the nation’s top budget post–would know how the budget process works. But apparently Mr. Lew does not.

Now, Mr. Lew has been nominated to become Treasury Secretary of the United States in the worst economy since the Great Depression. That, says Mr. Sessions, cannot happen:

It’s time for a Secretary of Treasury to look the American people in the eye and lay out an economic plan for America that will end our debt path that has endangered our future and which will find support among the American people and the world’s financial community. Far from being a positive force towards this essential good, Mr. Lew has given priority to the political interests of the President, in whose White House inner circle he has now served for several years. At this time of unprecedented slow growth, high unemployment, and huge deficits, we need a Secretary of Treasury that the American people, the Congress, and the world will know is up to the task of getting America on the path to prosperity not the path to decline. Jack Lew is not that man.

Questions have also emerged over a $950,000 bonus Mr. Lew received in 2009 in his role as chief operating officer of Citigroup’s Alternative Investments unit–a group that bet billions against homeowners paying their mortgages. Mr. Obama has previously railed against “obscene” Wall Street bonuses wherein “fat cats” get “awarded for their failure.” Still, Mr. Lew took the money.

In a letter to Mr. Lew, Sen. Chuck Grassley asked, “How is it in the public’s interest for you to receive a $1 million bonus on the eve of a massive $301 billion commitment to rescue Citigroup?”

Mr. Lew’s response: “My position at Citi was a management position. I was not an investment adviser. My compensation was in line with other management executives at the firm and in similarly complex operations.”

It is presently unknown whether Mr. Sessions plans to filibuster the Jack Lew nomination."

He was offering post-speech analysis on MSNBC, along with Rachel Maddow, Ed Schultz and Chris Hayes. Matthews said that it would be ""frightening"" if Republican lawmakers controlled states like Pennsylvania, suggesting that they would try to break up blocs of black, Democratic voters.

Maddow agreed. That could happen in ""Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Virginia [and] Ohio,"" she said.

""There's so much willingness to rig the elections by the Republicans,"" Matthews said. ""They know they’re heading into demographic trouble. They know they're going to be a minority in this country. It's almost like Lebanon — we've got to fake the census now, y'know?""

""And what I see them doing is saying, 'Okay, we know we're never going to be popular again, so we're going to have to rig it,"" he remarked."

As part of a general revision of old codes, the City Council changed a law that required some English on storefront signs because of fears that the language in the measure was unconstitutional. A proposed amendment, to be considered this week, requires the use of “modern Latin” letters on storefront signs.

It’s actually a looser requirement than the old law, which called for English words, not just letters. But that was lost in translation. After unanimously giving first approval to the ordinance last week, city leaders in the majority-Asian community say they’ve been inundated with negative media coverage and calls from upset residents.

“It has kind of spiraled,” Mayor Teresa Real Sebastian said.

Now some city leaders are beating a hasty retreat. One council member wants to avoid regulating language on signs altogether, and another said he would make a motion to delay action on the ordinance when it goes up for the second reading Wednesday.

The sudden furor and quick backtrack suggest a sea change in city politics from the racially charged 1980s, when Chinese immigrants rapidly transformed Monterey Park.

At the time, English-language requirements for commercial signs were hallmarks of a larger racial conflict. Three council members tried to get English declared the official language of the city and sponsored ordinances that would require all signs to use only English. Community groups launched recall efforts.

A wave of demographic change washed away much of the strife. Since 1980, census records show, the Asian population of Monterey Park has nearly doubled, nearing 67% in 2010. Four of five council members in office have Chinese last names.

Drive down Valley Boulevard or Garvey Avenue in Monterey Park and you’ll find mostly Chinese signs with a few begrudging, somewhat cryptic, letters in English. One northern Chinese restaurant whose Mandarin name evokes beauty and equality is known simply as “H&H.;” Others use such easily remembered acronyms as “ABC,” or they forgo English altogether.

This latest attempt to regulate signs, city leaders say, isn’t about race. Across the San Gabriel Valley, cities such as Rosemead, Temple City, San Marino and San Gabriel all have some requirements for English or English lettering on commercial signs.

English requirements for signs are about public safety, city leaders say. Police and firefighters who can’t read the languages of the ethnic communities they work in need some way of identifying businesses during emergencies.

Police Chief Jim Smith said no public safety incident prompted the code change. He supported it, he said, because it would help police officers do their jobs. Fire Chief Jim Birrell also supported the change in a letter to the City Council.

Advertisement

An informal “windshield” survey indicated that just one business would be affected by the change, according to City Atty. Mark Hensley, and he says the new language actually brings more business owners into compliance.

But for many residents, sign language is still “a sensitive, emotional issue,” Councilman Hans Liang said.

Advertisement

He initially voted for the change because he thought it would help firefighters and police officers do their jobs. Now he wants to delay action because, he says, it is a solution in search of a problem.

“There needs to be a better way of addressing this rather than making an ordinance,” Liang said.

Advertisement

John Man, president of the Monterey Park Chamber of Commerce, said he wants city officials to proceed more carefully. Many business owners didn’t know the city had laws on the use of English on signs, Man said.

“The business owners need to hear the reason for the change first,” Man said.

Advertisement

Former state Assemblyman Mike Eng, who served on Monterey Park’s council beginning in 2003, recalls when the issue splintered the city into ethnic coalitions. But he says the city has moved on.

“It’s something that used to divide us,” Eng said. “But that political battle that has run its course.”

Times Washington Bureau As An Editor In He Was A Foreign Correspondent In The Middle East In The', 'The Phelps Covered The Supreme Court', 'Justice Department For Newsday In The']",Filibuster rule’s end should help Obama reshape a key court,"WASHINGTON — On Monday, the U.S. Senate is scheduled to cast a historic vote to confirm Patricia Millett, an experienced Supreme Court advocate and taekwondo black belt, as a judge on the second-most powerful court in the land, tipping that court’s balance of power to Democrats for the first time in nearly three decades.

The next day, in a reminder of the importance of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, the U.S. Supreme Court will hear an appeal of a decision by two of the lower court’s Republican appointees that swept away one of the Environmental Protection Agency’s key air quality rules.

The impending confirmation of Millett and two additional Obama nominees to the D.C. Circuit, expected by Christmas, will give Democrats a 7-4 majority among full-time judges on a court that hears many of the most important cases on the powers of the federal government, ranging from labor law to banking regulation.

The court has been evenly split since Sri Srinivasan was confirmed in May, ending a Republican majority on the court. Republicans have fought tooth and nail to stop Democrats from taking control.

Senate Democrats last month voted to abolish the filibuster for most federal judgeships, obliterating a long-standing Senate rule that Democrats also had used during Republican presidencies to keep people they considered extreme off the lower courts. Many liberals are now hoping that President Obama and the Democratic-controlled Senate will take the opportunity to fill numerous judicial vacancies nationwide without having to worry about Republican filibusters.

Initially, however, the impact at the D.C. court may be modest. Unlike most federal appeals courts, the D.C. Circuit rarely meets as a group to issue opinions. But like other such courts, it issues most of its decisions in three-judge panels.

But close observers of the D.C. Circuit say the addition of Millett, plus Georgetown law professor Nina Pollard and U.S. District Court Judge Robert L. Wilkins — who personally won a landmark settlement against the Maryland State Police for racial profiling — will over time counter the rising influence of two archconservatives appointed by President George W. Bush.

The observers, who did not want to be identified discussing the inner workings of the court, said that the arrival in 2005 and 2006 of former California Supreme Court Justice Janice Rogers Brown and Brett Kavanaugh, a former top Whitewater prosecutor, changed the internal dynamics of the court.

Brown and Kavanaugh have been outspoken dissenters, which some feel has disturbed the tradition of comity on the court. And on panels where they teamed up with fellow Republicans to form a majority, as in the EPA case, they managed to pull the court’s decisions to the right.

The arrival of three Obama-appointed judges will probably change that, White House Counsel Kathryn Ruemmler said in an interview. “I think it’s really great for a very important court that decides issues of national importance,” she said.

Theoretically, the change in the filibuster rule will also improve Obama’s ability to influence other appeals courts and district courts across the country. But in most states, he is already encountering a new problem. Republicans are retaliating for the filibuster rule change by using another powerful tool to block nominees to other courts.

There is another arcane Senate tradition called the blue slip, for the colored piece of paper that both senators of a nominee’s home state are asked return to a Senate committee considering a nominee from that state.

Advertisement

An unfavorable comment from a nominee’s senator, or no opinion at all, has traditionally been enough to prevent a hearing and kill a nomination. And with at least one Republican senator in 31 states, some blue slips have already been withheld since the filibuster rule was changed. Republican senators in Arizona are even trying to block approval of judges they previously recommended.

“The reforms were wonderful, but no one thinks they ended anything,” said Nan Aron of the liberal lobbying group Alliance for Justice. “The fight goes on because the stakes are so huge.”

Advertisement

Even the White House acknowledged that despite all the hoopla about Obama’s potential ability to remake the federal judiciary, Republicans’ hold over the confirmation process has only been loosened, not broken.

“The filibuster rule itself was not … the only source of obstruction,” Ruemmler said. “I think in many ways the blue-slip rule is more problematic.”

Advertisement

Pressure is mounting on Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) to follow the filibuster change with modifications to the blue-slip tradition. Leahy has said he will continue to observe the tradition unless Republicans “abuse” their prerogatives.

But Ruemmler predicted the White House would have an easier time confirming judges in liberal states like California, New York and Maryland. In such states there would be no impediment to nominating even progressive judges who would not have been nominated previously because of fears they could not be confirmed.

“I think that it will make a pretty significant difference for courts of appeal from states with two Democratic senators,” she said.

Mitt Romney speaks with Chris Wallace on FOX News Sunday in Manchester, N.H. Wallace said on Sunday, Feb. 24, 2013, that he has landed the first post-election interview with Romney and his wife, Ann. The interview will air on his show next week (AP Photo/LM Otero, File)

WASHINGTON -- The bartender who secretly filmed Mitt Romney's infamous ""47 percent"" remarks at a Boca Raton fundraiser last May had an idea of what the former Massachusetts governor and GOP presidential nominee was really like. The two had crossed paths before.

The filmmaker tells The Huffington Post that he had actually met Romney at a previous fundraiser, held months before at the home of private equity manager Marc Leder. At that event, which included drinks and a quick speech by the presidential candidate, the would-be filmmaker also tended bar.

He and Romney shared a typical bartender-to-patron moment.

""I handed him a diet Coke with lemon on it,"" the filmmaker recalled, ""because I was told that that's what he drank.""

Romney didn't acknowledge his server at all.

""He took it and turned and didn't say anything,"" the filmmaker explained. ""I presented him the exact right drink that he wanted ... Had it there, sitting there on a napkin. He took it out of my hand and turned his back without a 'thank you' or anything else.""

HuffPost has agreed to withhold the name of the surreptitious filmmaker until he breaks his silence on MSNBC's ""The Ed Show"" Wednesday evening, followed by an appearance on HuffPost Live Thursday morning. In interviews over the last several months, he laid out his thinking before and after Romney's speech.

The filmmaker had worked in the service industry for years, starting out after high school as a club doorman in Boston. He slowly worked his way up to bartender and then operations manager and general manager at a downtown nightclub. He had wanted to be a cop and hoped to get a degree in criminal justice from Northeastern. When he couldn't afford to complete his degree, he still had his night-club jobs.

He moved to Florida about 10 years ago. He told HuffPost that former President Bill Clinton had partly inspired him to release the video: He had worked at a Clinton event at which the politician had made an effort to greet the cooks and waiters. Romney had been the opposite.

""You can tell a lot about someone the way they take a drink from you,"" he said. ""[Romney] took it and just turned his back."""

While Clinton never mentioned Obama by name, she used innuendo and some indirect references to try to separate herself from the president ahead of what is widely expected to be another run at the White House for her in 2016.

“I thought hard about what I wanted to say to Virginians today,” Clinton opened her remarks by saying. “I’ve been out of politics for a few years now. I’ve had a chance to think a lot about what makes our country so great, what kind of leadership is required to keep it great.”

Later in the speech, Clinton noted her work as Secretary of State and said she has come across leaders worldwide who divide and leaders who unite, a reference to Obama’s aloof and divisive style of politics and leadership.

“I’ve spent four years traveling across the globe, a great honor and privilege to represent all of you,” she said. “I’ve learned even more about what it takes to make the decisions, what it takes to bring people together to build the kind of future that we all want for our children and grandchildren. I’ve seen leaders who are divisive. And I’ve seen leaders who are unifiers. I’ve seen leaders who are exclusive. And I’ve seen leaders who are inclusive.”

A few minutes later, Clinton got even more direct in her criticism of current leadership in Washington, D.C., presumably a reference to both how Republicans and Democrats have handled ongoing policy battles.

“Now recently in Washington, unfortunately, we’ve seen examples of the wrong kind of leadership,” Clinton said. “When politicians choose scorched earth over common ground, when they operate in what I call the ‘evidence-free zone’ with ideology trumping everything else. We’ve seen that families in Virginia and across the country have felt the consequences, workers furloughed, businesses suffering, children thrown out of Head Start, poor mothers worried they won’t get the help they need to buy formula and food for their babies, that is not the kind of leadership we need in Virginia and America today.”

Clinton then touted bipartisanship, something that has been Obama’s weakest trait since being elected–a fact that has been on display even more so in recent weeks during the government shutdown and debt ceiling debate.

“Virginia has a history of getting it right, of electing problem-solving governors like Mark Warner and Tim Kaine,” she said. “We know well that both Mark and Tim reached across the aisle, focused on getting answers to the questions that Virginians had. That is the kind of leader Terry is. That is the kind of governor he will be.”

“For example, when Gov. McDonnell worked with the legislature to make historic investments in transportation that are vital to Virginia’s future, Terry supported him and the legislature every step of the way,” she explained. “Some might say: ‘Why would he do that? It’s a Republican governor and a Republican legislature.’ Well, there’s a simple answer: It was the right thing to do.”

Clinton also took a shot at people who are corrupted by ideology, by special interests, or both–another sideswipe at Obama. Much of the liberal base of the Democratic Party is upset that Obama has not been stricter with Wall Street and is similarly upset that he seems more consumed with ideology than with solving problems.

“If it’s only about yourself, if it’s only about you wanting to get a job and get the perks that go with it and, you know, have people stand up when you come into a room, that’s not enough anymore because it’s hard,” Clinton said. “Politics is hard, as the lieutenant governor and attorney general candidates know, because people are weary.”

“They’re wondering ‘Could I give this person my vote and will he then remember me? If I vote for him or her, will they do what I heard them say they will do? Will they get diverted by big money or ideology or power will they remember who put them into office?'” she continued. “I can tell you, you don’t have to worry about that with Terry McAuliffe.”"

The left-leaning Public Policy Polling surveyed voters in four key congressional districts, as well as House Speaker John Boehner's (R-Ohio) district, to gauge support for extending unemployment benefits. The poll, funded by the liberal advocacy group Americans United for Change, showed that voters across party lines were overwhelmingly in favor of extending the benefits, with 63 to 68 percent of voters in each district expressing support for preserving jobless benefits.

Voters in the four districts surveyed said they were less likely to vote for the Republican incumbent in 2014 -- by at least a 9-point margin -- were he to vote to cut off extended unemployment benefits.

Though jobless benefits are set to expire on Dec. 28 for 1.3 million longterm unemployed Americans, members of the House and Senate have returned home for the holidays without a solution to preserve those benefits. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has said it was an ""immorality"" that the benefits weren't secured in a recent budget deal, and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) has promised to bring the extension to a vote no later than Jan. 7, 2014.

Moderate Republicans urged Boehner and House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) to rescue jobless benefits for the longterm unemployed earlier in December, saying the issue was ""important to many American families."" But Boehner would only consider the proposal if cuts were made elsewhere and job growth guaranteed, and the measure ultimately did not make it into Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Rep. Paul Ryan's (R-Wis.) budget deal.

""Speaker Boehner and fellow Washington Republicans are hopelessly out-of-touch, and their decision to Scrooge over a million unemployed Americans three days after Christmas is the latest and among the worst examples of it,"" Jeremy Funk, communications director of Americans United for Change, said. ""All these struggling Americans got from the GOP for Christmas was a ‘Get Employed Soon’ card.""

Funk warned cuts to jobless benefits for the longterm unemployed would only put more Americans out of work, and bring a chain reaction of economic fallout in 2014.

""But it’s not just in America’s economic interest to extend [unemployment insurance] benefits, these polls show it’s in swing district Republicans’ own political interest to support the jobless in their districts,"" Funk said. ""Otherwise they just might join their ranks."""

So if you are the party committees in charge of electing Democrats in 2014, and your base is up in arms over President Barack Obama's unforced error on his budget's Social Security cuts, what do you do?

If you're smart, like the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, you say nothing (at least so far). Why rub salt in the wounds of your strongest supporters? But if you're the guys at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, you ask them to cheer louder. In an email blast:



What does backfire look like? Instead of compromising to get solutions on the budget, NRCC Chairman Greg Walden outrageously attacked parts of President Obama’s budget proposal that were included at the demand of Republicans.""

Ah yes, DCCC, your supporters are outraged that Republicans won't applaud the cutting of Social Security benefits—cuts, by the way, that weren't even included in Paul Ryan's draconian cut-everything-else budget. I'm sure that brought in the dough from outraged Democratic donors desperate for ""compromise"" with recalcitrant Republicans!

But the DCCC isn't the only one stepping off the cliff with the president. The Democratic Governor's Association decided to play lemming as well.



President Obama just released a budget for next year that will reduce the deficit while investing in the things we need to keep our economy competitive for the long-term – like pre-K for four-year olds. On the other side, Paul Ryan and House Republicans have a budget that spends your hard-earned money on tax breaks for the wealthiest, ends Medicare and Social Security as we know them, and slashes other critical programs. Stand with us in supporting President Obama’s budget and say no to Paul Ryan’s disaster of a plan.

There's no doubt that Ryan's budget is a piece of shit, but if you're going to be outraged at cuts in Ryan's budget (which again, doesn't include the president's chained CPI proposal), then why would you want to stand with Obama's budget?

You wouldn't. A Social Security cut is a Social Security cut, no matter who proposes it. Heck, it's worse when proposed by Democrats. Republicans are assholes. We expect them to slash the safety net. But Democrats? If we stand for anything at all, we stand for taking care of each other.

Sign this petition telling the DCCC and the DGA that that that's what we should be standing for. Not Obama's cut-Social Security budget."

Misunderstanding, misstatements and all the classic contortions of partisan message management surround the sequester, the term for the $85 billion in ugly and largely irrational federal spending cuts set by law to begin Friday.

What is the non-budget wonk to make of this? Who is responsible? What really happened?

The finger-pointing began during the third presidential debate last fall, on Oct. 22, when President Obama blamed Congress. “The sequester is not something that I’ve proposed,” Obama said. “It is something that Congress has proposed.”

The White House chief of staff at the time, Jack Lew, who had been budget director during the negotiations that set up the sequester in 2011, backed up the president two days later.

“There was an insistence on the part of Republicans in Congress for there to be some automatic trigger,” Lew said while campaigning in Florida. It “was very much rooted in the Republican congressional insistence that there be an automatic measure.”

The president and Lew had this wrong. My extensive reporting for my book “The Price of Politics” shows that the automatic spending cuts were initiated by the White House and were the brainchild of Lew and White House congressional relations chief Rob Nabors — probably the foremost experts on budget issues in the senior ranks of the federal government.

Obama personally approved of the plan for Lew and Nabors to propose the sequester to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.). They did so at 2:30 p.m. July 27, 2011, according to interviews with two senior White House aides who were directly involved.

Nabors has told others that they checked with the president before going to see Reid. A mandatory sequester was the only action-forcing mechanism they could devise. Nabors has said, “We didn’t actually think it would be that hard to convince them” — Reid and the Republicans — to adopt the sequester. “It really was the only thing we had. There was not a lot of other options left on the table.”

A majority of Republicans did vote for the Budget Control Act that summer, which included the sequester. Key Republican staffers said they didn’t even initially know what a sequester was — because the concept stemmed from the budget wars of the 1980s, when they were not in government.

At the Feb. 13 Senate Finance Committee hearing on Lew’s nomination to become Treasury secretary, Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) asked Lew about the account in my book: “Woodward credits you with originating the plan for sequestration. Was he right or wrong?”

“It’s a little more complicated than that,” Lew responded, “and even in his account, it was a little more complicated than that. We were in a negotiation where the failure would have meant the default of the government of the United States.”

One is to avoid the $1.2 trillion in spending cuts included in sequestration and another is raising the country’s debt ceiling. Here is a look at some of the issues involved in these two fiscal challenges. Sequester If Congress and Obama can’t reach a deal to avoid sequestration, then the country would see budget cuts of $1.2 trillion through 2021. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has said that the defense cuts would be a “disaster.” But if you look at this graph, the blow isn't as bad as the military has faced in the past. Even if the sequestration was implemented, the drop in spending would be less than the military experienced after the Korean, Vietnam or Cold wars. The Center for Strategic and International Studies Wait 1 second to continue.

“Did you make the suggestion?” Burr asked.

“Well, what I did was said that with all other options closed, we needed to look for an option where we could agree on how to resolve our differences. And we went back to the 1984 plan that Senator [Phil] Gramm and Senator [Warren] Rudman worked on and said that that would be a basis for having a consequence that would be so unacceptable to everyone that we would be able to get action.”

In other words, yes.

But then Burr asked about the president’s statement during the presidential debate, that the Republicans originated it.

Lew, being a good lawyer and a loyal presidential adviser, then shifted to denial mode: “Senator, the demand for an enforcement mechanism was not something that the administration was pushing at that moment.”

That statement was not accurate.

On Tuesday, Obama appeared at the White House with a group of police officers and firefighters to denounce the sequester as a “meat-cleaver approach” that would jeopardize military readiness and investments in education, energy and readiness. He also said it would cost jobs. But, the president said, the substitute would have to include new revenue through tax reform.

At noon that same day, White House press secretary Jay Carney shifted position and accepted sequester paternity.

“The sequester was something that was discussed,” Carney said. Walking back the earlier statements, he added carefully, “and as has been reported, it was an idea that the White House put forward.”

This was an acknowledgment that the president and Lew had been wrong.

Why does this matter?

First, months of White House dissembling further eroded any semblance of trust between Obama and congressional Republicans. (The Republicans are by no means blameless and have had their own episodes of denial and bald-faced message management.)

Second, Lew testified during his confirmation hearing that the Republicans would not go along with new revenue in the portion of the deficit-reduction plan that became the sequester. Reinforcing Lew’s point, a senior White House official said Friday, “The sequester was an option we were forced to take because the Republicans would not do tax increases.”

In fact, the final deal reached between Vice President Biden and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) in 2011 included an agreement that there would be no tax increases in the sequester in exchange for what the president was insisting on: an agreement that the nation’s debt ceiling would be increased for 18 months, so Obama would not have to go through another such negotiation in 2012, when he was running for reelection.

So when the president asks that a substitute for the sequester include not just spending cuts but also new revenue, he is moving the goal posts. His call for a balanced approach is reasonable, and he makes a strong case that those in the top income brackets could and should pay more. But that was not the deal he made."

In December, just after he won a second term, Obama held an 18-percentage-point advantage over congressional Republicans on the question of whom the public trusted more to deal with the economy. Now, it’s a far more even split — 44 percent to 40 percent, with a slight edge for the president — but the share of those saying they have confidence in “neither” has ticked up into double digits.

The poll contains ample evidence of the disillusionment voters feel toward both sides amid a sense of continuing dysfunction in Washington, which since December has been grappling with fiscal crises and deadlines of its own making.

Almost two weeks into the automatic across-the-board budget cuts known as the sequester, a slim majority of Americans dis­approve of the reductions. At the same time, nearly three-quarters say they are feeling no impact on their lives, and fewer than half expect a toll on their family finances if the cuts continue.

Still, large majorities expect that the sequester will eventually damage the economy, the military and the government’s ability to provide basic services. Most, 68 percent, say they would like the two sides to work together to come up with a deal to stop the cuts. The desire for cooperation is widely shared across party lines.

Asked who is responsible for the sequester, 47 percent say Republicans in Congress and 33 percent say Obama.

The poll suggests a closer divide on which side the public trusts in the battles over issues such as immigration and gun control — closer, perhaps, than the public’s policy preferences would indicate. Americans largely support the administration’s stand on new measures to curb gun violence, but on basic trust on the issue, the president and Republicans in Congress fare about evenly.

Obama’s overall job-approval rating stands at 50 percent, down five points from before he took the oath of office in January. Looking along partisan lines, the slippage since then has been particularly pronounced among political independents. Two months ago, independents tilted clearly in his direction, with 54 percent approving and 41 percent disapproving. Now, half of independents express a negative opinion of the president’s performance; just 44 percent approve.

The president has also seen an erosion in confidence among groups that he has counted as core supporters. Compared with a Post-ABC poll in December, the share of liberals who place their faith in Obama over Republicans when it comes to dealing with the economy is 14 points lower; there has been a 12-point slide among women.

At 50 percent, Obama’s overall standing in the poll is lower than that of most other modern second-term presidents at this point in their terms. Of the seven second-term presidents who have been in office since Harry S. Truman, only George W. Bush had a positive rating as low as 50 percent at this stage.

Obama and Bush share another similarity, one that describes what is arguably the most potent force shaping political decision-making in recent years: a deeply divided electorate. Among post-World War II presidents, Bush and Obama are the only ones to have led a nation as politically polarized as it is today. In both cases, there is a gap of more than 70 points between Democratic and Republican assessments of the president.

Congress remains far lower than the president in public esteem, with only 16 percent approving of its performance and 80 percent disapproving. That negative feeling extends to both parties, with congressional Democrats registering a ratio of 34 percent favorable to 62 percent unfavorable sentiment; Republicans are lower still, at 24 to 72.

The poll was conducted March 7 to 10 among a random sample of 1,001 adults. The full survey has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.

At a moment when the statistics — a booming stock market and surprising new strength in the job market — suggest a more vigorous economy, many Americans are not themselves seeing progress.

Barely more than half of those surveyed say the economy has started its recovery. And after a brief foray into neutral territory, most Americans again give Obama negative marks on handling the economy. The personal assessments of the economy’s trajectory relate directly to Obama’s overall rating: Seventy-three percent of those who say they sense economic growth approve of the way the president is doing his job, and an identical 73 percent of those who don’t see a recovering economy disapprove of his performance in office.

As they do on the economy, the president and the Republican opposition have rough parity on the question of who is better positioned on gun control, with Obama the choice of 42 percent and congressional Republicans, 41 percent.

On immigration, Obama has a six-point advantage, with 45 percent saying they trust him more and 39 percent expressing greater confidence in the Republicans’ approach. The margin may be surprisingly slender, given big majority support for a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants and strong Latino support for Obama in the November election.

Nor does the election seem to have produced a lasting consensus on which side is better equipped to figure out what government spending should be cut and what services preserved. When it comes to finding the right balance, 44 percent side with Republicans and 43 percent with the president.

The poll also confirms one of the political verities of deficit reduction: People may want to see an end to red ink, but there is rarely public support for reductions in popular social programs to achieve it.

Asked about alternatives to the automatic cuts now in place, 71 percent reject a reduction in Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor, and 60 percent oppose raising the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 67.

There is broader but still limited support for slicing business tax deductions. Most, 56 percent, say they back limiting tax deductions for high-income earners as part of a path out of the sequester. Tax reform is often considered a quid pro quo for reining in entitlement spending, which is a long-term driver of deficit spending.

A Post-ABC News poll last week found broad opposition to the across-the-board cuts to the military that started March 1 with the sequester, but there is majority support in the new survey for more targeted defense cuts.

The Republican consultant and his team had raised piles of cash to use in California politics as last November’s election approached. But a wrinkle in state law meant he couldn’t spend it in the final two months of the campaign without jeopardizing the anonymity he had promised his rich donors.

So Russo turned to what he called “the Koch network.” He asked a political consultant who has worked with billionaire Republican contributors Charles and David Koch to shuttle the money through an Arizona nonprofit. That group, which is not required to reveal its donors, could send cash to California causes without names attached.

But things went from bad to worse. Although Russo handed over $25 million, only about $15 million ended up back in California. And when the money surfaced, it sparked an investigation by state authorities, who last month levied $16 million in penalties against the Arizona group and three others.

The case offers a rare glimpse into the shadowy world of politically active nonprofits, which have played an increasing role in elections nationwide since the U.S. Supreme Court eased campaign rules in 2010. They provide donors a way to influence elections by piping major money around the country until it resurfaces — without their fingerprints — in a campaign.

Advocates of transparency in government call it “dark money.”

Russo declined to be interviewed by The Times. But he and his colleagues detailed their experience for California investigators, conversations that were recorded in hundreds of pages of transcripts.

Those records and other documents released by authorities show a convoluted money trail. They also show the risks of operating in a political world so intricate that even Russo didn’t fully understand how it worked when he threw in his donors’ money.

“There’s all kinds of groups all over the country that I wouldn’t even know,” Russo said.

::

California Republicans faced two major battles last year: a fight against Gov. Jerry Brown’s tax hike and a push to pass a measure that would limit unions’ political fundraising.

Russo did not think the state party was up to the task. He envisioned an independent advertising pitch to voters that would tout economic destruction wrought by tax increases and political havoc caused by powerful California labor unions.

To bring in the big money needed for a statewide television campaign, Russo worked with GOP consultant Jeff Miller, lead fundraiser for former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and for Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s 2012 presidential campaign. Miller declined to be interviewed by The Times.

The Fisher family, of the clothing firm Gap Inc., contributed more than $9 million. San Francisco investor Charles Schwab gave $6.4 million, and Los Angeles philanthropist Eli Broad sent $1 million.

The money went to a Virginia nonprofit that would use it to pay for the ad blitz and be allowed to keep the contributors secret. Nonprofits, unlike political action committees, are not required to identify their donors under federal law.

Many donors did not want to “put their name on … this fight because they didn’t want to face the retribution of the unions,” Miller told state investigators. Deep-pocketed labor groups were planning major campaign efforts in 2012, and some conservatives were wary of crossing them.

But by the time the money was pouring in, summer was turning into fall. If the donations were spent after early September, there was a risk that the veil would have to be lifted on those who wrote the checks, in accordance with California’s complex campaign laws.

That’s when Russo turned to Republican strategist Sean Noble, who has worked as a consultant for the Koch brothers and whom he had met on a trip to Las Vegas the year before.

Noble heads the Center to Protect Patient Rights, an Arizona nonprofit known as a clearinghouse for conservative causes. In 2010, the organization had distributed more than $55 million to 26 groups allied with Republicans to help them in the midterm elections.

Robert Tappan, a spokesman for Koch Industries, confirmed that Noble has worked for the Koch brothers as a political consultant. Charles and David Koch did not play any role in California campaigns last year, Tappan said.

Noble declined to speak with investigators, according to Gary Winuk, enforcement chief at the California Fair Political Practices Commission, and he did not answer requests for comment from The Times.

Noble had already helped Russo with hundreds of thousands of dollars for political research and focus groups. Now Russo needed a different kind of assistance.

He wanted the Virginia group, Americans for Job Security, to transfer the millions he had raised with Miller to Noble’s center, and he wanted Noble to relay the money to California campaign committees, obscuring the money trail.

There were risks. Russo and Miller would forfeit control of the donations, and they knew little about Noble. But donors had recommended him, the pair told investigators. And “we were running out of options,” Miller said.

On Sept. 10, the Virginia group sent about $4 million to Noble’s Center to Protect Patient Rights. Within a few days, the center routed roughly the same sum to an Iowa nonprofit, which sent it to a newly created California campaign committee.

Russo and Miller then directed $20.5 million more to the center, for a total of nearly $25 million.

The state documents show that one of the donors working with Russo and Miller, whose name was crossed out, emailed Charles Koch to ask for his direct assistance.

“It would be great if you could support the final effort with several million,” the donor wrote, adding that “Sean Noble from your group has been immensely helpful,” and “I look forward to seeing you on a golf course.”

::

A month before the November election, the whole operation came crashing down.

At that point, Noble had routed about $4 million to a California campaign committee. Russo sent him a text message asking for more cash, and $11 million was quickly delivered to the Small Business Action Committee, a California PAC fighting higher taxes and supporting the anti-union measure.

The money had come from an obscure Phoenix nonprofit, Americans for Responsible Leadership, which had received it from the Center to Protect Patient Rights.

An $11-million donation attracts immediate attention, even in a state as large as California. Americans for Responsible Leadership refused to tell the Fair Political Practices Commission, California’s ethics watchdog, where the money originated, and the agency launched an investigation to determine whether disclosure laws had been violated.

That heat created a problem. When Russo next asked Noble to transfer money, Noble balked. Expressing concern about the investigation, Noble said he didn’t think he could help now, Russo told investigators.

Miller believed Noble hoped to prevent California authorities “from opening up his books,” giving them the keys to an entire network of nonprofits that were distributing money around the country.

Russo never pried another dime from Noble. Russo said he and Miller scrambled to raise more cash to make up for the rest of the funds.

Miller said he was angry. “But at that point,” he said, “we were screwed, you know, because we didn’t have any legal control.”

On election day, voters passed Brown’s tax-hike plan and rejected the anti-union measure, delivering two blows to the Republicans.

Late last month, state officials announced they were fining the Center to Protect Patient Rights and Americans for Responsible Leadership a total of $1 million for violating California law. The groups should have disclosed that the center was the source of the campaign money but had failed to do so, authorities said.

The Small Business Action Committee and another California campaign group were ordered to pay the state $15 million, equivalent to the amount of money state officials said was improperly reported. The Iowa group that was the conduit for $4 million was not fined because it is more established in California politics, Winuk said.

Russo, sitting in his lawyer’s Sacramento office in July, told authorities he still wasn’t sure what happened to the $10 million that never came back to California.

(Mark Wilson/Getty Images)

With little more than a week to go before a potential government shutdown, Washington feels like a car without a driver on a road without a guardrail.

As it hurtles toward the edge, no one — conservatives, GOP leadership, congressional Democrats, the White House — seems to have a way to stop it.

Lurching from near-calamity to near-catastrophe has become a way of life in the capital, which has stood at the edge of a financial precipice at least four times since the end of 2010.

What makes these crises all the more exasperating is that none of them seem to resolve the political and ideological disputes that cause them. All they do is put both sides on a course toward the next disaster zone.

The one immediately ahead arises from the fact that the fiscal year will end on Sept. 30 without Congress having passed any of the spending bills needed to keep the government in operation going into 2014.

The Post's Jackie Kucinich discusses the battle between the House and the Senate as a government shutdown nears. (The Washington Post)

Without at least a stopgap funding bill, most nonessential federal operations will come to a halt.

Benefits payments, such as Social Security checks, would still go out, and critical functions such as national security would continue. But military pay would probably be delayed, hundreds of thousands of federal employees would be furloughed and attractions such as national parks would close.

“After five years spent digging out of crisis, the last thing we need is for Washington to manufacture another,” President Obama said in his weekly address Saturday, noting the fragility of the economic recovery. “But that’s what will happen in the next few weeks if Congress doesn’t meet two deadlines.”

The most pressing issue is a demand by conservative groups and tea party lawmakers that any spending measure include a provision that would strip funding for the health-care overhaul, which is set to kick into gear on Oct. 1.

The Republican-led House has passed a bill that would accomplish that, but it stands no chance in the Senate, which is virtually certain to send it back “clean,” meaning with full funding for the law that is known as Obamacare.

Even if they figure a way around this stalemate and keep the government open, a graver crisis is coming up quickly on its heels as the government hits the limit of its borrowing authority some time in mid- to late October. If Congress does not raise the debt ceiling, it could force the nation into default and the global financial markets into chaos.

Conservatives and tea party activists insist that Republicans will be rewarded for going to the barricades to stop the health-care law.

And just about every poll shows that, three years after its passage, Obamacare remains unpopular with voters. In the latest Washington Post-ABC News poll, 52 percent said they disapprove of the law; only 42 percent said they support it.

But Americans are even less enchanted with the idea of bringing the government to a halt as a means of blocking Obamacare.

The Republicans’ own numbers show that. In a recent survey conducted by David Winston, a pollster who advises the House GOP, 71 percent said they opposed “shutting down the government as a way to defund the President’s health care law.” Only 23 percent approved.

In an interview, Winston said that even the Republicans who were surveyed said a shutdown is a bad idea, 53 percent to 37 percent.

“I know when you get led into a box canyon what that means,” said Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), evoking imagery of an infamous method by which buffalo were slaughtered in the Old West. “Box canyon, here we come.”

Democrats are convinced they have the upper hand. The president has maintained that he will not negotiate with Republicans on the funding bill or the debt ceiling — a point he repeated to House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) in a telephone call Friday night. Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) plans to ensure that no bill defunding the health-care law reaches Obama’s desk.

From time to time, the fiscal year has brought partial, temporary shutdowns — nine of them, for instance, between fiscal 1981 and fiscal 1995. But they were over relatively narrow disputes, and none lasted more than three days.

Then-Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) was the first to engineer one as a strategy to wage a broader policy battle, with President Bill Clinton in 1995.

Gingrich and his forces had many advantages in 1995 that today’s Republicans do not. Their party’s standing with voters was stronger, they controlled both houses of Congress, and they were far more united than Republicans are today.

When he began laying plans for a year-end government shutdown, he was still at the height of his influence, after having led the House Republicans through an election that produced their first majority in four decades.

“This is the heart of the revolution,” Gingrich told Time magazine in June 1995.

“He can run the parts of government that are left, or he can run no government,” Gingrich said of Clinton. “Which of the two of us do you think worries more about the government not showing up?”

That year actually produced two shutdowns — one in November lasting five days and a second from mid-December to early January that went on for 21 days.

In the current telling of some conservative groups, the Republicans won that showdown.

That is not a widely held view among those who actually lived through it. They note that the 1995-96 shutdown helped resurrect Clinton’s presidency and put him on the way to a landslide reelection over GOP nominee Bob Dole.

“Prior to the shutdown, it looked as though the Republican nominee was going to be able to defeat Clinton handily. After the shutdown, Dole was clearly behind and struggling,” said Winston, who worked as an aide to Gingrich in the late 1990s. “Looking at any of the survey numbers, the shutdown was clearly a negative for Republicans.”

Nor did it do much to change the trajectory of federal spending, as the Republicans had promised it would.

“We gained almost nothing. It was a rounding error,” said Steve Bell of the Bipartisan Policy Center, who was a longtime top Republican staffer on the Senate Budget Committee. “It was subsumed by the next year’s economic forecast.”

But fewer than one in five of those now serving in the House were around for that earlier standoff.

One of them is Boehner, Bell noted. “I know the speaker, who went through that, knows who has the bully pulpit and who is going to get blamed,” he said.

Newer GOP members have come to power in a more unbending political culture, partly because of the rise of the tea party movement and partly because of the way their district lines are drawn.

An analysis this past week by the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics found that 94 of the House’s 233 Republicans come from districts in which GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney got 60 percent or more of the vote. Practically speaking, that means they come from areas so conservative that they have more to fear from a primary challenger on the right than they do from a Democrat in a general election.

The Senate, on the other hand, is a vastly different political landscape.

Although firebrands led by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) have been egging on their party for a showdown, other Republicans in the Senate fear that overreaching now could squander their chance of regaining a majority in next year’s midterm elections.

Besides that, it won’t work.

“We would be telling people that we’re defunding Obamacare when we really aren’t — so little of it is contained in annual appropriations,” said Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), who has strong credentials on the right. “We’re held in low-enough regard without telling people we’re doing something when we really aren’t.”

Nor will a bill that defunds the health-care law survive the Senate — a fact Cruz conceded after the House passed the measure he had pushed for so strenuously.

Under the Senate rules, Reid needs only 51 votes to defeat the Cruz-backed amendment that would eliminate spending for the health-care law. With 54 members in his caucus, it is a cinch he can get them.

So the only option left for Cruz to obstruct passage of a stopgap spending measure sets up a truly perverse situation — he can filibuster the House-passed bill when it comes to the Senate, even though that means blocking the very Obamacare-defunding measure that he and his allies worked so hard to get the House to approve.

On Saturday, the conservative organization Heritage Action for America sent out a bulletin urging senators to do just that. But the whole thing has left flummoxed Senate Republicans wondering what kind of double somersault it would take to explain all of this to their constituents back home.

Meanwhile, back in the House, Boehner and his forces are struggling to figure out an endgame. They will have to scramble, because Reid is expected to wait until the last minute to return a Senate-passed bill to their chamber.

In other words, the week ahead promises yet another installment of cliffhanger legislating, Washington’s new normal. And then, it’s on to the next crisis."

He has been struggling against Booker%2C nationally known in a state with more Democratic voters

PARSIPPANY, N.J. — The inconvenience of a federal government shutdown is worth the trouble if it can derail Obamacare, the Republican nominee for the unexpired term of New Jersey's late senator said in a meeting with Gannett New Jersey newspapers' editorial boards.

If he were in the Senate today, Steve Lonegan said he would join Republican efforts to tie the budget to a delay in the Affordable Care Act.

""If some people are inconvenienced by the shutdown of the federal government in order to drive this issue, to drive this debate, to stop the implementation of this health care system before it causes more problems, then that's a battle we need to have now. I would be holding the line on it until we can make that happen,"" Lonegan said Thursday.

New Jersey's special election to fill the unexpired term of Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., is Oct. 16. While Newark, N.J., Mayor Cory Booker leads by 13 percentage points among likely voters in the latest poll out Tuesday, the Democratic nominee's lead has shrunk by 3 percentage points since mid-August.

Lonegan said congressional Republicans' offer represents a sound compromise because the health care law isn't ready to launch. It should be delayed while the government continues to operate, preferably with a spending cut.

""There is room for compromise, and I believe the Republicans have offered that compromise,"" Lonegan said. ""There are significant questions and uncertainties, and it's creating way too much chaos in the economy. The Republican offer to simply postpone the implementation of Obamacare for one year — exactly like the president has offered to some of his major corporate supporters, giving them an out — every American should have the same opportunity.""

Booker had said he would attend the editorial board meeting but then backed out, citing a scheduling conflict. The nationally prominent Democrat and Lonegan clashed Friday in a debate taped in Trenton, N.J., which is scheduled to be televised in the state Sunday. In the debate, Booker sought to link Lonegan to the tea party movement though one tea party group in August endorsed a rival for the Republican Party nomination.

Lonegan and Booker have one more debate Wednesday, and turnout will be important at a time when many voters are focused on the November general election where races for governor, lieutenant governor, state senators and General Assembly are on the ballot.

On Thursday, Lonegan said the health care reform law should be replaced by free-market policies. He said malpractice lawsuits against doctors should be limited, people should be able to purchase health insurance plans offered in other states, and doctors should get tax credits and exemptions from malpractice lawsuits for pro bono services provided at free health clinics.

Lonegan, a former director of the state chapter of the free-market advocacy group Americans for Prosperity, easily captured the GOP primary.

He's a former three-term mayor of Bogata, N.J., population 8,200, who has made unsuccessful bids for state Senate, the House of Representatives and the Republican nomination for governor. He used to own a cabinetry business, and now owns a custom home-building business.

""My background in building a business, my background in governing a town effectively makes me a better candidate for the U.S. Senate than my opponent. It makes me one of the best candidates for U.S. Senate in the country,"" said Lonegan, who said Booker has a ""record of failure"" as Newark's mayor, pointing to the city's unemployment rate, high school dropout rate and violent crime. Newark is New Jersey's largest city with a population of more than 275,000.

Lonegan hopes to be appointed to the Senate Finance Committee if he wins the election. He said he would like to get laws passed that would deactivate and re-establish a regulatory body — such as the Environmental Protection Agency, Occupational Safety and Health Administration or Internal Revenue Service — every seven years and compel a review on whether to reinstate each of an agency's rules.

He wants Congress to approve any new federal regulations, he said.

""You may not agree with me on my ideas on every one of these issues, but they're founded in that simple belief in liberty,"" Lonegan said. ""I think that you're going to see in the debates — I know you're going to see — that Mr. Booker is founded in nothing other than a desire to be a politician."""

Obama, said Romney, has been traveling around the country ""berating Republicans and blaming and pointing"" over the sequester. The former Massachusetts governor, who along with his wife, Ann Romney, was interviewed by ""Fox News Sunday"" host Chris Wallace, said Obama's tactic ""causes Republicans to retrench and they put up a wall and fight back—it's a very natural, human emotion.""

It doesn't appear as if Congress will pass a budget before the March 1 midnight deadline. The White House claims the across-the-board spending cuts set to go into effect will be devastating, and that its negative impact is already rippling through the country.

Romney also criticized the government for deciding this week to release select noncriminal immigration detainees for budget reasons ahead of sequester cuts, and cast the decision as a political ploy.

""I think if there are people who are incarcerated, [Obama] should make sure that we're able to keep them in jail. Look, again, it's politics. It's, OK, how do we do something that will get a headline that will make it look like those terrible Republicans aren't willing to come together?” Romney said.

Romney has avoided the press since his loss to Obama. In his interview with Fox, he likened the election and its aftermath to an amusement park ride.

""We were on a roller coaster, exciting and thrilling, ups and downs. But the ride ends,"" Romney said. ""And then you get off. And it's not like, oh, can't we be on a roller coaster the rest of our life? It's like, no, the ride's over.""

Ann Romney said they were suddenly ""nobody."" She noted: ""In our church, we're used to serving, and you know, you can be in a very high position, but you recognize you're serving. And now all of a sudden, you're released and you're nobody. And we're used to that. It's like we came and stepped forward to serve. And you know, the other part of it was an amazing thing, and it was really quite a lot of energy and a lot of passion and a lot of—a lot of people around us and all of a sudden, it was nothing.""

The dip was the second quarterly drop in a row. At the end of last year, on the heels of his reelection, Obama’s approval rating stood at 51.9%. His approval rating is near the bottom of second-term Presidents at this point in their tenure.

Both Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton had significantly higher approval ratings at this point in their Presidencies. Reagan enjoyed a 58.7% approval rating, while Clinton’s approval was slightly lower, 56.3%. Gallup notes that Obama’s poll numbers more closely resemble George W. Bush and Harry Truman. Truman’s approval rating was 48.7%. Bush’s was slightly lower than Obama’s at 47.3%.

Over the next three months, the 19th Quarter in office, every modern President has seen a decline in their approval ratings, with the exceptions of Reagan and Clinton. Both Presidents were presiding over a strong and growing economy. Obama will be presiding, at best, over a weak and stagnant economy.

Obama faces particular challenges over the next three months, however. This Fall, Washington will be consumed with another fight over raising the nation’s debt ceiling and passing a budget. The last time Obama and Congress fought over the debt ceiling, his approval ratings fell to the lowest of his time in office, 41%.

Also, in October a major piece of his ObamaCare law is scheduled to go into effect, the federal and state health insurance exchanges. As with any major government undertaking, there are likely going to be problems with the implementation. Massive problems, however, which are not unlikely, could further erode Obama’s approval.

Obama’s challenge is that he is in a weak position to absorb those threats to his approval. Just a drop of a few points would put his approval in the low 40s. That is a weak position heading into an important election year, when the Democrats are at serious risk of losing control of the Senate.

Senate Democrats would likely continue to chart their own course, moving themselves away from Obama and the White House. The success or failure of Obama’s second term may be decided this Fall."

Thune discussed national debt%2C spending and tax reform at town hall

Senator defended vote on maintaining tax rates for those making %24400%2C000

Congress faces vote in next six weeks to lift debt ceiling beyond %2416.3 trillion

SIOUX FALLS, S.D. -- Republicans in Congress could take President Barack Obama to court if the president decides to lift the nation's debt limit without congressional approval, Sen. John Thune said Wednesday.

Thune said the president doesn't have the constitutional authority to lift the debt ceiling, even though Democrats in Congress are encouraging the president to try.

A divided Congress faces another nasty showdown in the next six weeks to lift the debt ceiling beyond $16.3 trillion. The president this week framed the debate as Congress needing to pay the debts it's incurred. But Thune said the debate also should include spending cuts to address the reasons why the nation has the debt, and he said past spending reforms have been tied to the debt ceiling.

""I don't know when it happens, but this thing is going to blow up on us if we don't do something,"" Thune said of the debt.

Thune made his comments at a town hall meeting Wednesday that focused on the national debt, spending and tax reform.

The only way to address the national debt in a substantial way is to make reforms to entitlement programs, including Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, Thune said. Solutions to Medicare include phasing in age adjustments so that younger people wouldn't be eligible to join the program until later in age, and to require wealthier Medicare recipients pay into the systems in order to get benefits.

The senator defended his New Year's Eve vote on a package that left taxes on income rates in place for all but those making $400,000 or more a year, or couples making $450,000. The measure also locked into place exemptions on estate taxes, which Thune said was important for farmers and ranchers who worried a large estate tax meant the loss of the family farm.

Conservatives, however, criticized the package because it didn't include spending cuts to government programs. When asked why he voted for the measure, Thune said he did it to keep taxes low for 99 percent of Americans.

""There's been a lot of criticism, and I understand that,"" Thune said. ""There are things in there I absolutely hated.""

Several people at the town hall expressed frustrations about Republicans in Congress being unable to get their messages out and to effectively block the Obama administration and Senate Democrats.

""I'm concerned for our country, and I just feel like we're losing it every day,"" said Jim Holiway of Sioux Falls. Holiway asked Thune what actions he would take to prevent the federal government from becoming more centralized.

Later, following the town hall, Holiway said he wished Republican elected officials would make speeches and take to the airwaves the way Democrats did when they were in the minority.

""When they were in the minority, they would holler to high heaven,"" Holiway said.

Politicians have become more reluctant to hold town halls for fear angry voters will confront them and the exchanges will be used in campaign commercials. Thune is the only member of the South Dakota delegation who consistently holds town halls.

At least one Democrat, former state lawmaker Darrell Solberg, asked Thune to clarify whether Medicare and Social Security were separate funds and their relations to the national debt.

Democrat Tom Cool said Republican presidents Reagan and Bush tripled the national debt, but Republicans didn't worry about it then. Cool said the debt won't be brought under control by Republicans in the House refusing to extend the debt ceiling.

""I don't know how elephants can have such poor memories,"" Cool said.

Ms. White has a formidable record as a prosecutor from 1993 to 2002, when she was the United States attorney in the Southern District of New York. She also has a stellar reputation as a white-collar defense attorney at Debevoise & Plimpton, where she has been chief of litigation since 2002, representing several of the firms and executives that she would regulate at the S.E.C.

Her résumé in the past decade has understandably alarmed advocates of financial reform, who fear that her work as a defender of Wall Street means that she is dangerously biased in favor of the banks and their deregulatory agenda. Her lack of a deep regulatory background is also a worry at a time when the agency’s top priority is to finish overdue rules to carry out the Dodd-Frank financial reform and other securities laws. Complicating matters further, her husband, John White, is also a corporate lawyer, at Cravath, Swaine & Moore, with his own long list of Wall Street clients.

We understand these concerns but do not believe they are disqualifying. Ms. White is a worthy nominee, though clearly, the White House and Ms. White will have to address the conflicts of interest in her background frankly and persuasively. Equally important, she must be able to demonstrate in her confirmation hearing that she is not captive to the financial industry’s view of the world, which has dominated her recent professional life."

There also is legal bribery. Lots of it.

“Campaign contributions provide a fig leaf for legalized bribery,” says campaign finance expert Robert Stern, who helped write California’s political reform act four decades ago.

“Ninety percent of campaign money comes from people who want something from government. And often they get it. Nobody gives campaign money to incumbents who have no real [reelection] competitors without thinking they’re getting something in return. Nobody wastes their money.”

Legal campaign donations, however, do not equate to sleaze.

Putrid sleaze is what state Sen. Ronald S. Calderon (D-Montebello) is alleged to have wallowed in during an elaborate FBI sting, according to a federal affidavit disclosed last week by the Al Jazeera America cable network. In the affidavit, the FBI alleged that Calderon took $88,000 in bribes, most of it from undercover agents.

Calderon has not been charged with any crimes and, through his attorney, has denied wrongdoing.

Nevertheless, Senate leader Darrell Steinberg (D-Sacramento) did the right thing Wednesday. He took steps to remove Calderon from his Senate committee assignments, including chairmanship of the coveted Insurance Committee, a “juice” panel that attracts generous campaign donations.

The allegations against Calderon “cloud any interactions the senator might have with colleagues, [lobbyists] and the public,” Steinberg said, calling the accusations “the most serious breach of the public trust.”

True. And I’m not saying that legal bribery is as odorous as smelly sleaze. But it does tend to emit a stench.

Campaign money actually gets a bad rap, to one degree. It costs a fair amount to run a competitive race.

If the public is unwilling to finance the campaigns of state politicians — and public financing has become impractical anyway, because of U.S. Supreme Court rulings — then the political funds must come from some other source. A very wealthy candidate might be willing to finance his own campaign, but normally the funding is supplied by favor-seeking special interests.

One problem, however, is that money in a campaign account doesn’t have to be spent on running for office. It also can be spent on goodies — such as four-star dinners and boondoggle trips — as long as it “reasonably” relates to a legislative or governmental purpose. For example: educating oneself on high-speed rail in Japan or the wine industry in France.

So campaign contributions can significantly enhance a politician’s lifestyle.

And a campaign fund is only one of several pots that special interests can fill to ingratiate themselves to officeholders.

There are “officeholder” accounts, which are especially important to incumbents who are not seeking reelection and are therefore barred from raising campaign money. Unless, as many do, they create a phony account ostensibly to run for another office.

They can dip into those officeholder pots for so-called legislative and governmental purposes — taking the staff to Morton’s for a dinner meeting, for instance, on the special interests’ dime.

Business execs dine lavishly, of course, but the company pays.

I’d require all legislative junkets to be paid for by the company — the government. If an officeholder’s fancy meal or trip truly has a governmental purpose, it ought to be paid for by the taxpayers. And if it can’t be justified, then it shouldn’t happen.

“You and maybe 5% of the people think the public should pay,” Stern says. So the special interests gladly do.

The interests — labor, business, casinos — also donate to politicians’ pet charities in their names. Those contributions are called “behested payments.” It’s a three-fer: the interests curry favor with the politicians, they earn tax write-offs and — probably their last concern — they help the charity.

Advertisement

Behested payments only need to be officially reported if they exceed $5,000 per year from a single interest. Even so, $2.3 million has been reported in the names of legislators this year.

And roughly $3 million has been reported on behalf of Gov. Jerry Brown, practically all of it for two charter schools he created in Oakland while mayor.

Legislators can also solicit special interest money for a legal defense fund. In case they get snagged in a sting. Unlike a campaign fund — for which there’s a $4,100 contribution limit per election, or $8,200 total for the primary and general — there’s no donation cap for a legal kitty.

“There’s a common thread that ties every single one of these” pots, says Dan Schnur, director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at USC and a former chairman of the state Fair Political Practices Commission. “That thread is a Capitol culture that is overwhelmingly focused on fundraising.”

Advertisement

A culture of hitting up special interests practically 24/7.

Schnur would ban fundraising while the Legislature is in session. “This would give legislators back five or six hours a day to do the job they were elected to do,” he says.

Steinberg won’t go that far. But the Senate leader says he does intend to introduce legislation to limit the amount of money that can be raised in a non-election year. “Probably $50,000.”

That would help a little. But I’d also limit what the money could be spent on — no gourmet dinners, no boondoggle trips.

Advertisement

The Legislature will never do that. It’ll require some moneybag reformer to finance a ballot initiative.

Meanwhile, spare me the spin from politicians that they aren’t influenced by any of these special interest investments. That’s like saying a dog isn’t influenced by petting.

THE graying man flashing fury in the Rose Garden on behalf of the Newtown families, the grieving man wiping away tears after speaking at the Boston memorial service, is not the same man who glided into office four years ago.

President Obama has watched the blood-dimmed tide drowning the ceremony of innocence, as Yeats wrote, and he has learned how to emotionally connect with Americans in searing moments, as he did from the White House late Friday night after the second bombing suspect was apprehended in Boston.

Unfortunately, he still has not learned how to govern.

How is it that the president won the argument on gun safety with the public and lost the vote in the Senate? It’s because he doesn’t know how to work the system. And it’s clear now that he doesn’t want to learn, or to even hire some clever people who can tell him how to do it or do it for him.

It’s unbelievable that with 90 percent of Americans on his side, he could get only 54 votes in the Senate. It was a glaring example of his weakness in using leverage to get what he wants. No one on Capitol Hill is scared of him."
http://globalpublicsquare.blogs.cnn.com/2013/01/29/israel-faces-reset-moment/,2013-01-29 00:00:00,[],Israel faces reset moment,"By Jane Harman, Special to CNN

Editor’s note: Jane Harman is director, president and chief executive officer of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. She was a nine-term congresswoman from California and the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee from 2002 to 2006. The views expressed are her own.

Israel’s surprising election result gives its wing-clipped prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, an opportunity to shift to the center. This option was available to him four years ago when he outmaneuvered Tzipi Livni to form a majority in the Knesset. But he chose instead to move to the right.

Now comes a reset moment. Israel’s economy is fragile, with housing prices soaring and the middle class squeezed. A majority of the mostly secular Jewish population also resents special deals cut with the ultra-Orthodox to shield them from compulsory service in the military and to provide them with benefits not available to others.

The candidates that focused on those issues – the centrist Yesh Atid’s Yair Lapid and the pro-settlement Jewish Home’s Naftali Bennett – received the enthusiastic support of the public. Indeed, the mandate was clear: share the burden.

But it’s not just the economy, stupid. This is in fact a double reset opportunity. Although the Israeli-Palestinian peace process wasn’t the focal point of this campaign (only 18 percent of voters cited negotiations with the Palestinians as the most important issue), most Israelis do still favor a two-state solution. Indeed, a poll last month found that 67 percent of Israelis would support an agreement based on the 1967 borders, including a divided Jerusalem between the two states, with only 21 percent opposed. Even 57 percent of supporters of the Likud and Jewish Home parties said they would support such a deal.

More from GPS: Six things to watch in 2013

Unfortunately, many Israelis no longer believe peace is achievable – at least in the immediate future. But help may be on the way if Israel’s new coalition includes parties open to a deal.

That help comes in two forms. First, the expected confirmation of Senator John Kerry as secretary of state provides an experienced hand with deep personal connections in the Middle East. He has known Netanyahu for 25 years, and their relationship is solid. He also knows and regularly visits Israel’s Arab neighbors. A trip to the region by him shortly after his confirmation could rekindle the focus on negotiations. It could also set up an overdue follow-on trip by President Obama to Israel and her neighbors.

A second source of help is the reported efforts by Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy to reconcile Hamas and Fatah. Notwithstanding muscular street demonstrations by the Hamas leadership in Gaza recently, Hamas is weakened by the loss of its safe haven in Syria. Egypt wants to reassert leadership in the region and got serious respect for brokering a ceasefire between Israel and Gaza late last year. Bringing a unified Palestinian delegation to the peace table would be a major achievement – and a blunt prod to Israel, which worries that Egypt could abandon their peace treaty.

Without a two state solution, both sides lose. Israel loses its legitimacy as a Jewish democracy once the youth bulge in the Palestinian population within its borders becomes a majority. And Palestinians – who have made bad leadership choices but have also been pawns in a local and regional power game – lose out, once again, on the opportunity for peace and prosperity.

As Woodrow Wilson once said, “There are many voices of counsel, but few voices of vision.” As Bibi puts together his new coalition, he would be wise to remember that advice and create a team with the foresight to make sure Israel isn’t one day the biggest loser.

Will Bibi seize the mantle of peacemaker that eluded his predecessors like Rabin, Sharon, and Barak? Only he knows."

However, the OBL bump lasted barely 10 days before the slog of the negotiations started eroding his numbers. We all remember those painful weeks—Obama begging the GOP to make a deal, making concession after concession with nothing in return from the other side. He looked weak because heweak. And the American people don't like weak. No one does, really.

Indeed, by the time Obama capitulated in late July, giving House Speaker John Boehner 95 percent of what he wanted, he was already at the lowest approval ratings of his presidency, and they fell even further in the weeks after. The White House thought that by looking ""reasonable"" and willing to compromise, the ""adult in the room"" as many of Obama's strongest partisans put it, that the American people would reward him. Well, they didn't. Indeed, Obama's numbers didn't head back into solidly positive territory until after the Democratic convention in September 2012, over a year later, and only after he took a more stridently partisan tone ahead of the the November elections.

In fact, 2012 exit polling confirmed that voters stopped seeing Obama as a strong leader.



Those who voted on leadership qualities opted for Mitt Romney by a whopping 61-38 percent. And yet here we are again, with Obama and his team deluded into thinking people want him to look ""reasonable"". No, Americans re-elected him to protect their interests. Among people who expected the president to look out for their interests, Obama won by a crazy 81-18. Those are the voters that gave him four more years, and right now he's inexplicably failing their trust.

If Republicans are so hell-bent on destroying our safety net, and they are, then make them put those proposals in their budget. Yet even Rep. Paul Ryan's draconian budget didn't touch Social Security. (And for good reason!)

Republicans released their ideal budget. It was Obama's turn to release his ideal budget. Then they'd go to the table to try and hammer out a compromise that would theoretically be somewhere in the middle. But as always Obama negotiated against himself, made concessions without corresponding Republican ones, became the only elected official in Washington, D.C., to put Social Security benefits cuts in a formal proposal (thus owning them), and then ... what?

Republicans dismissed everything out of hand, progressive groups went to war against the White House, Congressional Democrats distanced themselves from the proposal save for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (ever the loyal lieutenant), and seniors certainly weren't impressed.

If Obama's goal was to look weak and isolate himself, generating bipartisan scorn and ridicule while giving Republicans a chance to claim Democrats want to cut Social Security during 2014 elections, then sure, mission accomplished.

A few high-profile Republicans lost their races. The outcome has prompted the usual round of hand-wringing from the media, pundits and national GOP Leaders about the future of the party. A deeper look at the election results, however, paints a more complicated picture. Democrats may want to conduct their own hand-wringing about the future of their party.

Although it lost the Presidency, the Republicans picked up a large number of victories in November. They gained a Governorship and solidified their gains from 2010 in the House and in the states. The GOP now has 30 Governors, a record in modern political history. They control all levers of state government in 25 states. One would have to go back to the 1920s to find the GOP so ascendant in the states. The Democrats have complete control in just 12 states, an historic low. (The rest of the states have split control.)

GOP strength in the states isn’t confined just to the South or the Plains. They control the Governor and Legislature in industrial heartland states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Indiana, as well. While Governor’s races in these states will always be competitive, redistricting should ensure that the GOP will dominate the legislatures in these states for the next decade.

This isn’t just a numbers game. The polarization in the states gives each party an opportunity to enact large parts of their respective agendas. Republicans in several states are embracing this chance. Several states are looking at comprehensive overhauls of their tax codes. Republicans are looking at reforms throughout state government, from the budget, education and business regulation.

Democrats, meanwhile, made strong gains in the states where they hold control. The party won a supermajority in the California and Illinois legislatures, for example. Progressives in these states will feel emboldened to pursue their agenda of higher taxes on the wealthy and business, and increased social spending. In many places, they will pursue stricter gun control and new environmental regulations.

The public is about to benefit from a real-time experiment in whose policies are better suited to encourage economic growth. The likely Democrat lurch to the left in several states could tarnish the party’s brand in large parts of the country. Successful Republican governance in the states, by contrast, could repair some of the damage done to the GOP’s brand in national politics.

The national GOP does face challenges. National party leaders are engaged in an existential crisis over the right amount of “conservative” or “moderate” positions. They seem largely disengaged from the party’s base supporters and activists.

That said, Democrats are on a path to disengage them from large segments of the public. Combining this with the national Dem push to raise taxes and enact gun control, among other issues, will make it difficult for Democrats to remain competitive in large parts of the country. This will create an enormous opportunity for the national GOP to fix its brand.

It shouldn’t look to machinations on Capitol Hill for salvation. It should look to the states.

King Joined The Post S Editorial Board In']",Colbert King: The Republican pity party,"Conservative behavior since President Obama’s reelection in November has evoked, at least in me, a keen sense of sadness. Hardly a day goes by without weeping, wailing and gnashing of teeth by the likes of Rush Limbaugh on talk radio and Sean Hannity on Fox News over Obama’s return to the White House. Similar whining is heard among Republicans on Capitol Hill.

Simply put, conservatives are in agony over the president’s smashing victory. Their pain is hard to watch. Only small-minded Democrats would gloat.

What we’re seeing is the impact of losing when you believed with all your heart, soul and mind, buttressed by the predictions of pollsters and pundits, that you would win handily.

The reaction is, for me, heart-rending.

Consider the feeble attempt by House Republicans to recover political ground by threatening Obama over the debt limit.

The poor things, crazed by their defeat, didn’t realize that they had no leverage. They had to back down with a face-saving gimmick to suspend through May enforcement of the limit on federal borrowing.

Consider some Republicans’ return to the issue of what happened in Benghazi, Libya. Did they really think that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton would traipse up to the Hill this week, prostrate herself before Congress and confess to something that she knew wasn’t true?

They so wanted her to say that there was mendacity and attempts by the administration to cover up malfeasance in the Sept. 11 attack on a U.S. diplomatic facility. Some seemed truly distressed that Clinton wouldn’t give them what they wanted. They were so desperate. It was so sad.

And so it has gone since election night. The lamentations abound:

●Obama’s nominations of Jack Lew as Treasury secretary and Chuck Hagel as defense secretary are confrontational; woe unto us.

●“I would have liked to have seen some outreach” in Obama’s inaugural address, complained Sen. John McCain, who, with his Republican cohorts, did everything they could to kick Barack Obama out of the White House.

●The Obama administration will “attempt to annihilate the Republican Party . . . to just shove us into the dustbin of history,” House Speaker John Boehner wailed this week.

And so it goes: one big conservative pity party.

Imagine how hard it must have been to lose.

For four long years they hit Obama with everything they had, assailing him at every turn. No insult was too offensive to be hurled; no abuse too outrageous to be tried; no name too abusive to call.

From Day One, destruction of the Obama administration and preventing his reelection was top priority; the second item too far down the list to remember.

Four years of blame, blame, blame. Blah, blah, blah.

Conservatives on Capitol Hill and right-wing commentators left nothing on the field.

They gave it their all — and came up empty.

What an emotional letdown. How not to feel at least a little sorry for them?

So where do they go from here?

This should be a time for introspection, for conservatives to examine their thoughts and look inside for answers as to why they lost when, at first blush, they had so much going for them. And why were they so dead set on not just defeating but breaking this president?

Hard-liners, of course, will take exception to my characterization of their behavior. What I might call abusive or mean they would probably describe as passionate: their passionate defense of liberty, the Constitution, smaller government, free enterprise and the individual — all things they see Obama as opposing.

The conservative wing regards itself as all that stands between freedom and tyranny, between order and chaos, between values and licentiousness.

And perhaps that self-view explains why they are taking their loss so hard.

It also may help explain why their conduct is so, well, touching.

Conservatives yakking it up in House and Senate chambers and on the airwaves these days are delusional, in much the way that the South deluded itself into thinking it was in the right during the Civil War or that Republicans held fast to the misguided belief that the presidency of Franklin Delano Roosevelt was wrong for the country.

American principles endure. But America is changing, just as it evolved during the Lincoln era and just as it emerged from the Great Depression under FDR’s leadership.

What makes this so excruciatingly sad is that some forces on the right are too far gone to see the truth.

House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) left the Capitol after a midmorning meeting with his leadership team failed to reach consensus on an approach. He plans to assemble Republicans again at noon Saturday.

The Democrats who control the Senate easily beat back a GOP strategy led by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) that aimed to tie the government funding bill to a measure that would have blocked President Obama’s healthcare law. More than half of the Republican senators joined the Democrats in rejecting Cruz’s hard-line approach.

But Cruz and his conservative Republican allies in the House have refused to relinquish the fight. The senator met privately with tea party lawmakers in the House this week, complicating Boehner’s efforts to unite his restive majority around a strategy.

As the speaker and his leadership team tried to devise an endgame, federal agencies began notifying employees about whether they would be furloughed in the event of a shutdown, and prepared to shutter the popular Smithsonian museums, close national parks and halt many basic government services.

Obama, in a late-afternoon appearance in the White House briefing room, warned Republicans not to “threaten to burn the house down simply because you haven’t gotten 100% of your way.”

“My message to Congress is this: Do not shut down the government. Do not shut down the economy,” he said. “Pass a budget on time. Pay our bills on time. Refocus on the everyday concerns of the American people.”

The president cast the GOP effort as “political grandstanding” and said he would not buckle. “The House Republicans are so concerned with appeasing the tea party that they’ve threatened a government shutdown or worse unless I gut or repeal the Affordable Care Act,” Obama said. “That’s not going to happen.”

Tea party Republicans see the threat of a shutdown as their best chance to stop the Affordable Care Act before Tuesday, when the online marketplaces to buy health insurance under the new law are set to open. But the president said Friday that the marketplaces would open on time even if there is a shutdown. “That’s a done deal,” he said.

Many Republican strategists have warned that voters will blame their party for a shutdown, noting that happened the last time government offices were shuttered in 1995 and 1996. But many conservative lawmakers were not in Congress then and have rejected such warnings, saying polls show Americans do not support Obamacare.

Republicans, meanwhile, sought to blame Obama for the standoff.

“The House will take action that reflects the fundamental fact that Americans don’t want a government shutdown and they don’t want the train wreck that is Obamacare,” said Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck. “Grandstanding from the president, who refuses to even be a part of the process, won’t bring Congress any closer to a resolution.”

The deep GOP divisions spilled into the open this week as Cruz rankled fellow Republicans with his attention-getting, 21-hour-plus Senate speech promoting what many colleagues view as a doomed strategy.

Cruz and Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) met Thursday with some of the most conservative House Republicans for a dinner that lasted late into the evening. The senators encouraged their colleagues to stand firm against any funding bill that does not fully delay the healthcare law.

“I am hopeful; I am confident that the House will continue to stand its ground, continue to listen to the American people and step up to respond and to stop this train wreck — this nightmare that is Obamacare,” Cruz said after the Senate votes that sent the bill back to the House without the provision to cut money for the healthcare program.

At the same time, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which is influential among Republicans, urged Congress in a letter also signed by 235 other groups not to shut down the government or default on the debt. The debt limit must be raised by Oct. 17 for the nation to continue paying its bills and avoid a default.

The party’s former standard-bearer, presidential candidate Mitt Romney, also warned against the strategy. “The tactic of using a government shutdown to try and push that will be counterproductive politically,” he said in an interview on CNN’s “The Lead with Jake Tapper.” “I don’t think that will be as effective.”

House Republicans plan to discuss several proposals Saturday that would tie a new Obamacare rollback provision to the funding bill. That could prolong the standoff with the Senate and lead to a legislative pingpong that could take days to resolve, all but ensuring that the government would shut down.

The hard-right flank is pushing for a one-year delay of the healthcare law. The proposal, by Rep. Tom Graves (R-Ga.), is supported by more than 60 other House Republicans, and if they hold firm, they could deny Boehner the majority he needs to pass a less restrictive measure.

Other Republicans have suggested delaying the mandate that individuals must carry health insurance by 2014 or face a fine.

Some have also suggested more modest measures, including one to repeal a tax on medical-device manufacturers and another to prevent members of Congress and staff from receiving federal funding toward their health insurance — a hit to lawmakers’ pocketbooks that members of Congress oppose.

Boehner may see no option but to try again to cut back Obamacare, but the strategy of tacking other healthcare provisions onto the funding bill appears doomed to fail. Democrats in the Senate are united in their pledge to protect the healthcare law. No Democratic senators voted Friday to end funding for the program.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), who has taken to calling House Republicans “anarchists,” dismissed the tea party flank as the “weird caucus.”

“Any bill that continues to play political games will force a government shutdown,” he said. “To be absolutely clear: We are going to accept nothing as it relates to Obamacare.”

Advertisement

Alternatively, Boehner could seek support from Democrats to approve a funding bill without any healthcare provisions, but he has been reluctant to do that for fear of upsetting his conservative majority.

That Cruz has continued to pursue his strategy despite its failure in the Senate pointed to the sway of tea-party-aligned organizations that have supported the renegade Republican over the elected party leadership.

“It says more about the Republican leadership than it says about Cruz,” said Chris Chocola, a former Indiana congressman who is president of the Club for Growth, a free-market group influential among Republicans. “They leave this huge void for someone to come up with an idea and provide leadership, and they don’t like it when someone does.”

Mississippi Sen. Thad Cochran’s decision to seek a seventh term – revealed on the eve of his 76th birthday -- was something of a surprise. He raised just more than $53,000 in the most recent fundraising period, and has only $800,000 in the bank. Chris McDaniel, a 41-year-old state senator, entered the race in October and has begun actively campaigning and picking up endorsements.

Cochran said in a statement that he would “run hard and be successful so that I can continue to serve the people of Mississippi and our nation effectively.”

Only Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch has served longer than Cochran among Republicans. He is fourth overall in seniority in the U.S. Senate, a distinction that no longer carries the importance it once did in the body.

As the top Republican on the Senate Agriculture Committee, he has been deeply involved with negotiations with the House over a compromise on the farm bill, an effort that has been complicated by newer fiscal hawks in the GOP who are intent on separating food stamps from agriculture subsidies. The pairing of those issues in the past has provided the bipartisan coalition needed to ensure passage.

Cochran also served as the top Republican on the Appropriations Committee, a once-powerful perch that now is at the heart of conservative criticisms of the veteran lawmaker.

“Throughout his over 40 years in Washington, Sen. Thad Cochran has done some good things for Mississippi, but he’s also done some bad things,” said Chris Chocola, president of the conservative Club For Growth, which has endorsed McDaniel in the Senate primary. “He voted to bail out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, voted repeatedly to raise the debt limit by trillions of dollars, and even voted against a resolution that stated Congress has a ‘moral obligation’ to cut spending.”

“Sen. Cochran has had a long and distinguished career representing the people of Mississippi,” McDaniel said in a statement. “I look forward to a positive campaign based on the future of our state, our country and the Republican Party. As a strong conservative, I will fight to bring those values to Washington.”

The Republican primary is June 3. Whoever emerges from the Republican primary would be a heavy favorite to keep the seat in the general election. No Democrat has entered yet, but Jennifer Duffy of the Cook Political Report said that the prospect now of a “bruising” Republican primary could draw more interest from prospective candidates. Possible candidates could include Ray Mabus, the former two-term governor who now serves as secretary of the Navy.

Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), the minority leader, also face significant primary opposition in 2014 from candidates running to their right. Sen. Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.) also faces a challenge from Liz Cheney, daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney.

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/08/31/gop-activists-cheered-by-state-successes/,2013-08-31 00:00:00,[],GOP activists cheered by state successes,"Republican activists are taking solace in success stories by governors and legislatures in GOP-leaning states as their party tries to regroup after the disappointments of a bruising presidential contest and a stalled agenda in Washington.

Here's what fired up Washington-weary GOP stalwarts at a weekend conference of conservatives in this perennial swing state: pension overhauls in Wisconsin, tax cuts in Indiana and labor losses in Michigan.

Some of the biggest applause was reserved for governors who did not attend the event. The mere mention of Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, a tea-party favorite who won national attention for his battles with organized labor, prompted thunderous cheers. That was despite a speaking card full of potential presidential hopefuls, including Florida Sen. Marco Rubio.

Several GOP contenders, including Texas Gov. Rick Perry and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, used their appearances at the Americans for Prosperity summit to position themselves as Washington outsiders. While that strategy is hardly new, the appeals play to a Republican base starved for the kind of victories that gridlocked Washington has been unable to deliver.

""All roads lead back to the states,"" Perry said, as more than 1,000 activists roared their approval Friday. ""I don't think the American people want to look to Washington, D.C. to solve the problems of the day. Washington D.C. is creating the problems of the day.""

That set up an interesting dynamic, as Rubio was heckled for his support of immigration reform, his signature legislative issue. Attendees repeatedly interrupted him with cries of ""No amnesty!""

The anti-Washington mood is likely to harden this fall as Congress faces deadlines to pass a budget or face a government shutdown. This week, Republicans negotiating with the White House said there was ""no common ground"" with the Obama administration, which wants to couple spending cuts with tax increases.

Both sides are bracing for a confrontation.

Immigration overhaul legislation is also in limbo after the Democratic-led Senate passed a far-reaching bill that includes a path to citizenship for the 11 million immigrants already in the country illegally. A majority of House Republicans remain opposed to such a provision, creating a potentially unbridgeable divide.

""It's not working from the top down, obviously,"" said Andre Adamski, a 47-year-old engineer from Lawrenceville, Ga.

On Friday, he was headed to a workshop on local tax overhauls while his wife, Mary, was primed for a social media boot camp. Self-described tea party activists who volunteered for Mitt Romney's campaign, both said they were refocusing their efforts on state politics.

The conference hall was filled with patriotic garb and anti-Obama memorabilia, including a book entitled ""The Ultimate Obama Survival Guide."" Some attendees said they were slowly returning to politics after the sting of last year's presidential loss.

""I didn't turn a TV on for months,"" said Greg Gormley, a 49-year-old sales director from Charleston, S.C. ""This is my way to man up and see what I can do, whatever that is.""

The weekend conference, sponsored by Americans for Prosperity, was aimed in part at motivating the advocacy group's foot soldiers at a growing number of state affiliates, which have played prominent roles in tax, education and gun-control debates across the country. Backed by the billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch, the group spent $190 million on conservative causes in the past election cycle.

""I know things are difficult in D.C.,"" Tim Phillips, the group's president, told activists. ""It can get frustrating, you can get down and depressed sometimes. But I tell you, do what we do -- get the heck out of Washington and get out to states.""

Indeed, much of the summit's panels focused on grassroots organizing and local action.

At a session on President Barack Obama's health care law, panelists dismissed Washington-led efforts by Rubio and others to defund ""Obamacare,"" and instead urged activists to fight at the state level to oppose one of the law's key provisions: expanding Medicaid, the federal and state program for poor people.

""The Medicaid fight is where we can make a difference,"" said Avik Roy, of the conservative Manhattan Institute.

Nearly half the states have opted out of the expansion, and organizers urged activists to keep pressure on GOP leaders, including Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who was elected in 2010 with tea party support but now favors expanding Medicaid.

When speakers addressed Washington they used it as symbol of government run amok. Rubio won a standing ovation for his pledge to vote against a budget that includes funding for the federal health care law. ""Big government is doing what it has always done: It is failing,"" he said to cheers.

Jindal said he was ""angry this government is using its power -- the IRS, the NSA, the Department of Justice -- to go after innocent, law abiding Americans."" He brought the crowd to its feet with the declaration that ""there is a rebellion brewing in these states.""

Still, for now, conference organizers told activists to take solace in local victories.

""We're going to take back Washington too,"" Phillips said, ""we're just going to need a little more time."""

Menendez-sponsored bill could have aided donor's investment, report says","Sen. Robert Menendez sponsored legislation with incentives for natural gas vehicle conversions that would benefit the biggest political donor to his re-election, the same eye doctor whose private jet Menendez used for two personal trips to the Dominican Republic, an Associated Press investigation found.

The disclosure reflects the latest intersection between the New Jersey Democrat who is the subject of an ethics inquiry on Capitol Hill and the Florida doctor involved in a federal criminal investigation.

Dr. Salomon Melgen invested in Gaseous Fuel Systems Corp. of Weston, Fla., and joined its board of directors in early 2010, according to the company's chief executive and a former company consultant. GFS, as the company is known, designs, manufactures and sells products to convert diesel-fuel fleets to natural gas. The amount of Melgen's investment is confidential under rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, but a 2009 document filed with the SEC showed the company required a minimum individual investment at that time of $51,500.

At the same time, Menendez emerged as a principal supporter of a natural gas bill that would boost tax credits and grants to truck and heavy vehicle fleets that converted to alternative fuels. The bill stalled in the Senate Finance Committee, and after it was revived in 2012, the NAT GAS Act failed to win the needed 60 votes to pass.

While the bill was under consideration between 2009 and 2011, the former consultant for GFS spent $220,000 lobbying Menendez's staff and other congressional and federal officials on the act's provisions as well as other regulatory issues, according to interviews and Senate records.

There is no evidence that Menendez offered direct help or intervened on behalf of the company or Melgen. Instead, the connection between the two men's interests in natural gas is the latest example of the close symmetry between the senator — who recently rose to become chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee — and his millionaire backer. It illustrates the way Menendez's political clout has at times overlapped with Melgen's financial investments.

In recent weeks, Menendez has acknowledged other dealings with Melgen. Menendez was compelled to reimburse $58,000 for two flights aboard Melgen's private jet that he had previously failed to report, prompting scrutiny by the Senate Ethics Committee. Menendez also acknowledged that his office had contacted U.S. health agencies in 2009 and 2012 to question their billing practices and policies amid a dispute between Melgen, an eye specialist, and federal health authorities. FBI agents in January searched Melgen's offices in Florida and seized files as part of a criminal investigation.

Menendez also raised concerns last year with State and Commerce Department officials about the Dominican Republic's reluctance to enforce a port security contract with a company that Melgen partly owns.

A spokeswoman for Menendez, Patricia Enright, told the AP that the senator supported the natural gas bill to help improve the environment. She said Menendez personally had no known discussions with either Melgen or others associated with GFS concerning the legislation or its impact on the company. She said it was unclear whether the senator will continue to support the bill he had sponsored.

Melgen's attorney in Miami, Kirk Ogrosky, told the AP in a statement that ""Dr. Melgen has never discussed his involvement with Gaseous Fuel Systems Corp. with either Sen. Menendez or his staff.""

An SEC document filed last week by GFS showed that Melgen remains on the company's board of directors. An earlier document filed by the firm in May 2011 was the first to show Melgen as a director. That SEC record showed a $6 million investment in the firm from two unnamed individuals.

The company's top executive, Ken Green, said Melgen is a key investor but has had no influence on the company's decision-making and has not attended any director's meetings since he joined the firm.

""Dr. Melgen hasn't ever been to our offices, not once,"" Green told the AP. ""He's a passive investor.""

Green said the Senate bill that Menendez supported would provide only limited help to his company because most of its provisions are aimed at heavy on-road vehicles like truck rigs and bus fleets. GFS has pioneered an engine conversion system that can be installed on diesel-fueled vehicles, but Green said it is marketed exclusively for off-road equipment, such as massive mining trucks. The tax credits proposed by the bill would do little to offset the cost to buyers of the off-road trucks, which can cost as much as $8 million, Green said.

""This bill won't do much of anything for us,"" he said.

But in 2010, when Melgen first invested in GFS, the firm was actively considering marketing its natural gas engine devices for on-road vehicles. The bill, both in its 2009 and 2012 versions, authorized changes to IRS rules allowing larger tax credits for on-road, natural gas-supplied trucks and vehicles as well as grants for research. The proposal also urged the Environmental Protection Agency to streamline rules covering the conversion of diesel and gas engines to natural gas and alternative fuels.

GFS said in October 2010 in a press release that its strategy ""integrates four related areas of business development,"" including ""on-road coal truck conversions."" The release, written by the company's consultant and then-director of strategic projects, Elio Muller, also said that ""a vast number of on-road 18-wheeler tractor-trailer trucks hauling coal"" in the Appalachian region of Kentucky and West Virginia could be converted to combination diesel-natural gas engines with the GFS system.

Muller, a former Commerce Department official in the Clinton administration involved in several Tampa businesses, said last week that he introduced Melgen to Green and other GFS officials in early 2010. Green also said Muller was instrumental in bringing the company to Melgen's attention. Muller said he has known Melgen from Florida's Democratic political circles dating back to the late 1990s. At one point, Muller drew up plans to start a business, Melgen & Muller Inc., but the men never followed through.

Melgen has made investments in health-related companies since the 1990s, according to SEC reports, but his GFS stake is his only evident natural gas-related investment. Green said he met several times with Melgen and found him to be an ""intelligent investor"" but could not explain his sudden interest in natural gas.

""I don't know how he found out about natural gas, but he liked what we were doing and thought it was innovative,"" Green said.

By early 2010, when Melgen formally joined GFS, Menendez had already taken on a key role in backing the natural gas bill, joining Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada and Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah as out-front sponsors.

The NAT GAS Act quickly drew energy and environmental battle lines. Oil and alternative energy magnate T. Boone Pickens led corporate natural gas industry backers of the bill, aided by the Obama administration and influential environmental groups. Arrayed against the bill were top oil and coal firms and even some green activists, joined by industrialists David and Charles Koch, whose political action group, Americans for Prosperity, harnessed opposition from conservative groups.

Green said he did not authorize or hire any lobbyists on behalf of GFS because he was skeptical about broadening into the markets for on-road trucks. But he did not block the activities of Muller, who in addition to his consulting role with GFS, had also started his own firm, Diesel 2 Gas. It aimed to license GFS technology and use the firm's parts to outfit on-road trucks.

In June 2010, representing both GFS and Diesel 2 Gas, Muller testified before an EPA panel in Ann Arbor, Mich., about what he called ""cumbersome and unnecessary"" rules that hurt GFS and other natural gas firms. The EPA agreed to alter its regulations in April 2011.

Between 2009 and 2011, Muller also ran an independent consulting firm, Muller Group Inc., which paid $220,000 to lobbyists from Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck LLP to lobby for the NAT GAS Act and related issues.

Muller said he accompanied the lobbyists in at least one meeting with Menendez' staff about the bill but could not recall details. Melgen and Muller joined Menendez at a signing ceremony in Miami in January 2010 for the senator's book, ""Growing American Roots."" And last June, they joined Menendez at the annual U.S.-Spain Council Annual Forum in Jersey City.

Muller said he did not discuss his lobbying activities with Melgen, even though they were both involved with GFS.

Both Muller and Melgen also have fundraising ties to Menendez. Muller gave $5,000 to Menendez' New Jersey Senate re-election campaign in 2011.

The government shuts down and Pres. O. comes to the podium for a statement.

""The Republican party just shut down the government in an attempt to prevent millions of Americans from getting affordable health insurance.

This whole episode is pointless because even though government workers aren't getting paid today, members of the armed forces aren't being paid today, and social security checks will be going out late because of this temper tantrum... the health insurance exchanges still open today and the benefits of the affordable care act are there for everyone to see.

No more lies. No more hyperbole. Just go to Healthcare.gov and see how much money you can save for your family each month.

Sally Smith from Kentucky is saving over $200 per month.

Bob Jones from CO is saving $600 per month for his family of 4.

Wendy Wright is able to get affordable health insurance for the first time in 10 years.

All because of the Affordable Care Act. All because of Obamacare.

That's $600 more dollars per month that they can use to buy things they need for their family. $600 more dollars per month of breathing room.

Go to Healthcare.gov... see for yourself.

See who has been working for you... and who has been working against you.

The truth is out there just for you to see.

It's what the Republicans in congress don't want you to see. They don't want you to have access to affordable health insurance.

They don't care about the middle class. The don't care about you.

I do.

• HI-Sen, HI-01: The Hawaii State Teachers Association has endorsed Democratic Rep. Colleen Hanabusa in her bid for Senate. The HSTA, as well as the National Education Association, is also giving its support to state Rep. Mark Takai in the wide-open Democratic primary to replace Hanabusa in the 1st District.

• LA-Sen: State Rep. Paul Hollis, who first said he was considering a bid for Senate in October, has filed paperwork with the FEC. He's the third Republican to enter the race against Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu, along with Rep. Bill Cassidy and Air Force vet Rob Maness.

• MT-Sen: Montana's largest union, the 18,000-strong MEA-MFT, has endorsed Lt. Gov. John Walsh for Senate. MEA-MFT represents teachers and other state employees. Walsh faces ex-Lt. Gov. John Bohlinger in the Democratic primary.

• SD-Sen: As expected, former Republican Sen. Larry Pressler has launched his comeback bid as an independent.

Gubernatorial:

• HI-Gov: Barack Obama has endorsed Gov. Neil Abercrombie, who is seeking re-election but faces a challenge in the Democratic primary from state Sen. David Ige.

House:

• GA-01, -10, -11: Emily Cahn offers a helpful rundown on the GOP primary fields for Georgia's three open House seats.

• MN-08, NH-02: Americans for Prosperity is spending $600,000 to air ads attacking two Democrats over Obamacare, Rep. Rick Nolan of Minnesota and Rep. Annie Kuster of New Hampshire.

• NC-07: State Sen. David Rouzer was a natural to seek a rematch against Rep. Mike McIntyre after he lost the closest House race in the country in 2012, but he may have company in the GOP primary. New Hanover County Commissioner Woody White says he's considering a bid and expects to decide by the end of January.

• NE-02: It's very thin, but Joe Jordan at the Nebraska Watchdog says that unnamed sources have told him that attorney David Domina, who had been looking at Nebraska's open Senate seat, is considering a run against GOP Rep. Lee Terry in the state's 2nd Congressional District instead. This would actually be a winnable race for Domina, and he'd also really help Democrats, who lost their only candidate when Omaha City Councilman Pete Festersen dropped out earlier this month. Domina, however, missed a self-imposed mid-November deadline to decide on a Senate bid.

• VA-10: Former Democratic Rep. Artur Davis of Alabama has declined a comeback bid under the Republican banner for the open seat of retiring GOP Rep. Frank Wolf. Meanwhile, another dweebus—reality TV clown Tareq Salahi—says he will seek the GOP nomination in Virginia's 10th. (James L & David Nir)

• TX-04: GOP Rep. Ralph Hall, at age 90 the oldest member of the House in U.S. history, says that next year's campaign will be his last.

• House: On behalf of Americans United for Change, PPP has new polls of five House districts, mostly focused on extending unemployment insurance protection. (It's broadly supported.) There are no horserace numbers, but we do have job approvals for four potentially vulnerable Republicans: Gary Miller (CA-31), Mike Coffman (CO-06), Rodney Davis (IL-13), and Dan Benishek (MI-01). (John Boehner's district was also surveyed.) Everyone is under water, but nothing dramatic.

Other Races:

• VA State Senate: GOP Gov. Bob McDonnell has scheduled the special election for Attorney General-elect Mark Herring's 33rd District state Senate seat for Jan. 21. So even if Democrats hold Lt. Gov.-elect Ralph Northam's Senate seat on Jan. 7, Republicans would still control the chamber 20-19 until the second special could be held.

Grab Bag:

• Census: Unsurprisingly, Florida is about to overtake New York to become the third most-populous state in the nation, perhaps when the Census Bureau releases new population estimates on Monday. New York, however, still has a huge edge in GDP, and ranks seventh among all states in GDP per capita. Florida is 39th.

Meanwhile, BuzzFeed has some animated GIFs showing changes in the U.S. since 1990 on the county level, based on Census data, across several different demographic categories.

• Maps: New York Times graphics editor Joshua Katz has taken his data collection on dialects to the next level, with a new quiz that tries to pinpoint where you're from, linguistically speaking, depending on your answers to a battery of questions about vocabulary and pronunciation. It had me utterly nailed as a New Yorker, but come on, people. Are you really playing tennis in those shoes? You are obviously using them for sneaking, duh!

• Money: Kent Cooper lists how much cash the 17 members of Congress who are retiring at the end of next year still have in their campaign accounts. All told, it's $13 million, with Montana Sen. Max Baucus leading the way with $3.3 million.

• SCF: One lesser-known way PACs can support candidates is by acting as pass-through entities, which means they can solicit contributions from donors who earmark them for specific campaigns. As Kent Cooper explains, the gifts count only against the contribution limits of the original donors, who get credit for making the donation; the PAC, meanwhile, gets credit for collecting the money and passing it along. (I believe this is how ActBlue operates, legally speaking.)

Cooper discusses all this in the context of the Senate Conservatives Fund, which has forwarded nearly $500,000 to four different outsider Senate candidates this year. The largest recipient has been Kentucky businessman Matt Bevin, with $304,000. Also receiving funds are Rob Maness (Louisiana), Chris McDaniel (Mississippi), and Ben Sasse (Nebraska)."

Before Heading East', 'He Was The Los Angeles Times Bureau Chief In Sacramento', 'Where He Spent A Decade Untangling California S Epic Budget Mess', 'Political Dysfunction.']","In Virginia, government shutdown already hurting a GOP candidate","RICHMOND, Va. — Ken Cuccinelli is running for governor, not Congress, but the Virginia Republican is struggling to dodge the political fallout from Capitol Hill.

His campaign in this crucial battleground state is in danger of becoming the first political casualty of the federal government shutdown, which Americans largely blame on Republicans.

Advertisement

With the election just weeks away, Cuccinelli’s poll numbers have tumbled since federal agencies were closed Oct. 1. The conservative state attorney general was already lagging, but he went from within striking distance of a vulnerable Democrat to trailing by 8 to 10 percentage points in three independent polls.

As the candidate, a tea party favorite, seeks to distance himself from fellow activists in Congress, national Republican leaders are worried that a key office they expected to hold in a closely watched election is slipping away.

They also fear the shutdown could tarnish the party’s brand ahead of next year’s midterm election.

Not all Republican candidates are suffering because of the shutdown. In Democratic New Jersey, Gov. Chris Christie, a GOP nonconformist, is positioned to cruise to reelection.

Christie is conservative, but he has not allied himself with the tea party. Instead, he has focused on issues that most concern voters, such as the runaway costs of public employee benefits, and he is moving ahead with President Obama’s healthcare law. The New Jersey governor shows little regard for how his policies affect score cards with activists on the right.

“Republicans should think about these things as they ponder who to support in 2016,” said strategist Steve Schmidt, who ran Arizona Sen. John McCain’s presidential campaign in 2008. Schmidt sees the Virginia race as a cautionary tale for the party. “You have a campaign that has been unable to transcend its ideological baggage, running against someone who would have been beatable with almost any other conceivable candidate.”

Advertisement

Cuccinelli also has the misfortune to be running in the state with the most federal workers. Analysts say the uneasiness many voters had with Cuccinelli’s tea party brand of Republicanism has solidified into outright opposition.

“The shutdown is hurting Cuccinelli,” said Quentin Kidd, a professor of political science at Christopher Newport University in Newport News, Va. For voters on the fence, he said, “it helped them make a decision. They thought, ‘If that is the kind of thing we’d be looking at with Ken Cuccinelli, then I am not interested.’”

Advertisement

Establishment Republicans are frustrated. The Democratic nominee, Terry McAuliffe, is a former chairman of the national party and is saddled with baggage.

His business dealings have long attracted unflattering media attention, including allegations that he cashed in on his Clinton-era political connections to grow his personal fortune. At the Democratic National Committee, his fundraising tactics pushed ethical boundaries. He’s been compared to a carnival barker and a used car salesman.

Advertisement

But in a part of the country that has drifted from solidly red to solidly purple, polls suggest the statewide electorate would sooner vote for a candidate who may strike them as smarmy than one allied with the Republican Party’s most extreme politicians.

“I don’t like McAuliffe, but I really don’t like Cuccinelli,” said Cindy Freese, 59, a retired reinsurance executive in Alexandria who is registered as an independent. Her husband is a federal employee poised to miss his mid-month paycheck. Freese said she would “absolutely” vote for a moderate Republican for governor, “but there aren’t any anymore.”

Virginia’s electoral landscape, like that of the country overall, has shifted amid an influx of immigrants and the growth of diverse suburbs. In last year’s presidential election, the Obama campaign used those changing demographics to its advantage, microtargeting voters with messaging that appealed to them. McAuliffe has recruited some of the data whizzes and strategists behind that effort to replicate it in Virginia.

The Cuccinelli campaign represents the traditional approach. The candidate is the kind of firebrand conservative whom party activists believe energizes voters in the style of Ronald Reagan. As attorney general, he fought to block Obama’s healthcare law. A climate change skeptic, he started an investigation into a University of Virginia scientist whose research warned of a rise in temperatures. He has condemned homosexuality and sought to reinstate anti-sodomy laws rejected by the courts.

Advertisement

That record is not playing well with many Virginians uneasy with the rigid ideologies at the root of the shutdown. At a University of Richmond forum last week, Cuccinelli avoided much of it.

He lamented the refusal to compromise in Congress, saying he opposes the shutdown. He said Republicans failed the country on healthcare by not doing anything to fix a broken system when they controlled the White House and Congress. Asked to name the biggest social policy on his agenda, Cuccinelli responded, “That isn’t what I am running on.”

McAuliffe reminded the audience that Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), a current tea party favorite, had just campaigned in Virginia for Cuccinelli. “The architect of the shutdown was here last week,” McAuliffe said. “He and Ken Cuccinelli went to an event together. I wouldn’t have even been in the same room with Ted Cruz, with all the damage he has done.”

To be sure, Cuccinelli’s stumble began before the shutdown. Federal investigators are looking into a business executive’s connections to Gov. Bob McDonnell, and the inquiry has tainted the state party. Cuccinelli’s attacks on McAuliffe’s ethics were blunted when it came out that he had accepted $18,000 in gifts from the businessman.

But it was only after federal employees were told not to report to work that McAuliffe nearly doubled his lead in the polls.

“What has happened here reflects the challenges the GOP faces nationally,” Virginia Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling said.

Advertisement

A moderate Republican, Bolling opted not to run for governor when the party decided to choose its candidate with a convention, not an election, at the behest of activists seeking to ensure the nominee would be loyal to the base.

“Now,” he said, “Democrats have been able to use the shutdown to remind mainstream Virginia voters about what their concerns are: Would Ken Cuccinelli be able to govern in a mainstream way? Or would he govern the state in the style you are seeing in D.C.?”

If the Republican Party had a brain it would give up on its debt-ceiling gambit and announce instead that it wants to open negotiations immediately with President Obama on the basis of his own deficit commission, the Simpson-Bowles plan. That would at least make the G.O.P. a serious opposition party again — with a platform that might actually appeal outside its base and challenge the president in a healthy way. But the G.O.P. would have to embrace the tax reforms and spending cuts in Simpson-Bowles first. Fat chance. And that’s a pity.

As for Obama, if he really wants to lead, he will have to finally trust the American people with the truth. I’d love to see him use his Jan. 21 Inaugural Address and his Feb. 12 State of the Union Message as a one-two punch to do just that — offer a detailed, honest diagnosis and then a detailed, honest prescription.

On the diagnosis side, Obama needs to explain to Americans the world in which they’re now living. It’s a world in which the increasing velocity of globalization and the Information Technology revolution are reshaping every job, workplace and industry. As a result, the mantra that if you “just work hard and play by the rules” you should expect a middle-class lifestyle is no longer operable. Today you need to work harder and smarter, learn and re-learn faster and longer to be in the middle class. The high-wage, middle-skilled job is a thing of the past. Today’s high-wage or decent-wage jobs all require higher skills, passion or curiosity. Government’s job is to help provide citizens with as many lifelong learning opportunities as possible to hone such skills.

In the State of the Union, I’d love to see Obama lay out a detailed plan for tax reform, spending cuts and investments — to meet the real scale of our problem and spur economic growth. We’ll get much more bang for our buck by deciding now what we’re going to do in all three areas, and signaling markets that we are putting in place a truly balanced approach, but gradually phasing it in. If you tell investors and savers that we’re going to put our fiscal house in order with a credible plan, but one that is gradually phased in, all the money now sitting on the sidelines paralyzed by uncertainty will get off the sidelines and we’ll have a real stimulus.

As for investment, I’d love to see the president launch us on an aspirational journey. My choice would be to connect every home and business in America to the Internet at one gigabit per second, or about 200 times faster than our current national household average, in five years. In an age when mining big data will be a huge industry, when online lifelong learning will be a vital necessity, and when we can’t stimulate our way to prosperity but have to invent our way there, no project would be more relevant."

So why, in an exclusive survey of fast-growth CEOs, do 36 percent of these entrepreneurs say they’d support Hillary Clinton for President? That's more than any other potential Presidential candidate except for New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, whom 47 percent of survey respondents said they would support.

The findings are based on a survey of the Inc. 5000, our annual ranking of the fastest-growing private U.S. companies.

Some of the other contenders were Republican Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, with 34 percent; former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, with 31 percent; and Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, with 21 percent. After Clinton, the best-scoring Democrat was New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. Nine percent of fast-growth entrepreneurs said they’d support him.

Strange Bedfellows

The conventional wisdom is that two-thirds of business owners are Republican and one-third are Democrats. That’s misleading. In the Inc. survey, 47 percent of fast-growth CEOs describe themselves as Republicans, compared to only 17 percent who say they’re Democrats. But more than a third--36 percent--say they’re independents.

When asked about their political philosophy, as opposed to party affiliation, the results are telling. Only 31 percent say they’re conservative. Liberals are an even smaller minority, at only 10 percent. Everyone else--a whopping 59 percent--claims to be moderate.

Women CEOs, not surprisingly, are even less likely to be Republican. About a third of fast-growth women entrepreneurs said they are Republicans, a third said they are Democrats, and about a third are independents. While about two-thirds of fast-growth CEOs who are men voted for Republican candidate Mitt Romney in the last U.S. presidential election, more than half the women--53 percent--voted for Barack Obama.

The fact that so many of the Inc. 5000 consider themselves moderates doesn’t leave a whole lot of room for candidates on either edge of the political spectrum, be they Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts (6.3 percent) or Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas (15 percent). But it leaves plenty of business owners who are willing to back a Democratic woman for President--especially one whose bridge-building efforts have won praise from both sides of the political aisle and who is widely regarded as having had a successful tenure as the U.S. Secretary of State. Forty percent of fast-growth CEOs who said they were independents also said they’d back Clinton. Eighty-seven percent of Democrats said they’d support her, as did 13 percent of Republicans. Among women, 61 percent said they’d back Clinton for President.

It’s telling that New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a Republican who got flak from his own party by appearing to buddy up with President Obama just a bit too much during Hurricane Sandy last year, was the only one to make a stronger showing than Hillary. More than half of independents--53 percent--said they’d back Christie for president.

It undoubtedly helps both Christie and Clinton that neither of them is currently serving in Washington. When it comes to the federal government shutdown, the threatened debt default, and the record-breaking level of dysfunction in D.C., their hands are clean. For now.

Based on the results of an October survey of Inc. 5000 entrepreneurs. The survey had 306 respondents."

Dem Adv.","A Republican in California won a state Senate seat on Wednesday in a District in which Democrats have a 22-point advantage and that is 60% Hispanic.

Andy Vidak, the Republican farmer, won the special election runoff for the 16th District Senate seat when his opponent, Democrat Leticia Perez, a Kern County Supervisor, conceded on Wednesday, a day after voters cast their ballots. Vidak had 54% of the vote to Perez’s 46%.

Perez had initially conceded two months ago when the special election was held. But a recount put Vidak under the 50% threshold that was needed to avoid a runoff, and Perez took back her concession nearly a week after the initial election. The seat became vacant when the Democrat, who won the seat in 2010 by 21 points, resigned to work for Chevron. Democrats thought, especially with a Hispanic female candidate, the seat would be a shoo-in for them. The veto-proof supermajority Democrats have in the state Senate is now imperiled with Vidak’s victory.

As Breitbart News had previously reported, though, “Vidak, a working class candidate, resonated with working class Hispanics in the district who also saw how coastal California elites were not putting their bread-and-butter interests first.”

Vidak ran broadly on “the bifurcation of California: the coastal liberal elites versus the Valley folks.” On a more local level, Vidak’s theme of “fish versus farmer” resonated with Democrats in a District where the unemployment rate is 15% and as high as 30% in some communities in the District. Vidak reminded voters that liberal environmentalists, in order to protect fish, only allowed farmers to receive 20% of their water allocation, crippling the region’s economy. He also stressed that Perez supported the the state’s high-speed rail project that would have razed business, farms, and homes in the District. Because she supported the agenda of coastal elites and Democrat interest groups, Perez was able to raise twice as much money as Vidak, but 16th District voters ultimately rejected her liberal policies.

It is often said that California is a harbinger of things to come for the country. For Republicans looking at California, there has not been much of hope of late, but Vidak’s victory could be a sign that areas that have traditionally voted for Democrats may give the right kind of Republican a chance as they see unemployment rates increase and opportunities for upward mobility decrease in their communities.

"http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-court-campaign-funds-20130922,0,4017320.story",2013-09-22 02:24:00,"['David G. Savage Has Covered The Supreme Court', 'Legal Issues For The Los Angeles Times In The Washington Bureau Since']",Supreme Court may strike new blow to campaign funding laws,"WASHINGTON — In what may be Act 2 in the decline and fall of campaign funding laws, the Supreme Court appears poised to lift the lid on the total amount the wealthy can give directly to all candidates and political parties.

Increasingly, the money that funds election races for Congress and the presidency comes from a small sliver of the very rich, what the Sunlight Foundation called the “elite class that serves as gatekeepers of public office in the United States.” The nonpartisan group has tracked how a growing share of election money comes from the top 1% of the wealthiest Americans.

In the first major case of its new term, the court could give those donors even more clout with lawmakers and their parties. The issue is whether federal limits, not on contributions to individual races but on how much a donor can give to all candidates for Congress or party committees in a particular election cycle, violate the right of free speech.

Three years ago, the current court under Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said in the Citizens United case that “independent” spending on election races was protected free speech and struck down long-standing bans on such spending by corporations and unions.

Advertisement

But until now, the court’s conservatives have not joined together to strike down the Watergate-era limits on how much donors can give directly to candidates or party committees.

That has left the law in an odd posture. Wealthy people who want to influence campaign races can give millions of dollars to “super PACs” and other groups that pay for “independent” election ads, but they are barred by law from giving more than $48,600 total to all members of Congress or more than $74,600 to various party committees.

That may be about to change. On Oct. 8, the Supreme Court will take up an appeal from the Republican National Committee, Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Alabama businessman Shaun McCutcheon, who say contributions should be treated as “core political speech.” If they win, wealthy Republicans or Democrats could each give as much as $3.6 million total by giving the maximum amount to all of their party committees and candidates. This money could be funneled by party leaders into a close race or races, tipping the balance of power in Congress.

Defenders of the election laws have been sounding the alarm. “It would be terrible for our democracy … if one politician could directly solicit $3.6 million from a single donor,” said Lawrence Norden, an election law expert with the Brennan Center, a liberal legal advocacy group in New York. “That is 70 times the median income for an American family. It would mean a tiny, tiny group of donors would wield unprecedented power and influence.”

But the total limit on contributions stands on shaky ground. In recent opinions, Roberts has said the government may not try to “level the playing field” between candidates or prevent well-funded candidates from using their financial advantage to dominate the airwaves. The only justification for limiting contributions, the court has said, is to prevent “corruption or the appearance of corruption.”

And the challengers say there is no threat of corruption if one wealthy person gives the maximum $5,200 to each of more than 460 candidates who run for the House and Senate next year.

“This is a limit on how many candidates you support, not on how much you give them,” said James Bopp Jr., an attorney for the Republican National Committee. He cites the case of McCutcheon, an Alabama man who gave a total of $33,000 to various Republican candidates for Congress last year and wanted to give $21,000 more. He was stopped by the legal limit on total contributions to candidates, which now stands at $48,600.

McCutcheon “holds firm convictions on the proper role of government” and “opposes numerous and ill-conceived and overreaching laws,” he told the court, and he wants more “federal officeholders who share his beliefs.”

Bopp said a court decision lifting the total contributions limit would not give an unfair advantage to either side in American politics. “There are as many rich liberal people as rich conservative people,” he said.

Lee Drutman, a researcher at the Sunlight Foundation, disagrees. “The data shows there are more big donors on the right than on the left,” he said.

But a win for McCutcheon and the Republican National Committee would seemingly affect only a few thousand generous givers. Last year, about 1,700 donors bumped up against the limit on contributions to party committees. And only about 600 donors hit the maximum of $48,600 in contributions to all candidates.

The partisan divide on the campaign funding limits is stark and clear. The Republican campaign committees have joined in urging the court to strike down the limits, while House Democrats have joined the Obama administration in defending them. The court has been similarly divided, with the five Republican appointees joining recent rulings to strike down limits, while the four Democratic appointees dissented.

Advertisement

Fred Wertheimer, a longtime champion of the campaign funding laws, remains optimistic that the limits will survive — and because of Roberts.

Roberts “is likely to be the key vote in deciding this case,” Wertheimer said, and he “has a different record on campaign finance issues than his conservative colleagues.”

Wertheimer added, however: “If the Supreme Court reverses its past position and strikes down the long-standing aggregate contribution limits, it will open the door wide to corruption of our federal officeholders and government decisions.”

But just in case you do have some faint, slight, extremely modest interest in parlaying your landslide re-election into a presidential bid, here are four 2016 “don’ts” to keep in mind:

Don’t be Jon Huntsman. This sounds easy enough, but obvious pitfalls are still worth pointing out. For the next two years, you’re going to be hailed up and down the Acela Corridor as the Great Moderate Hope, the anti-Tea Party candidate, the Man Who Is Not Ted Cruz. But you can’t actively embrace that part, or give off the impression — as Huntsman did, obviously and fatally — that you agree with the media that your party’s full of rubes and cranks.

As a would-be nominee, you have to woo base voters, not run against them, and make them feel respected even when they disagree with you. This doesn’t mean muzzling yourself, or pandering to every right-wing interest group. But it means persuading conservatives that you like them, that you understand them and that as president you’re going to be (mostly) on their side.

Don’t be Rudy Giuliani. You probably think you wouldn’t have Rudy’s problems in a Republican primary.

Now, they've released the second part, and boy, it's a doozy for the GOP.



In a sign of the political hangover congressional Republicans are suffering in the wake of the government shutdown, three-quarters of Americans in a new national poll say that most GOP members of Congress don't deserve to be re-elected. A CNN/ORC International survey released Monday also found a majority saying that the Republicans' policies are too extreme. And according to the poll, Democrats have an 8-point advantage over the Republicans in an early indicator in the battle for control of Congress. But with more than a year to go until the 2014 midterm elections, there's plenty of time for these numbers to change. .... More than seven in 10 questioned in the survey said that most members of Congress don't deserve to be re-elected, with nearly four in 10 saying even their own representative doesn't deserve a return ticket to Washington next year. Both figures are hovering around all-time highs in CNN polling. ""Although incumbent members of Congress of both parties are not very popular, the shutdown seems to have only affected views of GOP incumbents,"" CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said. Three-fourths of people questioned in the survey said that most congressional Republicans don't deserved to be re-elected, 21 percentage points higher than the 54% who say most Democrats don't deserve another term in office. Only one in five say most Republicans deserve to be re-elected; 42% say the same thing about Democrats on Capitol Hill.

Deserve re-election?



Yes No

Dem 40% 56%

GOP 20% 76%

Now, this question was asked of all Americans, and NOT of registered voters (and obviously not of likely voters). The CNN pollask it of registered voters as well, and from the smaller sample, registered voters were slightly more angry at both parties. Here, I've put it in chart form.Of note, that 40% for Democrats among registered voters is actually not the worst we've seen in recent history. The August 2010 numbers had only 36% of registered voters saying Democrats deserved re-election to Congress. However, that 20% for the GOP is thein the poll's history by far, surpassing the previous low of just 31%, taken back in August 2011 during the last debt ceiling fight.

This is now spilling over into the generic ballot question as well.



Fifty percent of registered voters questioned said they would vote for the Democrat in their district, with 42% backing the Republican. The 8-point Democratic margin in the CNN poll is the same as in a recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey and close to the 9-point advantage for the Democrats in the generic ballot in a recent Quinnipiac University poll. ""We're a long way away from saying that the Democrats have a chance to regain control of the House,"" Holland cautioned. ""There is more than a year to go before any votes are actually cast and the 'generic ballot' question is not necessarily a good predictor of the actual outcome of 435 separate elections. A year before the 2010 midterms, for example, the Democrats held a 6-point lead on the generic ballot."" The Republicans eventually won back control of the House in 2010, thanks to a historic 63-seat pickup.

So again, while the signs look good now, they looked good for Democrats as well in 2010, and we all know the misery that followed. The generic ballot question almost always overestimates how well Democrats will do an entire year out from the actual election. Notice in 2006, a good year for Democrats, it only overestimated by a tiny bit. But in the midterm years good for the GOP, like 2002 and 2010, anyone thinking we were going to do OK because of the generic ballot question was in for a rude awakening. So recent history tells us that even if 2014 turns out to be a good year for Democrats, the generic ballot question STILL overestimates how well we're going to do a year ahead, but only by a little.

Notice in the 2010 average of the polls, on October 21, 2009 (exactly 4 years ago), Democrats held a 45%-39.5% advantage on the generic ballot question. And then a year later, a massive 63-seat loss in the House, with Republicans actually getting 51.6% of the vote, and Democrats only getting 44.8% of the vote.

So, while this poll is good news, don't you dare take anything for granted just yet."

Bloomberg on Tuesday challenged his would-be successors to take a tough line in negotiations with the city’s unions, while worrying aloud that whoever is elected will be too beholden to labor.

“We can’t wake up tomorrow morning — the day after the election — and find that some candidate has made a back-room deal with one of the unions that sets the pattern for all the other unions that will eventually lead to stopping the growth in this city,” Mr. Bloomberg said, departing from his prepared remarks at the end of a speech in Brooklyn on the city’s economy and fiscal situation.

“We cannot afford certain things,” he continued. “It’s tough to say no. It’s particularly tough to say no when nobody wants anybody to get hurt. But the bottom line: this is the taxpayers’ money, and this is our future.”

Mr. Bloomberg’s speech, delivered at a former Pfizer manufacturing plant that is now home to some two dozen small companies, producing everything from 3D printers to kimchi, was in part an attempt to burnish his record of fiscal stewardship, which is hotly debated. He argued that he has determinedly tried to reform pensions and health care but has been stymied by unions."

Story highlights NEW: Michelle Obama wears a floor-length, custom, red gown designed by Jason Wu NEW: She and the president dance to Jennifer Hudson singing ""Let's Stay Together"" ""Today is the day for all of us in this country to come together,"" says a GOP leader A civil rights veteran struggles ""to keep from crying"" as Obama takes oath on MLK Bible

It was a seemingly wistful moment at the halfway mark of his presidency, before the celebratory parade and the evening’s galas.

Shortly after exhorting the United States to continue its “never-ending journey” to live up to the ideals of its founders, on his way off the platform at the West Front of the Capitol, President Barack Obama stopped to drink in the scene before him.

“I want to take a look one more time,” he told those surrounding him. “I’m not going to see this again.”

And so, with his oath of office taken – again – and the speech delivered, the president stood aside for 24 seconds on the chilly Monday afternoon, letting the crowd that had joined him for his formal, public second inauguration file past.

It was one of the few quiet moments on an otherwise jam-packed day. Obama stole another such moment with his wife, at the first of two official inaugural balls they were scheduled to attend Monday night.

Obamas party with 30,000 close friends

Following performances by Alicia Keys, Brad Paisley and the Mexican rock group Mana, the first couple danced as Jennifer Hudson sang the classic song, “Let’s Stay Together,” by Al Green.

First lady Michelle Obama wore a floor-length, custom, ruby-colored chiffon and velvet gown designed by Jason Wu, the same designer behind her 2009 inaugural dress.

The celebrations came a day after Obama was sworn in on the constitutionally required date in a low-key ceremony at the White House. The flag-waving crowd that watched Monday’s event was noticeably smaller than the throng that turned out for his first oath in 2009 but still packed the National Mall for blocks.

The waving flags, the red-white-and-blue bunting and the heralding trumpets marked the 57th such ceremony in the history of the nation, with the peaceful extension of power based on last November’s election that returned Obama to the White House.

The best Inauguration Day tweets

The Sousa marches, the ceremonial guns and the voices of James Taylor, Kelly Clarkson and Beyonce having faded away, Obama headed into the Capitol for a luncheon with members of Congress. Then he led the traditional parade up Pennsylvania Avenue, stopping near the White House to walk a few blocks of the route with the first lady to the cheers of those lining the sidewalks.

“You’ve got to come out for this,” said Nick Pignone, a Washington resident. “Everyone’s excited – good vibes right now.”

Also publicly sworn in for a second term was Vice President Joe Biden, who, like Obama, also took his official oath Sunday. Justice Sonia Sotomayor performed the honors for Biden at his home at the Naval Observatory in Washington, where the vice president’s extended family and a few Cabinet officials gathered to watch the ceremony.

Biden and his wife, Jill, also took some time to walk part of the parade route, with a grinning Biden periodically jogging over to the sidelines to shake hands with people across the barricades. Once both couples and their families were seated at the White House reviewing stand, one of the first acts to pass was the marching band from Honolulu’s Punahou School, Obama’s alma mater.

What followed included dozens of military and school bands, Native American dance troupes whirling in traditional dress, war veterans, Civil War re-enactors, kilted firefighters blowing bagpipes and Montana’s governor and congressional delegation on horseback and in cowboy hats.

10 opinions: Explaining Obama’s speech

Obama, the first African-American president and the 17th to win a second term, used a pair of Bibles in Monday’s ceremony – one from Abraham Lincoln, the other from Martin Luther King Jr. His roughly 2,000-word inaugural address hearkened back to both.

“I did everything possible today to keep from crying,” said U.S. Rep. John Lewis, D-Georgia, a onetime lieutenant of King. He called the sight of Obama using King’s Bible “very moving, unreal – almost unbelievable.”

Monday is also the federal holiday commemorating the birthday of King, who was assassinated in 1968.

The loudest cheer of Obama’s address came when he said the nation’s journey remained incomplete “until our wives, our mothers, and daughters can earn a living equal to their efforts,” and “until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law.”

Obama embraces key social justice movements in inaugural address

Obama begins the second half of his presidency with the opportunity to make it more historic but facing some of the same challenges that he struggled with in the first four years.

Americans “have the power to set this country’s course,” he said, urging people to fulfill their citizenship by meeting “the obligation to shape the debates of our time – not only with the votes we cast, but with the voices we lift in defense of our most ancient values and enduring ideals.”

On the Mall, Carlos Arieta and his wife, Sharon, took in the scene after driving from Atlanta to witness history. The former Washington residents said it was the first time they had attended an inauguration.

Surprised by the throngs gathered a few hours before the speech on a clear morning with temperatures just above freezing, Arieta said “it’s nice to see all the different kinds of people.”

Even some of those who didn’t support Obama’s November re-election turned out to watch. Don King, 27, and his 21-year-old brother Matthew said they don’t agree with the president on taxation, debt and other fiscal issues but didn’t want to miss this bit of history.

“It’s the second inauguration for Obama, and it’s pretty amazing if you think back to the 1800s and later during the civil rights era, that we’re here,” Don King said.

Obamas, Bidens participate in National Day of Service

A new CNN/ORC International poll released Monday indicated less excitement this time than four years ago, when nearly 2 million people crowded the Mall despite frigid weather for Obama’s historic first inauguration.

In January 2009, nearly seven in 10 Americans questioned in a CNN survey said they were thrilled or happy that Obama was about to take office. Now, according to the new, that number is down 18 points, to 50%.

Back then, six in 10 saw Obama’s inauguration as a celebration by all Americans of democracy in action, with just 39% saying it was a political celebration by the supporters of the winning candidate.

Now, the numbers are nearly reversed, with 62% saying the second inauguration is a celebration by those backing the president, and 35% saying it’s a celebration of democracy.

“The thrill is gone, along with the hope that the start of a new presidential term of office will bring a divided nation together,” said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland.

Gergen: Obama 2.0 – tougher, wiser?

Reality of second-term presidencies

The smaller crowd this time around reflects the reality of second-term presidencies, when the novelty and expectations of a new leader have been replaced with the familiarity and experiences of the first act.

For Obama, that difference is even sharper. His historic ascendancy to the White House in 2008 came with soaring public hopes and expectations for a new kind of governance that would close the vast partisan gulf developed in recent decades.

However, a litany of challenges, including an inherited economic recession and repeated battles with congressional Republicans over budgets and spending, only hardened the opposing positions in Washington.

Obama’s signature achievements, including major reforms of the health care industry and Wall Street, became symbols of political division, with opponents constantly accusing him of hindering needed economic recovery.

Obama’s unfinished business and battles ahead

For his second term, Obama has vowed to press for an overhaul of the nation’s immigration policies and new ways to boost the sputtering economy, proposals that are bound to spark battles with his Republican rivals, and oversee the implementation of Obamacare.

And the shootings at a Connecticut elementary school last month put the divisive issue of gun control on his immediate agenda.

CNN polling released Sunday showed a majority of Americans – 54% – believe Obama will be an outstanding or above average president in his second term, while 43% said he’d be poor or below average.

And while overall, seven in 10 Americans hope the president’s policies succeed, only four in 10 Republicans feel that way, with 52% hoping that Obama will fail.

Obama’s second-term priorities

But House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, told CNN, “Today is the day for all of us in this country to come together.”

“I think the president did a fine job, certainly, laying out what he would like to see happen as far as the future of the country,” Cantor said. “There are areas of disagreement, but there are also some things fundamentally we agree on, and that is this country is one of opportunity. And sort of the way we get there to help everybody, there are some differences. Hopefully, we can bridge those differences.”

Four other priorities for the next four years

As mayor%2C Foxx hosted the 2012 Democratic National Convention in Charlotte

If confirmed by Senate%2C Foxx would replace the retiring Ray LaHood

Foxx%2C who is a Democrat%2C struck a bipartisan tone in remarks at the White House

WASHINGTON -- President Obama announced Monday his choice of Charlotte Mayor Anthony Foxx to be his next Transportation secretary, heralding the young mayor for revitalizing his city with critical investments in its transportation infrastructure.

Foxx, 41, raised his national profile after the Queen City hosted last year's Democratic National Convention.

Obama noted that during Foxx's time as mayor, ground was broken on the Charlotte Streetcar Project, a third parallel runway at Charlotte-Douglass International Airport was opened, and he worked to extend the LYNX light rail system to the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.

""When Anthony became mayor in 2009, Charlotte like the rest of the country was going through a bruising economic crisis,"" Obama said. ""But the city managed to turn things around ... and if you ask Anthony how that happened, he'll tell you one of the reason is that Charlotte made one of the largest investments in transportation in the city's history.""

In brief remarks at the White House on Monday afternoon, Foxx, who is a Democrat, struck a bipartisan tone.

""There is no such thing a Democratic or Republican road, bridge, port, airfield or rail system,"" Foxx said. ""We must work together, across party lines, to enhance this nation's infrastructure.""

The choice of Foxx, who is Charlotte's youngest elected mayor and the second African-American mayor in the city's history, also could help Obama dull criticism over the racial diversity of his Cabinet.

Earlier this month, Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., criticized Obama for failing to name any African Americans among his early picks for his second-term Cabinet, charging that the president ""has once again overlooked his most loyal constituency.""

And Rep. Marcia Fudge, D-Ohio, chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, also complained in a letter to Obama last month that his recent Cabinet nominees ""have hardly been reflective of this country's diversity.''

Obama was even ribbed by the comedian Conan O'Brien at Saturday's White House Correspondents Association's annual dinner in Washington over the lack of diversity in his Cabinet.

""Mr. President, your hair is so white it could be a member of your Cabinet,"" O'Brien said.

On Monday, Fudge in a statement praised Obama's pick and said that Foxx ""will surely be an asset to the President's cabinet and to this nation."" Meanwhile, Thompson said he was ""pleased with this development,"" but that he ""will continue to hold the president accountable for ensuring he has a diverse Cabinet.""

If confirmed by the Senate, Foxx would become the second African American in Obama's second-term Cabinet, joining Attorney General Eric Holder and United Nations Ambassador Susan Rice, both first term holdovers. Foxx would replace Ray LaHood, who announced earlier this year that he was stepping down as Transportation secretary once his replacement cleared the Senate.

The president has boasted of the diversity in his White House and urged critics not to judge the makeup of his Cabinet until he completed his picks. He still needs to nominate a Commerce secretary and U.S. trade representative.

Ahead of Obama's announcement Monday, White House spokesman Jay Carney said that the president is ""pleased with the individuals who have agreed to accept his nominations for positions in the Cabinet.""

""What you will see is a Cabinet that reflects the diversity of the country and the quality of people who are willing to serve their country in these important positions,"" Carney said.

Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond who studies federal nominations, said Republicans will question Foxx's short résumé on transportation issues, but predicted he'll sail through confirmation hearings. Foxx, who was first elected Charlotte's mayor in 2009, is a lawyer by training. He's served on staff of the House Judiciary Committee and in the civil rights division of the Justice Department.

""The Republicans on this kind of appointment as opposed to something like secretary of Defense are more likely to defer to the president,"" Tobias said.

If confirmed, Foxx will immediately face a budget fight and several contentious rules for consumer protection and safety.

A week of furloughs at the Federal Aviation Administration, which delayed thousands of flights, prompted Congress to allow the agency to shift around funding amid spending cuts to end the furloughs.

But the spending battle remains for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1 because the Obama administration wants to close tax loopholes while trimming spending, but congressional Republicans oppose new revenues.

The Transportation Department is also developing a consumer-protection rule dealing with how airlines market services such as baggage fees and seat assignments.

Consumer groups and travel agents are urging the department to force airlines to provide the prices for those services to the companies that allow comparisons at sites like Travelocity and Orbitz. But airlines are opposed to being forced to provide the information because comparison sites charge billions of dollars collectively each year.

Two safety rules are also pending at the FAA, in reaction to the last fatal crash of a commercial airliner in February 2009. One rule expected in August proposes to require as many training hours for co-pilots as pilots, with exceptions for military pilots and those graduating from four-year colleges. The other rule, expected in October, will require more simulator training about how to recover from a stall.

""Without question, our nation faces a number of transportation challenges that will require strong leadership and effective communication with Congress to keep our nation moving,"" said Sen. John Thune, the top Republican on the committee that will consider Foxx's nomination.

This was not the politician who campaigned in 2008 on themes of transcending the divisive politics of the past, though there were ritual calls for the country and its political leaders to seize this moment together. Instead, it was a president who has accepted the reality of those divisions and is determined to prevail on his terms.

Obama’s first campaign was aspirational, and he came to office believing, or at least hoping, that through force of personality he could gently guide the opposing sides to consensus on issues that had long resisted resolution. Monday’s speech conveyed the ambitions of a president looking at his next four years with a sense of frustration and impatience, and who now believes that a different style of leadership is required.

In his speech, Obama set out his priorities for a second term, goals that will cheer the liberal wing of the Democratic Party and probably alarm many on the right. He challenged Republicans to meet him partway, though not exactly in the middle. If there was an underlying message Monday, it was not “Come, let us reason together.” It was “Follow me.” The question is whether he will be any more successful in his second term than he was in his first.

Pressure on Republicans

There are reasons for the president setting a different tone in his second inaugural than in his first. Two years after he and his party took a beating in the midterm elections, he now holds the strongest hand in Washington. His approval ratings have climbed above 50 percent, while his Republican opponents in Congress remain mired in disapproval ratings almost three times as high as their approval ratings.

Williamson/The Washington Post Wait 1 second to continue.

Obama once hoped that he could overcome the united opposition of congressional Republicans, whose militant House members set the party’s tone during the battles of the past two years, through negotiation with GOP leaders. Now he is looking to the country to pressure his opponents to compromise in ways that they would not during his first term.

Republicans have already tested the reelected president and discovered the limits of their power. Their decision not to pick a fight — for now — over the debt ceiling signaled their recognition of that reality. It was an acknowledgment that the tactic of opposing Obama at almost every turn may be self-defeating.

Obama appears ready to try to split the Republican coalition by setting pragmatists against ideologues. On Monday, he rebuked those who have been most aggressive in their opposition when he said, “We cannot mistake absolutism for principle, or substitute spectacle for politics, or treat name-calling as reasoned debate.”

Republicans will have to choose their battles more carefully, and they may prevail in some cases. Obama knows that he won’t get all he wants, but the balance of power at the start of his second term is far different from what it was 24 months ago.

The year ahead promises more debates over the size and scope of government, issues that dominated the past two years in Washington. Obama acknowledged the need to deal with spending and the deficit, but he also set out terms for the coming fight over federal entitlements.

During the campaign, Obama talked about the philosophical divide between Republicans and Democrats on these issues, as he condemned the broken politics of Washington. He said the American people could break the tie with the election.

But the election returned a majority of Republicans to the House, and on Monday the president seemed to suggest that there were grounds for compromise. “Progress,” he said, “does not compel us to settle centuries-long debates about the role of government for all time, but it does require us to act in our time.”

Addressing his coalition

Obama’s second inaugural address also reflected a changing America and the coalition that reelected him to office. The nation’s first African American president leads an ever-more diverse population and a country in which attitudes and mores continue to change, particularly among the youngest segment of society.

The policy agenda he put forth, and the values he enunciated, spoke directly to that coalition. Never before has a president used an inaugural address to speak so openly about the cause of gay rights, linking the 1969 Stonewall uprising that led to the gay rights movement with Selma and civil rights and the 1839 Seneca Falls Convention and women’s rights.

Not all Americans agree with these changes, and as president, Obama must attempt to speak for them and to them. But his remarks Monday suggest that he believes history is on his side on these issues.

The president’s second inaugural address was notable also for what he talked about only in brief. Four years ago, he stood on the Capitol’s West Front with the country facing an economic crisis. Output was falling, the stock market had plunged, many Americans were threatened with housing foreclosures, and unemployment was rising rapidly. He talked about “a sapping of confidence across our land.”

On Monday, he touched only lightly on that crisis and spoke of the economy in positive terms. “An economic recovery has begun,” he said. At a time when jobs remain a top priority for most Americans, he chose neither to highlight that problem nor to offer any new solutions — though, ultimately, he will be judged on his effectiveness in restoring the economy to its full strength.

Opponents will find much to dislike about what Obama said Monday, for this was not a speech aimed at mollifying those who lost the election. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who lost the presidential race four years ago, expressed disappointment that Obama was not more explicit about bringing the two sides together. “I would have liked to have seen more on outreach and working together,” McCain said. But the senator added, “It’s his privilege to say what he wants.”

Obama risks overreaching or over-interpreting his mandate, which can be an affliction of newly reelected presidents. His victory in November was decisive but not overwhelming. Self-confidence can slip over the line to arrogance or hubris. Second terms often disappoint. So there are dangers ahead for the president.

On Monday, he set out his ambitions for a second term in clear language. What follows will define how history judges both those priorities and his ability to turn them into action."

The Senate Republican leader isn’t an especially lovable figure. Even many of his fellow conservatives are lukewarm about him.

He’s colorless and charisma-free. He’s a thoroughgoing partisan who has launched more filibusters than any Senate leader in history. He’s a relentless fan of unlimited campaign spending and a bitter opponent not just of Obamacare but of all things Obama. Asked in 2010 to describe his highest legislative goal, he said it was to make sure Barack Obama was a one-term president.

But the wily Kentuckian is also an old-fashioned legislative strategist who can count votes, discern when his party is holding a losing hand and make the decision to cut a deal.

That’s what McConnell did this week when he sat down with his Democratic counterpart, the equally unlovable Harry Reid of Nevada, and struck a bargain to reopen the federal government and avert the danger of a default on the national debt.

“No one wants a default,” McConnell said. “So let’s put this hysterical talk of default behind us and instead start talking about finding solutions.”

McConnell took a distinct political risk in agreeing to extend the federal debt ceiling until February with almost no strings attached. The Senate Conservatives Fund, a fundraising group that backs primary challenges to Republicans it deems insufficiently hard-line, denounced him for “negotiating surrender.” (This column won’t do him much good either.)

But McConnell could read the polls. The longer the government shutdown continued and the closer the nation came to a politically induced financial crisis, the more the GOP was losing.

And McConnell, a ferocious enforcer of discipline, knew he could deliver most of his party’s votes. “There are few things more daunting in politics,” Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) once said, “than the determined opposition of Sen. McConnell.”

But whether a deal is on track by the time you read this column — something in no way certain as I write these words — doesn’t depend on McConnell alone. His counterpart on the other side of Capitol Hill has a tougher job.

House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio), who holds a safe seat and commands a 32-seat majority, can’t manage to work his will among the 232 Republicans who chose him as their leader.

On Tuesday, Boehner and his lieutenants tried to unveil a proposal of their own to end the budget standoff, one with tougher conditions than the bargain McConnell struck with Reid. The idea was to give the House a coherent position from which to negotiate with the Senate and to avoid being “jammed” to accept the McConnell-Reid deal as the Oct. 17 deadline for lifting the debt ceiling bore down.

In a basement conference room in the Capitol on Tuesday morning, House Republicans gathered, bowed their heads, and — in lieu of an opening prayer — sang three a cappella verses of “Amazing Grace.”

It went downhill from there. Tea party conservatives, who had caucused the night before at a Mexican restaurant called Tortilla Coast, complained that Boehner’s draft didn’t do enough to block Obama’s healthcare law. Fiscal conservatives balked at lifting the debt ceiling for as long as the four months proposed by the Senate.

Boehner warned his colleagues — as he has many times — that flirting with the debt ceiling was a bad idea. “The idea of default is wrong, and we shouldn’t get anywhere close to it,” he said. But after a day of backroom negotiations, the speaker withdrew his own draft proposal, leaving the House without any plan at all.

The difference between the two leaders isn’t merely a matter of talent or style. Because House members represent much smaller, often more homogenous constituencies, many of them see no reason to compromise. This week, for example, as polls showed the Republican Party plummeting in the eyes of voters, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) dismissed the numbers, saying it was more important for conservatives to stick to their principles.

McConnell’s challenge is different: His mission is to make it possible for Republicans to win the six more seats they need to secure a majority in the Senate. That means fighting for conservative principles when he can, but not at the cost of diminishing the GOP’s appeal to centrist voters.

In the House, the roughly 35 Republicans who ally with the tea party make the difference between a majority and a minority for the GOP. In the Senate, McConnell has to contend with only three tea party renegades in his caucus of 48: Ted Cruz of Texas, Mike Lee of Utah and Rand Paul of Kentucky.

The difference mirrors the larger dilemma faced by the Republican Party nationwide: Should it focus on building a grass-roots movement of committed tea party conservatives, or seek to enlarge its coalition by welcoming more moderates and pragmatists?

The answer matters to McConnell in more ways than one. He faces a well-funded Tea Party opponent in Kentucky’s GOP primary next year. If he can survive that challenge and help six more Republicans win Senate seats, he might yet achieve his ambition of being sworn in as majority leader in 2015.

Most contributions to candidates for Virginia governor come from out-of-state sources

Outside groups are testing tactics in the state%2C which will be a key battleground in 2016 races

Groups backing McAuliffe%27s candidacy are among the biggest outside spenders in the race

A group backed by the Koch brothers has organized hundreds of activists to knock on doors to turn out conservative-leaning voters. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is running ads about the toll of gun violence. And a California billionaire worried about climate change has even hired an impersonator to taunt the Republican nominee.

Welcome to the Virginia governor's race, where outside groups are flooding the airwaves and bombarding voters' homes with mailers and phone calls both to shape the outcome of next week's contest between Republican Ken Cuccinelli and Democrat Terry McAuliffe and to test their campaign tactics ahead of 2016 in a presidential battleground state.

""Virginia in 2013 is a good incubator,"" said Dave Schwartz, Virginia state director of Americans for Prosperity, a non-profit group supported by billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch. Its affiliated foundation has undertaken a massive voter-canvassing operation ahead of the election, tapping about 1,600 activists to make phone calls and go door-to-door in the last month alone to encourage Virginians who typically vote in presidential contests to show up next Tuesday.

The group plans to reach 125,000 voters by Election Day. ""We want to test our capabilities,"" said Schwartz, whose organization is pushing a small-government agenda at the federal and state level. ""We want to see what works and what doesn't.""

Abortion-rights groups, environmentalists, gun-control advocates and the National Rifle Association all have jumped into the battle, one of two governorships to be decided next week. Virginia also is one of a handful of states where individuals, unions and corporations can donate unlimited amounts directly to candidates. McAuliffe has pulled in more than $34 million, while Cuccinelli has raised nearly $20 million.

The stakes are high in the Old Dominion, a swing state won by President Obama in both his campaigns. In 2008, he was the first Democratic presidential candidate to carry the state in more than four decades. In every race since 1977, however, the president's party has lost the state's governorship.

McAuliffe, a former Democratic National Committee chairman, hopes to end that streak, and recent polls give him the advantage over Cuccinelli, the state's attorney general, who has drawn support from religious conservatives and Tea Party activists for his staunchly conservative views. He was the first state attorney general to file suit against Obama's 2010 health care law, and he has expressed skepticism about climate change.

With New Jersey's Republican Gov. Chris Christie expected to cruise to re-election in the other gubernatorial race next week, ""the only game in town is Virginia,"" Robert Roberts, a political scientist at James Madison University in Harrisonburg, Va. ""Clearly, both parties want to win this race terribly badly.""

Obama will appear with McAuliffe at a get-out-the-vote rally Sunday in Northern Virginia. The husband-and-wife team of former president Bill Clinton and former secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, a potential 2016 presidential contender herself, also has stumped for the Democrat. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, a Republican, and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., hit the trail for Cuccinelli this week.

Major out-of-state donors

Out-of-state money dominates the race.

Seventy-two percent of McAuliffe's campaign funds through Sept. 30 came from outside Virginia, according to an analysis by the Virginia Public Access Project, a non-partisan group that tracks political money. Cuccinelli relied on out-of-state donors for 64% of his haul during the same period.

Groups backing McAuliffe's candidacy are among the biggest outside spenders in the race. They include NextGen Climate Action, a political action committee founded by California billionaire Tom Steyer, that has spent more than $2.4 million to run independent commercials slamming Cuccinelli in the state's largest television markets.

Steyer, a prominent Democratic fundraiser and environmental activist, also has employed guerrilla tactics in the race, underwriting billboards questioning an energy company's donation to the Republican's campaign and hiring a Cuccinelli impersonator. He also has worked behind the scenes, helping support a group of landowners from southwestern Virginia who have battled two energy companies over royalties from natural gas removed from coal seams beneath their land.

The landowners have urged Cuccinelli to return campaign contributions he received from the parent company of one of the firms.

""Our efforts have sent the message that if you are anti-climate science — or choose to side with an out-of-state fossil fuel company against your state's own people — you will be held accountable,"" Steyer said in a statement about the race.

Other groups spending heavily include the Independence USA PAC, funded by New York City's billionaire Mayor Michael Bloomberg to promote his gun-control message. The PAC, which began advertising last week, already has spent more than six times the amount of the NRA, according to the Virginia Political Access Project's tally of spending in the state's four largest television markets.

Each candidate said the other would be beholden to out-of-state interests.

""Liberals like Michael Bloomberg and Tom Steyer ... are counting on (McAuliffe) to impose a big-government, radical agenda on Virginia,"" Cuccinelli spokeswoman Anna Nix said.

McAuliffe spokesman Josh Schwerin said McAuliffe is backed by a ""bipartisan coalition"" that knows ""he will focus on mainstream issues, which is a big difference from the divisive ideological crusades that have defined Cuccinelli's time"" in office.

Democratic groups weighing in

Groups affiliated with the Democratic candidates and causes are spending more heavily to influence the governor's race because they ""have a lot to fear from a unified Republican government,"" said Daniel Palazzolo, a political scientist at the University of Richmond. Republicans currently have a large, veto-proof majority in the state's House of Delegates, and no one expects control of the chamber to flip to Democrats.

""The gun folks don't have to worry about Terry McAuliffe coming in and passing any gun-control legislation,"" Palazzolo said. ""It won't get through the House of Delegates.""

A third candidate in the race, Libertarian Robert Sarvis, has raised less than $200,000, but he's also getting some last-minute outside help for his candidacy.

The Purple PAC, which describes itself as backing candidates who are ""red"" on fiscal policy and ""blue"" on social issues, plans to spend between $300,000 and $500,000 on a commercial that paints Sarvis as a better alternative to either McAuliffe or Cuccinelli."
http://news.yahoo.com/ap-interview-njs-christie-blames-aid-delay-dc-043519935.html,,[],AP Interview: NJ's Christie blames aid delay on DC,"TRENTON, N.J. (AP) — Gov. Chris Christie says he understands victims' frustrations a year after Superstorm Sandy but maintains that his administration isn't to blame for delays in aid reaching victims.

In an interview with The Associated Press as the anniversary of the Oct. 29 megastorm approached, Christie blamed Congress, which took three months to approve a $50.7 billion relief package for the region, and a thicket of red tape put in place to prevent the type of fraud that occurred after Hurricane Katrina.

""We've done everything we possibly can, and I think in the immediate aftermath did a very good job,"" Christie told the AP. ""Since then, we've kind of been hostage to two situations, the delay in the aid itself and then what I call the 'Katrina factor,' which is the much more detailed and difficult rules surrounding the distribution of the aid.""

Christie, widely believed to be positioning himself for a 2016 Republican presidential run, saw his popularity skyrocket after Sandy as he donned a blue fleece pullover and doggedly led the state through its worst natural disaster, a freakish storm that plunged 5.5 million state residents into darkness, damaged 360,000 homes and businesses, and disrupted gasoline supplies for days.

Christie was in many ways the face of the storm, whether he was embracing President Barack Obama during a visit to the battered coast or consoling a tearful 9-year-old girl who had lost her house and told the governor she was scared.

Lately, though, some of his admirers have become detractors.

Frustrations boiled over at a hearing last week on the pace of the recovery in Toms River, one of the hardest-hit communities. Storm victims there complained of insurance companies trying to lowball them on payouts, and stringent aid rules delaying them from rebuilding.

""These programs are intended to help; they're not. They're just putting more obstacles on you,"" said Vincent Giglio, a doctor from the Ortley Beach section of Toms River, which was devastated by the storm and remains sparsely populated a year later. He said getting insurance payouts and government aid has been daunting.

Story continues

""When I needed my government — the people I voted for — they failed me,"" said Danielle Vaz, of Toms River, who brought her 4-year-old autistic son along to show how months of being displaced has severely affected them both.

Christie refused to send an administration representative to any of four post-Sandy hearings because, he said, the sessions were led by Democrats out to score political points. He did assign staff to monitor the hearings and follow-up with anyone who complained.

""I get the that fact that until any one particular person you speak to is back in their homes and their lives are back to normal, they are going to be incredibly frustrated and upset and, in some cases, distraught,"" he said. ""I think most people, if you talk to them, would say we've done a good job. Not a perfect job, but a good job.""

Since the first $1.8 billion in federal recovery aid was approved, New Jersey has set up 17 separate programs for homeowners, renters, small businesses, local governments, nonprofits and developers. Counselors and administrative staff who were rude or unhelpful have been fired, he said.

The largest homeowner aid program, which provides as much as $150,000 for reconstruction, repairs, to elevate a house or protect against future flooding, has been criticized for not making any payouts from a $600 million allocation. One hundred grant applications totaling $7.8 million in assistance were signed last week, and the administration expects 200 more to be finished within days. About 4,000 homeowners are expected to benefit eventually.

Asked about the delay, Christie said cumbersome federal requirements are responsible.

After Katrina, homeowners proved their losses and got their money, he said. Under the new rules, checks go directly to builders, so the jobs are being awarded through public bidding, slowing the process. Also, environmental and historical reviews are required for post-Sandy rebuilding of homes and businesses. Those reviews weren't required after Katrina.

Though he said he understands the insistence on increased oversight, Christie, a former federal prosecutor, said he would have done some things differently. For example, he would have cut checks to homeowners instead of builders in the remediation program but required residents to keep living in their homes for a certain time as a condition of receiving the grant.

""To the victims, I'd say you're right, it is too slow, and I wish that the federal government would allow us the flexibility to get you aid more quickly,"" Christie said."

Next week, President Barack Obama will award former U.S. Army Staff Sergeant Clinton Romesha the nation's highest award for combat valor for his actions in repelling a deadly insurgent onslaught in Afghanistan in October 2009. He is the fourth living recipient to receive the award for service in Iraq or Afghanistan.

In an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper, Romesha describes his thoughts about seeing Combat Outpost Keating for the first time. The remote outpost was at the foot of three large mountains and surrounded by a river on one side as well. By all military standards, the base was virtually impossible to defend because of the looming mountains that would ultimately give the Taliban a tactical advantage to shoot down into the base and offer deep cover to those fighters in the rocky mountainsides.

""This is a pretty indefensible spot. This is the exact opposite of when you open up the manual and look in to find the definition of finding a defensible spot, this is the total opposite of it,"" Romesha said in the interview with Tapper.

Romesha is being recognized for his courage at COP Keating against the onslaught of hundreds of Taliban fighters. With just over 50 troops inside the tiny base, Romesha directed and led several charges to repel the 12 hour long attack and regain control of the outpost which had been overrun.

The assault on the outpost in the eastern province of Nuristan goes down as one of the deadliest attacks on U.S. troops in Afghanistan with eight soldiers killed and more than 20 wounded.

Romesha tells Tapper in an emotional account about his failed attempt to save a close friend, taff Sgt. Justin T. Gallegos, who was trapped in a vehicle which had come under heavy Taliban fire.

""There was movement everywhere. There was muzzle flashes everywhere. You just couldn’t pick them out fast enough. I tried to hold it as long as I could but when you’re the only machine gun pocking on the COP at that point you start drawing quite a bit of attention and finished the belt and scurried on back,"" Romesha said. ""I called Gallegos and told him told I was sorry. I just told him I was sorry. I couldn’t hold that position for him anymore and they were still stuck."""

Back in July, Five Thirty Eight’s election guru Nate Silver believed that control of the Senate was a tossup. That has all changed now that voters got their first real look at the brutal consequences of ObamaCare.

Starting with the generic ballot that simply pits Republican lawmakers against their Democrat counterparts, the movement towards the GOP has been striking. In the Real Clear Politics average of these polls, going back as far as the beginning of the year, Democrats have consistently led by 3 to 4 points. During the government shutdown, Democrats leaped to 6 and 7 point leads. Since the disastrous rollout of ObamaCare, though, Republicans are not only in the lead by 2.5 points; they have led in every poll but one since November 10.

This generic polling is reflected in the available polling of individual Senate seats.

Keep in mind that in order to win control of the Senate, Republicans need only pick up six seats, and with Democrat incumbents retiring in the redder than red states of South Dakota, West Virginia, and Montana, Republicans pretty much have three Senate pick-ups in the bag. But thanks to ObamaCare and vulnerable Democrat Senators refusing to put their own promises and the wellbeing of their constituents above slavish devotion to Obama, picking off another three should be fairly easy.

Kay Hagan (D-NC)

In North Carolina, Democrat Kay Hagan looked as though she was cruising to a second term victory. Just a few months ago, polls showed her ahead by double digits against her most likely Republican challengers.

In September, before ObamaCare started cancelling people’s policies by the millions and boosting the price of their premiums, Hagan was beating potential challenger Greg Bannon by a whopping 16 points. In the most recent poll taken just a couple weeks ago, Bannon picked up an astonishing 17 points and is now ahead by 1.

All of Hagan’s most likely Republican challengers made similar gains.

There is a YouTube video of Hagan promising that under ObamaCare you can keep your insurance if you like it. Obviously that is not true, which means she either lied or blindly voted for something without understanding the consequences for her constituents.

Mary Landrieu (D-LA)

Louisiana Senator Mary Landrieu has seen her approval rating collapse by double digits in just six months. Three months ago, Landrieu looked as though she would coast to a fourth term in a state Mitt Romney won without breaking a sweat. The National Journal now lists Landrieu as the third most endangered incumbent facing re-election in 2014.

In August, Landrieu was polling over 50% in potential match ups (which would avoid a Louisiana runoff that requires the eventual winner hit at least 50%) and beating Republican Congressman Bill Cassidy, her most likely opponent, by a full 10 points. The consequences of ObamaCare have completely flipped that script.

A recent poll shows the relatively unknown Cassidy behind by only 2 points

There is YouTube video of Landrieu promising her constituents that under ObamaCare, you can keep your insurance. The facts have either proved Landrieu a liar or incompetent. Other than token legislation to keep that promise, Landrieu has been as devoted to Obama and ObamaCare as any liberal Democrat.

Mark Pryor (D-AR)

Thanks to ObamaCare, Senator Mark Pryor’s approval ratings in Arkansas have collapsed to just 33%, the lowest of his 12 years in the Senate. When Democrat Arkansas incumbent Senator Blanche Lincoln lost her seat in 2010, her approval ratings were actually higher. The National Journal ranks Pryor as the most vulnerable Senate incumbent facing reelection in 2014.

Pryor is also on record misleading his constituents about ObamaCare.

Mark Begich (D-AK)

Just before the disastrous ObamaCare rollout, Alaskan Senator Mark Begich was cruising to reelection by as much as 11 points. Post-ObamaCare polls show that Begich has been considerably weakened and is ahead by only a point or two against his likely Republican challengers. Moreover, Begich’s approval rating among Alaskans now sits at a measly 39%.

Begich is on record misleading his constituents with false assurances that under ObamaCare you can keep your insurance. The GOP is already pounding him over that.

Other than token proposals, Begich has done absolutely nothing to either keep that promise or to mitigate the damage ObamaCare is doing to Alaskans.

The National Journal lists Begich as the second most vulnerable incumbent in the Senate.

Iowa – Open Democrat Seat

With longtime Democrat Tom Harkin retiring from the Senate, Democrats thought they had made this seat safe with the recruitment of Rep. Bruce Braley. Until the American people were rattled by the consequences of ObamaCare, Democrats were probably right. In matchup after matchup, Braley was ahead by double digits.

Post-ObamaCare, that lead has shrunk to single digits.

Mark Udall (D-CO)

Prior to the ObamaCare rollout, Udall wasn’t even on the National Journal‘s list of endangered incumbents. Millions of insurance cancellations later, however, and the Democrat has a real fight on his hands. In one likely match up, Udall’s 15 point lead back in June has dropped to just 3 points.

—

Since the ObamaCare fallout, the National Journal has added Al Franken (D-MN), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), and Jeff Merkley (D-OR) to its 2014 endangered list. Prior to the country being hit upside the head with the reality of ObamaCare, the idea that any one of these incumbents had anything to worry about was unthinkable.

Shaheen is vulnerable enough that former Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown is considering a challenge. Polls show her under 50% at 48% and Brown only behind by 4%. He hasn’t even made it official and is already within the margin of error. And if he runs, it will be on the issue of ObamaCare.

Many believe that the worst of ObamaCare has yet to show itself. As the 2014 midterm elections loom closer late next year, so will the employer mandate. The Obama Administration itself has predicted that the fallout from the employer mandate could be tens of millions of cancellations.

Knowing this is coming, and unless something changes, these vulnerable Democrats are likely to be remembered only as having done nothing to avoid catastrophes mainly afflicting the working and middle class.

That is, other than hold hands with Obama to watch it all burn.

Story highlights 40,000 measures set to become law in 2014 Obamacare mandate is the big federal law going into effect But states and cities have laws impacting minimum wage, shark fins and gender identity New gun control failed at federal level, but Connecticut acting on its own

(CNN) —

Not everyone subscribes to a New Year’s resolution, but Americans will be required to follow new laws in 2014.

Some 40,000 measures taking effect range from sweeping, national mandates under Obamacare to marijuana legalization in Colorado, drone prohibition in Illinois and transgender protections in California.

Although many new laws are controversial, they made it through legislatures, public referendum or city councils and represent the shifting composition of American beliefs.

Federal: Health care, of course, and vending machines

The biggest and most politically charged change comes at the federal level with the imposition of a new fee for those adults without health insurance.

For 2014, the penalty is either $95 per adult or 1% of family income, whichever results in a larger fine.

The Obamacare, or Affordable Care Act, mandate also requires that insurers cover immunizations and some preventive care.

Additionally, millions of poor Americans will receive Medicaid benefits starting January 1.

Thousands of companies will have to provide calorie counts for products sold in vending machines.

Local: Guns, family leave and shark fins

Connecticut: While no national legislation was approved to tighten gun laws a year after the Newtown school shooting, Connecticut is implementing a final round of changes to its books: All assault weapons and large capacity magazines must be registered.

Oregon: Family leave in Oregon has been expanded to allow eligible employees two weeks of paid leave to handle the death of a family member.

California: Homeless youth are eligible to receive food stamps. The previous law had a minimum wage requirement.

Delaware: Delaware is the latest in a growing number of states where residents can no longer possess, sell or distribute shark fins, which is considered a delicacy in some East Asian cuisine.

Illinois and drones

Illinois: passed two laws limiting the use of drones. One prohibits them from interfering with hunters and fisherman. The measure passed after the group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals said it would use drones to monitor hunters. PETA said it aims through its “air angels” effort to protect against “cruel” and “illegal” hunting.

Also in Illinois, another law prohibits the use of drones for law enforcement without a warrant.

Gender and voting identity

California: Students can use bathrooms and join school athletic teams “consistent with their gender identity,” even if it’s different than their gender at birth.

Arkansas: The state becomes the latest state requiring voters show a picture ID at the voting booth.

Minimum wage and former felon employment

Workers in 13 states and four cities will see increases to the minimum wage.

While most amount to less than 15 cents per hour, workers in places like New Jersey and Connecticut will see a slightly larger increase.

New Jersey residents voted to raise the state’s minimum wage by $1 to $8.25 per hour. And in Connecticut, lawmakers voted to raise it between 25 and 75 cents to $8.70. The wage would go up to $8 in Rhode Island and New York.

California is also raising its minimum wage to $9 per hour, but workers must wait until July to see the addition.

Rhode Island: It is the latest state to prohibit employers from requiring job applicants to signify if they have a criminal record on a job application.

Social media and pot

Oregon: Employers and schools can’t require a job or student applicant to provide passwords to social media accounts.

Colorado: Marijuana becomes legal in the state for buyers over 21 at a licensed retail dispensary.

http://news.yahoo.com/mitt-romney-47-192834720.html,,[],Mitt Romney: What 47%?,"You likely remember this, but let's just do some quick catching up. On Sept. 17, 2012, Mother Jones released a video, helped by former President Carter's grandson, of a private fundraiser for Mitt Romney. Here's what the GOP presidential nominee said:

There are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the president no matter what. All right, there are 47 percent who are with him, who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe that government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you name it. That that's an entitlement. And the government should give it to them. And they will vote for this president no matter what. And I mean, the president starts off with 48, 49, 48—he starts off with a huge number. These are people who pay no income tax. Forty-seven percent of Americans pay no income tax. So our message of low taxes doesn't connect. And he'll be out there talking about tax cuts for the rich. I mean that's what they sell every four years. And so my job is not to worry about those people—I'll never convince them that they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.

MORE FROM NATIONAL JOURNAL

The remarks turned out to be quite damning. And now, 10 months later, there are new words from Mitt Romney trying to jedi mind trick the old ones all away.

RELATED: 100% of New Obama Ads Are Talking About 47%

In a Washington Post excerpt of Dan Balz's upcoming book on the 2012 election, Romney put forward one of his most adamant defenses of the 47 percent comments. Balz's interview with Romney took place in late January, 2013. Here's Romney on what went through his head when he first heard about the video being released:

As I understood it, and as they described it to me, not having heard it, it was saying, 'Look, the Democrats have 47 percent, we've got 45 percent, my job is to get the people in the middle, and I've got to get the people in the middle.'... And I thought, 'Well, that's a reasonable thing.' ... It's not a topic I talk about in public, but there's nothing wrong with it. They've got a bloc of voters, we've got a bloc of voters, I've got to get the ones in the middle. And I thought that that would be how it would be perceived — as a candidate talking about the process of focusing on the people in the middle who can either vote Republican or Democrat. As it turned out, down the road, it became perceived as being something very different.

Story continues

Calling the idea behind the comments ""a reasonable thing"" is a bit off from Romney's comments this June, in which he told CNN that he was ""very upset"" over what he said. The new view of his remarks also pushed aside the idea that those 47 percent weren't just ""Democrats,"" but in Romney's assessment were ""dependent upon government ... believe they are victims"" and that he'd never be able to ""convince them that they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.""

RELATED: James O'Keefe Is the Real Victim Here

Balz specifically asked Romney about the ""personal responsibility"" remark. Mitt Romney said it was fiction:

Actually, I didn't say that.... That's how it began to be perceived, and so I had to ultimately respond to the perception, because perception is reality.

Think of it as a ""sorry, I'm not sorry."" It's also a fascinating, one-sentence summation of how easy it is for a campaign aparatus to become an impenetrable bubble.

RELATED: Scott Brown Goes All In on Warren's Cherokee Pa-Paw

Romney then presented Balz with his own take on the event. Some of which is here:

In two months, my job is to get the people in the middle. But this was perceived as, 'Oh, he's saying 47 percent of the people he doesn't care about or he's insensitive to or they don't care—they don't take responsibility for their life.' No, no. I'm saying 47 percent of the people don't pay taxes and therefore they don't warm to our tax message. But the people who are voting for the president, my job isn't to try and get them. My job is to get the people in the middle. And I go on and say that. Take a look. Look at the full quote. But I realized, look, perception is reality. The perception is I'm saying I don't care about 47 percent of the people or something of that nature, and that's simply wrong.

This doesn't really mesh with the full quotation above from Mother Jones's video transcript. Mother Jones's David Corn was caught pretty surprised by the new comments. But Romney did realize one thing:

Well, clearly that was a very damaging quote and hurt my campaign effort.

That's a statement you don't need much more context for."

His campaign in this crucial battleground state is in danger of becoming the first political casualty of the federal government shutdown, which Americans largely blame on Republicans.

With the election just weeks away, Cuccinelli’s poll numbers have tumbled since federal agencies were closed Oct. 1. The conservative state attorney general was already lagging, but he went from within striking distance of a vulnerable Democrat to trailing by 8 to 10 percentage points in three independent polls.

As the candidate, a tea party favorite, seeks to distance himself from fellow activists in Congress, national Republican leaders are worried that a key office they expected to hold in a closely watched election is slipping away.

They also fear the shutdown could tarnish the party’s brand ahead of next year’s midterm election.

Not all Republican candidates are suffering because of the shutdown. In Democratic New Jersey, Gov. Chris Christie, a GOP nonconformist, is positioned to cruise to reelection.

Christie is conservative, but he has not allied himself with the tea party. Instead, he has focused on issues that most concern voters, such as the runaway costs of public employee benefits, and he is moving ahead with President Obama’s healthcare law. The New Jersey governor shows little regard for how his policies affect score cards with activists on the right.

“Republicans should think about these things as they ponder who to support in 2016,” said strategist Steve Schmidt, who ran Arizona Sen. John McCain’s presidential campaign in 2008. Schmidt sees the Virginia race as a cautionary tale for the party. “You have a campaign that has been unable to transcend its ideological baggage, running against someone who would have been beatable with almost any other conceivable candidate.”

Cuccinelli also has the misfortune to be running in the state with the most federal workers. Analysts say the uneasiness many voters had with Cuccinelli’s tea party brand of Republicanism has solidified into outright opposition.

“The shutdown is hurting Cuccinelli,” said Quentin Kidd, a professor of political science at Christopher Newport University in Newport News, Va. For voters on the fence, he said, “it helped them make a decision. They thought, ‘If that is the kind of thing we’d be looking at with Ken Cuccinelli, then I am not interested.’”

Establishment Republicans are frustrated. The Democratic nominee, Terry McAuliffe, is a former chairman of the national party and is saddled with baggage.

His business dealings have long attracted unflattering media attention, including allegations that he cashed in on his Clinton-era political connections to grow his personal fortune. At the Democratic National Committee, his fundraising tactics pushed ethical boundaries. He’s been compared to a carnival barker and a used car salesman.

But in a part of the country that has drifted from solidly red to solidly purple, polls suggest the statewide electorate would sooner vote for a candidate who may strike them as smarmy than one allied with the Republican Party’s most extreme politicians.

“I don’t like McAuliffe, but I really don’t like Cuccinelli,” said Cindy Freese, 59, a retired reinsurance executive in Alexandria who is registered as an independent. Her husband is a federal employee poised to miss his mid-month paycheck. Freese said she would “absolutely” vote for a moderate Republican for governor, “but there aren’t any anymore.”

Virginia’s electoral landscape, like that of the country overall, has shifted amid an influx of immigrants and the growth of diverse suburbs. In last year’s presidential election, the Obama campaign used those changing demographics to its advantage, microtargeting voters with messaging that appealed to them. McAuliffe has recruited some of the data whizzes and strategists behind that effort to replicate it in Virginia.

The Cuccinelli campaign represents the traditional approach. The candidate is the kind of firebrand conservative whom party activists believe energizes voters in the style of Ronald Reagan. As attorney general, he fought to block Obama’s healthcare law. A climate change skeptic, he started an investigation into a University of Virginia scientist whose research warned of a rise in temperatures. He has condemned homosexuality and sought to reinstate anti-sodomy laws rejected by the courts.

That record is not playing well with many Virginians uneasy with the rigid ideologies at the root of the shutdown. At a University of Richmond forum last week, Cuccinelli avoided much of it.

He lamented the refusal to compromise in Congress, saying he opposes the shutdown. He said Republicans failed the country on healthcare by not doing anything to fix a broken system when they controlled the White House and Congress. Asked to name the biggest social policy on his agenda, Cuccinelli responded, “That isn’t what I am running on.”

McAuliffe reminded the audience that Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), a current tea party favorite, had just campaigned in Virginia for Cuccinelli. “The architect of the shutdown was here last week,” McAuliffe said. “He and Ken Cuccinelli went to an event together. I wouldn’t have even been in the same room with Ted Cruz, with all the damage he has done.”

To be sure, Cuccinelli’s stumble began before the shutdown. Federal investigators are looking into a business executive’s connections to Gov. Bob McDonnell, and the inquiry has tainted the state party. Cuccinelli’s attacks on McAuliffe’s ethics were blunted when it came out that he had accepted $18,000 in gifts from the businessman.

But it was only after federal employees were told not to report to work that McAuliffe nearly doubled his lead in the polls.

“What has happened here reflects the challenges the GOP faces nationally,” Virginia Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling said.

Advertisement

A moderate Republican, Bolling opted not to run for governor when the party decided to choose its candidate with a convention, not an election, at the behest of activists seeking to ensure the nominee would be loyal to the base.

“Now,” he said, “Democrats have been able to use the shutdown to remind mainstream Virginia voters about what their concerns are: Would Ken Cuccinelli be able to govern in a mainstream way? Or would he govern the state in the style you are seeing in D.C.?”

TRENTON, N.J. — A lopsided race for governor in New Jersey will be decided Tuesday when voters choose between Republican Gov. Chris Christie, who could leave before a second term ends to run for president, and Barbara Buono, a little-known state senator who was the only Democrat willing to challenge the popular incumbent.

Polls opened at 6 a.m. and will close at 8 p.m.

Christie has been barnstorming the state by bus since Wednesday to drive up turnout. Polls leading up to Election Day showed him with a 20-plus point advantage as he pushes for a landslide to burnish his bipartisan credentials and show how well a reach-across-the-aisle Republican can do in a Democratic-leaning state. Christie is looking to become the first Republican running statewide to break 50 percent since George H.W. Bush in 1988.

Buono campaigned without the aid of big-name Democrats. She also was spurned early on by Democratic leaders who control party politics in the state. They have a good working relationship with Christie and didn't believe the progressive from Metuchen, on the fringes of the New York City metropolitan area, could win.

Christie, 51, was already popular when Superstorm Sandy slammed into the coast a year ago, damaging 360,000 homes and businesses, plunging 5.5 million people into darkness and disrupting gasoline supplies for days. His popularity skyrocketed as he donned a blue fleece pullover and led the state through its worst natural disaster, whether he was embracing President Barack Obama during a visit to the battered coast or consoling a tearful 9-year-old who had lost her house.

Christie underwent weight-loss surgery in February and has been shedding pounds steadily since, addressing a health issue that could affect his political plans in the future. He was disqualified as a 2012 vice presidential candidate after refusing to answer questions about his health and other matters, according to a new book on last year's presidential campaign.

Christie has refused to rule out a presidential run, which may mean he could resign before his second term ended.

Nearly half of New Jersey residents think he'll run, according to a recent poll.

Buono, 60, has portrayed Christie's ambitions as a negative. In an interview on MSNBC on Monday, she said the governor is putting his personal ambitions ahead of the needs of the state.

Buono has also challenged Christie on gay marriage, which she supported and he opposed before it became legal in New Jersey last month. She criticized Christie's budget priorities — refusing to reinstate a surcharge on millionaires while trimming a property tax credit for the working poor, for example — and his veto of legislation raising the minimum-wage.

Though a majority of New Jersey residents agree with Buono on social issues, she has been unable to get out from a campaign Catch-22: She couldn't get her message out because she hadn't raised a lot of money for advertising, and she had trouble raising money because voters didn't know her.

Democrats, including Buono, rejected Christie's minimum-wage compromise of scaling back an increase and phasing it in over three years, and instead decided to put the question to voters.

So voters are being asked in ballot question No. 2 to increase the minimum wage by $1, to $8.25 per hour, and to allow annual cost-of-living increases based on inflation. They'll also be asked to allow veterans' groups to use proceeds from games of chance to run their organizations.

Voters will also choose their legislative representatives. Democrats now control both the Senate and Assembly with all 120 seats up for election."

Editor’s Note: Julian Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University. He is the author of “Jimmy Carter” and “Governing America.”

Until now “sequestration” has been a word that only means something to people living inside the Beltway or to political junkies who depend on their daily dose of Politico and The Hill. But if Congress and the president do not reach a deal by March 1, which appears likely, Americans will quickly learn what it means – namely deep spending cuts.

The spending cuts pose a significant political threat to Republicans, more so than to Democrats. Although many Republicans are standing firm, insisting that their party will be fine if the cuts go through, there are many reasons for the GOP, through a sober eye, to see the dangers that lay ahead.

The cuts could push congressional politics in a liberal direction and establish the foundation for solid Democratic gains in 2014.

Last week Bob Woodward argued that President Obama was responsible for the sequester idea, not the Republicans. But while people are squabbling over who owns the sequester, the GOP will take the hit regardless.

Larry Levanti Julian Zelizer

The danger for Republicans is that the budget cuts will severely weaken public support for the austerity theme that the party has been promoting since 2010. The cuts will make “deficit reduction” something very real to average American citizens and business and something that is often quite painful rather than an abstract debate over numbers.

Opinion: One cuts, Washington throws a tantrum

While Americans have historically been hostile to government, they tend to support specific government services when asked by pollsters. So Washington’s overall spending might not be popular as a concept, but Social Security and Medicare are.

The spending cuts will shift the debate toward the specifics. Americans will watch as government services are retrenched. The last time this happened, things didn’t go well for the GOP.

When the federal government shut down in 1995-1996 because of a budget standoff between Republicans and President Clinton, the GOP faced a huge backlash when Americans were unable to access basic government services, such as obtaining a passport or visiting the national zoo.

Opinion: The spending cut fairy tale

President Obama has already been using the bully pulpit to make this case, appearing with first responders and warning of how the cuts will impact police, hospitals, teachers, airline workers and more. Standing in front of a group of police officers, Obama said, “Federal prosecutors will have to close cases and let criminals go.” While these speeches are a form of political theater, they are based on very real possibilities.

The budget cuts that result from sequestration would just be the first of the threats the GOP faces. If the government has to shut down as a result of a standoff when the government’s general operating budget expires in late March or the debt ceiling is not raised this spring, Republicans will continue to lose the public’s confidence in their ability to govern and the reduction in services will highlight to Americans what the government actually does.

If the economy sputters as a result of the spending cuts, as some economists predict, deficit reduction will look even worse. An already frustrated workforce will become even more angry, and likely take out their frustration on a Republican Party that has been insisting deficit reduction should be the nation’s short-term goal, rather than stimulating the economy.

Conservatives will suffer as the focus of congressional debate will quickly shift from the issue of spending cuts, where the emphasis has been since 2011, to the issue of spending more.

Once the cuts go through, frustration and anger with the impact on government services will certainly produce increased pressure on legislators in both parties to offer a fix, namely to restore spending to key areas.

Borger: Obama can’t kick his legacy down the road

With legislators already thinking about the 2014 elections, this will be tempting. If this shift occurs, Republicans, who have invested so much in making fiscal discipline their top issue, will be operating in a congressional environment where the debates center around areas where the government needs to devote more government resources rather than less.

The automatic spending cuts are the ultimate symbol of a dysfunctional government. The reason the cuts were put into place was that President Obama and Congress were unable to reach an agreement on taxes and spending. Government leaders agreed to put a gun to their own head by threatening unpalatable cuts if they were unable to reach a deal. Now the trigger is about to be pulled.

The problem for Republicans is that the polls show that the approval rating of the GOP is in the tank while President Obama is doing relatively well. According to Quinnipiac University, only 19% of Americans approve of how Republicans are handling their job.

Obama is enjoying his highest favorability ratings since 2009, with 60% having a favorable rating of him in a Washington Post-ABC poll. The likelihood, as in 1995-1996, is that the public will blame the dysfunction on the GOP rather than Democrats and the party will suffer a further erosion of its standing as a result.

According to a recent poll by the Pew Foundation and USA Today, Republicans would be blamed for the cuts by almost half of Americans, while only 31% would blame Obama.

News: Top Senate Republican doubts damage from defense cuts

Sequestration will soon become a dirty word in the American political lexicon. While it is impossible to predict which way the political winds will blow, there is good reason for Republicans to see how they can suffer politically if some kind of deal is not reached.

Republicans, who have now struggled through two presidential elections and are facing a demographic shift that does not work in their favor, might want to start thinking harder about their strategy on spending. Deficit reduction is no longer a winning issue for the GOP.

Reps. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, and Chris Stewart, R-Utah, on Friday sent a letter to EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy expressing concern over the proposed draft rule, which they say would give the agency “unprecedented control over private property across the nation.”

The rule, which aims to clarify the agency's regulatory jurisdiction over different types of water bodies, was sent to the Office of Management and Budget in September for review. The agency has said the scope of the proposal is limited to clearing up confusion caused by Supreme Court decisions involving the Clean Water Act.

The lawmakers claimed the agency is engaging in a ""rushed, politicized regulatory process"" and called for the EPA's independent science advisory board to review the science underlying the proposal.

""In light of the significant implications this action would have on the economy, property rights and state sovereignty, this process must be given more thought and deliberation to allow for important, statutorily-required, weighing of the scientific and technical underpinnings of the proposed regulatory changes,"" the lawmakers wrote.

In September, the agency released a report from its science advisory board analyzing the relationships between smaller, isolated bodies of water and larger ones. The report, which served as the basis for the proposal, concluded that streams and wetlands have important effects on downstream waters.

The EPA plans to accept public comments on the draft rule before finalizing it, but the agency has not indicated whether it will comply with the lawmakers' request to allow for an independent review of the science underpinning the rule.

“Any attempt to issue a proposed rule before completing an independent examination by the agency’s own science advisors would be to put the cart before the horse,” Smith and Stewart wrote.

In January, EPA critics and officials in Virginia scored a key victory in their legal battle with the agency over its attempt to regulate stormwater runoff that some described as a land takeover.

In the Virginia case, a federal judge ruled in favor of the state Department of Transportation and the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, which challenged EPA's restrictions on the flow of stormwater into a Fairfax County creek.

U.S. District Judge Liam O'Grady in Alexandria agreed with Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, who argued that the EPA was trying to regulate water itself as a pollutant. In his ruling, O'Grady said: ""Stormwater runoff is not a pollutant, so EPA is not authorized to regulate it.""

The EPA contended that water itself can be regulated as a pollutant if there's too much of it. The agency says heavy runoff is having a negative impact on Accotink Creek and that it has the regulatory authority to remedy the situation.

He may want to be careful what he asks for. Several of those lawmakers come from the president's own party.

Coal-state Democrats have been as scathing as any Republican in reaction to the president's plan, unveiled Tuesday in a speech at Georgetown University. The pushback was almost immediate, and a glaring signal of the trouble Obama may encounter as he charges ahead with new restrictions on coal-fired power plants.

Though Obama technically is going around Congress by having the Environmental Protection Agency impose the rules, moderate Democrats made clear they will pressure the administration from inside the party to scale back. They carry a simple message: The regulations will kill jobs, but working with the coal industry to improve its own clean-coal technology won't.

West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, calling the president's plan a ""war on America,"" delivered one of the most forceful rebuttals in an interview with Fox News.

""It's just ridiculous. ... I should not have to be sitting here as a U.S. senator, fighting my own president and fighting my own government,"" he told Fox News. ""I will continue to reach out, but I need a partner here. I don't need an adversary.""

Manchin argued that the coal industry has the technology to reduce emissions. But he said the government, rather than work with the industry, is setting unattainable standards.

The cornerstone of Obama's plan was a call for the first-ever regulations on emissions for existing power plants.

""Why is this economy going to be taking this hit? Why are jobs going to be lost, and they will be lost,"" Manchin said.

North Dakota Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp echoed the remarks, backing the overall intent of addressing climate change but accusing Obama of amplifying the ""war on coal"" with regulations that ""choke off good-paying American jobs.""

She, too, said the government should encourage investments in technologies that cut emissions with clean-coal technology.

Advocates of the industry argue that it has made strides toward making coal more environmentally friendly. According to the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity (ACCCE), 10 clean-coal technology plants have launched since 2011. Another five are under development or scheduled to come online.

But the industry claims to be struggling to both make those investments and meet the demands of federal regulations. Group President Robert M. ""Mike"" Duncan says EPA regulations have played a big role in the closure of nearly 290 coal plants so far this year.

Initially, there's very little the industry and skeptical lawmakers can do about the new EPA rules. But Congress could try to block the agency's effort with legislation. The rules could face legal challenges. Plus, the EPA will have to work with the states to implement whatever regulations it creates.

Obama said Tuesday that he anticipated claims that the rules will ""kill jobs,"" but compared those warnings to those throughout history whenever the federal government tried to act on the environment.

""The problem with all these tired excuses for inaction is that it suggests a fundamental lack of faith in American business and American ingenuity,"" he said.

Obama said he's willing to work with lawmakers but said: ""I don't have much patience for anyone who denies that this challenge is real. We don't have time for a meeting of the flat-earth society.""

He underscored that point in Saturday's radio address.

Urging voters to act, he said: ""Educate your classmates and colleagues, your family and friends. Speak up in your communities. Remind everyone who represents you, at every level of government, that there is no contradiction between a sound environment and a strong economy -- and that sheltering future generations against the ravages of climate change is a prerequisite for your vote.""

Reaction from Democrats has spanned the gamut.

Manchin's West Virginia colleague, Democratic Rep. Nick Rahall, called the president's plan ""misguided, misinformed and untenable.""

But the state's other Democratic senator, Jay Rockefeller, took a middle-of-the-road position, saying the president needs to provide more information about how miners would be affected.

And in Kentucky, Democratic Rep. John Yarmuth issued an unequivocal endorsement, saying the new standards would ""address the devastating health, environmental, and economic consequences of climate change."""

Moments before a scheduled vote on Thursday on the nomination of Gina McCarthy to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, Republican members of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee announced a boycott. One result was to delay her confirmation, which still seems virtually certain in the long run since Democrats control the committee as well as the full Senate. The other result was to make the Republicans look not only vindictive but supremely childish.

Their stated reason for the boycott was that Ms. McCarthy, who had already been bombarded in earlier hearings with 1,079 questions, spoken and written, had not sufficiently answered what Senator David Vitter, a Louisiana Republican and ringleader of the group, called 5 important “transparency requests.” What was really transparent was the Republicans’ true motive. They detest E.P.A. and the regulatory authority it possesses (authority granted to it, by the way, by Congress) to clean up the air and water and, in general, take steps to safeguard public health. The transparency issue was merely cover for deep-seated ideological objections to the agency’s basic mission.



A case in point was the request that the agency undertake “whole economy” cost-benefits analysis of its rules and regulations. Ms. McCarthy had earlier replied that the agency already conducts detailed, peer-reviewed analyses of those rules. So what more do Mr. Vitter and his colleagues expect? They want the agency to superimpose on its own reviews an industry-friendly cost-benefit model that — in addition to adding new layers of bureaucratic red tape — could also lead to weaker regulation. Their other requests would impose similarly time-consuming and non-essential burdens.

Few people saw this boycott coming, In fact, the questioning of Ms. McCarthy when she recently appeared before the committee was gentle, even pro-forma. What happened? One line of reasoning is that a couple of true Tea Partiers — Marco Rubio and Rand Paul — have lately been raising loud objections to Ms. McCarthy’s aggressive (and thoroughly proper) use of Clean Air Act to impose tough new regulations on mercury and other emissions from power plants — and that Republicans on the committee have felt obliged to knuckle under.

In any case, the Senate Republicans are now beginning to act and sound just like the House Republicans who have spent the last two years trying to undermine the E.P.A. at every turn. What’s truly dumb about this charade is that Ms. McCarthy is not an ideologue. She is tough, she believes deeply in the country’s basic environmental statutes. But she is also known as a good listener and negotiator, has served with distinction in key environmental posts in Massachusetts and Connecticut, and, more to the point, has broad backing among mainstream Republicans — the sort of Republicans who no longer exist in the House and, it appears, are headed swiftly for extinction in the Senate."

prev Image 2 of 2

Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg is facing a backlash from the left over ads that support drilling in Alaska and the Canada-to-Texas Keystone pipeline, as the young billionaire wades ever-deeper into charged political debates.

The daisy chain that connects Zuckerberg with the drilling ads starts with FWD.US, the bipartisan group Zuckerberg co-founded for the purpose of supporting immigration legislation. That organization gave money to a conservative group, Americans for a Conservative Direction, that aired a TV ad supporting South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham. It also gave to a group that put up an ad backing drilling in Alaska.

Graham is among the eight senators who crafted the bipartisan immigration legislation now being debated on Capitol Hill. However, Graham appears in the ad criticizing President Obama for not approving the Keystone pipeline, which supporters say will help the United Sates achieve energy independence and critics say will be an environmental hazard.

“The president says I’m for ‘all of the above’ when it comes to energy,” Graham says in the 60-second spot. “Well, those are words coming out of his mouth. They don’t come from his heart. No Keystone pipeline. No drilling in the Gulf. At the end of the day, the economy is not doing well.”

The Sierra Club, Credo Action -- the activist arm of cell phone company CREDO Mobile -- and others have since launched a multi-front pressure campaign that includes a petition, a protest outside company headquarters and a Facebook graphic that reads: “Hey Zuck, pull your ads supporting Keystone XL.”

“The people on Facebook who made Mark Zuckerberg a billionaire need to know that he is using his fortune to bankroll pro-Keystone XL propaganda,"" said Becky Bond, CREDO’s political director.

Zuckerberg, one of the world’s most successful entrepreneurs, has never publicly revealed his political party affiliation.

But he has openly and generously spent his money across the political landscape on causes he deems worthy and in support of politicians who share his ideas on economic and education reform, including New Jersey Republican Gov. Chris Christie, for whom he held a fundraiser in February.

FWD.US has answered the recent criticism by saying the group is trying to deliver its message to the wide range of voters.

The group “is committed to showing support for elected officials who promote the policy changes needed to build the knowledge economy,” said FWD.US spokeswoman Kate Hansen. “Maintaining two separate entities, Americans for a Conservative Direction and the Council for American Job Growth, to support elected officials across the political spectrum – separately – means that we can more effectively communicate with targeted audiences of their constituents.”

Beyond comprehensive immigration reform, FWD.US also supports education reform and expanded scientific research, with other co-founders including Joe Green of NationBuilder and LinkedIn’s Reid Hoffman.

Council for American Job Growth is led by Democratic strategists, but has a TV ad in which Alaska Sen. Mark Begich, a Democrat seeking 2014 re-election in a largely conservative state, supports drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.

The group Public Citizen argues that such support is “surprising,” pointing to a 2010 Greenpeace blog post in which Zuckerman tells Facebook followers that new offices in Oregon will go from coal to hydro power, adding “were moving in the right direction here.”

They also cite an op-ed Zuckerberg wrote last month announcing the group in which he said the economy of the last century was “primarily based on natural resources” and a zero-sum situation in which “if someone else had an oil field, then you did not.”

Credo has also taken its protest one step further by starting a campaign that calls on protesters to pledge to risk arrest if President Obama moves forward with a plan to approve the pipeline.

The group says at least 60,000 people have already signed the pledge."

Obama continued, “I meant what I said; I’m going to evaluate this based on whether or not this is going to significantly contribute to carbon in our atmosphere. And there is no doubt that Canada at the source in those tar sands could potentially be doing more to mitigate carbon release.”

Obama also blasted reports that job creation would be significant: “”[M]y hope would be that any reporter who is looking at the facts would take the time to confirm that the most realistic estimates are this might create maybe 2,000 jobs during the construction of the pipeline – which might take a year or two – and then after that we’re talking about somewhere between 50 and 100 [chuckles] jobs in a economy of 150 million working people.” He stated that gas prices would go up in parts of the United States thanks to Keystone XL: “So what we also know is, is that that oil is going to be piped down to the Gulf to be sold on the world oil markets, so it does not bring down gas prices here in the United States. In fact, it might actually cause some gas prices in the Midwest to go up where currently they can’t ship some of that oil to world markets.”

On Sunday, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew told Fox News Sunday that Keystone’s failure to move forward was somehow Republicans’ fault: “There were some political games that were played, that took it off the trail and path to completion, where Republicans put it out there as something that was put on a timetable that it could not be resolved. It caused a delay. Playing political games with something like this was a mistake.”

In an article published Friday, the Post tries to mitigate the damage President Obama’s new strict carbon emission limits will have on the McAuliffe campaign by also putting a pox on Republican nominee Cuccinelli’s house over, bizarrely, DC’s ongoing budget battles.

But as hard as the Post might try, there is just no comparing the latest round of federal budget battles to the effect Obama’s war on coal will have on Virginia and working class Virginians.

At the bottom of its article, the Post is eventually forced to admit that the Cuccinnelli campaign — if not the man himself — actually did comment on the possibility of a government shutdown:

“It’s pretty rich that in the same week it was revealed that Terry McAuliffe wants to shut down Virginia’s government, he’s now focused on whether the federal government is going to do the same,” Cullen said, referring to remarks by McAuliffe that he would not sign a budget as governor if it did not include funds for expanding Medicaid. “No one wants to see the federal government shut down, period. Ken Cuccinelli is not running for Congress, he’s running for governor. . . . Ken Cuccinelli would more than welcome a debate with Terry McAuliffe on the issue of Obamacare.”

Fast Terry, however, has yet to stand up for the state’s southwest coal country, and who knows how many middle class jobs. Instead of staking a position one way or another, the McAuliffe campaign punted with a statement that tries to please everyone and promises to take a position sometime in the future:

Terry agrees with the broad swath of scientists, economists, and military leaders, who view climate change as a looming problem for Virginia,” campaign spokesman Josh Schwerin wrote in an e-mail. “While he agrees that there needs to be some limit on carbon pollution and believes that Virginia can and should lead the way in building new plants that create low-cost, low-carbon energy, he looks forward to further reviewing the President’s proposed rules in detail and studying their impact on Virginia’s economy.”

Cuccinnelli was quick to jump on the Obama administration:

“The administration renewed its war on coal today,” Cuccinelli said, adding — as he often does — that “a war on coal is a war on the poor” and that Virginia “needs a governor who’ll fight for those folks” who depend on the coal industry.

It is doubtful Virginia voters will care one or another if a potential governor chooses to focus on his state as opposed to the latest drama unfurling in the nation’s capitol. These new carbon emission controls, however, directly affect the state and thousands of Virginia jobs.

Instead of choosing a position, McAuliffe is likely hoping to dither through the last five weeks left in the campaign. And as we have already seen, the Washington Post will be right there to hold his hand.

AP

Lawmakers hope the measure creates thousands of jobs

The legislation was crafted in collaboration with industry and some environmental groups

Opponents of fracking were pushing for a two-year moratorium

SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) — Illinois came a giant step closer to approving the nation's strictest regulations for high-volume oil and gas drilling on Friday, as lawmakers approved a measure they hoped would create thousands of jobs in economically depressed areas of southern Illinois.

The Senate passed the legislation 52-3, one day after it was overwhelmingly approved in the other chamber. Gov. Pat Quinn promised to sign it, calling the legislation a ""shot in the arm for many communities.""

The legislation was crafted with the help of industry and some environmental groups — an unusual collaboration that has been touted as a potential model for other states.

Legislation sponsor Mike Frerichs, a Champaign Democrat, said stakeholders ""sat down for hundreds and thousands of hours"" to hammer out the issue.

""These are tough regulations that are going to protect and preserve our most valuable resources in our state,"" he told floor members. ""We are going to increase home produced energy in our state in one of the most environmentally friendly ways possible.""

While proponents have said hydraulic fracturing, or ""fracking,"" would generate tens of thousands of jobs, opponents have been pushing for a two-year moratorium to allow more time to examine health and environmental impact. They are worried fracking could cause pollution and deplete water resources.

""This bill was written by industry and parties that have a vested interest,"" said Annette McMichael, a property owner in Johnson County who belongs to a coalition that opposes fracking. ""We have no say in our own water. … We are totally helpless.""

Despite the numerous protests by her group, Southern Illinoisans Against Fracturing Our Environment, and others — one woman was forcibly removed from the House chamber on Thursday after the vote — there was little opposition to the measure on the floor. Senators on both sides of the aisle praised the compromise.

""This could be a bright economic future for many, many Illinoisans,"" said Sen. Kirk Dillard, a Hinsdale Republican.

Fracking uses high-pressure mixtures of water, sand or gravel and chemicals are used to crack rock formations deep underground and release oil and natural gas.

Among the provisions in the proposed legislation are requirements that drillers disclose the chemicals they use and that they test water before and after fracking. Companies also would be liable for any water pollution.

Sen. Mattie Hunter, who was among the few who voted against the legislation, said in a statement that the state should ""halt fracking practices and allow for a task force to complete concrete, comprehensive evaluation of this highly controversial industry moving further."" The Chicago Democrat had introduced a measure that would put a temporary ban on the practice.

Sen. Sue Rezin, a Morris Republican described the legislation as having ""the highest environmental regulations in the entire country.""

Energy companies are eyeing the New Albany shale formation in southern Illinois, where they believe there are significant oil reserves 5,000 feet or more below the surface.

While the measure passed easily in both chambers, the road there wasn't easy. An amendment requiring energy companies to hire a state-licensed water well driller delayed the vote for more than a month before industry and unions reached a compromise that gives drillers a break on extraction taxes if at least half of their employees are from Illinois.

Two bills proposing a moratorium were offered, but neither gained traction.

Opponents say the regulatory legislation would leave Illinois communities with no control over the practice.

But others felt it was the best the state could do. State Sen. Don Harmon, an Oak Park Democrat said it was ""about as good of a regulatory bill as we could offer.""

""God willing,"" Harmon said, ""it's good enough."""

On page ES-16 of the SEIS, we find (pdf):



The pipeline would be buried deep enough to avoid surface impacts of climate changes (freeze-thaw cycles, fires, and temperature extremes).

The pipeline is essential for the expansion of tar-sand production. It is estimated that if the pipeline were approved, the rate of bitumen extraction would increase by 36%. What various industry voices have been trying to tell us is that the tar sands are necessary for friendly US-Canada relations, for jobs, and for energy security. What those industry voices have not told us is that approval of the pipeline would be a nail in the coffin of climate change. Tar-sand oil is very hard to remove from the ground; it requires enormous amounts of water and energy just to get it to the surface. As a result, it releases more greenhouse gases than conventional fossil fuels. It really is the dirtiest of the dirty. Approval of the Keystone pipeline will lock us in to decades of dependency on this dirty energy at a time when we need to develop clean sources of energy. But do the tar sands really matter that much? The answer is clearly yes. Alberta has 1.8tn barrels of oil contained within the tar sands. Extracting and burning all of that tar will cause a global temperature increase of about 0.4oC (0.7oF). That is about half of the warming that humans have already caused. For perspective, according to a recent study, the amount of oil-in-place in the Alberta tar sands is approximately seven times that of Saudi Arabia's proven reserves.

Which is very comforting. The SEIS doesn't bother to note that the pipeline itself will make those protections even more necessary, but it's very comforting that those protections will be there. The pipeline's impact on climate change was summarized by John Abraham And while the pipeline itself may be protected from the climate disaster it will make so much worse , the people of this world will not be protected ; and in January, Lord Stern, who in 2006 led a review that concluded that climate change could displace hundreds of millions of people, cause the extinction of some 40 percent of all species, and cost 5 to 20 percent of global GDP , admitted that he had actually underestimated the damage

The dishonesty of the State Department's SEIS continues with this jaw-dropper:



Spills associated with the proposed Project that enter the environment are expected to be rare and relatively small.

Which would be news to those already impacted by the existing pipeline's neither rare nor relatively small spills

The reaction to the SEIS has been blunt, and Kevin Grandia has compiled a list that must be read in its entirety. Among them have been NRDC Canada Project Director Danielle Droitsch:



A draft environmental review just released by the U.S. State Department for the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline ignores mounting evidence the pipeline is not in the national interest. NRDC has completed a preliminary review of the Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement and concludes that the State Department failed to account for the pipeline’s impact to water and climate. There is now significant evidence the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline would help trigger a major expansion to tar sands development leading to a sizeable increase in greenhouse gas emissions. And we know that a spill of tar sands oil from Keystone XL would pose much greater risks to precious waterways across America’s heartland. Despite this evidence, the State Department found there would be no significant impact to the environment if the pipeline were approved. We disagree. President Obama should reject this draft environmental review and tell the State Department to re-examine the evidence that shows the pipeline isn’t good for the climate, or water protection, or energy security.

The draft impact statement appears to be seriously flawed. We don’t need this dirty oil. To stop climate change and the destructive storms, droughts, floods, and wildfires that we are already experiencing, we should be investing in clean energy, not building a pipeline that will speed the exploitation of Canada’s highly polluting tar sands.

We cannot stress our extreme disappointment with this report. The fact that the Keystone XL pipeline is deemed as non-consequential and not connected to the unabated expansion of Tar Sands is simply not true. Without adequate roadways to markets the tar sands would be locked in the ground. Industry simply cannot expand without pipelines. Expansion of the tar sands in my peoples homelands means a death sentence for our way for life, destruction of eco-systems vital to the continuation of our inherent treaty rights and massive contributions to catastrophic global climate change, a fate we all share.

American Petroleum Institute Executive Vice President Marty Durbin welcomed the State Department’s draft Environmental Impact Statement for the new Keystone XL Nebraska route. “No matter how many times KXL is reviewed, the result is the same: no significant environmental impact,” said Durbin. “The latest impact statement from the State Department puts this important, job-creating project one step closer to reality. Nebraska has finished its final Keystone XL assessment and the governor has given it his full support. The last approval needed is by President Obama, and we urge him to do so as soon as possible.""

And Rep. Henry Waxman (D-CA) , the Ranking Member on the Energy and Commerce Committee:And Chief Allan Adam of the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation (ACFN):Of course, the Petroleum Institute had a different reaction:Of course, it's a lie that the pipeline will create significant numbers of jobs. The earlier Environmental Impact Statement estimated no more than 500 to 900 local jobs would be created throughout the entire construction throughout the entire region, and the new SEIS estimates no more than a few dozen permanent jobs , once the pipeline has been built. A 2011 study by the Cornell Global Labor Institute found that Keystone may actually destroy more jobs than it creates, and of course neither the fossil fuels industries, nor apparently the State Department that outsourced the SEIS to the fossil fuels industry, seems to care that the pipeline will damage the economy , overall.

Some argue that the tar sands will be exploited with or without U.S. help, but Jane Kleeb of Bold Nebraska explains:



Tarsands does not expand unless Keystone XL is built. The State Department's assumption that tarsands development does not change with or without this pipeline is wrong and laughable. Why would TransCanada spend billions on building the pipeline and millions on lobbying unless this piece of infrastructure is the--not a--but the lynchpin for the expansion of tarsands. Without this pipeline Canada stays at 2 million barrels a day, with it they get 3 million barrels a day. The President has the ability to keep a million barrels of tarsands in the ground a day. With a stroke of a pen he can protect property rights, water and make a dent in climate change. This report is laughable using the wrong assumption and therefore the wrong science.

And even more to the point, if this president and this nation are to be serious about dealing with the climate crisis, he and we cannot make excuses for expanding use of even more difficult and dangerous to extract fossil fuels, when all our focus should be on weaning ourselves of fossil fuels altogether.

As the graph at the top of this post indicates, we are nearing a level of 400 parts per million atmospheric carbon dioxide. As Peter Gleick recently explained, the planet has not even approached such a level in at least 800,000 years, and it might not have seen those levels in more than 2.6 million years. We have to act as if climate change is an unprecedented crisis, because in the history of the human species, it is. The four-star commander of U.S. military forces in the Pacific is calling climate change the most likely threat that will cripple the security environment, and the U.S. Navy has for years been planning how to secure an ice free arctic. A new study shows global temperatures are the highest in 4000 years.

It shouldn't need to be said, but finding new and more destructive means of burning fossil fuels is not the answer. It shouldn't need to be said, but a White House that, unlike the Republicans, acknowledges and understands the scientific consensus on climate change has no excuse not to be doing everything it can to address climate change. The president's positive steps, including increased fuel efficiency standards and EPA regulation of emissions, isn't enough. There is no halfway, on climate change. There is no balancing between good policies and terrible policies. As Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) put it:



The president cannot tell us that he is concerned about global warming and approve the Keystone XL project.

If the president is concerned about global warming, he will reject Keystone. If he approves Keystone, all his positive efforts on global warming, both as policy and politics, will be effectively for naught."

People living in temperate climates along the coast would probably see higher bills. Those in torrid regions — the San Joaquin Valley, the Inland Empire and the Mojave Desert — would get some rate relief.

Exactly how much rates would change would be left to the Public Utilities Commission after it conducts a detailed, technical investigation. Additionally, the PUC would have the authority to charge all ratepayers a fixed monthly fee of up to $10 each.

The legislation also would authorize the PUC to rewrite rules for solar power users selling excess power back to the grid and to require utilities to generate even more electricity from wind, solar and other renewable sources. The state now requires utilities to get 33% of their power from renewable sources by 2020.

The proposal would replace “outdated, electric-rate restrictions adopted during the state’s energy regulation crisis over a decade ago,” said its author, Assemblyman Henry T. Perea (D-Fresno).

The much-amended legislation has remained under the radar for most of the year as investor-owned electric companies wrangled with consumer groups, roof-top solar-power companies, environmentalists, manufacturers and farmers over half a dozen complex elements that affect rates.

But now it has emerged as the year’s major energy initiative, passing the state Senate on a 33-5 vote Monday after clearing the Assembly on a 66-4 vote in May. AB 327 faces one more largely procedural vote in the Assembly before being sent to Gov. Jerry Brown for his signature, which is expected.

The Perea bill is California’s first comprehensive effort to rejigger rates since the lowest two pricing tiers were frozen during blackouts and rolling brownouts that affected the state’s electrical grid in 2000 and 2001. Lower tiers cost less per kilowatt-hour than the higher ones.

But the freeze on some retail rates didn’t shelter utilities from the rising costs of wholesale power, generation, transmission and renewable energy, according to Edison, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and San Diego Gas & Electric Co.

Those costs mainly have been heaped on larger-volume consumers, whose bills are boosted by heavy, high-tier usage.

Owners of large homes with swimming pools, lighted tennis courts and a dozen television sets got hit. So did folks of more modest means, particularly those with low incomes and the elderly, who tend to live in hotter inland cities where temperatures often hit triple digits on summer days.

“The rates discriminate heavily against seniors who live ... in houses where energy use is high,” said Gary Passmore, vice president of the California Congress of Seniors. “They pay disproportionately.”

Though the measure sets certain parameters, it directs the PUC to come up with specific economic and energy regulations.

“The bill is a good package that allows the commission flexibility it needs to set rates going forward. It also includes significant ratepayer protections,” said Mike Campbell, a program manager with the Division of Ratepayer Advocates, the commission’s independent watchdog arm.

The measure is backed by the three utilities, consumer groups such as the Utility Reform Network and the Greenlining Institute, the AARP and other senior citizens groups, the California Retailers Assn. and the national Solar Energy Industries Assn., among others.

Opponents include the Sierra Club, the California Manufacturers & Technology Assn. and the California League of Food Processors.

Manufacturers said they feared that raising the renewable target could make California’s already high electric rates even higher. Farmers and growers, who invested in expensive solar power equipment, worried that they could be shortchanged by a shift in the rules for earning credits for excess power.

The Sierra Club objected to a provision that would allow the PUC to charge the $10 fixed monthly fee for maintenance of the grid.

Advertisement

The fee, said Kathryn Phillips, the club’s state director, “has no real purpose other than to discourage investment in roof-top solar and energy efficiency” by lengthening the time needed to reap a payback from their expensive renewable systems.

Edison argued that the charge is an equitable way to make sure that everyone who uses the grid, including people who get most of their energy from roof-top solar, pay a portion of the fixed costs of maintaining thousands of miles of transmission and distribution lines.

She Has Written Two Books', 'Demon Fish', 'Travels Through The Hidden World Of Sharks', 'Fight Club Politics']","As Obama moves forward on climate, he faces a tough political task","A pair of fundraisers just 90 minutes apart in the San Francisco Bay Area last week laid bare the competing forces of politics and policy that President Obama is grappling with as he prepares to unveil a slate of major initiatives on global warming in late June or in July.

In public comments at the beginning of the first session, Obama made it clear that he considered climate change “one of the most important decisions we make as a nation,” according to a transcript released by the White House.

But during the second event, according to several people familiar with his private remarks at the home of clean-tech entrepreneur Vinod Khosla, Obama expressed concerns about the political pain involved, saying that “dial testing” of his State of the Union speech showed that the favorability ratings “plummeted” when he vowed to act on climate change if Congress refused to do so.

The two comments highlight the White House’s quandary as it prepares to take more aggressive steps on the environment. Activists and some of Obama’s most loyal supporters are demanding strong efforts to curb greenhouse gas buildup before it’s too late to prevent catastrophic drought, sea-level rise and ocean acidification. But the public remains more concerned with the economy, and Obama is committed to developing North American energy supplies, which may mean disappointing his most ardent backers on a signature environmental issue: whether to permit construction of the Keystone XL pipeline.

As his second term takes shape, the president has fallen back from the broad clean-energy agenda he envisioned when he first took office and now faces tough political choices on how to achieve some of what remains a top administration priority.

The White House has asked agencies including the Environmental Protection Agency, the Interior Department and the Energy Department to draft plans on how to curb greenhouse gas emissions while also helping communities adapt to the impact of global warming, according to several people briefed on the matter. These individuals, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the plans won’t be finalized for at least a few more weeks, said Obama is likely to strongly consider proposals ranging from regulating greenhouse gas emissions from existing power plants to making coastal communities more resistant to increasingly severe storms and flooding.

“This is the issue of our time,” said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), who met with White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough and Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Calif.) last week to discuss climate change. “People can plainly see that something is wrong, and polls show a strong majority wanting action. By announcing and implementing strong regulatory steps, President Obama can revive this great issue and break through the barricade of special interests that now blocks action in Congress.”

Frances Beinecke, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, which launched ads this week in which Robert Redford called on Obama to live up to the “courage of his convictions,” said the president needs to outline exactly how he plans to combat global warming by 2016. “We’re going to ratchet up the noise, at least on this, because we’re running out of time,” she said, noting that power plants account for 40 percent of the nation’s carbon output.

A White House official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the plans are not final, said Obama has made it clear that he considers climate change a priority and is less politically constrained now that he no longer faces reelection.

The administration has yet to decide whether to block the Keystone XL pipeline, which would transport heavy crude from Alberta’s oil sands to Gulf Coast refineries. Environmentalists contend that the pipeline will speed the extraction of a particularly dirty form of crude and contribute to warming of the atmosphere. Backers argue that it will generate jobs and boost the nation’s oil supply.

“On climate, we’re worse off than we were when the president’s second term started,” said Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune.

In conversations with donors and lawmakers over the past few months, Obama has repeatedly emphasized that he needs more time to lay the groundwork with the American public before unveiling a formal climate strategy.

In a discussion this spring with one senator, who asked not to be identified, the president said he “was with [the senator] on climate but that the time wasn’t right.”

During an April visit to the San Francisco home of billionaire and environmental activist Tom Steyer, who created a political action committee in March to target lawmakers supporting the Keystone pipeline, Obama noted that the issue of climate change “is near and dear” to Steyer and his wife, Kat Taylor.

“But — and I mentioned this to Tom and Kat and a few folks right before I came out here — the politics of this are tough,” Obama added, according to a White House transcript. “Because if you haven’t seen a raise in a decade; if your house is still $25,000, $30,000 underwater . . . you may be concerned about the temperature of the planet, but it’s probably not rising to your number one concern. And if people think, well, that’s shortsighted, that’s what happens when you’re struggling to get by.”

Oil and coal industry officials argue that the country cannot afford new federal limits on carbon. “We think the recovery right now is quite nascent, and there is an opportunity that the administration has when it comes to creating jobs,” said Howard Feldman, director of regulatory and scientific affairs for the American Petroleum Institute.

Obama and his top aides also have expressed concerns about acting under executive authority that could be overturned by a subsequent administration, as well as about antagonizing Congress before the Senate votes on confirming Gina McCarthy as EPA administrator.

Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), a staunch opponent of the Keystone pipeline, flew aboard Air Force One with Obama in March. She said the president made the point that one shouldn’t always back a policy because it’s popular, noting that the majority of Americans support TransCanada’s proposed project, but wouldn’t say what he would do about the pipeline.

“I encouraged him to follow through on the correct policy position, suggesting polling numbers aren’t always in support of smart policy,” she said.

Organizing for Action, the nonprofit group formed to advance the president’s second-term agenda, has steered clear of Keystone and focused its efforts on changing Americans’ overall attitude toward global warming. Jon Carson, OFA’s executive director, has compared this approach to the battle over same-sex marriage, in which it has become less socially acceptable to oppose gay couples.

But several environmental and social change groups — including 350.org, CREDO Action and the Sierra Club — have expressed frustration with this approach, saying they need a more immediate remedy. The fact that Obama continues to support exploring for natural gas and shipping it overseas, they argue, contradicts his commitment to fight climate change.

Ivan Frishberg, campaign climate manager for OFA, said the group was “gearing up to be ready for aggressive action by the federal government” and has started planning for a slew of events during the August congressional recess.

At a Capitol Hill energy and environment conference Tuesday, Obama’s deputy assistant for energy and climate change, Heather Zichal, said the administration’s agreement with China to address the potent greenhouse gases in air conditioners and refrigerators was the first in a line of coming climate announcements from the White House. “We’re ripe for a few more deliverables,” Zichal said.

In 2009, Mr. Obama proudly declared that his Cash for Clunkers program, officially known as the Car Allowance Rebate System (CARS), was a stunning success. “There were skeptics who weren’t sure that this ‘Cash for Clunkers’ program would work,” said Mr. Obama. “But I’m happy to report that it has succeeded well beyond our expectations and all expectations, and we’re already seeing a dramatic increase in showroom traffic at local car dealers…So I’m very pleased with the progress that’s been made in the House today on the “Cash for Clunkers” program.”

But as Yahoo News notes, the program’s decision to shred, not recycle, many of the trade-in vehicles unleashed an “environmental nightmare”:

Shredding vehicles results in its own environmental nightmare. For each ton of metal produced by a shredding facility, roughly 500 pounds of “shredding residue” is also produced, which includes polyurethane foams, metal oxides, glass and dirt. All totaled, about 4.5 million tons of that residue is already produced on average every year. Where does it go? Right into a landfill. E Magazine states recycling just the plastic and metal alone from the CARS scraps would have saved 24 million barrels of oil. While some of the “Clunkers” were truly old, many of the almost 700,000 cars were still in perfectly good condition. In fact, many that qualified for the program were relatively “young,” with fuel efficiencies that rivaled newer cars.

A study conducted by Resources for the Future further underscored the program’s failure economically and environmentally:

Approximately 45 percent of the spending went to consumers who would have purchased a new vehicle anyway. Our results suggest no gain in sales beyond 2009 and hence no meaningful stimulus to the economy. In addition, the program will reduce CO2 emissions by only 9 to 28.4 million tons, implying a cost per ton ranging from $91 to $288 even after accounting for reduced criteria pollutants.

And E–The Environmental Magazine says the Department of Transportation’s declaration that Cash for Clunkers was a success is simply a case of smoke and mirrors:

The Department of Transportation reported that Cash for Clunkers was an environmental success…In general, drivers traded in inefficient SUVs and trucks for more efficient passenger cars. However, it’s quite easy to negate this small difference in gas mileage purely by the fact that people will be more likely to drive a vehicle that takes less money to fill up with gas. It’s an efficiency paradox: as we get more efficient at using energy, the overall cost of energy goes down, but we respond by using more of it. Auto emissions of carbon dioxide are directly proportional to gasoline consumed. With only 690,000 fuel-efficient vehicles purchased and over 250 million cars registered in the U.S., that is a negligible difference in overall greenhouse gas emissions.

As the Washington Post even conceded, Mr. Obama’s Cash for Clunkers scheme was an economic and environmental failure: “So were the naysayers right?” asked the Post. “It seems so.”"

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is under a judge's order to make a final determination on listing the Greater sage grouse as a threatened or endangered species. The species is found in 11 Western states, including Nevada, Utah, Idaho and Oregon.

According to the Bureau of Land Management, the sage grouse have declined in number over the past century because of the loss of critical sagebrush habitat. The Fish and Wildlife Service has proposed to list as threatened populations of the sage grouse in Nevada and California.

Ranchers and the oil and gas industry dodged regulations in 2005 when the government decided against extending new protections. The possible listing has been compared to the northern spotted owl, whose listing as a threatened species in 1990 drew criticism from the logging industry in the Northwest, according to The Associated Press.

Grant Gerber, a commissioner in Elko County, Nevada, and longtime critic of U.S. land managers says he's convinced the feds have already made up their mind to list the sage grouse as a threatened or endangered species.

But a Bureau of Land Management official says that's not the case and insisted at a public meeting in Elko last week they want the community's input on how best to save the troubled bird without a federal listing.

Gerber, a former state lawmaker, suggested the BLM and U.S. Forest Service are seeking comment on a regional sage-grouse conservation plan only to placate critics of the push to protect the Greater sage grouse.

The draft conservation plan, which applies to all of Nevada and parts of northern California, includes more than a third of the preliminary prime habitat and general habitat identified in Elko County at about 7.8 million acres, the Elko Daily Free Press reported.

“In the rest of the state, it’s a horrible situation. In Elko County, it’s a death blow,"" Elko County Commissioner Jeff Williams said. “In Elko County, it’s the whole county. It’s everything we’ve got. It’s recreation, it’s mining, it’s oil, it’s agriculture.""

Williams said sage grouse could “shut the county down,” according to the report.

At a meeting on Thursday, the commissioners said none of the outlined actions in the draft plan were preferable and floated the possibility of filing suit against the federal government.

Former Republican Assemblyman John Carpenter said he believes the government is determined to list the chicken-sized game bird as part of a bigger strategy to lock up federal lands.

""These people don't give a damn about the sage grouse. All it is is for control,"" Carpenter told the Elko Daily Free Press.

""They want to get control of the people that are using the public land and get them off,"" he said. ""They want to get the cowboys and the miners and recreationists and everybody else and get them off.""

BLM Elko District Manager Jill Silvey disagreed with Carpenter's assertion that the BLM was in favor of a listing.

""That's clearly not our objective,"" she said about the listing decision the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is expected to make in the fall of 2014.

After the BLM reviews public comment on the proposal, it will develop a proposed conservation plan to be drafted around June. That will be followed by agency review and a 60-day governor's consistency review and a protest period, with the intention is to issue a public record of decision by Sept. 30.

Jerry Brown’s administration, which appears not fully sold on the potential.

The roughly 1,700 square-mile Monterey Shale, from the state’s central coast to its San Joaquin Valley, holds roughly 60 percent of the country’s estimated shale oil reserves, potentially making California the country’s top oil producer and revving up its economy like a smaller shale-oil deposit did for North Dakota.

California’s economy has been showing signs of improvement after a downward slide for years – in part the result of myriad regulations, multi-billion dollar budget deficits, high unemployment and now Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown’s income-tax hike on the state’s highest earners that has some vowing to leave.

“The Monterey Shale could be a boon to the economy, but there’s heavy emphasis on the word ‘could,’ ” said Jason Marshall, chief deputy director for the state’s Department of Conservation.

Geoffrey Styles, energy consultant, recently wrote in the online forum The Energy Collective that drilling the formation “could slash California's imports while adding billions of dollars a year to the local economy and to the shaky state budget, along with lots of good jobs.”

Oil production in the region is still largely in the speculation or developmental phases. Oil companies purportedly have been working the region’s complex structure since the early 1990s, but only recently have new technologies made large-scale extractions economically possible.

Environmentalists are primarily opposed to the companies having to tap the estimated 15. 4 billion barrels in the Monterey Shale by deep, horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, which has helped drive the country’s recent shale oil and gas boom but also raised environmental worries.

They also argue such techniques will be especially tricky in that region, considering its complex geological formation, created in part by the San Andreas fault.

“There are some really serious concerns for California,” said Kassie Siegel, a lawyer for the Center for Biological Diversity.

She said two of the group’s biggest worries are the potential to trigger an earthquake and water contamination, consider that fracking includes injecting a mix of water, sand and chemicals into rock to release oil or natural gas.

She said fracking uses millions of gallons of water in a state “starved for water” and the latest methods use “slick water” that includes hundreds of potential harmful chemicals.

“There are many, many aspects to the water issue,” Siegel said. “And California is a very seismically active area.”

Oil companies have engaged in fracking in California for decades without heavy monitoring by state regulators. But that situation appears to be swiftly changing with the state releasing a draft of fracking rules in December with plans to have a complete set of regulations within the year, Marshall told FoxNews.com.

He also acknowledged the importance of oil in the state economy, pointing out that California in 2011 produced nearly 197 million barrels. But he also expressed Brown administration concerns similar to those of the environmentalists -- protecting state resources and whether fracking will work in the already-fractured formation.

“It may take (more) advancement in technology or methodology to unlock the oil-production potential of the formation,” Marshall said.

To be sure, California already has a long, boom-to-bust history with oil that started in 1865 with a discovery east of San Francisco and includes the great boom of 1894 around Los Angeles.

Though the state is still the country’s fourth-largest oil producer -- behind Texas, North Dakota and Alaska -- production has declined since roughly the mid-1980s.

Occidental Petroleum and Venoco are already working the Monterey Shale region with Hess Corp. purportedly among the other major oil companies making a foray – amid a real estate boom and middlemen snapping up leases for acres held by the Bureau of Land Management.

“We’ve seen a significant increase in the last three to five years in the price paid from our sales,” said Gabriel Garcia, a field manager at the agency’s Bakersfield office, recently told The New York Times. “Some of that has to do with speculation on new technologies, and some of that has to do with the high price of oil.”"

By Neela Banerjee

WASHINGTON -- In his State of the Union address, President Obama articulated a subtle but noticeable shift away from his longstanding discussion of climate change in almost entirely economic terms to making a moral argument for the need to act.

“For the sake of our children and our future,” he said, “we must do more to combat climate change.”

“Yes, it’s true that no single event makes a trend,” Obama said. “But the fact is, the 12 hottest years on record have all come in the last 15. Heat waves, droughts, wildfires, and floods -- all are now more frequent and intense. We can choose to believe that Superstorm Sandy, and the most severe drought in decades, and the worst wildfires some states have ever seen were all just a freak coincidence. Or we can choose to believe in the overwhelming judgment of science -- and act before it’s too late.”

His new, blunter language on climate change builds on rhetoric he used during the Democratic National Convention, in his election night victory speech and his Inaugural address three weeks ago. Obama did not follow up his mention of climate change by unveiling any new major initiatives. But he told legislators that with or without them he would act on it.

“I urge this Congress to pursue a bipartisan, market-based solution to climate change, like the one John McCain and Joe Lieberman worked on together a few years ago,” Obama said, speaking of the Senate veterans. “But if Congress won’t act soon to protect future generations, I will. I will direct my Cabinet to come up with executive actions we can take, now and in the future, to reduce pollution, prepare our communities for the consequences of climate change, and speed the transition to more sustainable sources of energy.”

The president has public opinion on his side, with polls late last year showing that a majority of Americans now consider climate change a serious problem. He also has initiatives at the ready that were being crafted toward the end of his first term, most notably rules to curtail greenhouse gas emissions from new power plants.

Environmentalists praised Obama’s new approach, but key decisions ahead are likely to test his commitment. Environmentalists hope to see the administration reject the building of the Keystone XL pipeline, which they say would amp up greenhouse gases. They also expect the Environmental Protection Agency to push new rules to cut emissions of greenhouse gases from existing power plants.

“He was strong on problems but weak on solutions after saying climate change was a moral crisis and an economic opportunity,” said Michael Brune, president of the Sierra Club. “He didn’t give us much to chew on as far as meeting the challenge.”

Minimum wage:

By Jim Puzzanghera

WASHINGTON -- President Obama focused his State of the Union address on boosting the nation’s slow-moving economic recovery, saying the first priority “is making America a magnet for new jobs and manufacturing.”

Advertisement

Obama unveiled some new initiatives, such as raising the minimum wage, opening new government-backed Manufacturing Innovation Institutes, and a program to fix crumbling infrastructure.

He also pushed lawmakers to approve proposals that stalled in Congress last year, including making it easier for some homeowners to refinance their mortgages, eliminating some corporate tax breaks, and enacting the so-called Buffett Rule to ensure that millionaires pay a minimum income tax rate.

Advertisement

“Now is our best chance for bipartisan, comprehensive tax reform that encourages job creation and helps bring down the deficit,” Obama said. “The American people deserve a tax code that helps small businesses spend less time filling out complicated forms and more time expanding and hiring.”

The most significant new proposal was to raise the national minimum wage in stages to $9 an hour by 2015 from $7.25, and to tie the rate to inflation.

Advertisement

“This single step would raise the income of millions of working families,” Obama said. “For businesses across the country, it would mean customers with more money in their pockets.”

Obama also proposed a $50-billion program called “Fix-It-First” that would hire people to repair nearly 70,000 structurally deficient bridges nationwide and other infrastructure.

Advertisement

In addition, the president said he would use existing money to open three new Manufacturing Innovation Institutes after the success of the first such facility, in Youngstown, Ohio, where an unused warehouse has been converted into a state-of-the art 3D printing lab. Obama called for Congress to authorize $1 billion to create a network of 15 such institutes.

Gun control:

By Melanie Mason

WASHINGTON — Much of President Obama’s rhetoric on gun violence in his State of the Union address focused on a seemingly basic appeal to Congress: hold a vote.

Advertisement

His repeated refrain that victims of gun violence “deserve a vote” served as the speech’s emotional crescendo. But it also underscored just how daunting is the legislative path facing gun control. Congress has not held floor votes on major changes to gun laws since the 1990s.

Obama made cursory mentions of the components of his gun policy proposals: universal background checks, a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and stronger anti-trafficking laws.

Advertisement

“Each of these proposals deserves a vote in Congress. If you want to vote no, that’s your choice,” Obama said. “But these proposals deserve a vote. Because in the two months since Newtown, more than a thousand birthdays, graduations and anniversaries have been stolen from our lives by a bullet from a gun.”

One of those lives, he noted, was that of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old who marched in his inaugural parade last month. One week later, she was killed in Chicago, an unintended victim of gun violence.

Advertisement

“Hadiya’s parents, Nate and Cleo, are in this chamber tonight, along with more than two dozen Americans whose lives have been torn apart by gun violence. They deserve a vote,” Obama said.

Her parents, sitting next to First Lady Michelle Obama, listened somberly. Hadiya’s mother, Cleopatra Cowley-Pendleton, flashed a brief smile at the president’s mention of her daughter’s love of Fig Newtons and lip gloss.

Advertisement

The president continued: “Gabby Giffords deserves a vote. The families of Newtown deserve a vote. The families of Aurora deserve a vote. The families of Oak Creek, and Tucson, and Blacksburg, and the countless other communities ripped open by gun violence – they deserve a simple vote.”

The chorus was picked up by lawmakers, mostly Democrats, who chanted “vote, vote.” Many in the hall in both parties wore green ribbons in show of support for Newtown, Conn., the site of a mass shooting at an elementary school in December.

Advertisement

A number of Democratic lawmakers also invited victims of gun violence and their loved ones as guests. Rep. Janice Hahn (D-San Pedro) brought the Rev. E. Winford Bell, a Los Angeles-based Baptist pastor who founded a faith-based anti-violence organization after his son was injured in a 2009 shooting. Hahn said Bell and others could prod her colleagues in Congress to act.

“Sometimes the president will have one issue, and he’ll have one person in the gallery stand up,” Hahn said. “This time, there [are] a lot of people who are guests who have suffered from gun violence. And I think that is a powerful message and voice for Congress.”

Job creation through minimum wage hikes:

By Don Lee

WASHINGTON -- Many mom-and-pop businesses were among the most vocal critics of President Obama’s healthcare overhaul as being too costly, and now they’re likely to howl at his latest proposal: an increase in the federal minimum wage.

But the proposal drew immediate praise from unions and worker advocacy groups. And the idea is likely to find support from many newly hired workers in this tough recovery.

Advertisement

Since early 2010, when the economy began to create jobs, about one-third of the 6 million private-sector jobs added to the economy have been in three sectors that pay relatively low wages: restaurants, retail trade and temporary help.

Obama, in his state of the union message, called for a boost in the minimum pay rate to $9 an hour from the current $7.25 and to tie that to a cost of living increase, saying that “in the wealthiest nation on Earth, no one who works full-time should have to live in poverty.”

A single person who works full-time today in a minimum-wage job would gross about $15,100, which is above the federal poverty line. Congress last passed a minimum-wage increase in 2007, and Obama noted that since then 19 states had bumped up their minimum hourly pay rates.

In reviving a proposal that he made as a presidential candidate in 2008, Obama probably got strong support from his chief economic advisor, Alan Krueger, whose research findings have poked holes in the commonly held view that increasing the minimum wage leads to higher joblessness.

Still, the president’s new push for a minimum wage increase is likely to draw fire from many who believe it will hurt the economy, especially small businesses, which as a whole have lagged behind in growth and hiring during this recovery.

Immigration reform:

By Brian Bennett

WASHINGTON – President Obama pressed Congress to overhaul immigration laws “in the next few months” during his State of the Union speech, but he did not dwell on the issue, a signal that he doesn’t want to upset delicate negotiations unfolding in the House and the Senate.

“Let’s get this done,” Obama said several times, as the chamber cheered. “Send me a comprehensive immigration reform bill in the next few months, and I will sign it right away.”

Advertisement

Marshall Fitz, an immigration expert at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, said Obama wanted to give Congress time to negotiate and draft a bill.

“There’s an awareness on his part that too much involvement can hurt the process,” he said.

Advertisement

Obama wove his immigration remarks into his larger proposals to stimulate the economy and create jobs. He emphasized that prominent business and labor leaders have said “the time has come” to pass an immigration bill.

Obama repeated his call for a bill that includes additional border security measures and creates a pathway to “earned” citizenship for those who pass a law enforcement check, pay back taxes and a penalty, and learn English.

Advertisement

The effort to forge a compromise has tacit support from Republican leaders in Congress, who see reaching out to Latino families as important for the future of the GOP. But some Republicans are staunchly opposed to expanding legal immigration and are unlikely to agree to offering legal status to illegal immigrants.

“If the president was serious about creating jobs and spurring economic growth, amnesty for illegal immigrants would not be on his agenda,” Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas) said in a statement Tuesday.

Advertisement

Smith, who has voted to reduce legal immigration levels for more than two decades, said the president’s proposal, which Obama outlined in a Jan. 29 speech in Las Vegas, “will make it easier for 11 million illegal immigrants to compete with hard-pressed American workers.”

Efforts to hammer out a compromise have accelerated in both the House and the Senate in recent weeks.

Advertisement

In the Senate, a bipartisan group of four Democrats and four Republicans has begun meeting twice a week. Aides are drafting a bill that includes a route to legal status, and more visas for highly skilled or highly educated applicants.

The Democrats – Sen. Charles E. Schumer of New York, Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, Bob Menendez of New Jersey, and Michael Bennet of Colorado – are scheduled to meet Obama on Wednesday afternoon to brief him on the group’s progress.

Advertisement

Obama has said he wants to see the Senate introduce an immigration reform bill next month. If he doesn’t, he has promised to send his own version to the Senate and ask the chamber to vote on it. Activists say that could poison the spirit of cooperation now underway.

Obama has been “really clear… that he’s not going to wait forever,” said Fitz, who was in a group of immigration advocates and labor leaders who met with the president in the West Wing last week. “This isn’t going to get dragged into a back room and be allowed to die a slow and ugly death.”

Educational programs:



By Howard Blume

President Obama focused Tuesday night on the ends of the education spectrum — preschool and college. He said in his State of the Union address that his administration would work with states to provide a high-quality preschool program for all. He said only 3 of 10 children currently enroll in such programs, which he said were proven to increase graduation rates and reduce teen pregnancy rates and violent crime.

Advertisement

There has been controversy, however, over the success of federally funded Head Start programs, which, critics have said, are not of consistently high quality. There’s also a persistent debate over whether early childhood programs should focus on academic skills or developing creativity and social skills. Either way, the president is likely to meet with resistance if a preschool initiative means a substantial new outlay of federal funds.

Obama also compared American high school graduates with their German peers, who, he said, can leave high school with the equivalent of a community college degree. Obama was not specific about how he would accomplish the same in the United States, although he said there are model programs in this country to emulate.

Advertisement

One of his most interesting and specific proposals dealt with colleges.

“Colleges must do their part to keep costs down,” Obama said, echoing campaign themes voiced by himself and Republican opponent Mitt Romney during the presidential race.

Advertisement

On Tuesday, Obama said he wanted to link federal funding to the affordability and value a college offers. And, he said, the administration is prepared to roll out a score card listing which schools do and do not offer the most “bang for the educational buck.”

Obama, in his state of the union message, called for a boost in the minimum pay rate to $9 an hour from the current $7.25 and to tie that to a cost of living increase, saying that “in the wealthiest nation on Earth, no one who works full-time should have to live in poverty.”

A single person who works full-time today in a minimum-wage job would gross about $15,100, which is above the federal poverty line. Congress last passed a minimum-wage increase in 2007, and Obama noted that since then 19 states had bumped up their minimum hourly pay rates.

In reviving a proposal that he made as a presidential candidate in 2008, Obama probably got strong support from his chief economic advisor, Alan Krueger, whose research findings have poked holes in the commonly held view that increasing the minimum wage leads to higher joblessness.

Still, the president’s new push for a minimum wage increase is likely to draw fire from many who believe it will hurt the economy, especially small businesses, which as a whole have lagged behind in growth and hiring during this recovery.

Immigration reform:

WASHINGTON – President Obama pressed Congress to overhaul immigration laws “in the next few months” during his State of the Union speech, but he did not dwell on the issue, a signal that he doesn’t want to upset delicate negotiations unfolding in the House and the Senate.

“Let’s get this done,” Obama said several times, as the chamber cheered. “Send me a comprehensive immigration reform bill in the next few months, and I will sign it right away.”

Marshall Fitz, an immigration expert at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, said Obama wanted to give Congress time to negotiate and draft a bill.

“There’s an awareness on his part that too much involvement can hurt the process,” he said.

Obama wove his immigration remarks into his larger proposals to stimulate the economy and create jobs. He emphasized that prominent business and labor leaders have said “the time has come” to pass an immigration bill.

Obama repeated his call for a bill that includes additional border security measures and creates a pathway to “earned” citizenship for those who pass a law enforcement check, pay back taxes and a penalty, and learn English.

The effort to forge a compromise has tacit support from Republican leaders in Congress, who see reaching out to Latino families as important for the future of the GOP. But some Republicans are staunchly opposed to expanding legal immigration and are unlikely to agree to offering legal status to illegal immigrants.

“If the president was serious about creating jobs and spurring economic growth, amnesty for illegal immigrants would not be on his agenda,” Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas) said in a statement Tuesday.

Smith, who has voted to reduce legal immigration levels for more than two decades, said the president’s proposal, which Obama outlined in a Jan. 29 speech in Las Vegas, “will make it easier for 11 million illegal immigrants to compete with hard-pressed American workers.”

Efforts to hammer out a compromise have accelerated in both the House and the Senate in recent weeks.

In the Senate, a bipartisan group of four Democrats and four Republicans has begun meeting twice a week. Aides are drafting a bill that includes a route to legal status, and more visas for highly skilled or highly educated applicants.

The Democrats – Sen. Charles E. Schumer of New York, Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, Bob Menendez of New Jersey, and Michael Bennet of Colorado – are scheduled to meet Obama on Wednesday afternoon to brief him on the group’s progress.

Obama has said he wants to see the Senate introduce an immigration reform bill next month. If he doesn’t, he has promised to send his own version to the Senate and ask the chamber to vote on it. Activists say that could poison the spirit of cooperation now underway.

Obama has been “really clear… that he’s not going to wait forever,” said Fitz, who was in a group of immigration advocates and labor leaders who met with the president in the West Wing last week. “This isn’t going to get dragged into a back room and be allowed to die a slow and ugly death.”

Educational programs:



By Howard Blume

President Obama focused Tuesday night on the ends of the education spectrum — preschool and college. He said in his State of the Union address that his administration would work with states to provide a high-quality preschool program for all. He said only 3 of 10 children currently enroll in such programs, which he said were proven to increase graduation rates and reduce teen pregnancy rates and violent crime.

There has been controversy, however, over the success of federally funded Head Start programs, which, critics have said, are not of consistently high quality. There’s also a persistent debate over whether early childhood programs should focus on academic skills or developing creativity and social skills. Either way, the president is likely to meet with resistance if a preschool initiative means a substantial new outlay of federal funds.

Obama also compared American high school graduates with their German peers, who, he said, can leave high school with the equivalent of a community college degree. Obama was not specific about how he would accomplish the same in the United States, although he said there are model programs in this country to emulate.

One of his most interesting and specific proposals dealt with colleges.

“Colleges must do their part to keep costs down,” Obama said, echoing campaign themes voiced by himself and Republican opponent Mitt Romney during the presidential race.

On Tuesday, Obama said he wanted to link federal funding to the affordability and value a college offers. And, he said, the administration is prepared to roll out a score card listing which schools do and do not offer the most “bang for the educational buck.”

Any move to restrict polluting carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, they maintained, would send energy costs up and lead to mass layoffs in a vital job sector.

At a press conference last Thursday, House Majority Leader John Boehner (R-Ohio) blasted the expected proposal as “absolutely crazy.”

“Why would you want to increase the cost of energy and kill more American jobs at a time when the American people are still asking where are the jobs?” he asked.

But experts who have studied the intersection of environmental policy and the job market say there's little truth to this claim, if any.

Such assertions are ""wildly overstated,"" said Richard Revesz, the director of the Institute for Policy Integrity at New York University. He framed Boehner's remark as the latest iteration of a “job-killer meme” that has surfaced frequently in recent years as Republicans have sought to drum up fears about Obama’s environmental efforts.

“We hear often that large swaths of the economy will be wiped out due to one regulation or another,” Revesz said. “Fortunately, and not surprisingly, we don't see those predictions coming true.”

In a comprehensive 2012 review of more than 25 studies that attempted to gauge the effect of environmental regulations on jobs, a team of researchers led by Revesz found that many claims about such regulations were unreliable.

While studies commissioned by the coal industry warned that millions of jobs could be lost, others conducted by left-leaning think tanks and environmental groups predicted that millions of jobs would be gained, their survey found.

By contrast, the most detailed studies concluded that job losses and gains from environmental regulations essentially balanced out. ""When serious studies have been done, the impacts tend to be small -- sometimes positive, sometimes negative, but small,"" Revesz said.

Obama said Tuesday that he would use his executive powers to place limits on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants. The plan is the most ambitious effort by a U.S. president to address climate change to date and includes $8 billion in loan guarantees for clean energy projects, such as efforts to trap and store carbon dioxide emitted by coal-burning power plants.

One company that stands to benefit from the plan is Neumann Systems Group, based in Colorado Springs, Colo. The company recently won a $73.5 million contract to apply its liquid-based emissions scrubbing technology to a local power plant that is under construction. Todd Tiahrt, Neumann's CEO, said the technology could also be used to retrofit older plants at a cost of about $150 million for an average-sized facility.

Tiahrt said he expected Obama's proposal would spur growth in his field, and that in five years his operation could employ 500 engineers. But he also worried that new regulations would single out coal plants for closure, even though they are hardly the only carbon polluters.

""My initial reaction is this amounts to an unfair segregation of the coal industry,"" he said.

Coal plants are still proliferating across the world, Tiahrt said, and any initiative to curb their use in the United States would also inhibit the growth of businesses like his that are developing methods to make coal clean.

Perhaps sensing this paradox, Democrats seem to be pulling back on their attempts to directly counter Republicans' jobs fears and portray climate regulations as boons to the job market.

The policy paper that accompanied Obama's announcement mentions potential job growth stemming from the proposed measures six separate times, but it avoids any specifics, such as what types of jobs might be created and in which industries.

Indeed, the only specific job-growth number in the report refers to an ""estimated"" 17,000 jobs created at 50 solar and wind farms and geothermal plants approved by the Department of Energy since 2009.

This reluctance to be predictive could be a sign the administration wants to bury a boast Obama made while on the campaign trail in 2008. If elected president, he pledged, he would invest in green-energy technology that would yield 5 million jobs.

The best opportunity at realizing that goal came in 2009, when the massive stimulus approved by Congress provided $90 billion in loans, tax credits and other measures for increasing clean energy production and bolstering public transit.

Even the most vocal supporters of the stimulus acknowledge that the investment didn't create many jobs. Robert Pollin, a former Energy Department official who was tasked with tabulating jobs stemming from the stimulus, said his ""best guess"" is that 240,000 green jobs were created from 2009 to 2011.

But while those green-energy efforts may not have boosted the job market, they weren't job-killers either, Revesz noted. And all things considered, he said, Obama's newly proposed climate rules are likely to do more good than harm.

""With the health benfits and environmental benefits are strong as they are, it's really clear to us that we as a nation are better off with these regulations,"" he said."
http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2013/05/28/christie-obama-set-to-meet-again-on-the-jersey-shore/,2013-05-28 00:00:00,"['Tampa Tim', 'Rudy Nyc', 'The', 'Compassionate', 'Gop Solution', 'Posted By']","Christie, Obama set to meet again on the Jersey Shore","8 years ago

(CNN) - Call it the bromance, part two.

President Barack Obama and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie team up Tuesday to survey recovery efforts along the Jersey shore, seven months after Superstorm Sandy slammed into the Garden State and neighboring New York, causing billions in damage.



The destructive storm hit the northeast just over a week before last November's presidential election, forcing both Obama and Republican nominee Mitt Romney to put their campaigns on hold briefly while the heavily-populated region recovered.

The president traveled to New Jersey a few days after Sandy hit to observe federal recovery efforts, touring the damage with Christie, who at the time was a top Romney surrogate.

Standing next to the president, Christie praised Obama, saying ""I cannot thank the president enough for his personal concern and compassion for our state and for the people of our state.""

Some political pundits say that the storm, which put the campaign on hold, and the federal government's response to the storm, were a couple of the many contributing factors that helped the president win re-election just a few days later. While Christie's own approval rating in New Jersey soared after Sandy, and has remained high to date as he runs for re-election this year, some commentators in his own party blasted him for his praise of Obama.

“He’s fat and a fool. Don’t listen to Governor Christie. He doesn’t know what he’s talking about,” said conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh.

Christie himself dismissed the critics, saying his actions after the storm weren't in any way motivated by politics – including a potential bid for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination. He reiterated that mindset last week, saying on NBC's ""Today"" he wasn't worried about how Obama's visit might affect his political future.

""If the president wants to come back here and see the progress himself, I never worry about that stuff,"" Christie said Friday morning."" ""I worry about doing my job.""

""The bottom line is you can't experience the way you're experiencing it right now unless you're here and you see it for yourself,"" Christie added. ""The fact of the matter is he's president of the United States and if he wants to see the people of New Jersey, I'm the governor and I'll be here to welcome him.""

Christie political adviser Mike DuHaime said the governor was putting his constituents' needs ahead of partisan politics.

""Governor Christie has always put the best interests of the people who elected him first, well ahead of any political calculations,"" DuHaime said. ""If some people do not agree with putting your constituents first in a time of crisis and natural disaster, then so be it. He will always put the people who elected him first.""

In New Jersey, Obama and Christie will tour areas hit hard by last year's storm, which caused an estimated $38 billion in damage to the Garden State. Hundreds of thousands of homes were either damaged or destroyed, with many ocean-front businesses also sustaining significant harm from the high winds and storm surge.

Those businesses on the Jersey Shore are still working to recover at the beginning of the busy summer tourist season, which in years past has brought billions of dollars in revenue to the state.

Millions have been spent rebuilding boardwalks and restoring destroyed businesses, but thinner crowds are expected this summer as towns continue to work toward getting back to normal.

In Asbury Park, the iconic hometown of Bruce Springsteen, Obama will deliver remarks and ""highlight the extensive rebuilding efforts to date,"" the White House said.

They added Obama will ""underscore his administration's ongoing commitment to stand with the impacted communities as the important work of recovery continues.""

""It's a pretty vivid illustration about the president's commitment to seeing these things through,"" deputy press secretary Josh Earnest said Sunday.

""The president made a promise, in the aftermath of that storm, that he would continue to focus on that recovery effort and that the federal government would continue to focus on that recovery effort long after the nation's attention, or at least the media's attention had turned elsewhere,"" Earnest added.

Even as Christie enjoys a healthy lead over his Democratic rival in this year's governor's race, many wonder how his public embrace of Obama - both last fall and now - will affect his presidential chances in 2016. Christie, who has said he's not interested in running for president, is nonetheless widely speculated to be a potential candidate.

Rich Galen, a GOP political analyst who advised Fred Thompson during his 2008 presidential bid, said Christie has a number of ""institutional problems"" aside from his relationship with Obama. He hails from the East Coast, and doesn't particularly align with the GOP's major factions.

""That being said, if it looks, two years down the road, like he can win and no one else can, all else will be forgiven,"" Galen said. ""Obama's not running again, but Christie is so I suspect that other than the ideologues, he'll be fine.""

""Republicans are still furious at Governor Christie, but not as mad as they are at President Obama,"" noted GOP strategist Alex Castellanos. ""If Christie demonstrates that he can wrest the White House back for Republicans and reverse the leftward shift of Obama's 8 years, many Republicans will forgive his sins.""

Tuesday's trip will mark the second time in just three days Obama has traveled to the site of a natural disaster – he toured tornado-inflicted damage in Moore, Oklahoma on Sunday and encouraged further Congressional support for programs that bolster emergency management systems for municipalities.

""Training, education, both for citizenry but also for first responders, is absolutely critical,"" Obama said. ""And we've got to make sure that those resources remain in place. So I know everybody in Congress cares deeply about what's happening, and I'm confident that resources will be forthcoming when it comes to rebuilding.""

Obama praised the Federal Emergency Management Agency for its quick response to the Moore tornado, just as he did last fall when Sandy struck the East Coast. Long the object of scorn for its missteps in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, FEMA has been commended by localities for responding quickly to disasters and reducing some of the bureaucratic hurdles of the past."
http://money.cnn.com/2013/01/14/news/economy/california-oil-boom/index.html,2013-01-14 00:00:00,['Steve Hargreaves'],California could be next oil boom state,"California is sitting on a massive amount of shale oil and could become the next oil boom state. But only if the industry can get the stuff out of the ground without upsetting the state's powerful environmental lobby.

Running from Los Angeles to San Francisco, California's Monterey Shale is thought to contain more oil than North Dakota's Bakken and Texas's Eagle Ford -- both scenes of an oil boom that's created thousands of jobs and boosted U.S. oil production to the highest rate in over a decade.

In fact, the Monterey is thought to hold over 400 billion barrels of oil, according to IHS Cambridge Energy Research Associates. That's nearly half the conventional oil in all of Saudi Arabia. The United States consumes about 19 million barrels of oil a day.

""Four hundred billion barrels, that doesn't escape anyone in this businesses,"" said Stephen Trammel, energy research director at IHS.

The trick now is getting it out.

Related: World's 10 biggest energy projects

As a result of the San Andres fault, California's geologic layers are folded like an accordion rather than simply stacked on top of each other like they are in other Shale states. The folds have naturally cracked the shale rock, and much of California's current ""conventional"" oil production -- the third largest in the nation -- is thought to come from the Monterey.

But the folds mean recent advancements that have made shale oil and gas profitable to extract -- horizontal drilling combined with hydraulic fracturing -- don't work as well in California. It's hard to drill horizontally if the shale is not flat.

Plus, it appears the Monterey is made up of shale rock that doesn't respond as well to hydraulic fracturing -- the controversial practice known as fracking that involves injecting water, sand and chemicals into the ground under high pressure to crack the rock and allow the oil and gas to flow.

Still, the U.S. Energy Information Agency estimates there are over 15 billion barrels of oil that can be recovered using today's technology.

""That's a huge number,"" said Matt Woodson, an analyst at the energy research firm Wood Mackenzie. Woodson said the 15 billion number far exceeds current estimates for North Dakota's Bakken Shale, and is about half the amount held in Alaska's North Slope before it was tapped.

That potential has attracted the attention of the oil industry.

Several oil companies have put together research teams to work on the Monterey, said Katie Potter, head of exploration and production staffing at NES Global Talent, a company that recruits oil industry professionals.

If the Monterey takes off, Potter said the impact on jobs in the state would be huge, saying the shale boom has already created 600,000 jobs nationwide over the last few years.

""It could potentially solve the state's budget deficit,"" she said.

Last month, the government held a lease sale to drill in the Monterey. While only a modest 18,000 acres were offered, they were all snapped up.

Occidental (OXY), which is California-based and has long held acres in the Monterey, has had some success using a technology known as deep acid injection, said IHS's Trammel.

The process involves injecting hydrofluoric or other acids deep underground, where they eat away at the shale rock and allow the oil to flow. It's cheaper than fracking, said Trammel. And while it sounds ominous, it may not be as controversial, as the volumes involved are far less and it's not done under such pressure, he said.

Still, no matter how the oil is produced, environmentalists in the Golden State are keeping close watch.

Fracking could still become an issue, as it has in other states where it's led to fears over groundwater contamination, said Nathan Matthews, a Sierra Club attorney based in San Francisco. And there's no guarantee acid injection is much better.

Plus, there's air pollution, road congestion and other issues that go along with an oil boom.

Matthews wants California regulators to require full disclosure of everything the oil industry is putting in the ground, as well as individual permits issued for each well drilled.

""There's a chance to get this done much better than where it's been done elsewhere,"" said Matthews. ""We need to understand the risks before we open the flood gate.""

Regulations or not, there's still no guarantee there will be an oil boom at all.

""It might not live up to its expectations,"" said Fadel Gheit, a senior energy analyst at Oppenheimer. ""The industry has not concluded whether it's boom or bust.""

But given the rapid advances over the last few years in oil drilling and producing technology, the smart money may be on boom.

""There are some pretty creative people in this industry,"" said Trammel. ""I'd say they are going to figure it out."""

On page ES-16 of the SEIS, we find (pdf):



The pipeline would be buried deep enough to avoid surface impacts of climate changes (freeze-thaw cycles, fires, and temperature extremes).

The pipeline is essential for the expansion of tar-sand production. It is estimated that if the pipeline were approved, the rate of bitumen extraction would increase by 36%. What various industry voices have been trying to tell us is that the tar sands are necessary for friendly US-Canada relations, for jobs, and for energy security. What those industry voices have not told us is that approval of the pipeline would be a nail in the coffin of climate change. Tar-sand oil is very hard to remove from the ground; it requires enormous amounts of water and energy just to get it to the surface. As a result, it releases more greenhouse gases than conventional fossil fuels. It really is the dirtiest of the dirty. Approval of the Keystone pipeline will lock us in to decades of dependency on this dirty energy at a time when we need to develop clean sources of energy. But do the tar sands really matter that much? The answer is clearly yes. Alberta has 1.8tn barrels of oil contained within the tar sands. Extracting and burning all of that tar will cause a global temperature increase of about 0.4oC (0.7oF). That is about half of the warming that humans have already caused. For perspective, according to a recent study, the amount of oil-in-place in the Alberta tar sands is approximately seven times that of Saudi Arabia's proven reserves.

Which is very comforting. The SEIS doesn't bother to note that the pipeline itself will make those protections even more necessary, but it's very comforting that those protections will be there. The pipeline's impact on climate change was summarized by John Abraham And while the pipeline itself may be protected from the climate disaster it will make so much worse , the people of this world will not be protected ; and in January, Lord Stern, who in 2006 led a review that concluded that climate change could displace hundreds of millions of people, cause the extinction of some 40 percent of all species, and cost 5 to 20 percent of global GDP , admitted that he had actually underestimated the damage

The dishonesty of the State Department's SEIS continues with this jaw-dropper:



Spills associated with the proposed Project that enter the environment are expected to be rare and relatively small.

Which would be news to those already impacted by the existing pipeline's neither rare nor relatively small spills

The reaction to the SEIS has been blunt, and Kevin Grandia has compiled a list that must be read in its entirety. Among them have been NRDC Canada Project Director Danielle Droitsch:



A draft environmental review just released by the U.S. State Department for the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline ignores mounting evidence the pipeline is not in the national interest. NRDC has completed a preliminary review of the Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement and concludes that the State Department failed to account for the pipeline’s impact to water and climate. There is now significant evidence the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline would help trigger a major expansion to tar sands development leading to a sizeable increase in greenhouse gas emissions. And we know that a spill of tar sands oil from Keystone XL would pose much greater risks to precious waterways across America’s heartland. Despite this evidence, the State Department found there would be no significant impact to the environment if the pipeline were approved. We disagree. President Obama should reject this draft environmental review and tell the State Department to re-examine the evidence that shows the pipeline isn’t good for the climate, or water protection, or energy security.

The draft impact statement appears to be seriously flawed. We don’t need this dirty oil. To stop climate change and the destructive storms, droughts, floods, and wildfires that we are already experiencing, we should be investing in clean energy, not building a pipeline that will speed the exploitation of Canada’s highly polluting tar sands.

We cannot stress our extreme disappointment with this report. The fact that the Keystone XL pipeline is deemed as non-consequential and not connected to the unabated expansion of Tar Sands is simply not true. Without adequate roadways to markets the tar sands would be locked in the ground. Industry simply cannot expand without pipelines. Expansion of the tar sands in my peoples homelands means a death sentence for our way for life, destruction of eco-systems vital to the continuation of our inherent treaty rights and massive contributions to catastrophic global climate change, a fate we all share.

American Petroleum Institute Executive Vice President Marty Durbin welcomed the State Department’s draft Environmental Impact Statement for the new Keystone XL Nebraska route. “No matter how many times KXL is reviewed, the result is the same: no significant environmental impact,” said Durbin. “The latest impact statement from the State Department puts this important, job-creating project one step closer to reality. Nebraska has finished its final Keystone XL assessment and the governor has given it his full support. The last approval needed is by President Obama, and we urge him to do so as soon as possible.""

And Rep. Henry Waxman (D-CA) , the Ranking Member on the Energy and Commerce Committee:And Chief Allan Adam of the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation (ACFN):Of course, the Petroleum Institute had a different reaction:Of course, it's a lie that the pipeline will create significant numbers of jobs. The earlier Environmental Impact Statement estimated no more than 500 to 900 local jobs would be created throughout the entire construction throughout the entire region, and the new SEIS estimates no more than a few dozen permanent jobs , once the pipeline has been built. A 2011 study by the Cornell Global Labor Institute found that Keystone may actually destroy more jobs than it creates, and of course neither the fossil fuels industries, nor apparently the State Department that outsourced the SEIS to the fossil fuels industry, seems to care that the pipeline will damage the economy , overall.

Some argue that the tar sands will be exploited with or without U.S. help, but Jane Kleeb of Bold Nebraska explains:



Tarsands does not expand unless Keystone XL is built. The State Department's assumption that tarsands development does not change with or without this pipeline is wrong and laughable. Why would TransCanada spend billions on building the pipeline and millions on lobbying unless this piece of infrastructure is the--not a--but the lynchpin for the expansion of tarsands. Without this pipeline Canada stays at 2 million barrels a day, with it they get 3 million barrels a day. The President has the ability to keep a million barrels of tarsands in the ground a day. With a stroke of a pen he can protect property rights, water and make a dent in climate change. This report is laughable using the wrong assumption and therefore the wrong science.

And even more to the point, if this president and this nation are to be serious about dealing with the climate crisis, he and we cannot make excuses for expanding use of even more difficult and dangerous to extract fossil fuels, when all our focus should be on weaning ourselves of fossil fuels altogether.

As the graph at the top of this post indicates, we are nearing a level of 400 parts per million atmospheric carbon dioxide. As Peter Gleick recently explained, the planet has not even approached such a level in at least 800,000 years, and it might not have seen those levels in more than 2.6 million years. We have to act as if climate change is an unprecedented crisis, because in the history of the human species, it is. The four-star commander of U.S. military forces in the Pacific is calling climate change the most likely threat that will cripple the security environment, and the U.S. Navy has for years been planning how to secure an ice free arctic. A new study shows global temperatures are the highest in 4000 years.

It shouldn't need to be said, but finding new and more destructive means of burning fossil fuels is not the answer. It shouldn't need to be said, but a White House that, unlike the Republicans, acknowledges and understands the scientific consensus on climate change has no excuse not to be doing everything it can to address climate change. The president's positive steps, including increased fuel efficiency standards and EPA regulation of emissions, isn't enough. There is no halfway, on climate change. There is no balancing between good policies and terrible policies. As Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) put it:



The president cannot tell us that he is concerned about global warming and approve the Keystone XL project.

If the president is concerned about global warming, he will reject Keystone. If he approves Keystone, all his positive efforts on global warming, both as policy and politics, will be effectively for naught."

Lawmakers hope the measure creates thousands of jobs

The legislation was crafted in collaboration with industry and some environmental groups

Opponents of fracking were pushing for a two-year moratorium

SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) — Illinois came a giant step closer to approving the nation's strictest regulations for high-volume oil and gas drilling on Friday, as lawmakers approved a measure they hoped would create thousands of jobs in economically depressed areas of southern Illinois.

The Senate passed the legislation 52-3, one day after it was overwhelmingly approved in the other chamber. Gov. Pat Quinn promised to sign it, calling the legislation a ""shot in the arm for many communities.""

The legislation was crafted with the help of industry and some environmental groups — an unusual collaboration that has been touted as a potential model for other states.

Legislation sponsor Mike Frerichs, a Champaign Democrat, said stakeholders ""sat down for hundreds and thousands of hours"" to hammer out the issue.

""These are tough regulations that are going to protect and preserve our most valuable resources in our state,"" he told floor members. ""We are going to increase home produced energy in our state in one of the most environmentally friendly ways possible.""

While proponents have said hydraulic fracturing, or ""fracking,"" would generate tens of thousands of jobs, opponents have been pushing for a two-year moratorium to allow more time to examine health and environmental impact. They are worried fracking could cause pollution and deplete water resources.

""This bill was written by industry and parties that have a vested interest,"" said Annette McMichael, a property owner in Johnson County who belongs to a coalition that opposes fracking. ""We have no say in our own water. … We are totally helpless.""

Despite the numerous protests by her group, Southern Illinoisans Against Fracturing Our Environment, and others — one woman was forcibly removed from the House chamber on Thursday after the vote — there was little opposition to the measure on the floor. Senators on both sides of the aisle praised the compromise.

""This could be a bright economic future for many, many Illinoisans,"" said Sen. Kirk Dillard, a Hinsdale Republican.

Fracking uses high-pressure mixtures of water, sand or gravel and chemicals are used to crack rock formations deep underground and release oil and natural gas.

Among the provisions in the proposed legislation are requirements that drillers disclose the chemicals they use and that they test water before and after fracking. Companies also would be liable for any water pollution.

Sen. Mattie Hunter, who was among the few who voted against the legislation, said in a statement that the state should ""halt fracking practices and allow for a task force to complete concrete, comprehensive evaluation of this highly controversial industry moving further."" The Chicago Democrat had introduced a measure that would put a temporary ban on the practice.

Sen. Sue Rezin, a Morris Republican described the legislation as having ""the highest environmental regulations in the entire country.""

Energy companies are eyeing the New Albany shale formation in southern Illinois, where they believe there are significant oil reserves 5,000 feet or more below the surface.

While the measure passed easily in both chambers, the road there wasn't easy. An amendment requiring energy companies to hire a state-licensed water well driller delayed the vote for more than a month before industry and unions reached a compromise that gives drillers a break on extraction taxes if at least half of their employees are from Illinois.

Two bills proposing a moratorium were offered, but neither gained traction.

Opponents say the regulatory legislation would leave Illinois communities with no control over the practice.

But others felt it was the best the state could do. State Sen. Don Harmon, an Oak Park Democrat said it was ""about as good of a regulatory bill as we could offer.""

""God willing,"" Harmon said, ""it's good enough."""

Sets New Offensive on Obama Goals,"WASHINGTON — Congressional Republicans are moving to gut many of President Obama’s top priorities with the sharpest spending cuts in a generation and a new push to hold government financing hostage unless the president’s signature health care law is stripped of money this fall.

As Mr. Obama prepares to deliver a major economic address on Wednesday in Illinois, Republicans in Washington are delivering blow after blow to programs he will promote as vital to a more robust economic recovery and a firmer economic future — from spending on infrastructure and health care to beefing up regulatory agencies. While Mr. Obama would like to keep the economic conversation lofty, his adversaries in Congress are already fighting in the trenches.

On Tuesday, a House Appropriations subcommittee formally drafted legislation that would cut the Environmental Protection Agency’s budget by 34 percent and eliminate his newly announced greenhouse gas regulations. The bill cuts financing for the national endowments for the arts and the humanities in half and the Fish and Wildlife Service by 27 percent.

For the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, Mr. Obama requested nearly $3 billion for renewable energy and energy efficiency programs — a mainstay of his economic agenda since he was first elected. The House approved $826 million. Senate Democrats want to give $380 million to ARPA-E, an advanced research program for energy. The House allocated $70 million."

EPA veteran Gina McCarthy was one of three nominees Obama announced at the White House late Monday morning. He also tapped MIT scientist Ernest Moniz to head the Energy Department and Walmart's Sylvia Mathews Burwell as his next budget chief.

All will have to undergo Senate confirmation. And McCarthy -- given her background and the controversial nature of the agency she wants to lead -- could face the toughest screening.

""Today's announcement that the president wants Gina McCarthy to serve as the next EPA administrator is a clear indication that the administration will continue a war on affordable energy,"" Thomas Pyle, president of the Institute for Energy Research, said in a statement.

""Throughout her career McCarthy has implemented policies that attempt to constrain the use of reliable energy sources. ... It appears the president is rewarding these efforts by increasing her ability to implement an ideological and political agenda. If confirmed as EPA administrator, McCarthy will continue the regulatory attack on oil, coal and natural gas with the result that Americans will experience increasing energy costs and high unemployment rates.""

McCarthy led the Office of Air and Radiation, and in that role oversaw regulations that some in the domestic energy industry blame for lost coal jobs.

Key were first-ever regulations on greenhouse gas emissions out of new power plants. That followed new controls on mercury emissions.

Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., said the nomination makes clear that Obama ""wants to continue pursuing an aggressive climate agenda at EPA.""

Environmental and air quality advocates, though, credit McCarthy with helping implement rules that could curb everything from asthma attacks to heart attacks.

Obama described McCarthy as someone who could balance smart environmental regulation and economic growth. He said that at the EPA so far, she has pursued ""practical cost-effective ways to keep our air clean and our economy growing.""

""She has earned a reputation as a straight-shooter,"" Obama said Monday. ""I'm confident that she is going to do an outstanding job.""

The nominations Monday preceded Obama's first Cabinet meeting of his second term. They also signal that the White House is trying to get back to normal business after the president and Congress failed to avert the $85 billion in automatic spending cuts that started taking effect Friday. While the president has warned of dire consequences for the economy as a result of the cuts, the White House does not want the standoff with Congress to keep the president from focusing on other second term priorities, including filling out his Cabinet, as well as pursuing stricter gun laws and an overhaul of the nation's immigration system.

His nominee for the budget office, Burwell, is a Washington veteran, having served as OMB's deputy director in the Clinton administration and chief of staff to former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin. She currently runs the Walmart Foundation, the retail giant's philanthropic wing, and previously served as president of the Gates Foundation's Global Development Program.

The White House official credited Burwell with being a principal architect of a series of budget plans in the 1990s that led to a budget surplus.

Walmart president Mike Duke called Burwell a strong leader with a ""clear vision for making big things happen.""

""She understands business and the role that business, government and civil society must play to build a strong economy that provides opportunity and strengthens communities across the country,"" Duke said in a statement.

Pollak'],"Coal Stocks Plummet, Environmentalist Hopes Rise Ahead of Obama's Climate Speech","President Barack Obama will deliver a speech at Georgetown University Tuesday afternoon in which he will call for new regulations aimed at restricting carbon dioxide emissions from existing coal-fired power plants, not just new ones. Previously, Obama had aimed regulations at new coal plants. Shares of U.S. coal stocks plummeted ahead of the speech, though the Washington Post suggested global market turmoil played a role.

The Obama administration has been uniquely hostile to coal and other fossil fuels, despite the fact that the rapid expansion of natural gas development through “fracking” and oil production from shale deposits has driven much of the growth that the U.S. economy has mustered during his presidency. Permits for oil and gas exploration and development on federal land have slowed; offshore oil and gas activity has been blocked, especially after the Deepwater Horizon spill of 2010, even in defiance of the courts; and the Environmental Protection Agency has pushed new emissions rules despite Congress’s refusal to pass a cap-and-trade bill.

Obama has long singled out coal in particular. In January 2008, as he sought to outflank rival presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on the left, then-Sen. Obama promised to “bankrupt” new coal plants. His administration issued heavy-handed new regulations on coal, forcing many plants out of production. And his left-wing supporters in Hollywood have cheered him on, encouraging him to bypass Congress, far from the job losses that will occur. Politicians of both parties in coal-producing state have protested, to little avail.

Earlier this week, seven governors wrote to the president to urge him to stop new EPA regulations on the new source performance standard (NSPS) for new coal power plants, arguing that they would cause plants to be shuttered, and pointing out the industry’s own progress on reducing emissions. Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett (R) was one of the seven, and wrote to the president: “It is imperative that abundant natural resources such as coal continue to be available to meet our base load electricity needs. I am convinced that we can achieve this goal, while lowering emissions. Significant technological advancements in generating plant efficiency and emission capture and reduction are within reach, but need regulatory flexibility that does not discriminate against our own home-grown energy resources if they are to be achieved.”

Nevertheless, Obama is expected to announce an expansion of regulations. The New York Times reported last week that the president would seek to apply regulations to existing coal plants as well as new ones.

In his speech at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, Germany last week, President Obama warned of the need to take action against “coastlines that vanish, oceans that rise”–an echo of his much-lampooned 2008 speech in Minneapolis upon winning the Democratic nomination, in which he said that he was “absolutely certain” that future generations would remember his nomination and anticipated victory as the moment that “when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal.”

For Obama and his most radical supporters, that moment was much delayed–perhaps, until today."
"http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-obama-climate-20130618,0,1769572.story",2013-06-17 07:00:00,['Neela Banerjee Is A Former Staff Writer For The Los Angeles Times.'],Obama considers sweeping climate plan,"WASHINGTON — The Obama administration is considering a sweeping initiative to address climate change, including the first-ever limits on carbon dioxide from power plants, the country’s biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions, according to people familiar with the discussions.

The White House has yet to settle on specific measures, but “we’re hearing that existing power plants are definitely in the mix,” said a person with knowledge of the deliberations, who, like others, asked not to be identified to talk about White House discussions. An announcement could come by mid-July.

Power plants account for about a third of the country’s greenhouse gas emissions, with most of the carbon dioxide coming from coal-fired plants and, to a lesser extent, natural gas generation. Issuing rules to curtail their pollution would almost certainly touch off a battle in the courts and Congress.

“There are only a few substantive, meaningful actions the administration can take short of dealing with existing power plants,” said S. William Becker, executive director of the National Assn. of Clean Air Agencies, a group of local and state air pollution regulators. “So I’d be extremely surprised if existing power plants weren’t one of the top priorities the administration is pursuing.”

The White House declined to comment on the deliberations, instead citing President Obama’s past comments on climate change. The Edison Electric Institute, the power industry’s trade group, also declined to comment.

Still, Heather Zichal, White House deputy assistant for energy and climate change, said at an environmental conference in Washington last week that “in the coming weeks and months, you can expect to hear more from the president on this issue.”

At the start of his second term, Obama identified climate change as one of his top priorities, along with immigration and the federal deficit. But then the administration appeared to pull back. Long-awaited final rules to limit greenhouse gases from new power plants have been delayed, and the White House has been silent on any plan to control emissions from existing power plants.

But in recent weeks, the administration has begun to move on its climate agenda. Most notably, Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping announced recently that the countries would phase down and eventually halt the production and use of hydrofluorocarbons, potent heat-trapping gases used as chemical refrigerants in air conditioners and other appliances. The United States and China now plan to work to get other countries, in particular India, to join the effort.

Three years ago, Obama pledged that the U.S. would lower its greenhouse gas emissions to 17% less than 2005 levels by 2020. The administration’s fuel economy rules for motor vehicles have helped rein in emissions. Carbon dioxide output has also fallen because the economy slowed and cleaner-burning natural gas plants are replacing coal-fired plants. Yet the U.S. cannot meet that target without enacting new regulations or laws, according to analysts and regulators.

Republican lawmakers have largely rejected the idea that human activity has caused climate change, precluding the chance of passing new legislation. As a result, the administration has to act on its own.

Rep. Edward Whitfield (R-Ky.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on energy and power, could not be reached for comment.

But to make a deep dent in carbon dioxide emissions, the administration would have to tackle the politically touchy subject of power plants. Any rule issued by the Environmental Protection Agency would no doubt trigger a lawsuit by opponents. Congress could also try to attach riders to spending bills that would stop funding for greenhouse gas standards, said Daniel J. Weiss, director of climate strategy at the Center for American Progress Action Fund.

The EPA could make new power plant rules more palatable if it avoided a one-size-fits-all approach, Becker said. The states would have to enforce the standards. The EPA could work with states to set up target reductions of greenhouse gases for each state. A state with many coal plants, such as Ohio, might not be able to meet its target as fast as a state such as Washington, which relies greatly on hydroelectricity.

Environmentalists and regulators said a new climate initiative might contain energy efficiency programs and efforts to eliminate leaks of methane, another potent greenhouse gas, from oil and gas drilling operations and pipelines.

“This is an important issue to the president. It’s a question of his legacy,” said Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Beverly Hills), ranking member on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. “Five years from now, people will be talking about what the Obama administration did on climate change, not entitlements or the deficit or whatever they are talking about now. Because climate change is here and real, and we have to address it.”

State senators convened a joint legislative hearing to review the draft regulations, which represent California’s first attempt to govern the controversial drilling process known as “fracking.”

Although the proposed rules would require energy companies to disclose many of the chemicals they inject deep into the ground to break apart rock and release oil, some lawmakers said the regulations should go further, including advance notice to nearby landowners and water monitoring around fracking operations.

Though fracking has unlocked vast amounts of previously unreachable fossil fuels elsewhere, environmentalists and public health advocates in California have raised safety questions about the hundreds of chemicals used — many of them known carcinogens — and the potential for drinking water contamination.

At Tuesday’s hearing, county elected officials and representatives of local and state environmental agencies joined in calling for more disclosure.

“We want to know if someone spills, what they spill,” said Jonathan Bishop, chief deputy director of the State Water Resources Control Board.

Oil companies say they have used the technology safely for decades in California. Nevertheless, representatives testified that they supported mandatory reporting to allay public concerns.

Lawmakers questioned the adequacy of the proposed venue for disclosure, FracFocus, a national fracking registry the industry helped create online to allow for voluntary reporting. Some senators said the disclosure reports should be public records maintained on a state website.

Jason Marshall, chief deputy director of the state Department of Conservation, countered that it would take at least five years for the agency to build its own database, calling FracFocus an “off-the-shelf, available-to-use-now tool.”

Lawmakers also questioned the diligence of the state’s oil agency, citing a 2011 audit from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that urged tighter extraction standards after finding that regulators were not adequately protecting potential drinking water.

“No regulations are going to make any difference if we don’t have qualified inspectors and enough numbers to actually enforce those regulations,” said state Sen. Hannah-Beth Jackson (D-Santa Barbara).

Tim Kustic, the state’s oil and gas supervisor, assured lawmakers that his agency had taken steps to correct deficiencies in the oversight program.

State Sen. Jean Fuller (R-Bakersfield) lauded regulators for their more aggressive approach and cautioned her colleagues against excessive regulation of the oil industry, one of the state’s economic powerhouses.

Some government agencies aren’t waiting for the state’s lengthy rule-making process. The South Coast Air Quality Management District, which regulates air quality in Southern California, has already drafted its own fracking rules and is to vote on them in April.

But only if the industry can get the stuff out of the ground without upsetting the state's powerful environmental lobby.

Running from Los Angeles to San Francisco, California's Monterey Shale is thought to contain more oil than North Dakota's Bakken and Texas's Eagle Ford -- both scenes of an oil boom that's created thousands of jobs and boosted U.S. oil production to the highest rate in over a decade.

In fact, the Monterey is thought to hold over 400 billion barrels of oil, according to IHS Cambridge Energy Research Associates. That's nearly half the conventional oil in all of Saudi Arabia. The United States consumes about 19 million barrels of oil a day.

""Four hundred billion barrels, that doesn't escape anyone in this businesses,"" said Stephen Trammel, energy research director at IHS.

The trick now is getting it out.

As a result of the San Andres fault, California's geologic layers are folded like an accordion rather than simply stacked on top of each other like they are in other Shale states. The folds have naturally cracked the shale rock, and much of California's current ""conventional"" oil production -- the third largest in the nation -- is thought to come from the Monterey.

But the folds mean recent advancements that have made shale oil and gas profitable to extract -- horizontal drilling combined with hydraulic fracturing -- don't work as well in California. It's hard to drill horizontally if the shale is not flat.

Plus, it appears the Monterey is made up of shale rock that doesn't respond as well to hydraulic fracturing -- the controversial practice known as fracking that involves injecting water, sand and chemicals into the ground under high pressure to crack the rock and allow the oil and gas to flow.

Still, the U.S. Energy Information Agency estimates there are over 15 billion barrels of oil that can be recovered using today's technology.

""That's a huge number,"" said Matt Woodson, an analyst at the energy research firm Wood Mackenzie. Woodson said the 15 billion number far exceeds current estimates for North Dakota's Bakken Shale, and is about half the amount held in Alaska's North Slope before it was tapped.

That potential has attracted the attention of the oil industry.

Several oil companies have put together research teams to work on the Monterey, said Katie Potter, head of exploration and production staffing at NES Global Talent, a company that recruits oil industry professionals.

If the Monterey takes off, Potter said the impact on jobs in the state would be huge, saying the shale boom has already created 600,000 jobs nationwide over the last few years.

""It could potentially solve the state's budget deficit,"" she said.

Last month, the government held a lease sale to drill in the Monterey. While only a modest 18,000 acres were offered, they were all snapped up.

Occidental (OXY), which is California-based and has long held acres in the Monterey, has had some success using a technology known as deep acid injection, said IHS's Trammel.

The process involves injecting hydrofluoric or other acids deep underground, where they eat away at the shale rock and allow the oil to flow. It's cheaper than fracking, said Trammel. And while it sounds ominous, it may not be as controversial, as the volumes involved are far less and it's not done under such pressure, he said.

Still, no matter how the oil is produced, environmentalists in the Golden State are keeping close watch.

Fracking could still become an issue, as it has in other states where it's led to fears over groundwater contamination, said Nathan Matthews, a Sierra Club attorney based in San Francisco. And there's no guarantee acid injection is much better.

Plus, there's air pollution, road congestion and other issues that go along with an oil boom.

Matthews wants California regulators to require full disclosure of everything the oil industry is putting in the ground, as well as individual permits issued for each well drilled.

""There's a chance to get this done much better than where it's been done elsewhere,"" said Matthews. ""We need to understand the risks before we open the flood gate.""

Regulations or not, there's still no guarantee there will be an oil boom at all.

""It might not live up to its expectations,"" said Fadel Gheit, a senior energy analyst at Oppenheimer. ""The industry has not concluded whether it's boom or bust.""

But given the rapid advances over the last few years in oil drilling and producing technology, the smart money may be on boom.

""There are some pretty creative people in this industry,"" said Trammel. ""I'd say they are going to figure it out."""

The court declined to rule on California’s Proposition 8, which defined marriage as between one man and one woman, clearing the way for the unions in that state.

A group of conservative House Republicans blasted the decisions on same-sex marriage issued Wednesday by the Supreme Court as legally inconsistent and detrimental to the future of the nation’s children. One lawmaker pledged to soon file a constitutional amendment to reinstate the Defense of Marriage Act.

“A narrow radical majority of the court has substituted their personal views for the constitutional decisions of the American voters and their elected representatives,” said Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R-Kan.). “My response will be later this week to file a federal marriage amendment.”

Asked if he would have the leadership’s support, Huelskamp pointed to a statement from House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) expressing disappointment in the decisions. Boehner’s comments were less forceful than those from more conservative House Republicans, though.

Huelskamp and other tea party-backed lawmakers spoke at a monthly meeting with reporters they call “Conversations With Conservatives,” which allows the reporters to quiz some of the most ardent conservatives on issues facing Congress.

In opening remarks, Huelskamp said he was primarily concerned about how the rulings could affect American children. Decades of social-science research have “shown that every child deserves a mom and dad,” he said, adding later, “I think children will be hurt.”

Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.), an outspoken tea party member, echoed Huelskamp.

“Marriage was created by the hand of God. No man, not even a Supreme Court, can undo what a holy God has instituted,” Bachmann said. “What the court has done will undermine the best interest of children and the best interests of the United States.”

Ralph Reed, a leading Christian conservative and head of the Faith & Freedom Coalition, denounced the ruling as “an Orwellian act of judicial fiat” and said he will join in the effort for new legislation to replace the Defense of Marriage Act.

“We will now seek the passage of federal legislation to remedy this situation as much as possible given the parameters of the decision,” he said.

While these conservatives spoke out, other Republican opponents of same-sex marriage were notably quieter than gay-marriage supporters after the decisions were handed down Wednesday morning.

Boehner said the debate over marriage will continue and emphasized that the court’s decision is part of the process.

“While I am obviously disappointed in the ruling, it is always critical that we protect our system of checks and balances,” Boehner said. “A robust national debate over marriage will continue in the public square, and it is my hope that states will define marriage as the union between one man and one woman.”

Not all Republicans expressed disappointment in the rulings.

Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), who last week became the third GOP senator to endorse same-sex marriage, hailed the decision as a victory for state’s rights, noting that states will be allowed to decide the issue for themselves.

Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who opposes same-sex marriage, agreed with Murkowski, telling ABC News that states should decide the issue.

“As a country, we can agree to disagree,” Paul said.

Another potential candidate in the 2016 GOP presidential race, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), said he sympathizes with the states’-rights argument. “For the purposes of federal law, however, Congress had every right to adopt a uniform definition, and I regret that the Supreme Court would interfere with that determination,” Rubio said.

Even as conservatives promised legislation to ban same-sex marriage, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) introduced a bill to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act, some parts of which were not challenged in the case decided Wednesday."

Several states with constitutional prohibitions on same-sex marriage have implemented rules in the past several weeks saying that same-sex married couples in their states will have to file state taxes as individuals.

The U.S. Department of the Treasury ruling recognizing same-sex married couples even if they live in states that do not, was issued in August in response to the U.S. Supreme Court's decision earlier this year to overturn the federal Defense of Marriage Act. The Treasury's new rule covers all federal tax matters where marriage is involved, including filing status.

North Dakota Tax Commissioner Cory Fong (R) wrote an email to state Rep. Kylie Oversen (D-Grand Forks) in late September explaining North Dakota's policy:

Because the North Dakota Constitution does not recognize same sex marriages, the married filing status cannot be recognized for same-sex couples at the state level. Instead, each individual will complete a new supplemental schedule that instructs them on how to report their separate share of the joint federal taxable income. The information on the completed schedule will then be used by each individual to fill out their respective state tax return. The filing status selected by each individual on the state tax return must be either single or head of household.

Last week, Kansas Revenue Secretary Nick Jordan made a similar announcement, while the Idaho Tax Commission also indicated that same-sex married couples would be treated as singles on their state filings.

In Kansas, Tom Witt, the executive director of Equality Kansas, told The Huffington Post that the state revenue department's ruling may actually violate a state law that allows married couples to use their federal tax returns to determine their state return.

""The administration should really follow state law and federal guidelines, and stop discriminating against gay and lesbian couples in the state,"" Witt told HuffPost.

Kansas Revenue Department spokeswoman Jeannine Koranda disagreed with Witt, saying that the state constitutional amendment barring same-sex marriage trumps the federal law. She noted that the revenue department is taking steps to help same-sex couples, like developing guidelines on how to use the federally adjusted gross incomes from an IRS worksheet to complete state returns.

But Witt said that he believes the state will be sued over this.

""If we get sued and go to the courts, and the court decides it is not constitutional, then we will address it,"" Kansas state Rep. J.R. Claeys (R-Salina) told HuffPost. Claeys said he agrees with the rule changes, noting that same-sex marriage is banned in the Kansas constitution.

North Dakota Deputy Tax Commissioner Ryan Rauschenberger told HuffPost that his department also wants to streamline the process for same-sex married couples. He said under the North Dakota rules, same-sex couples would be able to divide their federal taxable income between them for state tax purposes. Rauschenberger said rough estimates show those filing as singles under this plan would pay less in taxes than if they filed as a married couple.

""It is a pretty streamlined process,"" Rauschenberger said.

In Idaho, the state tax commission will require same-sex married couples to prepare paperwork as singles for the state, in addition to their federal tax preparation.

In North Dakota, Rauschenberger said allowing joint filing will have to be addressed by amending the constitutional ban on same-sex marriage and noted that state lawmakers don't reconvene until January 2015. Anything the state adopted would have to face a statewide referendum.

Oversen said she would like to bring up the issue with her colleagues in the Legislature, but said it would be a tough climb. ""We can't even get same sex housing discrimination banned yet,"" she said."

The Beacon Hill Institute’s most recent State Competitiveness Report also placed Rhode Island fifth among all states in the technology category. Now we are poised to adopt the third and final T: tolerance.

The point is not simply that we are welcoming to gay people, though we are. It is that we want to welcome everyone. The talented workers who are driving the new economy — young, educated and forward-looking — want to live in a place that reflects their values. They want diversity, not simply out of a sense of justice, but because diversity makes life more fun. Why would any state turn away the people who are most likely to create the economies of the 21st century?

I have been heartened in recent months to see members of my old party coming around on marriage equality, including the entire Republican caucus in the Rhode Island Senate — the first time a caucus of either party has been unanimous in its support. That reflects sound political judgment, and some values that are at least as Republican as they are Democratic, including a belief in marriage as an institution and a desire to keep government out of our personal lives.

The push for equality will continue to grow stronger in statehouses, courthouses and polling places in every state in America. This is, by and large, a generational issue, not a geographic one. Even in the reddest states, the rising generations are far more tolerant than their parents and grandparents. As this shift continues, marriage equality will inevitably become law in more and more states. The states that cling to their old prohibitions will then be viewed as the outliers. Like Rhode Island in recent years, they will be seen as islands of old thinking.

This is also true, more broadly, at the national level. The United States is at a competitive disadvantage in attracting skilled workers to fill high-level jobs in technology, finance and health care, as noted by industry leaders and Wall Street executives at Monday’s annual “Out on the Street” conference. It is my hope that the Supreme Court will choose to overturn the Defense of Marriage Act, and that my fellow governors will lobby their Congressional delegations to address our country’s discriminatory policies at the federal level.

So tomorrow, when I sign the Marriage Equality Act into law, I will be thinking of the Rhode Islanders who have fought for decades simply to be able to marry the person they love. I will be thinking of how Rhode Island is upholding its legacy as a place founded on the principles of tolerance and diversity. But I will also be thinking, as all governors must, about the economy. With marriage equality becoming law tomorrow night in Rhode Island, we are sending a clear message that we are open for business, and that all are welcome. I hope that leaders in capitals across the country — including Washington — will soon realize that marriage equality is an issue where doing the right thing and the smart thing are one and the same."

President Barack Obama said Friday that children from communities wracked by poverty and violence need help from the government, schools, family and clergy to have a chance to climb “ladders of opportunity” to reach the middle class and beyond.

Speaking at a Chicago high school near where he used to live, Obama cited gun violence that killed 443 people in the city last year as one reason why children need community wide support to help them believe they can improve their lives through education and hard work.

“In too many neighborhoods today, whether here in Chicago or the farthest reaches of rural America, it can feel like, for a lot of young people, the future only extends to the next street corner or the outskirts of town,” he said, adding “that no matter how much you work or how hard you try, your destiny was determined the moment you were born.”

Making his third campaign-style appearance in three days, Obama again emphasized proposals from Tuesday’s State of the Union address, such as raising the minimum wage to $9 an hour and providing good pre-schooling for every child as necessary to help people better themselves.

The president also called for Congress to vote on a package of gun proposals aimed at decreasing shootings like ones that occur daily on streets and in homes, as well as mass killings in recent months at a school, a movie theater and even a place of worship.

According to the Centers of Disease Control, there were 11,078 homicides by firearm in the United States in 2010, and 7,220 of the victims – 65% – were aged 15-34. In addition, 6,151 – or 56% – were African American, a demographic that comprises about 13% of the total U.S. population.

“This is not just a gun issue,” he continued. “It’s also an issue of the kinds of communities that we’re building, and for that we all share responsibility as citizens to fix it.”

It all starts at home, the president said, calling “strong, stable families” and “loving, supportive parents” the most important ingredients for reducing violence.

Noting he was raised by a single mother, he called for promoting marriage and encouraging fatherhood, saying he wished he had a father around and involved when he was a boy.

“By the way, that’s all kinds of parents,” he added, drawing applause when he specified “it includes gay or straight parents.”

He acknowledged the challenge, saying “it will not be easy, but it can be done.”

“No solution we offer will be perfect,” he said. “But perfection has never been our goal. Our goal has been to try and make whatever difference we can.”

Obama headed to his hometown after a White House ceremony Friday morning to award the Presidential Citizens Medal – the nation’s second-highest civilian honor – to 18 people. They included posthumous honors for six educators killed along with 20 first-graders in December’s Connecticut school massacre.

The president hugged family members of the slain teachers and administrators from Sandy Hook Elementary School in presenting the medals, saying: “We could not be more grateful to your loved ones, who gave everything they had” for the children in their care.

In his remarks later at Chicago’s Hyde Park Academy High School, Obama mentioned Hadiya Pendleton, 15, who was killed by gunfire in the city last month after returning from taking part in inaugural activities in Washington.

Pendleton’s parents were in the crowd Friday, just as they were at the State of the Union as guests of first lady Michelle Obama, who attended Hadiya’s funeral.

The president said his package of gun measures was intended to save young lives and that “they deserve a vote,” repeating the phrase a few times as he did in Tuesday’s address at the Capitol.

Chicago’s record murder rate: Don’t blame guns alone

Fierce opposition by the National Rifle Association makes passage of any significant gun legislation uncertain. In response to Obama’s State of the Union address, the NRA has sought to discredit the motives and impacts of legislation proposed by the president and Democrats.

“They only care about their decades-old gun control agenda — ban every gun they can, tax every gun sold and register every gun owner,” NRA chief executive Wayne LaPierre said in a statement on Thursday. “This president has taken the art of public deception and manipulation to a whole new level.”

Obama seeks an updated version of the 1994 assault weapons ban, which expired in 2004, that would prevent the manufacture and sale of some semi-automatic rifles modeled after fully automatic assault weapons.

Obama’s emotional plea might lead to vote on guns

He also proposes limiting ammunition magazines to 10 rounds, expanding background checks to all gun transactions, including sales at gun shows. In addition, the president wants Congress to take steps to better screen people with mental illnesses, so they cannot obtain weapons.

Legislation proposed so far also would crack down on so-called straw purchases, in which a legal buyer purchases weapons for distribution to non-legal buyers.

The NRA and other opponents argue the Democratic proposals are veiled attempts to limit gun ownership and eventually take away weapons, and therefore violate the constitutional right to bear arms.

In particular, opponents contend the proposed ban on semi-automatic rifles focuses on a weapon used in a tiny percentage of killings and other gun violence.

Opinion: Chicago’s violence took my dad, friends

Harold Pollack, co-director of the University of Chicago Crime Lab, confirmed on Friday that so-called assault weapons targeted by the proposed ban account for a small fraction of murders in the United States.

However, Pollack said the ban proposed by Obama can help reduce gun violence, especially what he called the psychologically impactful mass shootings such as the Newtown attack in which a lone gunman used a Bushmaster semi-automatic rifle.

The combination of such weapons with high-capacity magazines “facilitates mass homicides,” Pollack told CNN, noting that professional criminals generally don’t use such rifles that look like military weapons.

“The people who do use these weapons are often the most dangerous or most sociopathic,” Pollack said. The Newtown shooter, a 20-year-old man living with his mother, took her legally owned guns and killed her before going to the school to open fire on students and teachers.

New player in gun control ad wars

To Pollack, such a mass killing – while relatively rare – “traumatizes communities and the entire society in a way that demands attention.”

Studies show that street crime such as shooting deaths cost communities more than lives, Pollack said, citing emergency medical services and criminal investigation as tangible costs along with intangibles such as residents moving away to escape the threat.

Obama also made that point in his remarks on Friday, saying “it’s very hard to develop economically if people don’t feel safe.”

In the aftermath of the Newtown shootings, the NRA called for putting armed guards at every school, rather than seeking to limit the ability of people to obtain weapons. It also wants tougher enforcement of existing gun laws, which Pollack agreed was necessary.

“A lot of the underground gun market could be stopped if we treated guns with the same amount of determination and tools as the drug market,” he said.

For example, Pollack noted how committing a crime with a gun brought additional charges, and he called for similar treatment for illegally possessing a firearm.

How we talk about guns in my Chicago classroom

In a Google Hangout online chat on Thursday, a participant asked Obama how renewing the assault weapons ban would help reduce gun violence caused primarily by handguns.

He responded that his proposed package would affect handgun violence through the expanded background checks and cracking down on straw purchases. Renewing the weapons ban focused on what Obama called “weapons of war.”

“It’s not going to solve every problem,” the president continued, noting that some restrictions are already in place.

“We can’t purchase a grenade launcher from a store, although there may be some folks who want to buy those,” he said. “And the reason is we think on balance, the Second Amendment does not automatically assume that any weapon that’s available you can automatically purchase.”

The new Congress will begin its next session with an agenda expected to focus largely on issues that re-emerged over the past several weeks and months, with gun legislation and immigration reform near the top.

Though fiscal issues will remain a priority, how much work lawmakers put into them depends on whether, or to what extent, President Obama and congressional Republicans resolve the fiscal crisis in the closing days of this session.

A basic deal to prevent some of the $600 billion mix of tax increases and automatic spending cuts from kicking in Jan. 1 would still leave the 113th Congress to address debt ceiling and tax code issues.

But in the near term, immigration legislation appears to be high on the docket in the next Congress and second Obama administration term.

Washington has tried for years to change the country's immigration policy -- to strengthen border security and stem the flow of illegal immigrants into the U.S.; to reform the visa system for the benefit of those legal immigrants following the rules; and figure out how to address the millions of illegal immigrants already here.

Legislative efforts by Democrats and Republicans on comprehensive immigration reform had reached a standstill -- until the issue re-emerged during this election cycle when Obama suspended deportation for many young immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally by their parents.

Republicans have since signaled their intentions to be the first to introduce and pass more comprehensive legislation to deal with the roughly 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States, especially after Obama won re-election with roughly 71 percent of the Hispanic vote.

However, Obama appeared to re-stake his turf Sunday, saying he would introduce legislation next year to fix “our broken immigration system.”

Danielle Doane, director of government studies at the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank, said the question about what will be on the new Congress' agenda is really two basic questions: “What will be their priorities and what will they be forced to deal with?""

Gun control could answer both of those questions. Obama and leaders of the Democrat-controlled Senate have made clear their intentions to promptly introduce legislation restricting firearms, in the aftermath of the Dec. 14 shooting at a Connecticut elementary school in which six adults and 20 first-graders were killed.

California Sen. Dianne Feinstein and other Democrats want to re-institute an assault-weapons ban – a plan Obama on Sunday again publicly supported. And related legislation could include proposed bans on high-capacity ammunition clips and tighter background checks for gun buyers.

Lawmakers have suggested over the past weeks that debates on gun control could start as early as this month and delay those on immigration reform until spring – given the political climate and the Senate Judiciary Committee having oversight on both issues.

However, Democrats can expect strong opposition from Republicans and the National Rifle Association, the country’s most influential gun lobby. And large-scale Second Amendment changes are not expected, even if Democrats pass legislation.

The president on Sunday said energy issues are also on his high-priority list, specifically how the country can produce more energy in environmentally conscious ways, and mentioned 15 times in an interview with NBC News the need for further deficit reduction.

Congressional leaders appeared reluctant over the lame duck session to say what will be their top priorities.

A spokesman for House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, whose office plays a major role in setting the agenda, said lawmakers were focused on solving the fiscal crisis.

Senate leadership did not return calls, nor did the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank influential in setting Democratic legislative policy.

However, Doane thinks the Republican-controlled House will again focus on budget-related issues.

""We'll likely see debt and deficit issues weaving throughout next year,"" she said.

The recent fiscal negotiations failed to include cuts to such major entitlement programs as Medicare and Social Security – an issue fiscal conservative are expected to revisit.

And even if Congress extends the so-called ""Bush-era"" tax rates, that still leaves members trying to overhaul the U.S. tax code.

""There's a lot of stuff wrapped into the extensions alone,"" Doane said.

The fiscal talks also failed to address the recurring debt ceiling issue.

A deal in Congress in the summer of 2011 raised the ceiling and narrowly averted the U.S. from defaulting on its debt. But just last week, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said the country is again approaching its debt limit and would likely default without congressional action in the next couple of months.

South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham told “Fox News Sunday” he would not vote to raise the ceiling if entitlement reform was left out of the deal.

“Why would I raise the debt ceiling again unless we address what put us in debt to begin with?” he asked. “I’m not going to raise the debt ceiling unless we get serious about keeping the country from becoming Greece, saving Social Security and Medicare.”"

The stock prices for Smith & Wesson Holding Co. (SWHC) and Sturm, Ruger & Co. (RGR) rose about 4%. The stock for Sturm, Ruger has risen 13% in the month since the shooting at a Newtown, Conn., elementary school that left 20 children and six educators dead.

Retailers that specialize in guns have also done well. The stock price for Cabela's (CAB) surged 6% on Wednesday and has gained 20% over the last month. Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) notched up slightly, and has gained 6% over the month.

Obama issued the call for the assault ban as part of a broad response to the Newtown shooting.

""Congress should restore the ban on military style assault weapons and a 10-round limit for magazines,"" the president said. Obama was referring to a 10-year ban that expired in 2004, which limited the capacity of magazines and restricted military-style features on semiautomatic rifles.

Related: Obama seeks assault weapons ban

But the specter of a potential ban in the wake of mass shootings around the country has prompted gun enthusiasts to stock up on the weapons that may some day be denied to them.

""Consumers are flocking to stores to purchase certain types of firearms, including assault rifles, in fears of some type of ban going forward,"" said Rommel Dionisio, gun industry analyst for Wedbush Securities. ""It's people rushing to buy them before they're banned.""

Dick's said last month that it has suspended sales of assault rifles.

Related: Assault rifles are selling out

Smith & Wesson and Sturm, Ruger manufacture a wide variety of firearms, including the semiautomatic rifles that are known various as assault weapons or modern sporting rifles.

There are many other non-public companies that manufacture semiautomatic rifles, including Bushmaster Firearms International, which makes the rifle used at the Newtown shooting and also a recent shooting in Webster, N.Y., where a convict burned down houses and then ambushed and killed two volunteer firefighters.

Such a ban, if it passes, would also impact manufacturers of high-capacity magazines. They include the Beta Company, which makes 100-round drums, and SGM Tactical, which produces 30-round and 100-round magazines.

High-capacity magazines face a potential ban because they were used by Adam Lanza in the Newtown shooting and by James Holmes, suspect in a mass shooting last year at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo.

Obama acknowledged that he faces serious opposition in trying to get an assault weapon bill passed by a Republican-controlled House.

Even as Obama spoke, thousands of gun industry members packed into the SHOT Show -- an annual trade show -- in Las Vegas. The show is owned and sponsored by the National Shooting Sports Foundation, an organization based in Newtown, less than two miles from the site of the Sandy Hook school shooting."

The leadership of the Lamoille Valley Fish and Game Club explained that it's ""difficult"" for the club to support the city -- even its officers -- given the actions of the council.

""We have members in Burlington as well as members of our club that are going to be passing through Burlington and this would directly affect them and we felt that a prejudicial vote like that was going to be non-supportive of our club and being non-supportive of our club makes it very difficult to support Burlington City,"" said Bob Boivin, chairman of the Lamoille Valley Fish and Game Club.

""It is a constitutional issue. I mean, it's not just a Second Amendment constitutional issue; but it's also a constitutional issue for Vermont. We have laws that have the state governing our gun controls in this area and they're looking to supersede those,"" he said.

The group's ban will affect how and when officers train in the state, where such facilities are limited.

In response, the Burlington Police Department released a statement saying: ""It is unfortunate that this important and much-needed community dialogue regarding gun control currently under way in the City of Burlington and across the nation has resulted in this action.""

The city government is defending the measure.

""In the absence of federal legislation or state law we feel it has come upon us as a city to take the measures we feel are necessary to protect our citizens,"" Burlington City Councilman Norman Blais said.

""Ultimately, I don't think that the best way to assert control over guns is at the local level,"" conceded Joan Shannon, president of the Burlington City Council. ""But here in Burlington, I think we felt the need to act because we didn't see action coming from either the state level or the federal level.""

Boivin argues city-by-city gun rules would create a multitude of challenges.

""If you're going to a shoot, say in one end of Vermont to the other, you have to check the laws for every town in between, and you will pass through a half a dozen different towns, and that makes it almost impossible for someone to stay as a legal gun owner, and that's what we're concerned about,"" he said.

Shannon said the council's action are only a first step toward better protecting the people of the city, ""but this at least gets the discussion started and often times we have found in Burlington that we lead the way and others will follow, and I think that that's the intention here.""

The Burlington City Council's proposal to ban certain assault weapons is far from being implemented. City voters would get a say in 2014. Then the measure would require approval by the Vermont legislature. Finally, if it does become law, it's likely to face a constitutional challenge from gun-rights advocates."
http://money.cnn.com/2013/04/18/investing/gun-stocks/index.html,2013-04-18 00:00:00,['Aaron Smith'],Gun stocks lag after gun control bill fails,"The U.S. Senate's defeat of the gun control bill could deal a surprising blow to the gun industry.

On Thursday, the first full trading session since the bill was defeated, gun stocks lagged, and analysts fear this might be part of a wider trend.

In recent months, the fear of new restrictions has driven gun sales to all-time highs. Now, that incentive could be gone.

""When these things happen, we do see demand slide,"" said Neal Dihora of Morningstar, who covers Alliant Techsystems, an aerospace company that also makes guns for the civilian and military markets. ""People start hoarding for a while, and [then they] realize they don't have to fill their basements with ammunition because it will still be there tomorrow.""

Alliant's (ATK) stock price dropped 1.5% Thursday, after seeing its shares surge 38% over the last year. Ammunition maker Olin Corp. (OLN) fell 1.2%, after climbing more than 13% over the last year. Smith & Wesson Holding Corp. (SWHC) managed a 1.7% gain Thursday, while Sturm, Ruger (RGR) slipped 1.5%.

The stock price for Cabela's (CAB), a retailer dependent on gun sales, dropped nearly 5%.

Obama's reelection and the Newtown shooting in December made gun enthusiasts fearful that regulations would be tightened. This prompted consumers to buy military-style semiautomatic rifles and high-capacity magazines, the prime targets in the so-called assault rifle ban. Prices jumped sky-high, stock ran out and factories struggled to keep up.

According to the FBI, the 10 top-volume weeks for background checks have occurred since President Obama's reelection. A report published by Scott Hamman, an analyst for Keybanc Capital Markets, said this was a 26% increase from the year before, ""underscoring our belief that current levels of demand are unsustainable over the long term.""

The proposed assault rifle ban ground to a halt Wednesday, when the Senate shot it down, along with a proposed expansion of background checks.

http://news.yahoo.com/texas-sd-governors-court-conn-gun-makers-201532123.html,,[],"Texas, SD governors court Conn. gun makers","HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — The governors of Texas and South Dakota visited Connecticut on Monday to court gun manufacturers that have threatened to leave since the state passed tough new gun-control laws this year in response to the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School.

While gun makers may be unlikely to leave behind their factories and skilled workforces, executives say Texas is an appealing location — and some said the out-of-state attention marked a stark contrast with a Connecticut governor they say has shown little regard for a local industry that dates to the Revolutionary War.

Texas Gov. Rick Perry shot at a firing range at Connecticut's venerable Colt Manufacturing Co., one of the plants he toured, and met privately with company owners and other businesses at a downtown Hartford restaurant. At a brief news conference afterward, the Republican offered a conservative policy blueprint in a state run by Democrats.

""Are your tax policies really in the best interest of your job creators?"" he asked. ""Is your regulatory climate one of which (that) really allows your citizens to be able to enjoy the freedoms that they can have or they should have or that they think they should have or are they going to relocate somewhere?""

Connecticut's Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, a Democrat, signed new gun restrictions into law in April, four months after 20 children and six educators were murdered by a lone gunman at a Newtown school.

Joe Bartozzi, senior vice president and general counsel at O.F. Mossberg & Sons, welcomed Perry's visit to the North Haven gun maker, which employs 270 workers in Connecticut and 400 in Texas. He contrasted Perry's interest in the business and the jobs it provides with what he called ""less than flattering remarks"" in recent months by U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy and Malloy about the gun industry.

Asked about the possibility of expanding in Texas, Bartozzi said, ""That would make more sense. That would be more logical for us.""

Story continues

The political climate in Connecticut is one of the factors, he said. He also said taxes and costs are higher in Connecticut.

Colt President and CEO Dennis Veilleux issued a statement saying Perry assured the company it would ""always be welcome in Texas.""

Mark T. Malkowski, president of Stag Arms in New Britain, said he's been in touch with Perry's office and met with the governor in Houston last month. He said he and Perry spoke about taxes, what Texas is doing ""to keep it a very friendly place for businesses"" and the cultural differences between Connecticut and Texas, which is perceived as less hostile to guns.

""There was nothing as much as a phone from our governor asking us to stay,"" he said.

Kelsey Pritchard, a spokeswoman for South Dakota Gov. Dennis Daugaard, said the governor and state economic development officials are visiting Connecticut on Monday and Tuesday to meet with gun manufacturers.

Malkowski said the biggest obstacle to quitting Connecticut is that the company's 200 employees would have to uproot themselves and their families.

""That's the hardest part. The employees make up the business,"" he said.

Malloy, who welcomed Perry to Connecticut in an unannounced visit to the Texas governor's meeting in Hartford, said the gun issue is particularly sharp in Connecticut because of the killings at the Sandy Hook Elementary School.

""I don't think he understands that kind of loss and how it's affected people in our state,"" Malloy said.

Legislation enacted in April adds more than 100 firearms to the state's assault weapons ban and bans the sale of magazines capable of holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition.

Perry said taxes and regulations are factors in decisions not only by gun manufacturers, but by pharmaceutical companies, financial firms and other businesses about where to locate.

Malloy sought to blunt Perry's thrust on jobs and industry. Connecticut's governor has made economic development a signature issue since taking office in January 2011, establishing a program consolidating tax credits to draw large employers and pushing for legislation promoting small business and bioscience jobs.

""Listen, we compete for every job and we're doing a pretty good job at it,"" he said.

Perry has poached in other states. He sought to talk up Texas for jobs in California's high tech, biotechnology, financial, insurance and film industries and urged Illinois employers to leave the state ""while there's still time.""

The Texas governor, who is set to visit New York during his trip to the Northeast, also has run ads mocking New York's ""new New York ads,"" saying the Empire State is a high-tax state that hasn't much changed.

In Connecticut, he tried to take the edge off his tough message.

""Sometimes it's a rough business. I get that,"" Perry said. ""But so is competition on an athletic field. I hope we can shake hands, realize that we're just competitors. We're all Americans first. ""

Jan Brewer.

The bill prohibits cities and counties from destroying any guns that come into their possession; instead, the firearms must now be sold to federally licensed dealers.

The law started out as a set of guidelines on how government agencies should handle property that was confiscated, used as evidence, or turned in to law enforcement agencies, with an eye toward generating money for strapped programs. Eventually, the provision preventing local government from destroying such weapons was added.

Brewer’s office did not issue a statement about her approval of House of Representatives Bill 2455, which she signed without fanfare Monday.

Firearms groups, however, pushed heavily for the bill. The National Rifle Assn.’s legislative action arm urged members to support the bill, saying, “firearms that are collected would maintain their value and their sale to the public would help recover public funds when budgets are strained.”

Earlier this year, Tucson held a buyback that collected more than 200 weapons. The police department arranged with the Safeway chain of grocery stores to donate $10,000 worth of gift cards for the buyback.

“It was tremendously successful,” Councilwoman Regina Romero said.

Romero told the Los Angeles Times on Saturday that HB 2455 was “ridiculous,” particularly in light of the rash of mass shootings in the United States over the past few years. Arizona has not been immune: In January 2011, Jared Lee Loughner went on a rampage in a Tucson shopping center, shooting to death six people and wounding 13 others, including then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords.

“I think it’s tremendously hypocritical of the Republicans in the state Legislature to nag and cry about federal control but turn around and micromanage cities,” Romero said.

Gun buybacks have also been held to the east in Phoenix, and the police department there intends to make the best of the three months it has until the new law takes effect. The city will hold three buybacks this month, offering $100 gift cards for every handgun, shotgun and rifle turned in, and $200 for assault rifles. The collected guns will be destroyed.

Los Angeles routinely holds gun buybacks, with the most recent scheduled for Saturday.

%22Probably not a bad idea%22 for Mayor Bloomberg%2C others to step back%2C Hickenlooper says

New recall effort%2C if successful%2C could switch control of Colorado Senate to the GOP

Federal government shutdown has hurt recovery from last month%27s devastating floods

WASHINGTON -- Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper suggests national gun-control groups stay away from a looming recall battle that could switch control of the state Senate to the GOP. The groups poured money into an unsuccessful defense of two state lawmakers recalled over their gun votes earlier this year.

""Colorado is a state that people like to be themselves and solve their own problems,"" the Democratic governor said in an interview with Capital Download, USA TODAY's weekly video newsmaker series. ""They don't really like outside organizations meddling in their affairs, and maybe the NRA gets a pass on that.

""But (it is) probably not a bad idea"" for gun-control groups, such as the one established by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, to curb their efforts if gun-rights activists collect enough signatures to force a recall vote on state Sen. Evie Hudak, a two-term Democrat from a suburban district north of Denver, he said.

If Republicans succeed in gaining her seat, Democrats would lose their 18-17 edge in the state Senate.

Petition organizers have until Dec. 3 to collect 18,900 signatures. ""They're well-funded and there's a lot of energy behind this, a lot of frustration,"" Hickenlooper said. ""I'm going to guess it's probably 50-50"" that they will be able to get the recall vote on the ballot.

But, he noted, ""I didn't think they'd get enough signatures for the first two.""

The recall campaigns have been aimed at legislators who voted in favor of requiring universal background checks for gun buyers and limiting magazine clips to 15 rounds. The laws, pushed by Hickenlooper, were enacted in the wake of a mass shooting at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo., last year that left 12 people dead.

In September, Senate President John Morse and state Sen. Angela Giron — both Democrats — were ousted from office by recall votes. Bloomberg's group, Mayors Against Illegal Guns, contributed $350,000 to the anti-recall campaign, but the efforts by groups from outside the state became an issue itself for some. After the recalls succeeded, the National Rifle Association gloated on Twitter that Bloomberg had ""wasted his money.""

Hickenlooper acknowledges the difficulties of passing federal gun laws even after the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., last December and other tragedies. ""We have this tradition of the Second Amendment and people's rights to self-defense and a certain suspicion that the government can't be trusted,"" he said. ""That's going to make it very difficult. I think any progress in terms of even universal background checks will be slow.""

The governor was interviewed while in Washington for The Daily Beast's Hero Summit, discussing crisis leadership after Colorado's devastating floods last month.

The partial shutdown of the federal government has complicated recovery efforts, Hickenlooper said in the interview with USA TODAY.

""We had the worst floods probably in the history of the state, and yet we don't have the resources of the EPA,"" he said. The Environmental Protection Agency has been unable to test for suspected e-coli, the possible result of sewage contamination, on grass and parklands where children are playing. The Department of Housing and Urban Development ""doesn't have the resources or the flexibility to get shelter"" for some of those crowded into temporary housing.

""FEMA still has got all their people on the ground in Colorado,"" he said of the Federal Emergency Management Administration, ""but when they make requests now, all their support staff in Washington is gone.""

Hickenlooper, 61, was hobbling on crutches after undergoing hip surgery last month. A former mayor of Denver, he is running for re-election as governor next year, a race that the non-partisan Cook Political Report now rates as solidly Democrat, indicating a likely victory for him.

""Easy for them to say,"" he said with a smile.

-- Carl Sandburg’s poem “Chicago.”

How tough are Chicago’s gun laws?

A 55-year-old woman who works as a researcher at the University of Illinois at Chicago was jailed this week for bringing a pistol -- licensed, unloaded and in a case – to her office.

The woman, who also holds an “Illinois firearm owners registration card,” told Chicago police that she had brought the handgun, recently purchased for home defense, to her workplace because she did not want to leave it at her residence while a work crew was there doing a renovation project.

But Chicago has perhaps the toughest gun laws in the nation and carrying the weapon, even without ammunition, is a serious offense.

A co-worker spotted the pistol case and called police who came and snatched up the information specialist from her workplace. The Chicago Tribune reports that the woman was held on $25,000 bond pending trial and placed on leave by the university.

Not too far away on the city’s West Side, Chicago Police were having less luck in dealing with another crime that day than they did with the case of the pistol packing information specialist.

An unidentified male was found stabbed to death in an alleyway, marking the 50th murder in the city so far this year. The victim was later identified as a 22-year-old from across town in Calumet City, but given the low rate at which the city’s 535 murders last year were solved, it looks unlikely that police will soon be identifying the one who did the stabbing.

President Obama is back in his hometown today to make another pitch for his “cradle to career” educational initiatives. But while he’s in town, the president will surely have to address the murder epidemic that has gripped the city.

It’s not that Chicago rivals murder wastelands like New Orleans or Detroit, but what’s happening is very alarming for locals. While murder rates in the nation continue to decline, Chicago has seen sharp increases. While murder rates in New York dropped to an all time low last year, Chicago was approaching numbers not seen since the crack wars of the early 1990s.

So why is Chicago unraveling while New York is stabilizing? It’s hard to say exactly, but the city’s mayor, a former congressman, a former chief of staff to Obama and a potential future presidential contender, believes he knows. Rahm Emanuel has gone to war on guns.

Emanuel is doing everything he can to get the guns out of his city, taking up the cause with new vigor following the mass shooting in Connecticut last year.

[pullquote]

But as the jailed University of Illinois at Chicago researcher can attest, the gun laws are already pretty darn stiff. Remember, it’s not as if the police discovered the mix up and told her to take her gun home, they took her to jail for having a licensed, registered weapon that without ammunition was only about as deadly as a desktop stapler.

And one could hardly blame her for her recent purchase of the weapon given the deteriorating security situation in her neighborhood and the city at large. It’s not just murders. Shootings, robberies and other crimes are all up in the city, with shopkeepers and homeowners demanding protection.

As for her ignorance of the city’s gun laws, well, one supposes she understands now.

Emanuel urgently needs to stem the crime wave in his city. His political future and the city’s economic fate depend on erasing the growing perception of Chicago returning to its most lawless days, the era of Cabrini-Green and the crack wars. And at the very least he needs to demonstrate that it is gun makers who are more to blame than he, whose mayoralty has coincided with the crime wave.

The question for the president is whether he can make the case that a national gun ban would be effective in reducing murder rates given the results in Chicago.

And Now, A Word From Charles

“This isn't just any new entitlement. It's an entitlement that we know the $7 billion a year that we spend on Head Start doesn't make any difference after the third grade. There is a study that HHS has done that shows that. It's a failure, and yet he wants to double down to make it universal. That is probably a definition of a liberal.”

Rubio says ""more government"" -- and Obama's plans -- will ""hold you back"" NEW: ""Unconstitutionally undermining"" Second Amendment rights is wrong, he adds The Floridian delivered the official Republican rebuttal to Obama's State of the Union He referenced his personal story as a son of immigrants, while touting GOP positions

Claiming Barack Obama thinks a “free enterprise economy” is “the cause of our problems” – not, as he sees it, the solution – Sen. Marco Rubio argued Tuesday that the president’s proposals would hurt middle class citizens more than help them.

“Mr. President, I don’t oppose your plans because I want to protect the rich,” the Florida Republican said in his rebuttal to Obama’s State of the Union address. “I oppose your plans because I want to protect my neighbors.”

The 41-year-old lawmaker, viewed as a possible presidential candidate and declared by Time magazine as “The Republican Savior,” was tapped to give his party’s response to the speech.

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, also rebutted Obama on behalf of the conservative tea party caucus.

Rubio largely kept to his prepared remarks, except when he abruptly stopped talking about halfway through to reach for a drink of water.

The son of Cuban immigrants referred emotively to his personal story and that of his family, though his policy criticisms and proposals were largely in line with prevailing mainstream and, in some cases, conservative Republican thinking.

On immigration, for instance, on which Rubio has been one of his party’s most outspoken proponents of efforts to “modernize” the current system, he didn’t mention his past support of a route to citizenship for undocumented immigrants now in the United States.

The senator did generally advocate “a responsible, permanent solution to the problem of those who are here illegally.” But he added that first, “we must follow through on the broken promises of the past to secure our borders and enforce our laws.”

Speaking about gun control measures, one of the most emotional parts of Obama’s State of the Union speech, Rubio said he was for “effectively” dealing with such violence, then added, “but unconstitutionally undermining the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding Americans is not the way to do it.”

CNN Fact Check: Rubio says Obamacare needs a check up

He sharply criticized Obama on many fronts.

The president, Rubio claimed, had unfairly cast Republicans as opposing the environment and seniors, and only caring about rich people.

He contended that it was Obama who,if his plans are enacted, would hurt the majority of Americans by preventing the economy from growing.

“The tax increases and the deficit spending you propose will hurt middle class families,” Rubio said, referring to Obama. “It will cost them their raises. It will cost them their benefits. It may even cost some of them their jobs.”

His remarks often reflected the sharp partisan divide on budgetary matters.

Top Democrats, including Obama, have consistently said that increased government revenues should be paired with spending cuts to bring down the deficit.

Congress already raised tax rates on top income earners as part an agreement in January to avert the worst aspects of the so-called fiscal cliff. And now, Obama and Democrats want to eliminate some tax breaks and loopholes to further raise revenue.

Republican leaders have sought to reduce the size of government and, therefore, generally oppose any increase in tax revenue.

5 things we learned from the State of the Union

They have called for aggressive spending cuts and steps to overhaul entitlement programs, while rejecting any new attempts to increase revenue as part of further steps to reduce the deficit.

Obama’s “solution to virtually every problem we face is for Washington to tax more, borrow more and spend more,” Rubio said.

The president did, in fact, propose several new programs aimed at bolstering the economy, though he insisted they wouldn’t add to the deficit.

Opinion: Rubio missed the year of the woman

“The idea that more taxes and more government spending is the way to help hardworking middle-class taxpayers, that’s an old idea that has failed every time it’s been tried,” Rubio said. “More government isn’t going to help you get ahead. It’s going to hold you back.”

Rubio said he agreed with Obama on lowering the corporate tax rate, but didn’t mention the president’s support for closing tax loopholes that inordinately benefit the rich.

Rubio backed school choice for all parents and said that student financial aid should evolve to help more “nontraditional students.”

Talk Back: Is giving the State of the Union the political ‘kiss of death’?

On energy policy, the senator derided Obama’s administration for “wasting … taxpayer money on so-called clean energy ventures like Solyndra.” Rubio favors “reform” of energy regulations and opening up “more federal lands for safe and responsible (oil and gas) exploration,” both common Republican themes.

He spoke, too, of Medicare, the government-run health insurance program for seniors, arguing that changes are needed for it to continue. The president suggested he’d support “modest reform” of this entitlement program, but Rubio said Obama does not go far enough.

“I would never support any changes to Medicare that would hurt seniors like my mother,” he said. “But anyone who is in favor of leaving Medicare exactly the way it is right now is in favor of bankrupting it.”

Near the end of his speech, Rubio prayed that Democrats and Republicans “can come together to solve our problems,” contending that, if they don’t, the consequences will be stark.

“If we can get our economy healthy again, our children will be the most prosperous Americans ever,” Rubio said. “And if we do not, we will forever be known as the generation responsible for America’s decline.”

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/02/23/texas-mississippi-invite-gun-makers-to-move-to-state/,2013-02-23 00:00:00,[],"Texas, Mississippi seek to lure gun and ammunition makers","Top elected officials in Texas and Mississippi want gun and ammunition makers in several states to flee and relocate to their respective states.

Texas Gov. Rick Perry and Mississippi House Speaker Philip Gunn, both Republicans, have made overtures to Colorado-based Magpul Industries and other manufacturers, suggesting that they relocate.

Magpul, a manufacturer of ammunition magazines for firearms, has threatened to leave Colorado if the state enacts a ban on high-capacity magazines.

Perry, who reportedly sent letters to 26 firearms and ammunition manufacturers earlier this month, told Magpul that there is no other state ""that fits the definition of business-friendly like Texas,"" according to the Denver Post.

Perry's letter to Connecticut-based gun maker Mossberg & Sons reads in part, ""As you consider your options for responding to unwarranted government intrusion into your business, you may choose to consider relocating your manufacturing operations to a state that is more business-friendly,"" according to CTMirror.org.

Gunn sent letters Thursday to 14 gun manufacturers in Colorado, Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York and North Carolina.

""I am personally inviting you and your company to come to the great state of Mississippi,"" Gunn wrote in a letter to Colt's Manufacturing Co. in Connecticut. ""In our state, you will not be criticized for providing good to the law abiding citizens who enjoy hunting, shooting or who just want the peace of mind that comes with the constitutional right to protect their families.""

Leaders from other states have sent letters to some or all of the companies asking them to come to their homes. U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, a Republican, has made an overture. Also chiming in have been U.S. Rep. Jeff Duncan, R-S.C., and officials from Alabama, Idaho, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Wyoming.

Gunn's list also included the American unit of SIG Sauer in New Hampshire and North Carolina's Remington Arms Co. Both those states have little apparent movement toward tighter restrictions on guns and ammunition.

When asked how Gunn made up the list, spokeswoman Meg Annison said he had looked at high-profile arms makers who had threatened by gun control. She said Remington's factory in New York is why it made the list.

States where there's little movement to restrict firearms have trying to use their pro-gun culture as a way to lure gun makers away from their traditional production bases in the Northeast and Midwest.

Mississippi has five makers of firearms and ammunition, according to Mississippi Development Authority records. The most prominent of those is Olin Corp.'s Winchester unit in Oxford. The state lured Olin to Oxford from East Alton, Ill., after the company couldn't reach a wage-reduction deal with its union in Illinois and Mississippi put up $25 million in incentives.

Also in Mississippi, Precision Delta Corp. makes ammunition in Ruleville, MAC makes polymer bullet casings in Bay St. Louis, Nammo Talley assembles shoulder-launched rockets in Columbus and BAE Systems completes howitzers in Hattiesburg.

Brian Schweitzer has pledged his support for single-payer health care in the past, but his recent efforts to bring zero-cost sharing primary and preventive care to Montana government employees and retirees may be doing something that most progressives would only dream could happen in America: bringing NHS-style, socialized medicine to Montana.

This is a big deal and -- while currently limited to state employees and retirees -- could be laying the groundwork for America's most socially-just health care system. NPR has the details:



A year ago, Montana opened the nation's first clinic for free primary healthcare services to its state government employees. The Helena, Mont., clinic was pitched as a way to improve overall employee health, but the idea has faced its fair share of political opposition. A year later, the state says the clinic is already saving money. Pamela Weitz, a 61-year-old state library technician, was skeptical about the place at first. ""I thought it was just the goofiest idea, but you know, it's really good,"" she says. In the last year, she's been there for checkups, blood tests and flu shots. She doesn't have to go; she still has her normal health insurance provided by the state. But at the clinic, she has no co-pays, no deductibles. It's free. That's the case for the Helena area's 11,000 state workers and their dependents. With an appointment, patients wait just a couple minutes to see a doctor. Visitation is more than 75 percent higher than initial estimates.

The state contracts with a private company to run the facility and pays for everything — wages of the staff, total costs of all the visits. Those are all new expenses, and they all come from the budget for state employee healthcare. Even so, division manager Russ Hill says it's actually costing the state $1,500,000 less for healthcare than before the clinic opened. ""Because there's no markup, our cost per visit is lower than in a private fee-for-service environment,"" Hill says. Physicians are paid by the hour, not by the number of procedures they prescribe like many in the private sector. The state is able to buy supplies at lower prices. Bottom line: a patient's visit to the employee health clinic costs the state about half what it would cost if that patient went to a private doctor. And because it's free to patients, hundreds of people have come in who had not seen a doctor for at least two years.

Hill says the facility is catching a lot, including 600 people who have diabetes, 1,300 people with high cholesterol, 1,600 people with high blood pressure and 2,600 patients diagnosed as obese. Treating these conditions early could avoid heart attacks, amputations, or other expensive hospital visits down the line, saving the state more money. Clinic operations director and physician's assistant Jimmie Barnwell says this model feels more rewarding to him. ""Having those barriers of time and money taken out of the way are a big part [of what gets] people to come into the clinic. But then, when they come into the clinic, they get a lot of face time with the nurses and the doctors,"" Barnwell says.

Yup, nobody is forced to visit this publicly-financed clinic run by a private operator. If they wish, they can take their big-profit, private health insurance and head to any doctor they want, but folks are recognizing that this, err... public option, provides better care. And, when patients do make this choice, both the state and patients save money.Take a second and let the words above sink in real deep. There you have exactly why the UK, Canada, Australia, Italy, Costa Rica, Cuba and other first-world -- and third-world -- countries are able to secure better health care outcomes than the United States with dramatically lower health care spending. Imagine what -- let's call it the Montana model -- could do for our national debt . And, you know, even more importantly, the health of our people and the wellbeing of our medical professionals.Again, common sense that's not too common in these United States -- with the exception of Montana -- at the moment. High-deductible garbage plans -- promoted by big wigs at Aetna and Cigna who want patients to have more 'skin in the game' -- lead patients to delay putting off that chest pain until it becomes a heart attack...and open-heart surgery. When doctors aren't dealing with private health insurer bureaucracy and any sort of medical billing, the entire resources of the practice go towards taking care of human beings. When doctors are salaried instead of operating with a fee-for-service model, they emphasize quality over quantity. This is how medicine works in the UK, Canada and many other countries where protecting the wealth of hospital and insurance company CEOs is not the primary goal of the health care system.

Even Republicans -- who, you know, are naturally predisposed to hate the idea of patients seeing doctors without cost-sharing -- have a tough time faulting the new clinics.



""For goodness sakes, of course the employees and the retirees like it, it's free,"" says Republican State Sen. Dave Lewis. ... Now, Lewis is a retired state employee himself. He says, personally, he does like going there, too. ""They're wonderful people, they do a great job, but as a legislator, I wonder how in the heck we can pay for it very long,"" Lewis says.

Well, Mr. Republican, they're saving the state millions -- you just won't admit it, but at least you admit you love the socialized medicine.

What's most exciting about these clinics? More are on the way.



Montana recently opened a second state employee health clinic in Billings, the state's largest city. Others are in the works.

And best of all? Schweitzer went right around the backs of Republicans to set up these life- and money-saving clinics. That's bold, progressive leadership. Let's do our best to spread the news far and wide about how the ""Montana model"" is proving what much of the rest of the world already knows: the ideal primary health care system should be free at point of use."

An even higher number of 53% favor a partial government shutdown until “Democrats and Republicans can agree on what [general] spending to cut.” Only 37% oppose.

For obvious reasons, the media refuse to make clear that it is not the GOP proposing any kind of government shutdown, partial or otherwise. The GOP’s plan is to kill the ObamaCare debacle with a bill that funds everything but the president’s job-killing health care plan. It is up to the president and Democrat-led Senate, then, to decide if this wildly unpopular drag on our economy is worth shutting down the government.

Both the media and the president are eager for this showdown; both relish the idea of replaying the 1990s when the media and the Clinton White House worked together to bludgeon then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich over a similar gambit.

This poll, though, shows that this tactic might not work as well this time. Just for starters, people are much more concerned about the deficit today than they were in the mid-nineties; and there was no boondoggle like ObamaCare hanging out there as a prize in a shutdown showdown.

Make no mistake, the media will ignore this poll. The results do not fit the media’s pro-ObamaCare Narrative, and only interferes with the reality they are attempting to manufacture that says a shutdown can only mean disaster for the GOP.

But to those interested in reality, this poll should be food for thought.

Those are the odds they give for a government shutdown.

An alternative to the shutdown would be a proposed delay of the individual mandate, the most painful part of Obamacare, which may seem like a Republican victory but on closer inspection would be a win for President Obama and Democrats.

Historians — or commentators, in the meantime — might view either of these possible outcomes as yet another “Putinesca” victory for the president: Saved by the enemy.

Just as Russian President Vladimir Putin emerged at the brink of the U.S. bombing of Syria to orchestrate an alternative solution, Republicans may have provided a rip cord for Obama.

Postponement of the individual mandate is part of the GOP bargaining package on raising the debt ceiling. Delay it for a year, say Republican leaders, and they’ll raise the debt limit for a year to keep the government operating.

At least one Democrat, Joe Manchin, has conceded that this would be a pretty good idea since the health-care overhaul obviously isn’t ready. The many flaws have been fully vetted for months, though new ones continue to reveal themselves as we approach the insurance-exchange shopping spree scheduled to begin in a few days.

Latest to the fraying Affordable (now “Adorable”) Care Act is a technological glitch in online applications for small businesses. It isn’t ready yet and will be delayed.

What is ready, and adorable, is a sampler of new ads aimed at children who are still fretful about the new plan. Oh, wait, no. The ads, featuring baby ducks and kittens — purring and feeling ducky about Obamacare — are aimed at adults. They’re certifiably cute, but one can’t escape the thought that the federal government has skipped all pretense at treating Americans as adults. Naptime, anyone?

To be fair, Sen. Ted Cruz read Dr. Seuss’s “Green Eggs and Ham” to his children during his 21-hour un-filibuster. The muse whispers: “Ted Cruz would send Ronald Reagan back to the Democratic Party.”

Here’s the problem for Republicans, which will not be news to those with a view of the long game. The short game is to stall Obamacare, but to what end ultimately? Until Republicans can seize the Senate in 2014 and the White House in 2016, at which point they can repeal the whole thing?

Skinny chance, that.

More likely, whether the government shuts down or, should Tinker Bell suddenly materialize and persuade Obama to cave and postpone his personal dream act, Republicans will be viewed by a greater majority than previously as having no talent for leadership.

And if the debt ceiling isn’t raised and the United States defaults, threatening our full faith and credit around the world and sending countries looking favorably for other currencies, not to mention the financial fallout here, then blame will fall at the feet of the Republican Party. No surprise there.

Now consider the alternative scenario: Suppose Republicans succeed in getting the individual mandate delayed for a year — right up to the 2014 midterm elections. Bravo, right? Not necessarily. If voters don’t have to experience the uncertainty and discomfort of being forced to buy insurance in an unwieldy, dysfunctional system — all the while noticing that millions are still without coverage — who benefits?

Surely not the Republicans, who, on the one hand, can be blamed for depriving insurance coverage to those poor sick kittens and ducklings. On the other, they accrue no benefit from having prevented the pain of implementing Obamacare.

Republicans lose either way, but they may lose biggest if they win.

Alternatives to present circumstances do not abound. Republicans have drawn their line in the sand. Democrats have drawn theirs. Obama says no negotiating over the debt ceiling, period.

There is one alternative that is both perhaps best for the country and hardest for Obama. He could relent not to Republicans but to the greater good. He could delay full implementation past the 2014 elections, which would accomplish two things: One, he could iron out the wrinkles that are now apparent. Two, Democrats would get to slide through another election cycle without the most visibly painful part of Obamacare — the individual mandate.

What, really, does Obama have to lose? Only face, the pain of which passes. What he would gain is the legacy that escapes so many these days — proof that he is a leader who does the right thing, even if it hurts his pride just a little.

Republicans, who will have banished themselves to wander a while longer in the desert, may have drawn a line too far.

She Writes About News', 'Politics', 'Culture. Her Columns Appear On Wednesday', 'Sunday. Twitter']",President Obama’s public self-flogging on the Affordable Care Act,"It’s possible that President Obama felt better after that confessional, hour-plus press conference Thursday.

He had come to publicly flog himself for the disastrous Obamacare website rollout, comparing his role to that of a hapless football team captain: “If I fumble the ball, you know, I’m going to wait until I get the next play, and then I’m going to try to run as hard as I can and do right by the team. So, you know, ultimately I’m the head of this team. We did fumble the ball on it.”

He had also come to announce a temporary fix aimed at easing the outrage of many Americans who bought into his demonstrably untrue promise that “if you like your insurance policy you can keep it.”

But it’s hard to imagine that anyone besides his Republican antagonists was comforted by the mea culpa, or the newfound sense of transparency. Disappointed citizens, angry insurance companies, or freaked out Democratic legislators worried about their 2014 prospects probably didn’t feel a whole lot better after the president’s litany of disappointments.

In the course of an hour, he admitted he didn’t know what was going on with the website and that partly may have been due to the “insularity” of the White House. He acknowledged he misled people by promising them they could keep their plans, that it’s not easy to purchase a complicated product like health insurance online, that the federal government is ill-equipped to develop technology systems.

Here are seven issues Obama addressed, taken from a transcript posted by the Washington Post:

1. On why he allowed the Healthcare.gov website to be launched when it was failing internal tests:

“OK. On the website, I was not informed directly that the website would not be working the way it was supposed to. Had I been informed, I wouldn’t be going out saying, boy, this is going to be great. You know, I’m accused of a lot of things, but I don’t think I’m stupid enough to go around saying, this is going to be like shopping on Amazon or Travelocity, a week before the website opens, if I thought that it wasn’t going to work.

“So, clearly, we and I did not have enough awareness about the problems in the website. Even a week into it, the thinking was that these were some glitches that would be fixed with patches, as opposed to some broader systemic problems that took much longer to fix and we’re still working on them.

“So you know, that doesn’t excuse the fact that they just don’t work, but I think it’s fair to say, no...we would not have rolled out something knowing very well that it wasn’t going to work the way it was supposed to, given all the scrutiny that we knew was going to be on the website.”

2. On why he told people they could keep their insurance if they liked it:

“With respect to the pledge I made that if you like your plan you can keep it, I think, you know, and I’ve said in interviews, that there is no doubt that the way I put that forward unequivocally ended up not being accurate. It was not because of my intention not to deliver on that commitment and that promise. We put a grandfather clause into the law but it was insufficient.

3. On what he’s going to do to fix that:

“The other problem that has received a lot of attention concerns Americans who’ve received letters from their insurers that they may be losing the plans they bought in the old individual market, often because they no longer meet the law’s requirements to cover basic benefits like prescription drugs or doctor’s visits....

“I completely get how upsetting this can be for a lot of Americans, particularly after assurances they heard from me that if they had a plan that they liked they could keep it. And to those Americans, I hear you loud and clear. I said that I would do everything we can to fix this problem. And today I’m offering an idea that will help do it.

“Already people who have plans that pre-date the Affordable Care Act can keep those plans if they haven’t changed. That was already in the law. That’s what’s called a grandfather clause that was included in the law. Today we’re going to extend that principle both to people whose plans have changed since the law took effect and to people who bought plans since the law took effect....The bottom line is insurers can extend current plans that would otherwise be canceled into 2014. And Americans whose plans have been canceled can choose to re-enroll in the same kind of plan.”

4. On why the federal government is so bad at technology systems:

“There aren’t a lot of websites out there that have to help people compare their possible insurance options, verify income to find out what kind of tax credits they might get, communicate with those insurance companies so that they can purchase, make sure that all of it’s verified, right? So there’s just a bunch of pieces to it that made it challenging.

“And you combine that with the fact that the federal government does a lot of things really well. One of the things it does not do well is information technology procurement. You know, this is kind of a systematic problem that we have across the board....

“As I said before, our IT systems, how we purchase technology in the federal government is cumbersome, complicated and outdated....On my campaign, I could simply say, who are the best folks out there, let’s get them around a table, let’s figure out what we’re doing and we’re just going to continue to improve it and refine it and work on our goals.

“If you’re doing it at the federal government level, you know, you’re going through, you know, 40 pages of specs and this and that and the other and there’s all kinds of law involved. And it makes it more difficult. It’s part of the reason why chronically, federal IT programs are over budget, behind schedule.”

5. On underestimating the difficulty of purchasing a complicated product like insurance online:

“What we’re also discovering is that insurance is complicated to buy. And another mistake that we made, I think, was underestimating the difficulties of people purchasing insurance online and shopping for a lot of options with a lot of costs and lot of different benefits and plans and -- and somehow expecting that that would be very smooth, and then they’ve also got to try to apply for tax credits on the website.

“What we’re doing even as we’re trying to solve the technical problems is also what can we do to make the application a little bit simpler? What can we do to make it in English as opposed to bureaucrat-ese? Are there steps that we can skip while still getting the core information that people need?

Advertisement

“And part of what we’re realizing is that there are going to be a certain portion of people who are just going to need more help and more hand-holding in the application process....

“And you know, buying health insurance is never going to be like buying a song on iTunes. You know, it’s just a much more complicated transaction.”

6. On whether the website problems will be fixed by the end of the month, as promised:

”...On Dec. 1st, Nov. 30th, it will be a lot better, but there will still be some problems. Some of those will not be because of technological problems, although I’m sure that there will still be some glitches that have to be smoothed out.”

Advertisement

7. And, finally--in my view, a bit disingenuously--on why he can’t catch a break:

“Part of this job is, the things that go right, you guys aren’t going to write about. The things that go wrong get prominent attention; that’s how it’s always been. That’s not unique to me as president, and I’m up to the challenge. We’re going to get this done, all right?”

Peters', 'Jonathan Weisman']",Senate Action on Health Law Moves to Brink of Shutdown,"WASHINGTON — The Senate is expected to reject decisively a House bill that would delay the full effect of President Obama’s health care law as a condition for keeping the government running past Monday, as Senator Harry Reid, the Democratic majority leader, expressed confidence that he had public opinion on his side.

Angering Republicans who lead the House, Mr. Reid kept the Senate shuttered on Sunday, in a calculated move to stall action on the House measure until Monday afternoon, just hours before the government’s spending authority runs out at midnight.

Without a complete capitulation by House Republicans, large sections of the government would close, hundreds of thousands of workers would be furloughed without pay, and millions more would be asked to work for no pay.

Polls show that the public is already deeply unhappy with its leaders in Congress, and the prospect of the first government shutdown in 17 years would be the latest dispiriting development. With a temporary shutdown appearing inevitable without a last-ditch compromise, the battle on Sunday became as much about blaming the other side as searching for a solution."

1. All Americans, even those with pre-existing conditions, should have access to affordable health insurance

2. All Americans, even those currently healthy, should be required (or induced) to buy insurance to spread the risks as broadly as possible to keep the costs reasonable

3. There should be subsidiess to prevent the ""mandate"" from becoming too onerous, so that the cost of premiums as a share of income can be held down.

As to whether this approach can work, despite the Republican predictions that it will fail, we of course have the example of Romneycare in Massachusetts (based, I remind people, largely on a proposal from the Right-leaning Heritage Foundation). Krugman then explores whether larger starters with significant numbers of uninsured can duplicate what happened in the Bay State.

The answer to this question depends, in the first place, on whether insurance companies are willing to offer coverage at reasonable rates. And the answer, so far, is a clear “yes.” In California, insurers came in with bids running significantly below expectations; in New York, it appears that premiums will be cut roughly in half.

apologies, but the latter link counts against your monthly quota from the NYTimes, so you might not be able to see it.

Krugman offers two paragraphs that frame the issue succinctly. In the first he writes



Over all, then, health reform will help millions of Americans who were previously either too sick or too poor to get the coverage they needed, and also offer a great deal of reassurance to millions more who currently have insurance but fear losing it; it will provide these benefits at the expense of a much smaller number of other Americans, mostly the very well off. It is, if you like, a plan to comfort the afflicted while (slightly) afflicting the comfortable.

So far the American people do not yet fully grasp that the vast majority of them will be better off with respect to medical insurance without being hit directly financially by the cost of premiums. A small number of better off Americans will wind up paying somewhat more. If the American people understand this, attempting to sabotage Obamacare will have serious political implications for Republicans.

There is also another problem for the GOP:



And the prospect that such a plan might succeed is anathema to a party whose whole philosophy is built around doing just the opposite, of taking from the “takers” and giving to the “job creators,” known to the rest of us as the “rich.” Hence the brinkmanship.

Krugman is very blunt about that philosophy, but then, we can remember a certain presidential candidate who complained about he 47% who are takers.

brinkmanship - the willingness of the Republicans, particularly among their tea party caucus members in the House, to risk shutting down the government and crashing the economy in order to prevent the success of Obamacare,

when their own leaders have admitted that confrontations over the budget inflict substantial harm on the economy.

It will not be because of fear of what is now a rapidly falling budget deficit.

Nor, Krugman opines, will it be because they true believe that the slashing of federal spending will actually lead to increased prosperity.



No, Republicans may be willing to risk economic and financial crisis solely in order to deny essential health care and financial security to millions of their fellow Americans. Let’s hear it for their noble cause!

Let me if I may explain just a bit what that noble cause is, paraphrasing well-known words of the first (and greatest) Republican President:

Government of the wealthy, by the Republicans, for the corporations

Anything that might threaten that paradigm is to be fought fiercely

- that includes suppressing the votes of those who might vote for a different paradigm

- that means fomenting fear and hatred on issues like guns in order to gin up an angry mob to vote against their own economic interests

- that includes gerrymandering to minimize the impact of votes of the masses of people who either do not agree with their paradigm or who may not be able to be misled by the promotion of fear and hatred

It is the mentality of the American Colonel who said in Vietnam that in order to save the village we had to destroy it.

It is the petulance of the child who if he can't have his way wants to take the ball and go home, even if someone else brought the ball.

If you wonder why the House Republicans have now voted almost 40 times to try to kill Obamacare, it is because if it succeeds, not only will they not be able to roll it back, but it also undercuts any arguments about the other social programs that for half a century or more they have tried to kill - Medicare, Medicaid and most of all Social Security.

Panic is the right words to describe Republican actions towards Obamacare.

Petulance is another appropriate description.

Which is why the White House and the Democrats have to hold firm

- for the health (physical and economic) of the American people

- for the future (economic and political) of the United States."
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/07/08/republicans-challenge-authority-to-delay-ignore-obamacare-provision/,2013-07-08 00:00:00,[],"Republicans challenge authority to delay, 'ignore' ObamaCare provision","House Republicans are escalating their scrutiny of the decision to delay a key part of the health care overhaul, questioning whether the Obama administration even has the authority to ""ignore the law"" without the approval of Congress.

The administration announced early last week that it was delaying by one year a requirement that large employers offer access to health insurance. Officials described the delay as a common-sense concession to businesses who complained the rules were too onerous, and maintained the Treasury Department was within its right.

A Treasury official told FoxNews.com that the move was ""an exercise of the administrative authority"" under the IRS code. The official said the department has ""longstanding"" authority to ""grant transition relief when implementing new legislation"" like the health care law.

A number of Republicans pointed to the sudden change as a sign of problems to come with the massive health care law. But, as lawmakers return on Monday from the holiday break, they're also challenging whether the tweak was an abuse of power.

""This action raises a lot of questions about whether the Obama administration can simply ignore the law when it's convenient for them,"" Rep. Phil Roe, R-Tenn., said in a statement.

He said he's asked the Congressional Research Service to ""investigate"" that issue -- ""because I don't think any president has the authority to pick and choose what parts of law to follow.""

The matter will get an airing on Capitol Hill later this week. Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, chairman of a House Ways and Means subcommittee, has set a hearing for July 10 which, in part, will examine the issue of the administration's authority to change the law.

Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, went a step further, describing the move as ""another in a string of extra legal actions taken"" by the Obama administration.

The complaint about the administration's authority is just one of several Republicans have regarding the move to delay the mandate. They question whether more delays and changes are in store in the run-up to the Jan. 1 launch of many of the law's major provisions. They question why the so-called individual mandate -- the requirement on individuals to buy health insurance -- wasn't also delayed.

But the Treasury Department and White House, in announcing the delay last week, explained that they did so after businesses complained about the reporting requirements. As the administration moves to simplify the rules, they said, they would in turn give businesses more time to comply.

""We have heard concerns about the complexity of the requirements and the need for more time to implement them effectively. We recognize that the vast majority of businesses that will need to do this reporting already provide health insurance to their workers, and we want to make sure it is easy for others to do so,"" Mark J. Mazur, the assistant secretary for Tax Policy at the Department of the Treasury, said last week on the Treasury blog."

Statewide, 50% said they backed the Affordable Care Act and 42% opposed it, according to the USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll. That runs counter to national polls that show more people disapprove of Obamacare than support it.

Latinos, who make up about half of California’s uninsured population, were even more enthusiastic, supporting the healthcare law by a 2-1 margin. Forty-nine percent of whites were opposed, with 44% in favor.

Predictably, 77% of Democrats backed the president’s healthcare plan, whereas 80% of Republicans surveyed said they were against it. Independents were more evenly split.

Cutting across partisan and racial lines, Californians as a whole were skeptical that the Affordable Care Act would live up to its name.

Sixty-five percent of respondents said people wouldn’t be able to afford the health insurance they’ll be required to have under the law’s individual mandate. Forty percent think the program will have a negative effect on what they pay for coverage, compared with 21% who expect a positive outcome.

Advertisement

According to the survey, 46% of registered voters expect the Affordable Care Act to be a drag on the overall economy and 34% see an economic boost. Nearly 60% think the law’s new requirements will raise healthcare costs and keep businesses from hiring more workers.

The poll was taken just as the national healthcare rollout was coming under intense criticism in Congress, even from some Democrats. Obama has apologized for the malfunctioning healthcare.gov enrollment website and for millions of Americans receiving cancellation notices because their current coverage doesn’t meet all the requirements of the healthcare law.

Those consumers have directed much of their anger at Obama’s repeated pledge that Americans could keep their existing insurance if they liked it.

California is running its own insurance exchange, as are 13 other states, and its online enrollment hasn’t experienced nearly as many problems as the federal marketplace for 36 states. But the sticker shock from higher premiums and concerns about losing access to preferred doctors and hospitals have taken a toll.

“California has had a pretty good rollout on its exchange compared to the national one, but people here are still feeling the negative repercussions of higher costs and lost policies,” said David Kanevsky of American Viewpoint, the Republican firm that helped conduct the poll for the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences and The Times.

The poll was conducted jointly by American Viewpoint and Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research, a Democratic polling firm in Washington. They surveyed 1,503 registered state voters by telephone Oct. 30-Nov. 5. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points, and larger for subgroups.

For Obama and his signature law, much depends on Californians embracing the changes. California wants to enroll more than 2 million people by the end of next year in subsidized health insurance or an expansion of Medi-Cal, the state’s Medicaid program for the poor.

Poll respondents said they were upbeat about the law’s potential to help many of the state’s 7 million uninsured. Sixty-five percent expect there will be fewer people without coverage and 67% think patients will get more access to checkups and other preventive care.

Advertisement

“Fundamentally, Californians are viewing the Affordable Care Act as a mixed bag,” said Drew Lieberman of Greenberg Quinlan Rosner. “They harbor real concerns about the potential negative impact on costs and the economy.”

Diana Sackett, 61, a software engineer in Pleasanton, has many of those worries even though she strongly supports the president’s healthcare plan. She has battled cancer in the past and knows the value of quality health coverage. “In an advanced country like ours, everyone should be able to get the healthcare they need,” Sackett said.

Advertisement

But she isn’t optimistic that the healthcare law will stem the rising costs of medical care and fears it may even get worse with an influx of newly insured patients.

“I’m concerned it won’t really address the cost problems,” said Sackett, who pays for health insurance through her employer. “I think healthcare is still going to be pretty expensive.”

Advertisement

According to the poll, the changes are being implemented at a time when voters are generally satisfied with their own healthcare. Ninety percent of respondents said they were happy with the quality of their medical care and access to their doctors.

The state’s health insurance exchange, Covered California, also faces deep skepticism among its core audience.

Advertisement

Even uninsured Californians, who stand to benefit the most from the changes, were split. Forty-eight percent favored the law while 45% were against.

Individuals who now purchase their own policies were more negative. Forty-nine percent were opposed to the law and 44% said they were in favor.

Kathryn Davis, 29, an unemployed lab technician in San Diego, already had her doubts about Obamacare. Then she received a cancellation notice from her insurer, joining an estimated 1 million Californians who have received similar termination letters in recent weeks.

“It makes me angry I will be forced to purchase a new policy I don’t want, and fined if I don’t,” she said.

Advertisement

Davis said she paid $130 a month for a Blue Shield of California policy. On the state exchange, she saw a mid-level Silver plan from Blue Shield that would cost her $96 a month thanks to a federal subsidy of $187 a month based on her income.

Her annual deductible would decrease, and the coverage would be more comprehensive, including benefits such as maternity care. Even though it may be a better deal for her, Davis said she feared government spending on insurance subsidies would trigger huge tax increases.

California exchange officials say they are ramping up their marketing campaign this month to better explain the new insurance options and address some of the criticisms. People must enroll by Dec. 15 if they want coverage Jan. 1. Open enrollment in the exchange runs through March 31.

In the poll, 42% of respondents said they still didn’t have enough information about the healthcare law. Statewide, 50% of Latinos said they didn’t know enough about the overhaul.

Federico del Castillo, a 51-year-old Bellflower resident, said he couldn’t afford health insurance for himself while he searched for a new job in sales. His wife has coverage through her job, and his three young daughters are enrolled in a low-cost government program for children.

He said he’d heard about all the glitches with Obamacare, but he hoped it would make coverage affordable for him. He hears a lot of conflicting information about the program from neighbors and friends at church.

“Everyone is so confused,” Del Castillo said. “I don’t think most people are getting all the information they need.”

Someone comes for an appointment, and based on the level of detail I obtain in the history, the level of detail needed in physical examination, and the complexity of medical decision-making, that determines the fee for the visit. So as you can imagine, an ear infection or sore throat requires a LOT less work than managing three or more chronic problems, and the medications, labs, monitoring tests, etc. that go along with them. But again, you are paid the same to see the ear infection patient as you are to see the person with uncontrolled diabetes, high BP, and high cholesterol.

On the surface, that makes no sense at all, but the thinking is that it probably costs too much for the ear infection, too little for the diabetes/BP/cholesterol patient, but it all evens out in the long run. The rules for 'coding' a level of service for an appointment govern the fees, and they are relatively simple, as otherwise it would just be too complicated to have a different fee structure for every diagnosis. Anyway, the idea is that it all comes out in the wash. That might be true in a simple world, but of course we live in a complex world with a lot of moving parts.

As you can see, the fee-for-service environment does not really incentivize physicians to focus their efforts on chronic disease management. I'm not implying that physicians are not trying to do a good job or are just in it to make as much money as possible, but let's face it: if you make the same amount per patient, and you can see 30 patients with ear infections or 15 diabetic/hypertensive/hyperlipidemic patients, which would you choose? How would you set up your schedule?

Everyone agrees that prevention is the most cost-effective way to keep people healthy. Vaccines, for example, are arguably the single most cost-effective thing in all of medicine (get your flu vaccine if you have not already done so, by the way!). Preventative care is now covered without a co-pay because of the ACA. That is awesome. However, better care/control of chronic disease doesn't pay well, as discussed above. But better control of diabetes, of BP, of cholesterol, of COPD, of asthma, of heart failure will save lots and lots and lots of money in the long run because complications of all these diseases are expensive. It costs a LOT to be in the hospital, to have a heart bypass, to have dialysis, etc. A rough estimate is that a well-controlled diabetic costs the system an average of $4,000 per year to take care of, but an uncontrolled diabetic will cost $16,000 or more. So why would we pay doctors the same for an ear infection as we would to take care of serious chronic disease?

Part of the answer unfortunately is that people switch insurances and by the time they develop more significant complications, they are on Medicare anyway, so UHC, Humana, Anthem don't need to worry about paying for dialysis. In the long run, though, it saves us all money if we do a better job of taking care of chronic illness. So it makes sense to try to incentivize doctors to improve our chronic disease management instead of incentivizing doctors to just see as many patients as possible in the day.

So enough background. Here's the good stuff. The ACA provides funding and guidance for a new way to approach health care. The Comprehensive Primary Care initiative is a program that involves about 500 practices across the country, in several geographic areas. Southwest Ohio/N. KY, New Jersey, Arkansas, Colorado, New York, Oregon, and Oklahoma have participating practices. Practices were selected based on a number of factors, including past willingness to participate in such things as NCQA quality recognition, and patient-centered medical home (PCMH) certification. You can read more here: http://innovation.cms.gov/...

Basically, CMS (center for Medicare and Medicaid services) provides funding outside of the fee-for-service environment for practices to do a better job of chronic disease management. There is/was a detailed application process, and multiple milestones you have to meet, but a lot of it boils down to CMS providing additional monies for practices to use as they see fit in order to help improve the care for their patients, particularly (although not exclusively) those with higher risk chronic illness.

The whole thing is actually really interesting. While there are quite a lot of specifics, there are also a lot of areas open to interpretation. CMS is partnering with multiple private insurance carriers to provide a monthly fee (outside of any appointment or fee-for-service interaction) to physician practices in order to help those practices invest in infrastructure which will help improve patient care. The amount per patient per month is based on risk assessment. Basically, the more diagnoses, and the more complicated a patient is, the higher the monthly fee. A well-controlled diabetic would have a lower fee than a diabetic with chronic kidney disease, heart disease, and neuropathy. So right off the bat, you can see how this is a paradigm shift from the traditional fee-for-service environment. You may actually be paid more to take care of a more complicated person and try to keep them out of the hospital.

However, and this is a BIG part, the money from this CPC initiative can NOT be paid to physicians as compensation. It is to be used to improve infrastructure. This is actually pretty cool because instead of just paying doctors more and saying, ""hey, if we pay you more, you'll do a better job, right?"", CMS is saying, ""we will give you money to use as you see fit (within the structure of our program and its milestones) to improve patient care which should improve outcomes, decrease severe complication rates, improve patient satisfaction, and eventually decrease overall costs through an investment up front.""

If you hadn't already guessed, my group has several practices involved in the CPCI program and we are excited about it. I don't know what the other 490-some practices across the country are doing, but we have used the money to hire more staff, including what we call Care Coordinators for each office, an RN who can reach out to patients before, during and after appointments to see how we can better coordinate care. We try to have labs drawn before folks come for appointments, so we can have already reviewed the results before walking in the room. This allows for more efficient care. If someone's cholesterol is not to goal, for example, we can increase the dose of their cholesterol medication while sitting with them and explaining why an LDL goal of under 70 is the target. This works a lot better than a medical assistant calling someone and playing phone tag three days after their appointment to try to make sure they know that the new dose is 40 mg instead of 20. Anyway, the Care Coordinator can help reach out to people who might need help paying for meds and see what assistance programs might help someone. She can help someone who was recently in the hospital understand their new medication regimen and help set up their follow up. If someone doesn't go for the colonoscopy or mammogram that we ordered, she can call them and find out why and/or encourage them to go (and maybe mention that preventative care is covered 100% now!). She can review their chart ahead of time and put in a reminder for the doctor that the patient is due for a pneumonia vaccine or a shingles vaccine. This is all part of the team-based approach to care which is helping to improve patient outcomes. Our practice would not really been able to afford a Care Coordinator without the CPCI monies. Our group has also decided to hire a diabetes educator. Insurance is often squirrelly about paying for diabetes education, despite study after study clearly showing the benefits. Now we will be able to offer diabetes eduction free of charge to all of our patients. This is pretty great all around. The doctors get more help, the patients get more individualized attention and care, outcomes improve, which specifically means someone didn't have a stroke. Someone didn't lose their vision because of diabetes. Someone had a precancerous colon polyp removed instead of being diagnosed with metastatic cancer a couple years later. Someone's grandmother didn't lose her foot. Oh, and all that stuff also saves money.

That's the other piece of the CPCI, which is a multi-year venture: ""shared savings."" You can calculate how much a population of patients is likely to cost over say, three years, based on how sick they are. If people get their blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar, asthma under better control, they will cost less to take care of because they will have fewer ER visits, fewer hospitalizations, fewer procedures. Sure, they might take more medications, get more frequent lab tests, maybe more frequent (outpatient) doctor appointments, but this leads to an overall reduction of the cost of care. So for the additional work to do a better job of taking care of patients, practices in each region get a chance to share in the $$ saved by providing more efficient care. This will be calculated and distributed equally among the 75 or so practices in each region.

There's of course a lot more to the story, but this diary is already rather lengthy. I'm excited about the program though. It really is a win-win. It has a lot of the things that us progressives like: government-initiated innovation. Science-based (or to use the medical buzzword, evidence-based) care. Regulations on how the money can be used, with the greater good in mind. Short term investment for long term success (I didn't mention that the money is eventually phased out with the hope that the infrastructure improvements will lead to overall better reimbursements, and a focus on ""pay-for-performance"" or better pay for better quality care). Using government dollars to help those who need it most (ie sicker patients). Shared benefits in the long run for all of us. If we are all healthier, we cost less to the healthcare system. We are more productive workers. We have fewer people on disability. We end up putting more $$ back into the economy and indirectly increase government revenue (if you can work more and make more money because you are healthier, you end up paying more taxes and of course can purchase more goods and services).

Anyway, it's a relatively small part of the ACA, and unless you go to a practice involved in the CPCI, you likely would never hear about it. But in the long run, the idea is that the extra $$ will help to transform how we provide care, therefore leading to a sea change in primary care across the country. If you get better outcomes, improve patient satisfaction AND save money while practicing a certain way, every practice is going to want to adopt these methods. Over the next few years, the 500 practices will be sharing (HIPAA-compliant) data, successes and failures, to try to come up with ""best practices"" we can all use to keep people healthier longer. Because everyone benefits from that, and that is really what the Affordable Care Act is about."

Pugach doesn't see herself as upper-income by any stretch, but President Barack Obama's budget would raise her Medicare premiums and those of other comfortably retired seniors, adding to a surcharge that already costs some 2 million beneficiaries hundreds of dollars a year each.

More importantly, due to the creeping effects of inflation, 20 million Medicare beneficiaries would end up paying higher ""income related"" premiums for their outpatient and prescription coverage over time.

Administration officials say Obama's proposal will help improve the financial stability of Medicare by reducing taxpayer subsidies for retirees who can afford to pay a bigger share of costs. Congressional Republicans agree with the president on this one, making it highly likely the idea will become law if there's a budget deal this year.

But the way Pugach sees it, she's being penalized for prudence, dinged for saving diligently.

It was the government, she says, that pushed her into a higher income bracket where she'd have to pay additional Medicare premiums.

IRS rules require people age 70-and-a-half and older to make regular minimum withdrawals from tax-deferred retirement nest eggs like 401(k)s. That was enough to nudge her over Medicare's line.

""We were good soldiers when we were young,"" said Pugach, who worked as a computer systems analyst. ""I was afraid of not having money for retirement and I put in as much as I could. The consequence is now I have to pay about $500 a year more in Medicare premiums.""

Currently only about 1 in 20 Medicare beneficiaries pays the higher income-based premiums, which start at incomes over $85,000 for individuals and $170,000 for couples. As a reference point, the median or midpoint U.S. household income is about $53,000.

Obama's budget would change Medicare's upper-income premiums in several ways. First, it would raise the monthly amounts for those currently paying.

If the proposal were already law, Pugach would be paying about $168 a month for outpatient coverage under Medicare's Part B, instead of $146.90.

Then, the plan would create five new income brackets to squeeze more revenue from the top tiers of retirees.

But its biggest impact would come through inflation.

The administration is proposing to extend a freeze on the income brackets at which seniors are liable for the higher premiums until 1 in 4 retirees has to pay. It wouldn't be the top 5 percent anymore, but the top 25 percent.

""Over time, the higher premiums will affect people who by today's standards are considered middle-income,"" explained Tricia Neuman, vice president for Medicare policy at the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. ""At some point, it raises questions about whether (Medicare) premiums will continue to be affordable.""

Required withdrawals from retirement accounts would be the trigger for some of these retirees. For others it could be taking a part-time job.

One consequence could be political problems for Medicare. A growing group of beneficiaries might come together around a shared a sense of grievance.

""That's part of the problem with the premiums -- they simply act like a higher tax based on income,"" said David Certner, federal policy director for AARP, the seniors lobby.

""Means testing"" of Medicare benefits was introduced in 2007 under President George W. Bush in the form of higher outpatient premiums for the top-earning retirees. Obama's health care law expanded the policy and also added a surcharge for prescription coverage.

The latest proposal ramps up the reach of means testing and sets up a political confrontation between AARP and liberal groups on one side and fiscal conservatives on the other. The liberals have long argued that support for Medicare will be undermined if the program starts charging more for the well-to-do. Not only are higher-income people more likely to be politically active, they also tend to be in better health.

Fiscal conservatives say it makes no sense for government to provide the same generous subsidies to people who can afford to pay at least some of the cost themselves. As a rule, taxpayers pay for 75 percent of Medicare's outpatient and prescription benefits. Even millionaires would still get a 10 percent subsidy on their premiums under Obama's plan. Technically, both programs are voluntary.

""The government has to understand the difference between universal opportunity and universal subsidy,"" said David Walker, the former head of the congressional Government Accountability Office. ""This is a very modest step towards changing the government subsidy associated with Medicare's two voluntary programs.""

It still doesn't sit well with Sheila Pugach. She says she's been postponing remodeling work on her 58-year-old house because she's concerned about the cost. Having a convenient utility room so she doesn't have to go out to the garage to do laundry would help with her back problems.

""They think all old people are living the life of Riley,"" she said."

As another recent Politico news item reported, “Fix the Debt is ramping back up its lobbying efforts as government funding fights become the topic du jour on Capitol Hill.” Politico listed a group of Republican and Democratic politicians who “met Monday with Maya MacGuineas, head of the campaign, and members of the group’s CEO council and small business members.” [...] But can they really come to a deal? Tea Party Republicans are demanding Obamacare’s repeal in return for a budget deal. The President says he’ll refuse to negotiate. Things look hopelessly gridlocked. Look again. Boehner will want to give his party’s Tea Party wing something in return for dropping their futile Obamacare attacks, and entitlements would be the perfect prize. As for the president, in a terse conversation with Boehner on Friday he merely said “he wouldn’t negotiate with him on the debt limit,” according to Boehner’s office. The president and White House officials have consistently echoed the line taken last Sunday by presidential economic advisor Gene Sperling on a reporters’ call. “The President is not going to negotiate over the debt limit,” said Sperling. (emphasis ours) [...] And Republican Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma said this: “If we found $700 billion in savings from entitlements—Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security—it would relieve pressure on the Pentagon and on non-mandatory spending. All the cuts they need are there to avoid a possible shutdown.”

While the nation is being diverted by the antics of Sen. Ted ""Calgary"" Cruz , the deficit fetishists smell blood in the water. Budget fight? That means they have a chance to get those entitlement cuts that they've devoted their lives to, because while President Obama said he wouldn't negotiate on the debt limit, he said no such thing about resolving the budget crisis. The cuts to Social Security and Medicare he offered up in his budget are still on the table, and the catfood crowd sees their opportunity, Richard Eskow explains.So tempting for would-be compromisers among the Democrats, and so unnecessary. Republicans are well aware who is going to get the blame if the government shuts down, andare the ones over a barrel. Furthermore, a willingness to allow the Republicans to see this out would go some distance to convince the GOP that, yeah, there's no negotiating the debt ceiling.

Something else Democrats should think about: cuts to Social Security and Medicare are even more unpopular than a government shutdown would be. There's no need to go there. At all.

Join Daily Kos and CREDO in telling the Senate now is not the time to think about cuts to Social Security. Now is the time to support the Harkin and Begich plans to strengthen Social Security."

For starters, the effort has elicited something long missing on the part of this president -- some spine.

Ever since he stepped into the Rose Garden on October 1 to warn the Republicans that he simply wasn't prepared to negotiate while the government was shut down and default on the debt was threatened, we've seen a much tougher Obama. The split in the Republicans, meanwhile, continues to widen, with an ever-increasing backlash among party professionals against the nihilism of Ted Cruz and company. Poor John Boehner tacks back and forth between frantically trying to hold his coalition together and signaling that he'd be willing to suspend the Hastert Rule and allow pragmatic Republicans vote with Democrats to keep the government open.

Public opinion seems to be moving against the Republicans. The question is no longer whether they will continue their suicidal gambit but when they will cave and on what terms.

Weirdly, by threatening to shut the government unless Obama killed the Affordable Care act, they got the opposite of what they sought. The rest of the government is closed, and Obamacare is open for business.

And, while Republicans and movement conservatives have spent the better part of a year demonizing Obama's health reform, the more people become familiar with it, the more people will appreciate it -- leaving the Republican alarmism with no clothes. In that regard, the president and his strategists would do well to change one core piece of their rhetoric. In his Rose Garden remarks, the president said this:

Now, of course, if you're one of the 85 percent of Americans who already have health insurance, you don't need to do a thing. You're already benefiting from new benefits and protections that have been in place for some time under this law. But for the 15 percent of Americans who don't have health insurance, this opportunity is life-changing.

In fact, that's profoundly wrong, and weakens the president's case. The statistically accurate contention that 85 percent of people will have no change in their insurance is a throwback to the early days of the health reform debate, when focus groups suggested that people who had employer-provided insurance and liked it needed to be reassured.

But a lot has changed since then. Employer coverage is eroding. People who lose jobs or change jobs typically lose their insurance. COBRA protection paid entirely by the former worker is only a temporary and largely unaffordable stopgap.

The fact is that the Affordable Care Act helps a lot more the 15 percent of the population. Young adults with no employer-provided insurance (and their parents) already know how valuable Obamacare is, for allowing people under age 26 to stay on their parents' insurance. People without jobs and at risk of losing jobs are also coming to value the Affordable Care Act.

There is an analogy here with the revolution in broad acceptance of sexual diversity. As more and more gays and lesbians came out, straight people were initially shocked, then surprisingly accepting, as they realized that they had a friend, co-worker, neighbor, or family member who turned out to be gay.

As more and more people sign up for affordable insurance thanks to Obama Care, many Americans who have insurance (and many who are worried about losing it) will hear heart-rending firsthand stories about friends, colleagues and relatives with medical worries, who finally get insurance. That coalition is a lot more than 15 percent.

Many of these people, incidentally, are in red states, where the percentage of the uninsured tends to be far higher than the national average. In several such states, Republican governors have broken ranks and signed their states up for the provision of the Affordable Care Act that has the Federal government finance nearly all the costs of expanded Medicaid.

No wonder the Republicans are so desperate to kill Obamacare in utero. The more it takes effect, the more their hysteria will be proven to be a phony. By 2014, when the Republican House majority will present itself for re-election, the Affordable Care Act could be quite popular. What then?

President Obama, increasingly, finds himself in the chips. Let's see if this time he can resist the impulse to fold a winning hand.

The three-year anniversary of the signing of the bloated government grab is tomorrow, and what better time to point out its massive failures and punitive complications than after it is too late to do anything about it?

In the media’s defense, some of the failures being reported on now weren’t apparent in 2009 and 2010, but that’s not my complaint. My complaint — and what should be America’s complaint — is where was this kind of scrutiny and reporting when this terrible bill was being gamed through the all-Democrat federal government?

As we all know, skeptical, forward-looking media analysis of ObamaCare was pretty much non-existent back then. We also know that those who did read the bill and report on its real and potential horrors (through New Media and in Townhall meetings) were demonized by the media.

Rather than report on the devilish details or laugh Democrats out of office for submitting fraudulent ObamaCare budgets to the CBO so the monstrosity could be called “deficit neutral,” the media instead played State Pipe Organ and focused on all the “goodies.”

In the meantime, out here in the real world and contrary to all those cotton candy promises the media assured us would come true, insurers facing all kinds of restrictions and a glut of sick people have boosted our health care premiums, and companies everywhere are cutting back employee work hours to avoid being forced to provide insurance. Moreover, contrary to Obama’s biggest promise, people are losing their insurance because companies would prefer to pay the fine than for the Cadillac plans ObamaCare demands.

And how can one even begin to count the number of individual ObamaCare horror stories that dribble out almost daily, not from the ObamaMedia, naturally — but from conservative media sites like Drudge? We’re about to face a terrifying shortage of physicians and heaven only knows what this means.

But if you believe in the philosophy of better-late-than-never, Politico actually summoned a little moral courage Friday morning. One of its morning leads takes a fairly in-depth look at how the bill remains unpopular and the massive uphill battle the government faces (money and tech) to get the ObamaCare pieces in place by October, when people are supposed to start signing up. (ObamaCare’s insurance exchanges and most punishing mandates hit early next year.)

Here’s Wednesday’s Wonk Blog at the Washington Post:

Last week I posted a copy of the draft application for Obamacare benefits, which clocks in at a hefty 21 pages.

Consumer advocates and Wonkblog commenters had similar questions: Why on earth would the federal government create such a complex form to obtain a public benefit?

You don’t have to spend much time with the chart to get that, it’s really not simple at all.

And Wednesday’s New York Times:

‘Our revenues are about $8 million, but the food business is a low-margin industry so cutting $108,000 out of our profits, which are just over $200,000, is a big deal,’ said Ms. Shein, who is the chief executive. They are evaluating different ways to comply with the new law and finance the expense.

You get my point. But if you don’t, Sean Hannity has a terrific round-up here.

Over at Investors Business Daily, they’ve come up with “10 Disturbing Facts Americans Have Learned” about ObamaCare over the last three years.

A better title might have been “10 Disturbing Facts About ObamaCare the Media Are Still Covering Up.”

Regardless, “disturbing” is a kind word when you’re talking about skyrocketing premium costs, losing your employer-based insurance, having your hours cut back, and nearly a trillion in new tax hikes that will hit the middle class.

The damage Obama, Democrats, the media, and the Supreme Court have done to this country is impossible to wrap your mind around. How did so many become so corrupted that they gleefully aided and abetted the likely destruction of our most vital and successful institution: the imperfect but still amazing American health care system?

And God help us; it is just getting started.

http://news.yahoo.com/democrats-scramble-to--fix--obama-s-trouble-health-care-law-213354029.html,,[],Democrats scramble to fix Obama's troubled health care law,"Democrats aren’t running through the halls of Congress with their hair on fire yet, but anxiety over the possible blowback from the federal health care law is growing by the day.

Between the disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov and the fact that millions of Americans are poised to lose their current health insurance coverage at the end of the year despite a promise from President Barack Obama that they would be able to keep their plans “no matter what,” congressional Democrats are scrambling to cover their hides before next year’s midterm elections.

A handful of Senate Democrats have leapt to support a proposal from Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu, who's facing a tough re-election campaign in 2014, that would allow Americans with already existing insurance plans to keep them even if they don’t meet the quality guidelines established by the Affordable Care Act.



House Democrats on Wednesday held a closed-door meeting with White House officials, where some members vented frustration with the administration over the law's handling and demanded a solution by the end of the week.



Republicans, not surprisingly, are working to leverage the Obamacare problems for political gain.

In a speech on the Senate floor last week, Landrieu suggested that she had been misled when she voted for the Affordable Care Act in 2010.

""When we passed the Affordable Care Act, we did so with the intention that if you liked your health plan, you could keep it,"" she said. ""A promise was made, and this legislation will ensure that this promise is kept.""

It's hard to see how that would be the case, given that millions of Americans at the time who were insured on private plans held policies that did not meet the minimum requirements set by the law. (Many Republicans at the time warned that this would be a consequence.)

So far, Sens. Kay Hagan of North Carolina, Jeff Merkley of Oregon, Mark Pryor of Arkansas, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Dianne Feinstein of California have co-sponsored Landrieu's proposal. Hagan, Merkley and Pryor are up for re-election next year while Feinstein and Manchin are not.



On Wednesday, another lawmaker facing re-election in 2014, Colorado Democratic Sen. Mark Udall, introduced his own legislation that would allow Americans facing cancellations to keep their current plan for up to two years.

Story continues

Landrieu and Udall's cause received a kick-start earlier this week when former President Bill Clinton, who has long advocated in favor of the health care law, said he thought the law should be changed to let people keep their current plans.

“I personally believe — even if it takes a change in the law — the president should honor the commitment the federal government made to those people and let them keep what they got,” Clinton said in an interview with the website Ozy.com.

These new Democratic efforts to “fix” Obamacare, however, could actually prove disastrous for the law.

The Department of Health and Human Services has already struggled to persuade people to sign up for insurance plans through the federal exchanges. Despite Obama’s oft-repeated promise, allowing people to keep their existing plans could suck millions of potential customers out of the exchanges — customers the law relies on to remain sustainable.

Neither the White House nor Senate Democatic Leader Harry Reid have taken a position on the Democratic senators' proposals.

On Wednesday, Reid said he planned to hold a rare Thursday meeting with all Senate Democrats and White House officials to consider the new proposals. Reid declined to comment on anything related to health care during his weekly press conference, saying he would have more details after Thursday’s meeting.

At the White House, press secretary Jay Carney said the president is looking into “options.”

“The president has instructed his team to come up with options for him to review,” Carney told reporters on Wednesday. “And you can expect a decision from him and announcement from him sooner rather than later on options that we can take to address the problem that we've been discussing here with regards to those individuals who have had their individual insurance plans cancelled because of the transition to the Affordable Care Act marketplaces.""

Senate Republicans appeared positively gleeful about the Demorats’ efforts to change the law.

Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell suggested he would not support Landrieu’s bill if it came for a vote.

“We think the thing ought to be repealed and replaced entirely. We think it can’t possibly work,” McConnell said. “And I’m somewhat suspicious about red state Democrats who are up in ’14 trying to promote some way out of their political dilemma. If they really want to fix Obamacare, they will join with us, repeal it and start over step by step to deal with the problem, which was the number of people uninsured.”

In the House, Republican Rep. Fred Upton, the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, has unveiled his own proposal to allow people to stay on their current plans. House Republican leaders have scheduled a vote on the bill for Friday, and it is expected to pass with at least some Democratic support.

Meanwhile, House Republican committee chairmen continue to hammer away at federal officials and private contractors responsible for the law's implementation.

The House Oversight and Reform Committee on Wednesday, for instance, hauled in IT specialists working to fix the website for a hearing about their progress.

Under questioning, the panel reported that the federal government had already spent “north of $600 million” on the project as of late September and even more during the repair process.

Despite more than three years of lead time and $400 million to $600 million in taxpayer money, the government can’t seem to deliver something that is bread and butter to the average online retailer.

Of course, the task is much more complex with health care, and there are plenty of excuses: poor coordination among technology contractors, shifting goals for the design of HealthCare.gov, the need to coordinate between federal and state governments. But these challenges are hardly unprecedented. Based on our experience in the public and private sectors, we’ve concluded that the core problem is that the federal government lacks many of the basic skills private firms rely on.

Over the past three decades, fierce global competition has forced corporate America to modernize how it manages projects so that they can be delivered as efficiently as possible. The federal government, insulated from market pressures, has fallen badly behind. In government, managerial jobs — such as chief financial officers, technology officers and procurement executives — are considered the least glamorous, a poor second to policymaking and politics.

Civil servants who manage government programs are judged by their ability to expand their departments, in terms of the number of employees and the size of their budgets. Most people who work in government are committed to their mission, so they naturally want their programs to grow bigger and do more. There is seldom much personal benefit, in pay or promotion, for a manager who delivers services at the same quality for lower cost. There are few thank-yous for simplifying Web sites or delivering faster, better service. Managers are actually penalized for being more efficient: If an agency saves money, its budget will most likely be reduced the following year.

And the media pounces on mistakes, but when the government accomplishes something skillfully — such as the smooth launch of the new GI Bill Web site, which provides education benefits to nearly 1 million veterans — few reporters take notice.

The malfunctioning HealthCare.gov is simply the latest in a long series of problems for large, complex government technology projects. The price tag of the Coast Guard’s project to modernize its fleet ballooned from $17 billion to $29 billion because of cost overruns, oversight failures and massive contracting flaws. The Homeland Security Department’s multibillion-dollar initiative to develop an electronic “virtual” fence along the border with Mexico has been halted after software and contractor problems. A four-year effort to integrate service-member files between the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Defense Department has been plagued by delays and dysfunction. And the IRS’s decades-long effort to improve electronic filing of tax returns and issue refunds faster is several years behind schedule and vastly over budget.

Altogether, these failures cost taxpayers tens of billions of dollars. In the end, the problems usually turn out to be not technical but related to procurement, incentive structures, the way objectives are defined, and the management of schedules and costs. Most congressional “oversight” focuses on pinning political blame rather than improving how programs are executed.

More perniciously, repeated failure reinforces a belief — widely promoted by the right wing of the Republican Party — that government cannot do anything right. If we lose faith in the idea that our nation can collectively accomplish great things, talented young people who could be interested in government will take their technical or administrative skills to the private sector, where they will be better appreciated and better paid.

There are three steps the government should take to restore Americans’ confidence in its ability to get things done. First, we need more and better incentives for workers. President Obama has said he wants to make working in government “cool again.” For that to happen, the hot opportunities must be in the managerial ranks, not just in policy positions. We need to train our civil servants how to be managers. And managers and their programs should benefit directly from improvements in efficiency. “Gainsharing,” or letting a department keep a portion of any savings to spend the next fiscal year, is one technique; another is to mimic some U.S. cities that have introduced individual and team bonuses for successful reforms. Managers also need greater flexibility to reallocate resources.

Second, the federal bureaucracy should consolidate programs with similar missions. The Government Accountability Office has provided a blueprint of hundreds of programs that should be considered. For example, there are dozens of programs serving veterans that, in many cases, duplicate efforts and make it harder for states to help men and women who have served.

In a related step, government programs should make performance targets more meaningful. We should understand which of the programs that we fund year in and year out actually work, prune the poor performers and be willing to experiment with new approaches. Right now, objective evaluation succumbs to finger-pointing among different agencies.

Third, the federal government needs to align its systems and processes to work better with state and local governments, which disperse more than a quarter of all federal money. The lack of coordination with state governments has been a particular problem in the launch of the federal health insurance exchange. The success of the ACA will vary considerably from state to state, and states with the fewest insured residents — Texas, for example — are likely to lag behind in providing care for their populations.

More broadly, state governments, most of which must by law balance their budgets every year by July 1, are at the constant mercy of federal budgeting — which, inexplicably, is supposed to be set by Oct. 1. In recent years, budgeting has been especially uncertain as Congress lurched from crisis to crisis, passing only temporary funding measures.

Poor management is undermining public trust in our government. It makes it hard for departments to run programs effectively and for citizens to have faith in our leaders. Starting with Congress, our elected officials need to change the attitude in Washington to one that values and rewards efficient government.

Updated 4 p.m. ET, 11/15/2013

(CNN) - The House approved Republican legislation on Friday giving health insurers the option of extending plans through 2014 that would otherwise be canceled for not complying with Affordable Care Act standards.

The bill, approved 261-157, would also allow new customers to enroll in those plans. Thirty-nine Democrats crossed party lines and joined a nearly unanimous GOP caucus in voting for the measure proposed by Rep. Fred Upton, R-Michigan.



It has little to no chance of clearing the Democratic-controlled Senate, however.

The White House has also indicated President Barack Obama would veto the measure if it reaches his desk, saying the Republican plan would undermine the integrity of the law aimed at providing health coverage to millions of Americans without it.

The Senate is taking a wait-and-see attitude about possible legislation over the politically charged insurance cancellations after Obama ordered administrative steps on Thursday to address the matter.

Obama's signature domestic policy initiative has been marred by the disastrous launch of the HealthCare.gov website, which allows consumers to buy new health plans online, and by the policy cancellations.

Both problems have put congressional Democrats in a difficult political position since the Affordable Care Act was approved in 2010 with no Republican support and signed by Obama, a Democratic president.

Earlier, the House rejected a similar plan offered by Democrats, but it was more restrictive than the Republican measure and therefore not supported by the majority.

Separately, Obama sat down with insurance company executives on Friday at the White House.

Prior to the meeting, the President said that he and his administration would brainstorm with and solicit ideas from industry on how to smoothly carry out the changes he is making to the Affordable Care Act.

Obama said there would be a ""collaborative process"" around his proposal to reverse insurance plan cancellations due to broader coverage requirements under the sweeping law.

""We want to make sure that we get this done,"" Obama said."
http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/26/politics/shutdown-showdown/index.html,2013-09-26 00:00:00,['Tom Cohen'],Boehner signals GOP focus now on debt ceiling,"Story highlights NEW: The White House rejects a one-year delay in implementing Obamacare House GOP leaders to Obama: talk to us The Senate is expected to restore Obamacare funding to a House spending plan Without a spending deal, the government faces a shutdown next week

(CNN) —

With a possible government shutdown in five days, House Speaker John Boehner on Thursday signaled a shift in Republican tactics with the focus now on negotiating a compromise on raising the federal debt ceiling next month instead of a short-term spending plan now.

He and other GOP leaders called on President Barack Obama to negotiate an agreement with them to increase how much the government can borrow to pay its bills in exchange for concessions they seek such as delaying the implementation of Obamacare.

However, Obama later made clear that he rejected any political bartering on the debt ceiling.

“I will not negotiate on anything when it comes to the full faith and credit of the United States of America,” he said.

It is one of two potential showdowns embroiling Congress as deadlines loom to fund the government before the end of the current fiscal year on Monday, as well as increasing the debt ceiling by October 17.

The Democratic-led Senate is considering a spending plan sent over by the Republican-led House that makes continued government funding contingent on eliminating all money for Obamacare.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid says his caucus will restore the funding for the Affordable Care Act, the signature legislation of Obama’s first term that was passed by Democrats and upheld by the Supreme Court.

The spending measure would then go back to the House with time running out to act before a shutdown begins on Tuesday.

Fed up over Beltway shutdown battle

GOP battle line moving to debt ceiling

At a news conference after meeting with his GOP caucus, Boehner indicated the House might further revise the Senate’s version of the spending plan, but he also told reporters that he didn’t expect a government shutdown to happen.

Instead, he and other House GOP leaders focused on the debt ceiling, with Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia citing a Bloomberg poll Thursday that showed a strong majority support a compromise on the debt ceiling instead of simply increasing it without spending cuts or other steps.

“They don’t want a government shutdown, but they are tired of the debt and they want to make sure that this president sits down and negotiates with us a resolution to this problem,” Cantor said. “So we call on the president now to sit down with us, Harry Reid to sit down with us, and let’s solve the problem. This plan of more debt and no reform is absolutely unacceptable.”

Cantor confirmed that a House proposal to raise the debt ceiling would include a one-year delay in the full implementation of Obamacare, as well as other provisions from measures passed by House Republicans but ignored by the Senate such as building the Keystone oil pipeline from Canada.

To Obama, such an offer amounts to trying to “blackmail a president into giving them some concessions on issues that have nothing to do with the budget,” he said in a speech in Maryland on Obamacare.

White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters a one-year delay in implementing Obamacare’s individual mandate for people to obtain health insurance would undermine a key provision of the program that prohibits the denial of coverage due to pre-existing conditions.

“The fact is you have to make the system work,” Carney said, adding people with pre-existing conditions won’t be denied insurance under Obamacare “because of the expansion of the number of people who will be covered and participate in these marketplaces provided by the Affordable Care Act through the individual mandate.”

CNN Chief National Correspondent John King said Thursday that focusing on the debt ceiling was where House Republicans “wanted to wage this fight all along.”

“They didn’t want to get bogged down in the government shutdown fight, but a conservative revolt within the House Republican ranks forced them to get there,” King said.

How this affects you

Conservative backlash

However, some conservative House Republicans emerging from a meeting Thursday with Boehner said they won’t simply accept the Senate’s version of the spending plan needed to avoid a shutdown. They also expressed reservations about the proposal outlined by Boehner and Cantor for raising the debt ceiling.

Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama said the GOP leadership’s plan on the debt ceiling would extend it until after next year’s congressional election and include provisions sought by Republicans, but he complained it didn’t cut spending enough to satisfy him. Brooks also said the debt ceiling issue should be part of the election debate next year.

Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said this week the debt ceiling must be raised by October 17, or the government may not have enough money to pay all of its bills.

Analysts warn of severe economic impact in that case. A similar bout of congressional brinksmanship over the debt ceiling in 2011 led to the first-ever downgrade of the U.S. credit rating.

Obama cited that potential harm to a still sluggish recovery on Thursday, saying the world looked to America for economic leadership and stability.

“You don’t mess with that,” he said to cheers in Maryland.

However, King said the president previously negotiated on the need to increase how much the federal government can borrow to meet its obligations, such as in the 2011 showdown that led to deep spending cuts sought by Republicans.

“The Republicans think that is safer ground politically. The question is, can they actually get anything from the president?” King said.

Noting Obama has previously accused Republicans of having an unreasonable “my way or the highway” stance, he said the GOP can now accuse the president of doing the same thing by refusing to negotiate on the debt ceiling.

Senate spending plan

In the Senate, tea party conservatives led by GOP Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas reversed themselves on Wednesday by joining colleagues from both parties in a 100-0 procedural vote to take up the House spending plan expected to be revised to fund Obamacare.

Cruz supported the move after he spent more than 21 straight hours railing against any government money for the health care reforms.

The rare unanimous vote on a procedural step signaled that Senate Democrats would be able to amend the plan to restore the Obamacare funding.

On Thursday, Reid made clear that if the House then made further changes to the revised spending proposal sent back by the Senate, it would cause at least a short-term government shutdown because of the time it would take the Senate to reconsider the measure.

Cruz had led a group of tea party conservatives in trying to block Senate consideration of the spending legislation.

However, he came under strong criticism from fellow Republicans including Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and other influential veterans such as Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Bob Corker of Tennessee for that strategy, which called for GOP senators to filibuster the House measure that – in its original form – would defund programs under the Affordable Care Act.

The Obamacare question

Corker told CNN on Wednesday that a better idea would be to get the bill back to the House as soon as possible so the Republican majority there can offer a compromise.

“House members are already talking about how they might respond if the defunding component ends up being stripped out,” Corker said, adding he hoped that the Senate would “give the House some time to respond in a thoughtful way.”

With Obamacare markets for the uninsured set to open on October 1, which also begins the new fiscal year, GOP opponents consider this their last best chance to undermine or amend the health care reforms.

What happens in a government shutdown

GOP infighting over how best to prevent a government shutdown while defunding Obamacare escalated this week as McConnell publicly dismissed Cruz’s more confrontational strategy.

Cruz’s GOP critics believe his strategy is politically suicidal, arguing there is no way to stop Obamacare as long as Democrats maintain control of the Senate and Obama is in the White House.

They believe that trying to do so by forcing a shutdown – or preventing an increase in the debt ceiling next month – will backfire by harming the economy and damaging the Republican brand.

House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) yielded to his right flank by agreeing to attach the healthcare law repeal to a must-pass bill to keep the government funded past Sept. 30. A vote is expected Friday on a bill that would allow the government to stay open for the next few months.

The measure is all but certain to pass the Republican-led House, but faces rejection in the Senate, where the Democratic majority has shown little interest in undoing Obama’s signature domestic achievement.

Without a resolution by Oct. 1, the start of the new federal fiscal year, the government will run out of money to keep federal workers on the job and provide basic services.

Boehner and his leadership team had tried to avoid a prolonged battle over government funding, but the speaker saw no other option after the most conservative House members revolted last week.

“Every member in this room is for defunding Obamacare,” Boehner told his colleagues in a private meeting in the Capitol basement, according to a source in the room. “We’re going to send it over to the Senate, so our conservative allies over there can continue the fight.”

Top Republicans worry the party will be blamed if government services are interrupted, much the way the party suffered during the last shutdowns in the mid-1990s. They were hoping to hold off the fight over repealing the healthcare law until next month, when Obama may be forced to bargain in exchange for the administration’s request to raise the debt limit to borrow money to avoid defaulting on the nation’s bills.

But many rank-and-file Republicans believe stopping the healthcare law is their constituents’ top priority.

“We’re doing what the American people are asking us to do,” said third-term Rep. Marlin Stutzman (R-Ind.). “I think now is the time. You take the best opportunity that you have.”

Rep. Tom Graves (R-Ga.), among those leading the fight, said, “I think over the next 12 days there’s going to be a strong argument from the American people saying this is the path forward.”

Polls show more Americans oppose the law, the Affordable Care Act, than support it, even as the online health insurance marketplaces are set to open Oct. 1. Obama on Wednesday asked the Business Roundtable, an organization of top business leaders, to use its influence to encourage lawmakers to “not promise apocalypse every three months.”

“I think this is the time for us to say once and for all we can’t afford these kinds of plays,” Obama said. “I know the American people are tired of it. I’m tired of it, and I suspect you’re tired of it too.”

A similar message was sent to Capitol Hill from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which warned that it was “not in the best interest of the U.S. business community or the American people to risk even a brief government shutdown.”

The fight to keep the government running is the first in series of choke points this fall that Republicans intend to use to pressure Obama since they have failed repeatedly to stop the healthcare law.

Advertisement

By mid-October, Congress will be asked to raise the debt limit, and Republican leaders are gearing up to demand a one-year delay of the healthcare law as part of any deal with the White House. The funding bill, if approved, would keep the government open through Dec. 15.

How Congress will handle the Sept. 30 deadline for a government funding resolution remains an open question.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) will probably ask Democrats to strip the healthcare law repeal from the resolution, but Republicans in the Senate will be under enormous pressure to prevent that.

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), a potential presidential contender who has been a vocal opponent of the healthcare law, and other conservative senators are being urged by their House colleagues to mount a round-the-clock filibuster, if needed, to thwart Democrats.

The senator, however, did not appear to promise heroics as he acknowledged Reid probably had enough votes. But Cruz’s spokesman said “all options remain on the table.”

Intensifying the threat of a shutdown, Boehner does not appear to have a backup plan if the Senate sends the funding bill back to the House without the healthcare law repeal.

Many House Republicans appear unprepared for that scenario, which could unfold late next week. Others, such as Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R-Kan.), insisted they would not vote for a bill that did not kill the healthcare law.

“This is the line in the sand,” he said.

Boehner may need to rely on Democrats to help pass the bill, which he has been increasingly reluctant to do because it could threaten his already shaky hold over his Republican majority.

Each week offers new cause for alarm: whether a dysfunctional website rife with opportunity for security breaches, health care cancellation notices, or sharp increases in health care premiums, ObamaCare has quickly devolved into a political third rail for the Democratic party.

Out of the ashes of ObamaCare, however, rises a golden opportunity for the Republican party – so long as the GOP’s leadership has the presence of mind to grasp the full implications of this historic moment.

[pullquote]

As President Obama’s approval ratings sink, Republicans have a narrow window of opportunity to begin the process of rebranding themselves as true defenders of the middle class.

And boy, do they need it. Though aligned with most Americans in opposition to ObamaCare, Republicans are sinking deeper and deeper into a hole of their own digging.

No matter how hard they try to align themselves with a majority of Americans, Republicans simply aren’t connecting with the middle class, who view them as a party of “old, rich, white men,” or “the party of ‘no.’” These perceptions are reflected in recent poll numbers, which show GOP approval ratings hovering below 30%.

As someone who manages brands for a living, I can assert with confidence that all successful brands stand for something. It is not enough to merely be against something, no matter how unpopular that “something” is. All durable brands are associated with at least one positive attribute in the minds of consumers - or in this case, voters.

That is certainly not the case for the GOP right now.

Americans want leadership on the issue of health care, and they will reject politicians who delay the hard work of problem-solving.

As such, the GOP’s anti-ObamaCare rhetoric has gone stale. Republicans must abandon their “party of ‘no’” moniker, by sharing their vision of what “no” should be replaced with. In other words, Republicans must explain to voters what they stand for, as well as what they’re against.

A party that controls only one chamber of the legislative branch cannot make public policy. But the House GOP can facilitate the collapse of ObamaCare by aligning Republicans with the interests of hardworking Americans, and forcing Democrats to side with the special interest groups that are poised to profit from them.

In order for this to work, actions taken by the House GOP should be accompanied by simple, straightforward messaging, so that voters can connect with the Republican narrative on a visceral level.

Visceral connections require visceral emotions -- and only two things stoke the ire of Americans as deeply as Congress: trial lawyers and insurance companies. If Republicans leverage this antipathy to their advantage, Democrats will find themselves in the unenviable position of being defenders of both.

The House should pass two bills, recognizing that Frosty the Snowman has better prospects on a Hawaiian vacation than these bills do of ever becoming law. Nonetheless, they will set the stage for Republicans to become day-saving heroes for most voters on the issue of health care.

First, the House should pass a tort reform bill aimed at reducing medical malpractice premiums, for the sole purpose of reducing health care costs. GOP messaging points should target trial lawyers, framing them as special interest groups, explaining how they’ve influenced the architects of ObamaCare and how they plan to profit from it.

Concurrently, Republicans should explain how tort reform would decrease doctors’ costs of doing business, and how those savings would be passed on to hardworking Americans.

A few weeks later, the House should pass another bill permitting interstate competition for health insurance companies.

Doing so would force Democrats to defend ObamaCare’s protection of these quasi monopolies.

GOP messaging should highlight Democrats’ crony capitalism at the expense of free-market competition and individual choice.

ObamaCare is a “teachable moment” in this regard. Americans will always choose freedom and choice over being told what to do, so long as Republicans connect the dots for them.

Will these two bills and messaging points represent all that is needed to repair the GOP’s brand? Absolutely not. There is far more work to be done on that front.

But these initial efforts represent a meaningful first step in the right direction: one that recasts Republicans as defenders of the middle class, rather than merely an unpalatable alternative to the left."

The first vote was to amend the Senate continuing resolution, or CR, with the repeal of the medical device tax.

That passed by a vote of 248 to 174.

17 Democrats defected from the party line:

Ron Barber (AZ-02)

Bill Owens (NY-21)

Scott Peters (CA-52)

Nick Rahall (WV-03)

Brad Schneider (IL-10)

Kyrsten Sinema (AZ-09)

In the next vote, the House voted to amend the Senate's CR with a one-year delay in implementation of provisions of the Affordable Care Act like the health care marketplaces and the individual mandate.

That passed by a vote of 231 to 192.

Two Republicans defected from party line: Chris Gibson (NY-19) and Richard Hanna (NY-22).

Two Democrats defected from party line: Jim Matheson (UT-04) and Mike McIntyre (NC-07).

Keep in mind that both Matheson and McIntyre are on the DCCC's Front Line, so the $$$s they collect by fundraising off this vote will go to the two Democrats who voted with GOP to shut down the government.

Many members of the DCCC Front Line, all of whom face tight races, voted against both of these measures. John Tierney (MA-06) and Carol Shea-Porter (NH-01) come to mind as examples of some of the better names on the Front Line. So those who voted for them have no excuses.

And honestly, the Democratic Party would be better off by cutting funds from party deadwood and making actual efforts to win blue seats held by Republicans like those of Pete King and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. However, Steve Israel's friendship with King and DWS's friendship with Ileana are perpetual roadblocks.

In addition, the House also unanimously voted to continue appropriations for military pay in the event of a government shutdown."

Washington (CNN) – Red state-blue state governors Rick Perry and Martin O’Malley debated job creation and healthcare on Wednesday, with Perry equating adding people to Medicaid via Obamacare with “putting tens of thousands on the Titanic knowing how it’s going to turn out.”

Both men are thought to be contenders for the White House in 2016 and on CNN’s “Crossfire,” they aired out some of the key issues that are likely to define their campaigns should they run.



Perry has been noncommittal about his plans to pursue the Republican nomination for a second time after the Texas governor’s campaign imploded last year. He showed none of the hesitation of 2012 on Wednesday night however, hammering home points about Texas job creation through limited government policies.

Ex-advisers hint at future as Perry announces exit as governor

When challenged on the disproportionately large number of minimum wage jobs created in Texas along with the large number of Texans without health insurance, Perry stuck to his talking points.

“We’re about giving people freedom,” Perry said, the freedom to have a job and the freedom to choose whether or not they have health insurance.

Perry continually cited the businesses that have set up shop in Texas, including Amazon, Facebook and Toyota.

“They didn’t come there if they were worried about whether or not there was not going to be a skilled workforce, or people were going to have healthcare,” Perry said.

Perry and O’Malley clashed most sharply over jobs, in large part spurred by Perry’s media outreach aimed at poaching Maryland businesses.

In response to Texas’ business-friendly environment, O’Malley fell back on job-creation language coined by President Barack Obama.

Rather than Texas policies that seem to disproportionately create minimum wage jobs, Maryland has chosen to focus on “building an economy from the middle out,” O’Malley said, via things like improving education.

2016 watch: O'Malley New Hampshire bound

O’Malley, a Democrat, told Perry that Texas is “not an economy that is actually lifting up the middle class.”

The two came at their different positions with radically different statistics and perspectives.

O’Malley spoke of talent creation and entrepreneurship encouraged in Maryland while Perry trumpeted improving education standards and the various options Texans have for healthcare, although he didn’t elaborate.

Texas and Maryland have also taken polar opposite views on the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, Obama’s signature legislative achievement better known as Obamacare.

O’Malley has continued to hold up Maryland’s early adoption of Obamacare while Perry has refused federal money to expand Medicaid via the healthcare law.

Perry argued that expanding Medicaid and embracing Obamacare would ultimately end up costing Texas $100 billion.

Putting “tens of thousands of people on a system that is broken,” Perry said of adding them to Medicaid, is akin to “putting tens of thousands on the Titanic knowing how it’s going to turn out.”

In turn, O’Malley argued that the flexibility of the Obamacare healthcare exchanges that get underway next month, regardless of the inevitable hiccups in the system, will offer Maryland workers a competitive advantage – allowing them to move from job to job without worrying about losing their health insurance."

He Joined Fnc In As A Senior White House Correspondent.']","Cost of ObamaCare subsidies has increased dramatically, critics say","The cost of subsidies for those seeking government aid through ObamaCare has increased dramatically, critics say – even before a single dollar has been collected.

Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah wrote a letter to the administration asking why the president is already requesting 107 percent more than three years ago to pay for subsidies.

""They low-balled everything, and they knew they were not asking for enough money to actually do this,"" John Goodman of the National Center for Policy Analysis said. ""And so now they are coming along saying: 'Oh, we've just discovered we don't have enough money'. They should’ve known that from day one.""

""I don’t think most of America will be shocked that a government project is coming in over budget,"" Jim Capretta of the American Enterprise Institute said. ""It’s the typical story and so yeah it's probably happening in this case as well.""

The remarks followed by days the administration’s announcement it was easing requirements on those seeking government aid through ObamaCare, making it easier to apply for subsidies.

White House spokesman Jay Carney portrayed it as another example of flexibility.

""We have made clear all along when it comes to working with states that we are flexible with the way that they implement the Affordable Care Act,"" he said.

The Department of Health and Human Services quietly announced Friday it was tweaking the rules requiring those seeking federal aid for insurance coverage to prove they actually need the help.

Under the law, those seeking subsidies are supposed to have incomes no higher than 400 percent of the federal poverty line. Further, they can't have access to affordable insurance through their jobs.

The administration looked to the newly created ""exchanges"" -- a blend of federal- and-state run insurance marketplaces -- to verify those facts. Originally, the administration wanted to launch random checks to verify whether applicants got insurance through their jobs, and to individually verify everyone's income level.

But Reuters reports that the new rules released on Friday will give 16 states -- as well as the District of Columbia -- a pass for now on the employer-insurance verification. For those states, which are launching their own exchanges, the federal government will give them until 2015 to start random checks. The exchanges themselves launch at the beginning of 2014.

Last week the administration also announced it was delaying until 2015 a requirement that businesses employing 50 or more workers provide access to insurance.

On ""Fox News Sunday,"" critics and supporters took very different views of the effect of that delay.

""What it's doing to keep employers from bringing on any kind of employee,"" said Republican Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee. ""It's been very damaging. And I think just moving it back a year is not going to undo the uncertainty that people have.""

But Democratic Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island said, ""the vast majority of companies in this category provide health care already and they'll continue to so. But I think given the potential confusion, postponing it, not eliminating it, but postponing it for a year makes sense.""

""They do it because they want to attract the best workers,"" said Ron Pollack of Families USA, a backer of the health care law said. ""And workers are likely to be attracted to a company if you provide good benefits and good wages."""

But then, about five years ago, Buffett said at Georgetown, he and Gates began plotting about philanthropy and now they have enrolled 115 plutocrats pledging a majority of their net worth.

“I’ve been dialing for dollars,” he said, adding that when billionaires resist, he gives them a warning: “If I’m talking to some 70-year-old, I say, ‘Do you really think your decision-making ability is going to be better when you’re 95 with some blonde on your lap, or now?’ ”

Chris Christie will agree to expand the state’s Medicaid program under Obamacare on Tuesday.

According to the Newark, NJ-based Star-Ledger, Christie will announce the expansion when he unveils the governor’s new budget in a 3 p.m. speech to a joint session of New Jersey’s Legislature on Tuesday.

Christie joins Florida’s Rick Scott and Virginia’s Bob McDonnell as two Republican governors who have completely reversed course on the issue after rejecting addition Medicaid funds.

As recently as last summer, Christie had suggested that he would refuse the Medicaid expansion. As he told Fox & Friends in July: “Medicaid is pretty well expanded in our state already because of the legacy of previous Democratic governors. So, I don’t think there’s a lot for us to do in New Jersey in that regard.”

Likewise, McDonnell had said in July: “Expanding Medicaid without fixing Medicaid is a terrible idea.”

Christie and McDonnell were both elected in 2009 in the first wave of Tea Party-supported Republican campaigns. McDonnell is leaving office after this year; Christie is widely favored to win re-election.

State Sen. Joe Vitale, a Democrat who is chairman of the New Jersey Senate committee that deals with health care, told the Associated Press that he “had been briefed” on Christie’s decision. Health advocacy groups also said they were told by Christie’s staff of the decision that will cover 300,000 uninsured people in New Jersey.

The Supreme Court, in its Obamacare ruling last year, made Medicaid expansion, which was mandatory in the Obamacare law, optional for the states. However, the federal government attempted to encourage the states to participate by offering to pay 100% of the cost for the first three years, and 90% of the costs thereafter, provided Medicaid eligibility is expanded to include those living within 133% of the poverty line.

In essence, states that accept the federal government’s deal will have the short-term costs subsidized by federal taxpayers. The Star-Ledger notes that New Jersey is expected to receive “$1.7 billion a year” to cover the initial costs. A recent Government Accountability Office report predicted that Obamacare would add $6.2 trillion to the long-term federal deficit.

According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 22 states, including the District of Columbia, have now agreed to the Medicaid expansion. Seven of those states are governed by Republicans.

Though once a conservative hero for his tough stances on the state budget and his willingness to confront New Jersey’s public sector unions, Christie has fallen from grace. In late October, he offered effusive praise for President Barack Obama’s handling of Hurricane Sandy, though all Obama had done was visit the area briefly. Many residents are still struggling to rebuild, and face numerous obstacles, including the federal bureaucracy.

In California, state officials have released premium rates so residents can figure what they'll pay for coverage if they buy insurance through the exchange there. Same in Indiana. And Ohio, Colorado, Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Vermont and Washington.

People will see huge price spikes in some of those states. People will save money in others.

And what will happen in Illinois? Big hike? Big cut? That's a mystery.

State officials have submitted proposed insurance plans and rates to the federal government, but they won't reveal the numbers to the public. The feds won't either.

So people are left, for now, to guess.

Illinois officials once expected that as many as 16 insurers would sell some 250 health plans via the exchange. But only six insurers, including the state's largest, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois, have signed up. They will offer 165 insurance plans. UnitedHealthcare, the state's second-largest insurer, decided not to participate.

Does the relative lack of competition, the absence of a big player like UnitedHealthcare and the Obamacare demands for certain coverages mean that Illinois rates will be higher than they are now?

Sounds like a real possibility. But Illinois officials won't say if bad news is coming. Maybe they're waiting for the PR firm that was awarded a $35 million contract last month to promote the Illinois exchange to get up to spin speed.

We're getting a sense of what will happen in other states. California officials say some people will pay as much as 29 percent below the current market rate for coverage. New York says people will pay at least 53 percent less than they do now for comparable plans. But Florida warns that consumers who buy individual policies will pay 30 to 40 percent more. Ohio says people should brace for an average 41 percent jump.

In Illinois ... silence.

It's time for Illinois health care officials to clue in the rest of us. What will health coverage cost here?"

USA TODAY

With the government reopened and the debt ceiling dispute deferred, President Obama and his team now face another big story this month: The error-ridden rollout Oct. 1 of the new health care law.

Treasury Secretary Jack Lew went on NBC's Meet The Press on Sunday to say that officials are working around the clock on website problems that are preventing people from signing up for health care exchanges.

""I think that there's no one more frustrated than the president at the difficulty in the website,"" Lew said.

Obama himself plans to discuss the challenges Monday at what the White House is billing as a ""health care event.""

USA TODAY reported that ""the federal health care exchange was built using 10-year-old technology that may require constant fixes and updates for the next six months and the eventual overhaul of the entire system.""

On Meet The Press, Lew said that ""the huge outpouring of interest shows how important it is that we get this right. There are millions of Americans who want health insurance. It's important for our economy for them to have health insurance.""

The ""real test,"" the Treasury secretary said, comes in January, when officials learn how many people are enrolled in health care exchanges, and the quality of care that they're receiving.

Said Lew: ""If we get that right, everyone will regret that the early weeks were choppy on the website — but the test is, are people getting coverage and are they getting the care that they need? And we're confident we're going to be on track to do that.""

In the meantime, congressional Republicans who opposed the 2010 law known as Obamacare are spotlighting its early problems.

The office of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., sent out an e-mail Sunday featuring a June 7 quote from Obama: ""I think it's important for us to recognize and acknowledge this is working the way it's supposed to.""

Appearing on CBS' Face The Nation, McConnell said Obamacare is ""the worst piece of legislation passed in the last half century ... we need to get rid of it."""
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/09/28/senate-advances-controversial-obamacare-budget-bill/,2013-09-28 00:00:00,[],What Now? Budget bill heads to House after Senate restores ObamaCare $$,"House Republican leaders heading into a rare weekend session struggled with a tough choice after Senate Democrats succeeded in passing a ""clean"" budget bill which, contrary to GOP wishes, restores funding for ObamaCare.

The Senate, capping a dramatic week on Capitol Hill, approved the bill on Friday, after Democrats stripped a Republican-backed provision to defund the health law. The final vote was 54-44.

The House is expected to take up the legislation starting on Saturday, and the bill is seen by some lawmakers as a sort of legislative hot potato. If the two chambers cannot agree on a final bill by midnight on Monday, then the government will shut down. Neither side wants to be left holding the bill if that happens.

House Speaker John Boehner could, theoretically, just call up the Senate-passed bill and rely on mostly Democrats to pass it. But House Republicans are under heavy pressure, now, from fellow conservatives to stand by their demand that ObamaCare be defunded, or least delayed.

A group of 62 conservative Republican lawmakers emerged late Friday with a proposed amendment to the spending bill that would delay the entire health care law for a year. Rep. Tom Graves, R-Ga., said he plans to introduce the amendment when the House considers the funding bill.

""This approach was developed over several meetings with House Republicans, with a goal of keeping our conference unified, as we continue working to keep the government open and protect our constituents from the harmful effects of ObamaCare,” Graves said in a statement.

Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who staged an unsuccessful effort to stall the bill in the Senate, predicted the House would restore anti-ObamaCare provisions -- and urged Senate Republicans to unite with them. ""Today, far too many Republicans joined Harry Reid in giving the Democrats the ability to fund ObamaCare,"" he said.

Boehner signaled he will not accept the Senate-passed bill in its current form. If the bill is altered in any way, it will have to return to the Senate for yet another vote.

""The House will take action that reflects the fundamental fact that Americans don't want a government shutdown and they don't want the train wreck that is ObamaCare,"" spokesman Brendan Buck said in a statement.

But President Obama, during remarks at the White House, warned Republicans not to go down that road.

""(Undoing ObamaCare is) not gonna happen,"" Obama said. ""House Republicans will have to decide whether to join the Senate and keep the government open, or shut it down because they can't get their way. ... This grandstanding has real effects on real people.""

Obama also warned Republicans to back down on threats to tie an increase in the debt ceiling to other demands, claiming a U.S. default would cause an ""economic shutdown.""

Should Republicans stand by their anti-ObamaCare demands, Democrats have launched an aggressive campaign to pre-emptively blame them for a government shutdown. During a post-vote press conference, Senate Democrats displayed a countdown clock to the ""Republican government shutdown.""

""I don't know of anyone who wants to shut down the government. The only thing we want to shut down is ObamaCare,"" Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said.

Amid the fighting, federal agencies are warning about the impact of the looming shutdown. The Pentagon warned Friday that as many as 400,000 civilian workers could be furloughed. Military personnel are not subject to furlough and would continue to work, for the time being, without pay.

Democrats used the doomsday scenarios to pressure Republicans into backing down.

""We've passed the only bill that can avert a government shutdown Monday night. I've said this on the floor -- I say it again: This is it,"" Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid said.

Earlier Friday, Reid narrowly won approval to restore funding for ObamaCare. The 54-44 vote fell along party lines.

That was after the Senate voted 79-19 on the initial version of the bill, which in its original form would keep the government open while defunding ObamaCare. Several Republicans joined Democrats in voting ""yes"" on that vote, ignoring appeals by Cruz and other conservatives to stall the bill.

The first roll call had put Republicans in a difficult position, and prompted a very-public spate of infighting. Tea Party-aligned Republicans like Cruz, who staged a 21-hour anti-ObamaCare speech on the Senate floor this week, argued that Republicans should stop this bill in its tracks. Though the bill technically defunded ObamaCare -- which Cruz and his colleagues wanted -- they argued that since Reid would restore the funding, they should vote ""no.""

A number of Republicans rejected this logic.

""I don't understand how I can otherwise vote on a matter that I want to see passed,"" Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said. (Click to see the vote breakdown.)

Though the test vote put Senate Republicans in a tricky spot, the bigger question is what House Republicans will do next.

If Republicans stand by their demand that ObamaCare be defunded, delayed or otherwise undermined, then the two chambers could easily be at an impasse by midnight on Monday.

Tempers and rhetoric were heated on Friday as Democrats accused their Republican colleagues of playing with legislative fire.

""We are at one of the most dangerous points in our history right now -- every bit as dangerous as the break-up of the Union before the Civil War,"" said Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa.

But Republicans are treating their push to defund ObamaCare with urgency, in part because a key part of the law is set to go into effect next week.

""ObamaCare is the biggest job killer in the country,"" Cruz said."

According to insurers and the White house, delaying the deadline could undermine efforts to lure a broad, young and healthy mix of consumers to the market. That would end up costing insurers, and possibly taxpayers, money.

The case against delay was outlined in a memo circulated to lawmakers by the insurance lobby last week. The document from America’s Health Insurance Plans warned that delay could have a “destabilizing effect on insurance markets, resulting in higher premiums and coverage disruptions for individuals and families.”

For now, the administration is sticking with the insurers. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius on Wednesday called delaying the tax penalties for those who miss the deadline premature. Testifying before a House committee, Sebelius said she was confident the site would be running smoothly by the end of November, giving consumers four months to enroll easily online before the deadline of March 31.

President Obama made the case in Boston, where he argued that the model for his healthcare law — the 2006 Massachusetts law that then-Gov. Mitt Romney pushed through — experienced a similarly slow rollout and went on to success.

There is more than policy keeping the administration from pursuing what some contend is a simple fix. House Republicans have long pushed to delay the mandate. Any concession on the point would hand another “I told you so” moment to the GOP only weeks after the White House and Democrats watched the government shut down rather than agree to Republicans’ demands to suspend the mandate for a year.

Still, the politics of the issue could change quickly as Democrats face pressure to show they are responding to public frustration with the website. Ten Democratic senators have signed a letter asking the White House to extend the date beyond March 31 — six of those are up for reelection in 2014.

Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) said an extended enrollment was merely a fair way to make up for a website rollout she labeled a “disaster.” Millions of people have been shut out of the site intended to link consumers with private health plans. “That is unacceptable; consumers should not pay a penalty because a website did not work,” Shaheen wrote in an op-ed published Wednesday in USA Today.

Advocates for the extension note that the administration has already pushed back the date by six weeks in an attempt to align mismatched deadlines outlined during the rule-making process. Another limited extension is unlikely to change consumer behavior much, some experts opposed to a delay concede.

“To change sends a message: Don’t worry about signing up quickly. So there is an impact, but it depends a lot on how long an extension it is,” said Linda Blumberg, a health policy expert at the Urban Institute.

Blumberg said it was too soon to know whether an extension was necessary. Any decision should come only after insurers know who is signing up and whether they are seeing too many sick customers to deliver on the premiums they’ve promised. There are two major provisions already built into the law to help insurers adjust for risk pools, she said.

Obama advisors made similar arguments. Extending the enrollment period by a few months or a year increases the possibility that people won’t sign up until they’re too sick, increasing the costs for everyone else, said Chris Jennings, a former advisor to President Clinton now working on Obamacare implementation.

Enforcing the requirements for insurers without enforcing those for individuals would compound the destabilizing effect, Jennings said.

“No one will sell you house insurance when your house is on fire,” he said. “If you want to ban discrimination against people with preexisting conditions, then you have to have everyone in the pool. That’s why you need the individual responsibility requirement.”

Critics of the president’s law are reviving the push to undo the mandate. Romney issued a statement Wednesday suggesting a number of changes, including “carefully phasing it in to avoid the type of disruptions we are seeing nationally.”

In support of the Obama plan, some former Romney advisors have stepped forward to counsel patience through what they suggest is just a rocky beginning.

The law ramped up slowly in Massachusetts, said Jonathan Gruber, an MIT economist who has advised Romney and Obama on healthcare reform.

In the first month of enrollment in 2006, he said, only 123 enrollees from the premium-paying population — comparable to the group using the marketplaces created by the Affordable Care Act — signed up. That represented fewer than 1% of those who eventually signed up within the enrollment period.

“The fact that people aren’t signed up now for a policy they can’t even get until January, and which they’re not mandated to have until March, is not at all interesting or important,” Gruber said on a White House conference call held as Obama prepared to travel to Boston. “What matters is the fact that it will ramp up, and it will ramp up over time.”

The arc of enrollment in Massachusetts suggests that the deadline itself plays an important role, he said.

As the program neared the deadline, he said, “you saw an enormous increase in healthy people signing up.”

In their push on Capitol Hill, insurers are arguing that the March 31 date is crucial to the assumptions they used in developing the premiums they are offering at healthcare.gov.

According to America’s Health Insurance Plans, the industry group, changing these “vital enrollment incentives” would mean the premiums that health plans filed for next year would have to increase to account for fewer young and healthy people signing up for coverage. Insurers must determine the premiums for 2015 in April, a deadline that would be hard to meet without knowing who had signed up in 2014.

“Extending the open enrollment period would also drive up the 2015 premium rates,” the group’s document says, “as health plans would have to start submitting premiums to regulators before knowing who is enrolled in their insurance plans.”

(CNN) —

They are the numbers we’ve all been waiting for and House Republicans have unsuccessfully tried to get out of the Obama administration.

This week, the Department of Health and Human Services will reveal how many people purchased policies on the federal Obamacare exchange website.

Technical failures have plagued HealthCare.gov since its October 1 launch, although officials say it’s slowly getting better.

White House spokesman Jay Carney says enrollment numbers “will be lower than we hoped and we anticipated.”

Democrats losing patience with Obamacare

Just how low and what effect all of those online roadblocks had on enrollment remain to be seen.

But what will the numbers mean about the health of Obamacare?

Q: How many people need to enroll?

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that 24 million people will purchase insurance through an exchange by 2023, but just seven million will enroll during the initial sign-up window ending March 31.

CBO’s estimate includes customers on both state-based and federally run insurance exchanges, but not individuals who enroll in Medicaid.

If that number is spread evenly over the course of the open enrollment period, 1.16 million people would need to purchase insurance each month in order for the administration to be on pace to reach the seven million figure in six months.

But officials both in and out of government are quick to point out that enrollment is unlikely to occur at an even pace.

Pro-Obamacare group raises $27 million for outreach

To make that case, President Barack Obama recently traveled to Massachusetts where then-Gov. Mitt Romney enacted similar health care reforms in 2006.

“Enrollment was extremely slow, within a month only about a hundred people had signed up,” the President told a crowd in Boston in late October, recounting data from the state’s first open-enrollment period. “But then, 2,000 had signed up, and then a few more thousand after that. And by the end of the year, 36,000 people had signed up.”

On CNN the day after the President’s trip, MIT economist Jon Gruber, a former health care adviser to both Romney and Obama, argued that the first month’s numbers aren’t that useful in estimating the pace of enrollment.

“The key deadline here is March 31, that’s when people have to have insurance to avoid the individual mandate,” Gruber said of the deadline for avoiding a financial penalty for not having any health coverage. “That’s still months away.”

A consumer behavior expert said the slow pace of enrollment early could be attributed to buying habits.

Michael McCall, consumer psychology professor at Ithaca College, compared it to paying rent or a mortgage when it’s due, rather than before a bill is received. Until payment is submitted, the door remains open to back out or make changes.

“Once I pay, I’ve kind of made that commitment,” McCall added.

Arguably more important than the overall enrollment number is the diversity of the new customer pool.

The administration is working to ensure that 40% of those on the new exchanges are relatively healthy between 18 and 35.

“Part of the challenge is to make sure that the exchanges are able to attract a broad cross section of people, sick people and healthier young people so that the coverage is affordable,” said Drew Altman, president and CEO of the Kaiser Family Foundation.

An unbalanced insurance pool could cause insurers to increase monthly premiums or pull out of the exchanges altogether in future years.

Clinton: Obama should honor commitments on keeping health plans

What about Medicaid enrollees?

Customers whose income falls below a certain threshold are automatically referred to their state’s Medicaid program. The Affordable Care Act offers subsidies to states to increase Medicaid qualification to 138% of the federal poverty level, and 25 states and the District of Columbia have taken up the federal offer so far.

If your state has opted to expand Medicaid, you’ll likely be referred to your state’s welfare agency if you make less than $15,800 and are seeking coverage as an individual, or $32,500 if you’re seeking it for a family of four.

The CBO estimates that nine million people will enroll in Medicaid and its partner initiative for children, the Children’s Health Insurance Program, by 2014. According to this estimate, that number will increase to 13 million by 2023.

Media report: Fewer than 50,000 signed up for Obamacare

What if my state didn’t expand Medicaid?

The authors of the ACA intended Medicaid expansion to be mandatory, but a Supreme Court decision in 2010 ruled the federal government couldn’t require expansion of a state-run program. This decision led 25 states to opt out.

If you make less than the federal poverty level, you will be referred to your state Medicaid agency to see if you qualify for benefits under the current law, regardless of whether your state has expanded Medicaid or not.

According to a study by the Kaiser Foundation, only four states that didn’t expand Medicaid offer benefits to parents with incomes up to the federal poverty level, and only Wisconsin offers benefits to adults without children.

If your state chose not to expand its Medicaid program, you can still purchase insurance on the exchange, but you might not qualify for a premium subsidy.

Federal subsidies kick in for those with income above 100% of the federal poverty level.

Due to the Supreme Court decision and the structure of the law, a large group of low-income Americans won’t qualify for Medicaid in their state, but will earn less than the federal poverty level, meaning they won’t qualify for any federal subsidies. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, roughly five million people will fall into this Medicaid coverage gap.

What does “enroll” mean, anyway?

Regardless of whether you’re signing up on HealthCare.gov or one of the state-run exchanges, there are several steps in the enrollment process.

You must first create an account and enter in some personal information, including your Social Security number and an estimate of your annual income.

This information is then verified through the federal data hub with various government agencies, such as the Social Security Administration and the Internal Revenue Service.

Then you’ll either be presented with the plans available in your coverage area and an estimate for what those plans will cost after any federal subsidy is factored in, or you’ll be told you qualify for Medicaid and referred to your state’s Medicaid agency.

If you’re eligible to purchase a plan on the exchange, you can compare the plans available to find one that best fits your budget and coverage needs.

Many insurance companies and state-based exchanges don’t classify customers as officially enrolled until they’ve paid their first premium. Others will count people as enrolled once they’ve selected a plan.

A spokeswoman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services confirmed Tuesday that the numbers the government plans to announce will reveal how many consumers have completed an application and selected a plan, not necessarily how many have paid.

Consumers have until December 15 to pay if they want coverage beginning on January 1, or until March 31 if they simply want to avoid paying the penalty for not having insurance.

According to CNN’s tally, at least 54,700 people have paid for insurance on the state-based exchanges, but many more have made it partially through the process, completing an application and selecting a plan.

Various news outlets have reported that fewer than 50,000 people have signed up and paid for new private insurance plans through the federal marketplace, HealthCare.gov. Neither the Department of Health and Human Services nor officials at CMS would confirm those numbers."
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/09/heritage-debt-ceiling_n_4070242.html,2013-10-09 00:00:00,['Global Editorial Director'],Heritage Action Bails On Debt Ceiling Fight,"WASHINGTON -- A crack appeared Wednesday morning in the conservatives' united front against President Barack Obama in the budget-and-borrowing crisis of 2013.

Michael Needham, CEO of the powerful group Heritage Action, said that he opposed conditioning a crucial vote to increase the government's borrowing authority on the group's main goal: defunding Obamacare.

Under questioning at a breakfast with reporters, hosted by the Christian Science Monitor, Needham, a product of the Stanford Business School, conceded that failure to raise the debt ceiling would indeed disrupt the global economy.

""I'm sure the markets will react negatively,"" he said, even if, as he suggested was possible, the Treasury could ""prioritize"" interest payments to foreign bondholders.

Rather than try to hold the debt ceiling vote hostage to the defunding of Obamacare, he said, the better ""tactical"" course for Heritage and other key foes of the administration is to continue to focus on annual spending -- and on allowing the full opening of government only if Obamacare is dismantled.

""No, we should raise the debt limit,"" he said, though he added that he would oppose an increase that extends until after the 2014 election, which is Obama's preferred outcome.

But with regards to the government shutdown, Needham insisted that his group would continue to oppose any continuing resolution -- no matter how short in duration -- that did not defund the health care law.

""My tactic is to focus on the CR,"" he said.

Matt Kibbe, the president and CEO of the influential conservative group FreedomWorks, also said in a Wednesday interview with The Huffington Post that the debt ceiling should be raised in order to keep the Obamacare fight focused on the continuing resolution.

""This is an emerging set of opinions that looks to be where everybody's gravitating to,"" he said.

Heritage Action, funded by small donors, corporate allies and wealthy individuals Needham refused to name -- other than the Koch Brothers, who he said had given $500,000 -- has become a powerhouse in a new generation of conservative groups.

It operates on a model developed by Evangelical activists, producing informative -- and politically inflammatory -- ""scorecards"" that rate lawmakers' ideological purity based on their many votes.

The group organized a series of public events and town halls this summer to oppose Obamacare, which the group regards as the next camel's nose under the tent of a bankrupt entitlement state.

Needham thinks that Social Security needs ""fundamental"" change and that other entitlement programs are unfairly burdening Millennials.

But he indicated at the Wednesday breakfast that his disdain for Obamacare did not extend to the debt ceiling vote.

That could give Obama and House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) at least a smidgen of room to maneuver if and when they decide to strike an overall deal: the White House could get a ""clean"" debt ceiling vote (though of short duration) and the GOP could get a concession or two on the continuing resolution to fund the government's annual spending."

So said conservatives of Chief Justice John Roberts when he rescued the Affordable Care Act (ACA) — a.k.a. Obamacare — from being found unconstitutional.

But the manner in which he did this may have made the ACA unworkable, thereby putting it on a path to ultimate extinction.

This plausible judgment comes from professor Thomas A. Lambert of the University of Missouri Law School, writing in Regulation, a quarterly publication of the libertarian Cato Institute.

The crucial decision, he says, was four liberal justices joining Roberts’s opinion declaring that the ACA’s penalty for not complying with the mandate to purchase health insurance is actually a tax on not purchasing it. With this reasoning, the court severely limited the ability of the new health-care regime to cope with its own predictable consequences.

What was supposed to be, constitutionally, the dispositive question turned out not to be. Conservatives said that the mandate — the requirement that people engage in commerce by purchasing health insurance — exceeded Congress’s enumerated power to regulate interstate commerce. Liberals ridiculed this argument, noting that since the judicial revolution wrought during the New Deal, courts have given vast deference to Congress regarding that power. The ridicule stopped when five justices, including Roberts, agreed with the conservative argument.

This did not, however, doom the ACA because Roberts invoked what Lambert calls “a longstanding interpretive canon that calls for the court, if possible, to interpret statutes in a way that preserves their constitutionality.” Roberts did this by ruling that what Congress called a “penalty” for not obeying the mandate was really a tax on noncompliance.

This must, Lambert thinks, have momentous — and deleterious — implications for the functioning of the ACA. The problems arise from the interplay of two ACA provisions — “guaranteed issue” and “community rating.”

The former forbids insurance companies from denying coverage because of a person’s preexisting health condition. The latter, says Lambert, requires insurers to price premiums “solely on the basis of age, smoker status, and geographic area, without charging higher premiums to sick people or those susceptible to sickness.”

The point of the penalty to enforce the mandate was to prevent healthy people — particularly healthy young people — from declining to purchase insurance, or dropping their insurance, which would leave an insured pool of mostly old and infirm people. This would cause the cost of insurance premiums to soar, making it more and more sensible for the healthy to pay the ACA tax, which is much less than the price of insurance.

Roberts noted that a person earning $35,000 a year would pay a $60 monthly tax and someone earning $100,000 would pay $200. But the cost of a qualifying insurance policy is projected to be $400 a month. Clearly, it would be sensible to pay $60 or $200 rather than $400, because if one becomes ill, “guaranteed issue” assures coverage and “community rating” means that one’s illness will not result in higher insurance rates.

So, Lambert says, the ACA’s penalties are too low to prod the healthy to purchase insurance, even given ACA’s subsidies for purchasers. The ACA’s authors probably understood this perverse incentive and assumed that once Congress passed the ACA with penalties low enough to be politically palatable, Congress could increase them.

But Roberts’s decision limits Congress’s latitude by holding that the small size of the penalty is part of the reason it is, for constitutional purposes, a tax. It is not a “financial punishment” because it is not so steep that it effectively prohibits the choice of paying it. And, Roberts noted, “by statute, it can never be more.”As Lambert says, the penalty for refusing to purchase insurance counts as a tax only if it remains so small as to be largely ineffective.

Unable to increase penalties substantially, Congress, in the context of “guaranteed issue” and “community rating,” has only one way to induce healthy people to purchase insurance. This is by the hugely expensive process of increasing premium subsidies enough to make negligible the difference between the cost of insurance to purchasers and the penalty for not purchasing. Republicans will ferociously resist exacerbating the nation’s financial crisis in order to rescue the ACA.

Because the penalties are constitutionally limited by the reasoning whereby Roberts declared them taxes, he may have saved the ACA’s constitutionality by sacrificing its feasibility. So as the president begins his second term, the signature achievement of his first term looks remarkably rickety."

Businesses have complained about some of the provisions

Administration says it%27s listening to businesses

Change does not affect businesses with fewer than 50 employees

WASHINGTON —The Obama administration announced Tuesday it is delaying until 2015 the requirement that businesses with more than 50 employees provide health insurance to their workers or pay a penalty.

The announcement by the Internal Revenue Service comes after numerous complaints from businesses that the requirements were too complicated and difficult to implement in time.

Business groups, such as the National Retail Federation, praised the delay, while congressional Republicans jumped on the move to reiterate their opposition to the 2010 health care law.

Other key parts of the law, including the health exchanges where individuals can buy insurance, are on schedule. The exchanges will open on Oct. 1, wrote Valerie Jarrett, a senior adviser to President Obama, in a White House blog released Tuesday.

The delay also does not change the individual mandate, which requires most Americans to purchase insurance. Some consumers may receive subsidies to help them pay for the insurance depending o their incomes.

Jarrett said the move is a sign the White House is paying attention to the concerns of business.

""As we make these changes, we believe we need to give employers more time to comply with the new rules,"" Jarrett wrote. ""Since employer responsibility payments can only be assessed based on this new reporting, payments won't be collected for 2014.""

""We have heard concerns about the complexity of the requirements and the need for more time to implement them effectively,"" wrote Mark Mazur, assistant Treasury secretary for tax policy, in an IRS blog.

""We recognize that the vast majority of businesses that will need to do this reporting already provide health insurance to their workers, and we want to make sure it is easy for others to do so,"" Mazur said.

The delay gives the IRS more time to simplify reporting requirements, as well as for businesses to get up to speed with reporting systems. The government still encourages businesses to voluntarily begin reporting in 2014 so they will be ready for 2015.

Business groups had argued for months that the law created an administrative burden for businesses as they tried to update technology and plan to offer health coverage to their employees without knowing how much the coverage would cost.

Businesses with more than 50 employees would have paid a fee of $2,000 per uninsured employees after the first 30 employees. The Congressional Budget Office expected those penalties to bring in $4 billion in 2014.

""We commend the administration's wise move to delay the employer reporting and penalty obligations under the Affordable Care Act,"" said National Retail Federation President Neil Trautwein in a statement. ""This one-year delay will provide employers and businesses more time to update their health care coverage without threat of arbitrary punishment.""

This does not affect businesses with fewer than 50 workers, who were already exempt from that rule. Most large businesses already offer coverage to their employees.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said the ""White House seems to slowly be admitting what Americans already know ... that Obamacare needs to be repealed.""

House Republicans, who have tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act 37 times, echoed McConnell.

""The best delay for ObamaCare is a permanent one,"" said House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va.

Various parts of the law have taken effect since its passage in 2010, including allowing children up to age 26 to remain on their parents' insurance plans and discounts for prescription drugs for Medicare patients. More young Americans have health insurance than before the law, because of that change, and the discounts have saved Medicare recipients billions of dollars.

However, the more complicated parts of the law, such as the exchanges and the individual mandates, are set to take effect Jan. 1, and many of the businesses and groups affected have worried about their ability to meet the deadlines."

President Obama returns from vacation to face a busy fall agenda

One priority%3A Avoiding a government shutdown

Violence in Egypt adds to a list of foreign policy challenges

President Obama faces a full agenda when he returns from vacation this weekend, one that includes budget battles and health care fights — and that was before Egypt descended into near-chaos this week.

Pressuring Egypt's military government into holding new elections is the latest addition to a crowded fall political calendar that could make or break Obama's second term.

The president is scheduled to return Sunday evening from his week-long vacation at Martha's Vineyard, Mass.

In the days and months ahead, Obama will seek to put in place key parts of his health care law, pursue a landmark immigration bill, and — perhaps most important in the short run — avoid a government shutdown and another crisis over the debt ceiling.

The president's to-do list also includes pushing a jobs and middle-class legislative package and defending surveillance programs conducted by the National Security Agency.

At a pre-vacation news conference, Obama said he didn't expect congressional Republicans to back a government shutdown ""at a time when the recovery is getting some traction"" and jobs are starting to come back.

""I have confidence that common sense, in the end, will prevail,"" Obama said.

He added: ""We'll see what happens.""

Congressional Republicans said they don't want a government shutdown either, but that Obama needs to support bigger spending cuts in a new budget plan.

""Our good friends on the other side of the aisle have been spending the entire year trying to get us to walk away from spending reductions that we committed to on a bipartisan basis just a couple of years ago,"" said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.

Obama, meanwhile, wants to end the automatic, across-the-board cuts known as sequestration.

The dispute hits a major deadline on Sept. 30. when the current fiscal year ends, as does the temporary spending plan that is now funding the government. Without at least a new continuing resolution, the government could shut down on Oct. 1.

Moreover, some conservative Republicans are advocating a shutdown if Congress does not end funding for Obama's new landmark health care law, another major item on the president's fall plate.

In October, the administration will begin attempts to sign up uninsured Americans for new health care marketplaces coming on line. In addition, at some point this fall, Congress will have to raise the current debt ceiling, which is around $16.7 trillion.

Obama has said, repeatedly, he will not negotiate to raise the debt ceiling, noting that it enables the government to pay bills already rung up.

Some congressional Republicans say the debt ceiling issue can be used to leverage more budget cuts from the administration. Two years ago, a debt ceiling standoff led to a near-default and a downgrade in the nation's credit rating.

On Sunday, though, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., spoke out against a shutdown. ""I don't think shutting down the government is a good idea, but I do think that we were elected, conservatives were elected, to try to stop this overreach, this government takeover of health care,"" Paul told Fox News Sunday.

The upcoming fall political season will see a renewed Obama effort to secure another major piece of legislation, an immigration bill. As he has in recent months, the president is planning to pressure House Republicans to sign off on the immigration bill approved by the Senate earlier this year.

Many House Republicans say a key a provision of that Senate bill — a pathway to citizenship for people already in the United States illegally — amounts to amnesty for lawbreakers.

Obama is likely to cite some of these issues this week when he embarks on a two-day bus tour of upstate New York and northeastern Pennsylvania. The president is also expected to stress education and jobs proposals.

Foreign affairs are no less crowded for the administration in the coming months.

Over the next few months, Obama faces the prospects of rising instability in Egypt, an escalating civil war in Syria and increasingly testy relations with Russia.

During the first week in September, he is scheduled to fly to St. Petersburg, Russia, for a Group of 20 nations summit, where a still-struggling global economy tops the agenda.

Even though the G-20 summit is in Russia, a meeting with Russian president Vladimir Putin is not on the schedule. Obama canceled a planned summit with Putin in Moscow after a string of differences that included Russia's decision to grant temporary asylum to National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden.

Snowden's leaks led to criticism of NSA tactics, and Obama has said he will work with Congress on potential improvements to surveillance programs.

Outside events can always intrude on a president's time, as they did this week during his vacation in Martha's Vineyard.

After Egypt's interim military government cracked down on supporters of ousted President Mohammed Morsi, Obama responded by canceling plans for joint U.S.-Egyptian military exercises. He alluded to other potential aid cuts if the military government does not follow through on pledges to call new elections and re-install a democratically elected government.

""Going forward,"" Obama said, ""I've asked my national security team to assess the implications of the actions taken by the interim government and further steps that we may take as necessary with respect to the U.S.-Egyptian relationship."""
http://news.yahoo.com/top-florida-health-insurer-touts-obamacare-pain-relief-140049073--finance.html,,[],Top Florida health insurer touts Obamacare pain relief,"By Tom Brown MIAMI (Reuters) - Florida's leading health insurer is reaching out to hundreds of thousands of state residents, touting temporary relief from what it describes as an imminent spike in premium rates due to President Barack Obama's signature healthcare reform law. ""When the new healthcare law takes effect, you may be surprised how much more you could pay for health insurance,"" says an advisory to consumers from Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida, also known as Florida Blue. ""Find out how much you'll save if you buy now,"" adds the advisory, which has been mailed over the past month to homes of existing policyholders and potential new clients. ""Let us help you get the best deal on health insurance right now,"" the notice says. ""We can even tell you if you can get help paying for coverage from the government."" Under Obama's Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, millions of uninsured Americans will be able to buy government-subsidized health coverage on new online state insurance exchanges beginning on October 1. The cost of the new plans, which require insurers to provide more benefits to consumers and bar the exclusion of people with prior illnesses, is a key factor to making the enrollment effort a success. However, the law also allows consumers to select from existing individual insurance policies now and extend them into 2014. While these existing policies may be cheaper in some states than those under the Obamacare reform plan, many may not contain the same comprehensive benefits. Florida Blue's notice marks one of the more aggressive efforts by an insurer to tap into fears of ""sticker shock"" for the newer Obamacare plans. Republican-led Florida refused to set up its own insurance exchange, leaving the job to the federal government. The enrollment stakes are big in the Sunshine State, where the U.S. Census Bureau says there are about 3.8 million people without health insurance. About a quarter of Florida's population is uninsured, giving it the third-highest rate in the country. Florida's insurance regulators have said the cost of new insurance plans may rise 30 to 40 percent when compared with a fictional 2013 plan modeled to include the same benefits. But rates in the state are still being finalized between insurers and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The Florida estimates don't include substantial subsidies that a majority of uninsured people may qualify for. Florida Blue said the advisory is part of a direct mail advertising campaign aimed at drumming up new business for the Jacksonville, Florida-based giant, which reported $8.9 billion in revenues last year and covers more than 4.3 million people in its primary health business in the state. The company, a leading contributor to the political action committee of Florida's Republican Governor Rick Scott, is one of nine insurers that have applied to sell non-group policies on the state's new marketplace and the only one that promises to cover every county in Florida. Craig Thomas, the executive responsible for marketing and strategy at Florida Blue, said the consumer advisory - unlike anything seen from other health insurance companies in Florida - was part of what he termed ""an appropriate marketing program."" It primarily targets many people purchasing coverage in Florida's individual market today who will be ineligible for premium subsidies under Obamacare, Thomas said. Many of those same consumers will be hit with higher rates because of benefit changes and other factors tied to next year's full implementation of the law, he said. ""Their rates are generally going to go up,"" said Thomas. ""New expenses are going to be reflected in next year's premiums."" HURTING ENROLLMENT Federal and consumer groups dispute the state's projections. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told reporters on a recent Florida visit that competition for customers should help keep premiums in check. An HHS spokeswoman declined to comment on the Florida Blue campaign, which comes against the backdrop of a full-court press by Scott and other Republican leaders in the state to undermine Obamacare. But Ron Pollack, who heads Families USA, the national healthcare consumer advocacy group, strongly criticized the campaign and said it could hurt enrollment in Florida for coverage under the president's reform plan. ""This letter from an insurer that has tried to appear helpful to consumers is outrageous, misleading and for many, totally erroneous,"" Pollack told Reuters. ""People who get suckered into this appeal may very well lose many thousands of dollars in premium subsidies that become available soon if they enroll starting on October 1 in health coverage through the Affordable Care Act,"" he said. Republican opponents of the reform law were the driving force behind Florida Senate Bill 1842. Signed into law by Governor Scott in May, the legislation prohibits Florida's Office of Insurance Regulation from providing any real protection for consumers from unreasonably high health insurance rates. The federal government says it lacks the legal authority to regulate insurance premiums in individual states, though it is trying to persuade insurers to alter higher-priced plans when it can. Sebelius, who has said she was ""baffled"" by Florida's move, commented earlier this month that she knew of no other state that had chosen to eliminate its own regulatory oversight, leaving consumers at the mercy of health insurance companies. ""It's really unconscionable that the Florida legislature and Governor Scott would take what is in essence the insurance cop, regulating insurance companies, off the playing field, take that cop off the beat ... It just doesn't make sense for families or small businesses. They're supposed to be on our side,"" said Tampa's U.S. Representative Kathy Castor. Castor, Debbie Wasserman Schultz and seven other Florida Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives sent a letter to Sebelius decrying their state's deregulation of health insurers as ""a cynical and intentional effort by Governor Scott and the Florida legislature to undermine the Affordable Care Act and make health insurance premiums more expensive on the Florida Health Insurance Marketplace."" The same law that curtails Florida's rate-setting authority requires insurers to issue notices to consumers, blaming hikes in premiums on ""the impact of federal healthcare reform."" A copy of one such notice, which all health insurance companies operating in the state will be required to use, was made available to Reuters by the insurance commissioner's office. Thomas, who spoke in a telephone interview with Reuters from Jacksonville, said many Florida consumers could benefit financially from buying policies now, even though the plans would expire under Obamacare with no chance of renewal. ""The benefits and rates they buy now would not be changed until the product anniversary date gets here next summer,"" Thomas said. It will carry them with their current program well into next year,"" he added. He and other company officials declined to comment on how Florida Blue's premiums in 2014 would compare to existing rates. (Editing by Ken Wills)"

The moon landing was one of the last times the government delivered a big program ahead of schedule.

As it%27s gotten bigger%2C the federal government appears to have gotten less competent.

Obama within the government is a technological embarrassment.

So the Obamacare website doesn't work, and nobody knows when it'll be fixed. Administration officials are pointing toward late November, but they've had more than three years to work on it. In about the same amount of time after John F. Kennedy's ""we choose to go to the moon"" speech, we'd already put people into orbit and brought them safely to earth. It was obviously the signature effort of the Obama administration, but it was a flop. Forget launching to the moon; we can't even launch a website now. What does that tell us?

Well, don't blame Obama too much. It certainly tells us that the government has trouble executing the things it decides to do. But it wasn't always that way. Even for Obama.

The 1960s space program, of course, is a classic example of big government doing something successfully: Promising to put men on the moon within a decade, and doing it. But there are others.

Not far from me is Norris Dam, the very first dam built by the Tennessee Valley Authority. It was filled in 1936, less than three years after the Tennessee Valley Authority Act passed Congress. Note that it was not less than three years after construction started, but less than three years after the act creating the agency that built it passed Congress. Norris Dam worked, and it's still there today, more than 70 years later.

The Obamacare website -- which took longer to create -- doesn't work, and certainly won't be around in 70 years. And if you think about it, it seems like the moon landing was one of the last times the federal government delivered a big successful program ahead of schedule. I can't think of many others since.

Unlike Norris Dam, the Olmsted Dam and Locks on the Ohio River were authorized by Congress in 1988, but a quarter-century later the project is only half-done. It has also overrun its budget by a factor of four.

Meanwhile, most of the interesting stuff being done in outer space is being done by private companies. (In fact, President Obama's space policy approach, which emphasizes private enterprise, is one of his greatest policy successes.)

As it's gotten bigger the federal government appears to have gotten less competent. Apollo was a success on its own terms, but the big government policies that followed -- the War On Poverty, the War On Drugs, the War On Cancer -- have all been pretty much failures, sometimes disastrous ones.

Even Obama himself is evidence of this problem. His 2012 presidential campaign was famous for its mastery of technology, building up an electronic campaign infrastructure in just a few months that helped him win the election. But, of course, it wasn't a government operation. Obama without the government -- a technological success. Obama within the government -- a technological embarrassment. The difference between success and failure here, as even Obama-haters will have to admit, wasn't Obama. It's more likely that a political campaign has clear goals, and lots of freedom to improvise, while a federal program is much more encumbered by law and bureaucracy.

Whatever the cause, it remains indisputable that the federal government isn't very good at delivering on big projects. The obvious response is to not entrust the federal government with big projects on which it can't deliver. Instead, they should be left to those who can.

Will our political and pundit class draw the obvious lesson here? Stay tuned.

Zients, a multimillionaire entrepreneur and management consultant, joined the Obama White House in 2009 with a mandate to streamline the federal bureaucracy. A year later, he issued a prescient warning.

The government “largely has missed out” on the information technology revolution, Mr. Zients said in a 2010 internal memo. “I.T. projects too often cost hundreds of millions of dollars more than they should, take years longer than necessary to deploy and deliver technologies that are obsolete by the time they are completed,” he wrote.

These days, Mr. Zients is witnessing that ineptitude up close as the emergency fix-it man charged with righting HealthCare.gov, the bungled online marketplace for medical insurance. He is to become President Obama’s top economic adviser in January, but first he is leading the so-called tech surge to haul HealthCare.gov into the 21st century. Ignoring friends who told him not to get mixed up in the website fiasco, Mr. Zients (pronounced ZYE-ents) promises it will run “smoothly for the vast majority of users” by the end of November — a schedule considered highly optimistic.

Mr. Obama’s reputation, and the electoral fortunes of Democrats, could hinge on the work of Mr. Zients, a man who has no hands-on technology experience — although he has advised health care companies on business practices. In the universe of experts who might have been called in for rescue work, Democrats close to the administration say, there were others perhaps more qualified than Mr. Zients, but he was the best of those Mr. Obama and an insular White House were comfortable with."

But there may be another explanation than congenital cruelty: Republicans believe they are adhering to a principle that they place above every other value, including compassion. That principle is the need to punish individuals whom they view as undeserving.

Though we Americans love to brag about our decency and concern for others, the punitive gene runs deep in our national DNA. It goes back to the Puritans, who, while professing charitableness and community, had a hard vision of life. They subscribed to the Protestant idea that, since you couldn’t know if you were one of the “elect,” predestined for salvation, you had to look for signs. A major one is a productive life.

The sociologist Max Weber fastened on this Protestant work ethic as the basis of Western civilization’s material success. As he saw it, capitalism was a by-product of the desire for grace. For the Protestants, hard work was not only a potential sign of personal salvation. It became a sign of national salvation.

The United States was particularly fertile ground for this. It was not only a Protestant nation, it took pride in being a classless society, a meritocracy — in which the secular elect would become just as important as the religious. The country’s governing principle was, and still is, that anyone can make it here if he or she is just willing to put in the necessary elbow grease.

This may be why no country seems to worship success as much as the United States. Our success is always perceived to be earned. This is American bedrock — our primary myth remains the social mobility of the Horatio Alger stories.

But if the work ethic was secularized and popularized, it was also politicized. If every individual was responsible for his or her own destiny — short of natural disasters, which some conservatives see as divine punishment for various cultural transgressions — there was no need for government interventions to redress inequalities.

In a world where everyone is on their own, help is not just wasteful; it is ungodly and un-American. If we are responsible for our success, we are also responsible for our failure.

It is impossible to know whether the modern Republican Party exploited self-reliance to destroy big government or sought to destroy big government as a principle of self-reliance. Whichever, this is now deeply embedded in modern conservatism.

When U.S. conservatives cut unemployment benefits, it is because giving the unemployed money allegedly discourages them from working. When they cut food stamps, it is because they claim recipients are gaming the system, though there is virtually no evidence to support this. Representative Jack Kingston (R-Ga.), a Senate candidate, proposed last week that any child receiving lunches through the federal school lunch program be required to work to earn the food.

But Republicans wouldn’t be proposing these hardships if there weren’t a sizable contingent of Americans supporting them. Presumably on the basis that the disadvantaged aren’t really disadvantaged. They are unworthy.

Slashing benefits is only cruel if you are hurting the deserving. But in the conservatives’ view, the poor are never deserving. So you can hack away with a sense of righteousness. Poverty, they insist, is a choice.

This may help explain the conservatives’ anger at anyone who purports to help the poor. Doing so violates the sense of justice for many on the right. It isn’t just that conservatives hate government for taking taxpayers’ hard-earned dollars. They hate it because it rewards indolence — where politics conjoins with sinfulness.

This has a powerful appeal. And it goes a long way toward answering the liberal quandary of why so many Americans who could benefit from government programs oppose them and work against their own self-interest.

The answer goes back to those Puritan roots. We are a nation of scolds and scourges. We hate the idea that someone can get something he or she didn’t earn. So what’s the matter with Kansas may just be that many Americans believe in something more important than self-interest, more important than compassion. Punishment.

Many Americans, certainly many Republicans, are more interested in making sure that the “undeserving” are not being rewarded than making sure the deserving are rewarded.

Sure it is punitive. Meting out punishment, however, is something we love to do. Which is why one of our major political parties can subsist on it. The Republican Party is the punishment party.

All this is worth remembering at this time of year. We may say we like giving. But a whole lot of us resent the taking. Or put another way, it is better to give so long as no one needs to receive.

Obamacare remains a political albatross for Democrats, but a government shutdown has proven to be more toxic to voters.

2. The plan of using a government shutdown to spark a national discussion on Obamacare fell flat.

3. While the White House and some in the media view the government

shutdown through the lens of the Tea Party, the intransigent factions of Republicans and Democrats are equal in size.

4. Women are following the government shutdown more closely than men, and that should be concerning for Republicans.

We entered the government shutdown certain of one thing:

there will be no shortage of blame to go around. Above 50 percent in January,

President Obama’s job approval now registers in the low-to-mid 40’s, and voters

are increasingly pessimistic about the direction of the country

The shutdowntoxic to voters, but how much of an albatross can Obamacare be for Democrats when they handily won the 2012 elections? It's true, more people disapprove of the law, but the polling also consistently shows that 1) people don't understand the law, and 2) people support individual components of the law. That's why Republicans haven't been able to capitulate on the supposed opposition to it, it's why people don't want to see the law defunded, and certainly not via government shutdown, and why support for the law isas people start paying more attention to it.No shit.Somehow, the fact that Democrats want Democrats to hold firm means something to these guys. Not sure why. Fact is, the government shutdown is being viewed through the lens of the Tea Partythey are responsible for it. It's true, the terrorist gets more attention than his victims.Memo to GOP pollsters at Resurgent Republic: that ""rebranding"" thing was soooo January 2013.Obama hasn't seen 50 percent approval since February , so the fact that he was above 50 percent at the time is irrelevant to how the shutdown is playing. If you look at a more narrow slice of time, as in the last week, the president has actually seen his numbers go up in the most recent NBC/WSJ, Rasmussen (ha!), and Fox (ha ha!) polls and has been mostly stable according to everyone else.

Now that they've surveyed the state of public opinion (as well as Republicans can, being that they are Republican), they now get down to giving some advice. Try not to cringe too much.



Public opinion remains stacked against Obamacare, and this is problematic for Senate Democrats in red states, so conservatives should look to 2014 and highlight Obamacare’s policy and implementation woes along the way.

The reasonableness of President Obama has been tarnished in the shutdown.

The president strikes a harsh chord when his message to Congress and the American people is a barrage about not negotiating rather than leading a divided government

Let’s remember, not long ago voters believed Mitt Romney, not President Obama, was better able to bridge the partisan divide

Habitually labeling Republicans as arsonists and hostage takers reminds voters of the president’s own weakness in this area.

While this is not your 90’s shutdown, it is not an envious position for Republicans either

If Republicans can put the shutdown dysfunction in their rear view mirror, they can move to a more favorable playing field, connecting with a majority of Independents who want the government to stop spending money it doesn’t have.

In reality, November 2014 can't get here soon enough. Even in those Red states like North Carolina Louisiana , and even Arkansas . Heck, Republicans actually need to start worrying about their own Red states of Georgia and Kentucky No evidence, other than the fervent wishes of conservative pollsters, apparently.He sounds a principled, strong chord. You say ""tomato"", I say ""good luck with that, buddy.""And Mitt Romney won!This'll certainly be a problem for Obama's 2016 reelection bid, given how it made him lose in 2012.It's worse than your 90s shutdown.That's the biggest fucking ""if"" I have ever seen. Before they can put any shutdown dysfunction in their rear view mirror they have to capitulate to Obama and the Democrats by providing a clean continuing budget resolution and a clean raising of the debt limit. And if they do that, the party's fringy base will explode, littering that ""favorable playing field"" with the debris of a once-vibrant national party.

But let's say they do that, and the GOP ""connects"" with those independents ... so what? Romney won Independents in 2012 by a 50-45 margin. ""Independent"" includes ""teabaggers and other assorted conservatives too embarrassed to say they are Republicans"". The big question is whether the GOP can connect with moderates, who were 41 percent of the 2012 electorate and went to Obama by a whopping 56-41 margin."

The House has listened to the American people.”

That’s what Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) said at the GOP’s victory rally Friday after the House voted to pass a spending bill that cut all funding for the president’s healthcare law — and took the country one step closer to a government shutdown on Oct. 1.

The American people, alas, weren’t in the room to speak for themselves. But was Boehner right about their desires? Polls show that most Americans are, not surprisingly, divided.

Yes, a majority doesn’t like Obamacare. They’re unsure about what it will do and worried that it might make their healthcare worse. But do they really want to defund the law, and risk the chaos of a government shutdown to do it? Probably not, most polls suggest.

As one Republican pollster told me, though a majority of voters don’t like Obamacare, they’re not angry enough about it to risk a fiscal crisis that could hurt the economy.

So why are Republican lawmakers hearing a different message? Because most of them represent districts so conservative that they are listening only to their own choir. “It’s clear where the public in my district is,” said Rep. Jim Bridenstine (R-Okla.), a tea party firebrand. “They want Obamacare repealed. They want it defunded. They want it dismantled.”

Bridenstine, a Navy Reserve pilot from Tulsa, is probably right. In his solidly Republican district, Mitt Romney won two-thirds of the vote in the last presidential election.

A visit to the House side of Capitol Hill these days feels a bit like an excursion to an alternate universe, where the voters are all conservative, the will of the American people is crystal clear and the only mystery is how that Obama fellow ever got reelected.

“This is all a result of redistricting,” a Republican strategist told me. “The only election these guys have to worry about is the Republican primary. The only danger they face is from the right.”

According to ratings compiled by Larry Sabato of the University of Virginia, only 28 of the House’s 233 Republicans have even a theoretical chance of losing their seats to a Democrat next year; the other 205 are safe as long as they win their primaries. (The same is true of most House Democrats, of course.)

Outside the conservative bubble of the House GOP conference, the politics of the budget standoff look different. Karl Rove, former political advisor to George W. Bush, has warned that the only winner in a government shutdown would be Obama. “This is one thing that can rescue him,” Rove said on Fox News.

In the Senate, Republicans acknowledge there is almost no chance of passing legislation to defund Obamacare, the president’s most cherished achievement. Even Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), the loudest champion of the defund Obamacare movement, agreed on that last week, landing him in hot water with the House conservatives he was urging to plunge ahead.

The entire strategy, warned Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), is “a box canyon” for Republicans — a trap with no way out but retreat.

Cruz and other tea party senators have vowed to filibuster to block the Senate from approving a spending bill that doesn’t defund Obamacare, but Senate rules make that difficult. So the Senate is expected to strip the Obamacare provision and kick the bill back to the House, where Boehner and his Republicans will consider their next move.

They might make a dignified retreat and pass the Senate version before the Sept. 30 deadline. Or, more likely, they might engage in another round of legislative pingpong, in which doomed proposals bounce between the two branches of Congress as the clock runs out. One veteran budget guru, Stan Collender of Qorvis Communications, puts the chances of a government shutdown at 70%.

And that’s not even the worst possible outcome. Boehner and his lieutenants have told House members that the current battle over the spending bill is only a preliminary bout. The real fight, they’ve said, will be over the debt ceiling — the government’s authority to borrow money to pay its bills, which is expected to run out in October or November,

Once again, conservatives have begun telling one another that the American people would welcome the crisis if it resulted in less federal spending and the end of Obamacare. They argue that a debt-ceiling standoff wouldn’t force the federal government to default on its debts and throw the world economy into crisis; the Treasury, they say, could keep paying bondholders and stop most of its other checks. Even if that were possible (and the Treasury Department says it isn’t), the world’s lenders would almost certainly downgrade Uncle Sam’s credit rating, imposing higher interest costs on the federal budget for years to come.

This may sound like just another round of Washington’s recurring impasse, but this time the prospects for a quick solution look worse. The Republicans have chosen to demand the one concession Obama is least likely to make: the crippling of Obamacare. And the GOP’s chief deal maker, Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), is battling a primary challenge on his right, which means he’s not eager to play the role of middleman this year.

When Boehner described what the American people want from Congress, he left one thing out: They also want their government to solve problems, even if that sometimes requires an uncomfortable dose of compromise. They aren’t seeing much of that from the House of Representatives this year.

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/09/28/senate-advances-controversial-obamacare-budget-bill/,2013-09-28 00:00:00,[],What Now? Budget bill heads to House after Senate restores ObamaCare $$,"House Republican leaders heading into a rare weekend session struggled with a tough choice after Senate Democrats succeeded in passing a ""clean"" budget bill which, contrary to GOP wishes, restores funding for ObamaCare.

The Senate, capping a dramatic week on Capitol Hill, approved the bill on Friday, after Democrats stripped a Republican-backed provision to defund the health law. The final vote was 54-44.

The House is expected to take up the legislation starting on Saturday, and the bill is seen by some lawmakers as a sort of legislative hot potato. If the two chambers cannot agree on a final bill by midnight on Monday, then the government will shut down. Neither side wants to be left holding the bill if that happens.

House Speaker John Boehner could, theoretically, just call up the Senate-passed bill and rely on mostly Democrats to pass it. But House Republicans are under heavy pressure, now, from fellow conservatives to stand by their demand that ObamaCare be defunded, or least delayed.

A group of 62 conservative Republican lawmakers emerged late Friday with a proposed amendment to the spending bill that would delay the entire health care law for a year. Rep. Tom Graves, R-Ga., said he plans to introduce the amendment when the House considers the funding bill.

""This approach was developed over several meetings with House Republicans, with a goal of keeping our conference unified, as we continue working to keep the government open and protect our constituents from the harmful effects of ObamaCare,” Graves said in a statement.

Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who staged an unsuccessful effort to stall the bill in the Senate, predicted the House would restore anti-ObamaCare provisions -- and urged Senate Republicans to unite with them. ""Today, far too many Republicans joined Harry Reid in giving the Democrats the ability to fund ObamaCare,"" he said.

Boehner signaled he will not accept the Senate-passed bill in its current form. If the bill is altered in any way, it will have to return to the Senate for yet another vote.

""The House will take action that reflects the fundamental fact that Americans don't want a government shutdown and they don't want the train wreck that is ObamaCare,"" spokesman Brendan Buck said in a statement.

But President Obama, during remarks at the White House, warned Republicans not to go down that road.

""(Undoing ObamaCare is) not gonna happen,"" Obama said. ""House Republicans will have to decide whether to join the Senate and keep the government open, or shut it down because they can't get their way. ... This grandstanding has real effects on real people.""

Obama also warned Republicans to back down on threats to tie an increase in the debt ceiling to other demands, claiming a U.S. default would cause an ""economic shutdown.""

Should Republicans stand by their anti-ObamaCare demands, Democrats have launched an aggressive campaign to pre-emptively blame them for a government shutdown. During a post-vote press conference, Senate Democrats displayed a countdown clock to the ""Republican government shutdown.""

""I don't know of anyone who wants to shut down the government. The only thing we want to shut down is ObamaCare,"" Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said.

Amid the fighting, federal agencies are warning about the impact of the looming shutdown. The Pentagon warned Friday that as many as 400,000 civilian workers could be furloughed. Military personnel are not subject to furlough and would continue to work, for the time being, without pay.

Democrats used the doomsday scenarios to pressure Republicans into backing down.

""We've passed the only bill that can avert a government shutdown Monday night. I've said this on the floor -- I say it again: This is it,"" Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid said.

Earlier Friday, Reid narrowly won approval to restore funding for ObamaCare. The 54-44 vote fell along party lines.

That was after the Senate voted 79-19 on the initial version of the bill, which in its original form would keep the government open while defunding ObamaCare. Several Republicans joined Democrats in voting ""yes"" on that vote, ignoring appeals by Cruz and other conservatives to stall the bill.

The first roll call had put Republicans in a difficult position, and prompted a very-public spate of infighting. Tea Party-aligned Republicans like Cruz, who staged a 21-hour anti-ObamaCare speech on the Senate floor this week, argued that Republicans should stop this bill in its tracks. Though the bill technically defunded ObamaCare -- which Cruz and his colleagues wanted -- they argued that since Reid would restore the funding, they should vote ""no.""

A number of Republicans rejected this logic.

""I don't understand how I can otherwise vote on a matter that I want to see passed,"" Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said. (Click to see the vote breakdown.)

Though the test vote put Senate Republicans in a tricky spot, the bigger question is what House Republicans will do next.

If Republicans stand by their demand that ObamaCare be defunded, delayed or otherwise undermined, then the two chambers could easily be at an impasse by midnight on Monday.

Tempers and rhetoric were heated on Friday as Democrats accused their Republican colleagues of playing with legislative fire.

""We are at one of the most dangerous points in our history right now -- every bit as dangerous as the break-up of the Union before the Civil War,"" said Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa.

But Republicans are treating their push to defund ObamaCare with urgency, in part because a key part of the law is set to go into effect next week.

""ObamaCare is the biggest job killer in the country,"" Cruz said."
http://news.yahoo.com/canceled-u-health-plans-disruptive-part-reform-cigna-041400229--finance.html,,[],Canceled U.S. health plans are disruptive part of reform: Cigna CEO,"By Caroline Humer (Reuters) - The hundreds of thousands of Americans whose individual insurance policies will be canceled as Obamacare takes full effect next year are experiencing a disruptive element of healthcare reform, the head of health insurer Cigna said on Thursday. In the past week, reports of pending plan cancellations have become a political problem for President Barack Obama, who promised years ago as he was pushing to pass the healthcare law that Americans who liked their health plans could keep them. While that remains true for most people with insurance, a small percentage of the 17 million Americans with individual policies are now getting notice that they will terminate next year because they do not comply with new benefits required by Obamacare. Many insurers are offering new, compliant policies to replace those that are expiring, but they may be significantly more expensive. Nearly half of U.S. consumers with individual health plans are also expected to qualify for tax credits to buy insurance on new state exchanges under Obamacare. ""When you are that individual who has a benefit plan and it's working for you and your family at your current life stage and you are told that you no longer have that choice, that's disruptive and that's the environment that as a country we are going through right now,"" Cigna Chief Executive David Cordani said in an interview. Cigna had about 232,000 people in individual policies at the end of September, according to company filings. Competitor WellPoint Inc, which operates 14 Blue Cross Blue Shield licenses including the Anthem and Empire brands, has about 1.8 million people in individual plans. Aetna Inc, which bought smaller insurer Coventry earlier this year, has 650,000 members in these plans and will drop about 50,000 members when it exits the California market at the end of this year. In defending the healthcare law on Wednesday, Obama said it was not to blame for the plan cancellations, and that the real fault lies with ""bad apple"" insurers who were allowed to sell cut-rate policies that offered minimal coverage for people when they needed them the most. Cordani declined to comment on Obama's remarks, but noted that individual plans have been subjected to numerous new requirements under the law. States determine the minimum eligible benefits and there are federal requirements, so in some states elements such as the size of the deductible could disqualify an individual plan for 2014. ""It's as simple as that,"" he said. WellPoint and Aetna declined to comment on specifics about policy cancellations or about the president's comments. Cordani said that Cigna has a small individual insurance business and is not significantly impacted by needing to cancel these plans. In addition, it has about 125,000 employer-sponsored plans that will end on January 1, 2014 because they do not comply with the law. These plans typically targeted seasonal or hourly workers, he said, and it was clear from when the health reform law was passed in 2010 that they were going away.

Ryan, the former Republican vice presidential candidate, has been a tea party favorite and a bridge between House conservatives and the party leadership ever since he took the lead in crafting a plan to scale back Medicare and other social programs to reduce federal spending.

But on Wednesday, when Ryan (R-Wis.) stepped forward to try to bring Republican factions together behind a strategy to end the government’s latest budget stalemate, some of the same conservatives who once trusted him went cold.

Advertisement

The complaint: His plan, which centered on trimming back spending on government entitlement programs, failed to mention the demise of Obamacare as a top Republican objective. Conservatives accused him of abandoning their cause and caving in to Democrats.

“So we are going to ditch the fight over Obamacare, which is extremely unpopular, to fight for Medicare reform? Really, Paul Ryan? And they think we are politically stupid?” wrote Daniel Horowitz on RedState.com, an influential conservative website.

“This is the road to cave city,” he said.

The heated reaction showed how deeply divided Republicans remain in the second week of the government shutdown — with a week to go before the nation could run out of money to pay its bills.

House GOP leaders have been trying to shift the focus of their standoff with the White House and Senate Democrats away from Sen. Ted Cruz’s drive to stop the president’s health law to a broader plan to cut the budget. But partly as a result, the majority led by House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) can no longer explain what, exactly, it is fighting for.

“There are a lot of ideas right now on the table,” said Rep. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.). But he said Republicans hadn’t yet coalesced around one approach.

Advertisement

One way out would be a short-term agreement to raise the $16.7-trillion debt ceiling for a few weeks while both sides work on a broader budget agreement. Republicans are increasingly floating this proposal, but Democrats are wary that the GOP will demand concessions.

Senate Democrats are expected to vote this weekend on a proposal to suspend the debt limit through 2014.

Republican divisions over what they want from the White House have weakened their hand and made the stalemate harder to resolve. The party’s struggles could be seen in a new Gallup poll that put the GOP’s favorable rating at 28%, the lowest measure for either political party since Gallup started asking the question in 1992 — lower even than the GOP’s standing during the last government shutdowns in 1995 and 1996.

Ryan defended his approach on conservative commentator Bill Bennett’s radio show. “I don’t know that within the next two weeks we have a viable strategy for actually repealing Obamacare, every piece of it,” he said.

Advertisement

The conservative Heritage Action, which helped launch the strategy taken by tea party favorite Cruz (R-Texas), said any action short of a fight over the Affordable Care Act would be “detrimental.”

“Fundamentally, we are not supportive of anything that’s going to take the focus away from the current fight over Obamacare,” said Heritage’s Dan Holler. “That’s where we think the fight needs to be — that’s where the fight is.”

Advertisement

At the same time, top conservatives, especially those tired of the Cruz-led campaign, heaped praise on Ryan as the party’s expert on fiscal issues. “Excellent piece by @RepPaulRyan on a path forward,” tweeted Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), once a leader among House conservatives.

But two-term Rep. Mo Brooks, a Republican from Alabama, called Ryan’s brief presentation before the House GOP’s conservative caucus Wednesday “very generic” and walked away undecided on whether he would sign on.

“The devil’s in the details,” Brooks said. “Delaying socialized medicine — that is one way to delay one’s insolvency.”

As Boehner struggled to find a cohesive strategy, the White House sought to amplify Obama’s willingness to negotiate with Congress once it passes bills to end the shutdown and avert a default. The president invited every Republican in the House to meet with him Thursday at the White House. He held a similar session with Democrats on Wednesday.

Advertisement

Boehner, however, decided to limit the White House session to a few top House Republicans. One GOP leadership aide said that a broader meeting would be little more than a “photo op.”

The decision “disappointed” Obama, the White House spokesman said. “The president thought it was important to talk directly with the members who forced this economic crisis on the country about how the shutdown and a failure to pay the country’s bills could devastate the economy,” said White House Press Secretary Jay Carney.

Obama has refused to engage in serious talks until Republicans agree to reopen the government and raise the debt limit. “The president will talk to anyone any time and looks forward to their visit to the White House, but will not pay the Republicans ransom for doing their job,” Carney said.

Splinters among Democrats, who have publicly maintained an unusually united front, also emerged Wednesday, as liberals warned against budget talks that could result in steep cuts to cherished government programs.

Advertisement

Rep. Raul M. Grijalva (D-Ariz.), co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, has called those fears “grand bargain paranoia.” Democrats worry, based on past talks aimed at a so-called grand bargain, that the president might be willing to reduce Social Security benefits or increase the amount of money higher-income seniors pay toward Medicare.

But Democrats appeared unified Wednesday as senators rallied on the Capitol steps and House Democrats met with Obama. “The debt ceiling needs to be lifted. They’re not getting anything for that,” said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) as she left the White House with her leadership team.

Advertisement

The reemergence of Ryan, whose role had faded since the January day when he led rebellious House Republicans back from the brink of an earlier fiscal standoff, still holds the potential to shift the debate.

Ryan’s prescriptions, spelled out in an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal, reflect Boehner’s interest in a deal that could provide what the budget chairman has called a “big down payment” on the nation’s debt.

Advertisement

Ryan said Wednesday that he was “totally committed to dismantling” the healthcare law. “Obamacare is an entitlement just like any other entitlement. So that, as far as we’re concerned, is in this conversation,” he said on Bennett’s radio show. “Ultimately, we have to rethink all of our nation’s healthcare laws.”

Retail prices for health insurance can be considerably different based in part on the cost of health care services where a person lives, even within the same state, the Kaiser Family Foundation reported Wednesday. Premiums also vary based on age, family size and tobacco use. But under Obamacare, prices cannot be based on someone's medical history and patients with preexisting condition cannot be turned away. The law also mandates a set of minimum benefits that includes hospitalizations, prescription drugs and maternity care.

The prices included in the report don't include health benefits provided by employers because the health insurance exchanges are intended for the uninsured and those who don't get job-based health plans.

The actual premiums for the health plans on the exchanges have been a chief unknown since Obama enacted the health care law in 2010 and although complete information won't be available until the exchanges open, the Kaiser Family Foundation examined detailed data published by state authorities to create a snapshot of what coverage will cost.

In Baltimore, a 40-year-old will be able to buy a so-called bronze health insurance plan for as little as $146 a month, compared to $336 a month in Burlington, Vt., not including the savings from tax credits available to people who earn up to four times the federal poverty level -- $45,960 for a single person this year -- according to the report.

The health insurance exchanges in all 50 states and the District of Columbia are slated to open Oct. 1 for small businesses, uninsured people, and for people who don't get health benefits at work, to comparison shop and to learn whether they qualify for financial assistance. People who get health benefits from large employers or who are enrolled in government programs like Medicare don't need to use the exchanges. Employers provide coverage to 150 million U.S. residents, according to census data, and virtually all large firms are expected to continue doing so next year despite the Obama administration's one-year delay of the law's requirement that large companies cover workers or pay a penalty.

The exchanges will sell four tiers of health insurance -- bronze, silver, gold and platinum -- indicating how generous the coverage is. Bronze plans will tend to have the lowest premiums, but expose consumers to the highest possible out-of-pocket costs and platinum plans will have the highest prices but the lowest additional expenses. Those younger than 30 can purchase so-called catastrophic insurance with minimal coverage at a lower price, but cannot apply federal tax credits to these plans.

The Kaiser Family Foundation didn't compare the premiums on the health insurance exchange with the cost of health insurance for those who don't get health benefits at work today, however. The new law's guaranteed benefits, prohibition against turning down people with preexisting conditions will make health insurance on this market too different from what's currently available, the report says.

""These changes make direct comparisons of exchange premiums and existing individual market premiums complicated, and doing so would require speculative assumptions and data that are not publicly available,"" it says. Some people, most likely young adults who don't qualify for financial assistance, may see higher prices as a result.

The variation isn't limited to bronze plans, the Kaiser Family Foundation analysis reveals. ""The lowest cost exchange silver exchange plan available range in cost for a 40-year-old from $194 per month in Portland, Oregon, to $395 per month for a 40-year-old in Burlington, Vermont, before tax credits,"" the report says.

Under Obamacare, people whose incomes range from poverty, $11,490 for a single person this year, and 400 percent of poverty may be eligible for tax credits to buy private insurance. Sixteen states and the District of Columbia are running their own exchanges while the federal government will at least partly manage exchanges, also called marketplaces, in the remaining states.

""Most people buying their own insurance will qualify for premium tax credits, which will significantly lower the cost of their premiums,"" the Kaiser Family Foundation report says. The foundation also notes that premiums released so far are lower than projected by the Congressional Budget Office.

People who earn up to 133 percent of poverty, or $15,282 for an individual this year, can enroll in Medicaid if they live in the District of Columbia or one of the 24 states that are expanding the program under the law.

The Kaiser Family Foundation examined insurance company filings to state regulators in 17 states and the District of Columbia and analyzed the prices in the largest cities in each jurisdiction for people at ages 25, 40, and 60. At least two health insurance companies are offering products in all of the locations included in the report. California has the largest number of companies participating in its exchange, Covered California, at 12, while HealthSource RI in Rhode Island and Maine's federally run marketplace each have two companies.

Eligibility for tax credits via the exchanges is determined based on the maximum amount of a person's income they must spend on health insurance and the price of the second-cheapest silver-level health insurance plan where they live. In addition to the tax credits for annual premiums, people who earn up to two-and-a-half times poverty can qualify for additional subsidies to cover their out-of-pocket costs like copayments and deductibles. Most legal residents of the United States must obtain coverage or face a tax penalty under the law's individual mandate.

The full Kaiser Family Foundation report includes breakdowns for each example in every one of the metropolitan areas examined."

The president is reprising his core message that what the economy needs is more federal spending on popular priorities such as infrastructure and education, not less.

And his stump speeches last week in Illinois, Missouri and Florida put Republicans on notice that he will blame them if a standoff over spending results in a government shutdown or a financial crisis over the federal debt ceiling this fall.

“Repealing Obamacare and cutting spending is not an economic plan,” Obama lectured his opponents. “You can’t just be against something; you’ve got to be for something.”

But is that true?

House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) doesn’t seem to think so. When asked recently about the glacial pace of legislation in the House, he responded: “We should not be judged on how many new laws we create. We ought to be judged on how many laws that we repeal.”

Boehner has a point. The number of bills a Congress passes is no guarantee that it’s doing important work. Roughly a third of the measures Congress passes are inconsequential actions such as renaming post offices.

But there’s also a flaw in Boehner’s argument. Although the current Congress is on pace to pass even fewer laws than the previous one (which set a modern record for lack of productivity), it hasn’t succeeded in repealing many laws either. The GOP-led House has voted nearly 40 times to repeal all or part of Obama’s healthcare law, for example, but hasn’t succeeded in overturning the act — although it has cut its funding.

Boehner has said he has no intention of shutting down the government during budget talks this fall, a move he believes would be counterproductive.

As one of his allies, Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), put it last week: “The only way Republicans will lose the House is to shut down the government or default on the debt. Shutting down the government is not in the best interests of the American people, and it makes you look politically irresponsible.”

But Boehner doesn’t always control the majority of his own caucus. Tea party radicals in both chambers of Congress are demanding a hard line, with some, including Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, promising to block any increase in the federal debt ceiling unless Obama’s healthcare law is repealed — a proposal another Republican, Sen. Richard M. Burr of North Carolina, called “the dumbest idea I ever heard.”

That’s no guarantee it won’t gain traction. Members of Congress in safely partisan districts — including some liberal Democrats as well as tea party conservatives — can be remarkably indifferent to broader public opinion. That’s one reason Congress’ approval rating dropped last week to an all-time low of 12% in the NBC News-Wall Street Journal Poll, far below Obama’s anemic rating of 45%.

It’s also well below the level Congress sank to last year, when Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) joked that its only remaining supporters were “paid staff and blood relatives.”

Obama hasn’t given up hope that he can spur legislators to action. He’s trying to win legislative battles on both immigration and the budget by striking bipartisan compromises in the Senate, which still has a sizable faction of Republicans who say they want to negotiate with the president.

Even as he denounced House Republicans last week, Obama doled out elaborate praise for a few, unnamed Republican senators who he said were working toward bipartisan compromises.

“The Senate is their only hope,” said Norman J. Ornstein, a congressional scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. “If you begin to get 70 or 75 votes for things in the Senate, then you get a different conversation; it becomes clear that there’s only one group of people [the House conservatives] standing in the way.”

Obama is doing everything he can to cast the opposition as being obstructionist. But will his return to the campaign trail have any real effect on Congress?

The too-easy answer is no. He’s given speeches like these before. He’s got no new proposals to unveil. And the House members who stand in his way aren’t worried about pressure from voters who support the president; they are more worried about primary challenges from even more conservative Republicans to their right. Speeches from the president aren’t going to change their minds.

But that’s not what Obama’s campaign is about. On one level, it’s about influencing votes in the Senate, not the House. And on another, it’s about making sure that if this fall’s budget battles do result in a government shutdown or, even worse, a financial crisis over the debt ceiling, the president and his party don’t get blamed.

Obama may look and sound as if he’s on the offensive, but his strategy has an awful lot of defense in it too.

Government says overpayments reveal weaknesses in Social Security procedures

Social Security plans to investigate and recoup improper payments

Last year%2C Social Security paid out %24137 billion in disability payments

WASHINGTON (AP) — Social Security made $1.3 billion in potentially improper disability payments to people who had jobs when they were supposed to be unable to work, congressional investigators said in a report Friday.

The Government Accountability Office estimated that 36,000 workers got improper payments from December 2010 to January 2013.

The numbers represent less than 1 percent of beneficiaries and less than 1 percent of disability payments made during the time frame. But GAO said the overpayments reveal weaknesses in Social Security's procedures for policing the system.

""The report lays out clear, common-sense steps that the agency can and should take in order to avoid improper payments,"" said Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. ""However, if we're serious about preventing waste and fraud and ensuring that these critical benefits get to the people who need and deserve them, Congress must also do its part and provide needed resources and access to basic anti-fraud data to the Social Security Administration.""

The Social Security Administration said its accuracy rate for disability payments is more than 99 percent. But the agency noted that even small errors translate into big numbers.

""We are planning to do an investigation, and we will recoup any improper payments from beneficiaries,"" Social Security spokesman Mark Hinkle said. ""It is too soon to tell what caused these overpayments, but if we determine that fraud is involved, we will refer these cases to our office of the inspector general for investigation.""

More than 8.2 million disabled workers received disability payments in December 2010, a figure that has grown to nearly 9 million. Last year, the agency paid out $137 billion in disability payments.

Before people can receive disability benefits, there is a 5-month waiting period in which they can, in general, earn no more than about $1,000 a month. The waiting period is to ensure that beneficiaries have long-term disabilities.

Using a federal wage database, investigators checked whether a sample of disability beneficiaries had worked and earned significant wages during the waiting period, the report said. They found that most of the improper payments went to people who worked during the five months they waited for payments to begin.

Once people start receiving benefits, they can return to work and still get benefits during a trial work period, in an attempt to re-enter the workforce. Using the same wage database, investigators checked whether another sample of disability beneficiaries earned significant wages after their trial work period had ended, the report said.

Based on their findings, the GAO estimated the amount of improper payments and the number of people receiving them.

Citing a potential weakness, the report said Social Security might not detect a person who worked during the waiting period if the period started in one year and ended in another. For example, if Social Security starts paying benefits in February, the agency might not detect significant wages earned the previous November because they weren't earned in the same year that benefits were awarded, the report said.

In a written response to the report, the Social Security Administration agency questioned whether GAO overestimated the amount of overpayments. The agency said investigators did not determine whether the work activity qualified as an unsuccessful attempt to return to work, or whether there were any other special circumstances.

The report comes as Social Security's disability program faces a financial crisis. If Congress doesn't act, the trust fund that supports the disability program will run out of money in 2016, according to projections by Social Security's trustees. At that point, the system will collect only enough money in payroll taxes to pay 80 percent of benefits, triggering an automatic 20 percent cut in benefits.

Congress could redirect money from Social Security's much bigger retirement program to shore up the disability program, as it did in 1994. But that would worsen the finances of the retirement program, which is facing its own long-term financial problems.

""This report demonstrates just how little importance the Social Security Administration places on policing its disability rolls,"" said Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, the ranking Republican on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. ""SSA has known for years that it could prevent millions of dollars in improper disability payments using quarterly wage records, but chose not to."""
http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/industries/food/2011-06-08-fda-chicken-arsenic_n.htm,2011-06-08 00:00:00,"['Mary Clare Jalonick', 'Associated Press']",FDA: Some chicken may have small amount of arsenic,"FDA: Some chicken may have small amount of arsenic

WASHINGTON  The Food and Drug Administration says some chicken meat may contain small amounts of arsenic, though the agency is stressing that the amount is too tiny to be dangerous to people who eat it.

The FDA said Wednesday that a new study by the agency shows that an ingredient in chicken feed that contains arsenic, called Roxarsone, may make its way into parts of the bird that are eaten. Previous studies have indicated the arsenic was eliminated with chicken waste.

Pfizer, which makes the feed ingredient, said Wednesday that it will pull it off the market in the United States. The FDA said it would be banned because it is a carcinogen.

Many poultry producers have already stopped feeding their birds the ingredient, which was used to kill parasites and promote growth.

The FDA said people do not need to stop eating chicken that may have been treated with the drug. Michael Taylor, FDA's deputy commissioner for foods, says the study raised ""concerns of a very low but completely avoidable exposure to a carcinogen.""

Pfizer said in a statement that its subsidiary, Alpharma, is suspending sales next month in response to the FDA findings. The company said it is not withdrawing the ingredient immediately so chicken producers have time to transition their birds off the drug.

Scott Brown of Pfizer Animal Health's Veterinary Medicine Research and Development division said the company also sells the ingredient in about a dozen other countries. He said Pfizer is reaching out to regulatory authorities in those countries and will decide whether to sell it on an individual basis.

In a study of 100 chickens, the FDA found that chickens that had eaten the Roxarsone had higher levels of inorganic arsenic — as opposed to organic arsenic, which is naturally occurring — in their livers than chickens that had not been fed Roxarsone. Inorganic arsenic is more toxic than the naturally occurring form.

Roxarsone has long been a concern for environmental groups worried about its presence in chicken waste and the resulting effects on human health in areas with high chicken production. Maryland state lawmakers have tried to force a ban in that state, saying the arsenic ends up in the Chesapeake Bay.

The National Chicken Council, which represents companies that produce and process chickens, said in a statement that the ingredient has been used to maintain good health in chickens for many years, and that it is used in ""many, but not all"" flocks.

""Chicken is safe to eat,"" the group said.

Working more could ultimately mean thousands of dollars less for you under a quirk in the new health-care law going into effect this fall. This could prompt some people to cut back on their hours to avoid losing money.

""Working more can actually leave you worse off,"" the price-comparison site ValuePenguin.com notes in a new analysis.

""It's sort of an absurd scenario,"" said Jonathan Wu, ValuePenguin.com's co-founder. ""It's something for people to be aware of.""

In that scenario, an individual or family whose annual income surpasses maximums set by the federal government—if only by $1—will totally lose subsidies available to buy health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.

(Read more: Obamacare fraud?)

The loss of those subsidies in some cases will mean that people potentially would have been better off financially if they had worked less during the year, Wu said. And they then would have to work significantly more to make up for the lost subsidy.

""I think they'd be surprised to see how drastic it is,"" said Wu. ""I'd be kind of shocked to see if I make $100 less (in total income each year), I get all these benefits, but if I make $100 more, I get nothing.""

""You basically don't want to fall in that hole,"" said Wu, adding that he believed contractors and others with more control over their incomes would be apt to adjust their hours worked to avoid the subsidy cliff.

He also said that because of lower insurance premiums often offered to younger people, the effect will more likely be seen by older people. But ""you will see it across all age groups"" in the seven states including New York and Vermont where insurance premiums are either barred from being affected by age, or restricted from being dramatically affected, he said.

Under the ACA, federal subsidies in the form of tax credits to buy insurance on new state health insurance exchanges will be available to millions of people who can start enrolling on those exchanges Oct. 1. The subsidies are available to people or families whose incomes total 400 percent above the federal poverty level or less, and are designed to cap their insurance premiums at 9.5 percent of their total income.

For a single person, that FPL income maximum is $45,960 per year. The maximums are adjusted upward for couples and families until maxing out at $94,200 for a family of four.



(Read more: Doctors skeptical, confused about Obamacare)

Under a scenario that ValuePenguin.com identified, a couple in Ohio, both age 50, would be eligible for subsidies worth $3,452 to purchase a so-called silver insurance plan—a moderately priced level of benefits under the ACA's scheme—that costs $9,346 annually if they made up to $62,040 per year.

But if they made just $1 more than that, they would lose the subsidy. Wu noted that the couple then would have to earn at least $65,492 to make up for the lost subsidy.

In New York, a family of three whose annual income totals $78,120, would pay $12,784 for the second-lower-priced silver plan on that state's insurance exchange. After getting a $5,363 tax credit, the family's net cost for the insurance would be $7,421.

But if the family earned even slightly more than $78,120, they would have to pay the entire $12,784 for the insurance because they then wouldn't qualify for the subsidy.

To make up for that, the family's annual income would have to reach $83,483, Wu said.

The stark effect of peoples' age in determining their risk from the subsidy cliff is seen in two examples from Connecticut.



(Read more: This could put Obamacare in the ER)

There, Wu said, a 27-year-old single man would pay $3,636 annually for the second-cheapest silver plan—less than the $4,366 cap on insurance premiums for individuals earning $45,960 or less annually. That person would not be eligible for subsidies, and thus would see no disincentive in working more hours.

But the annual premiums for a 50-year-old Connecticut couple buying that plan would be $12,468. If their combined incomes were $62,040 or less, they would receive $6,575 in subsidies to offset the cost.

However, if their income was more than that, they would lose the subsidies, leaving them out of pocket $6,575. They then would have to earn at least $68,615 to make up for that lost subsidy, Wu said.

With the end of the fiscal year looming, they aren’t offering the kinds of compromises that might produce a deal and avoid a government shutdown; instead, they’re drafting extremist legislation — bills that would, for example, cut clean-water grants by 83 percent — that has no chance of becoming law. Furthermore, they’re threatening, once again, to block any rise in the debt ceiling, a move that would damage the U.S. economy and possibly provoke a world financial crisis.

Yet even as Republican politicians seem ready to go on the offensive, there’s a palpable sense of anxiety, even despair, among conservative pundits and analysts. Better-informed people on the right seem, finally, to be facing up to a horrible truth: Health care reform, President Obama’s signature policy achievement, is probably going to work.

And the good news about Obamacare is, I’d argue, what’s driving the Republican Party’s intensified extremism. Successful health reform wouldn’t just be a victory for a president conservatives loathe, it would be an object demonstration of the falseness of right-wing ideology. So Republicans are being driven into a last, desperate effort to head this thing off at the pass.

Some background: Although you’d never know it from all the fulminations, with prominent Republicans routinely comparing Obamacare to slavery, the Affordable Care Act is based on three simple ideas. First, all Americans should have access to affordable insurance, even if they have pre-existing medical problems. Second, people should be induced or required to buy insurance even if they’re currently healthy, so that the risk pool remains reasonably favorable. Third, to prevent the insurance “mandate” from being too onerous, there should be subsidies to hold premiums down as a share of income."
http://news.yahoo.com/boehner-obama-why-break-businesses-174549696.html,,[],Boehner to Obama: Why a break for businesses only?,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Framing a new argument against President Barack Obama's health care law, congressional GOP leaders called Tuesday for a delay in the law's requirement that individual Americans carry health insurance.

If the White House can grant a one-year delay for employers — as the administration did just last week — individuals should get the same consideration, House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio and other senior Republicans said in a letter to the president.

""Your decision to delay one part of the law affecting employers and leave in place provisions regulating individual and family health care creates many new questions and concerns,"" the GOP leaders wrote. ""We agree with you that the burden was overwhelming for employers, but we also believe American families need the same relief.""

White House spokesman Jay Carney said the administration has no intention of delaying the individual mandate. He said the law provides financial aid to low-income Americans and is flexible so that people facing financial hardships aren't punished for going without coverage.

The criticism from top Republicans, he said, is ""pretty rich coming from leaders who have now voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act going on 40 times, and who promised to do it again, to charge up that hill, only again not to reach the top, rather than focus on the work that the American people want done because they have no alternative.""

Asked whether public confidence in the law could be eroded by delays and by the change in the smoking provision, Carney said, ""A piece of legislation like this, to be responsibly implemented, needs to be implemented in a flexible way.""

Nonetheless, Republicans hope their new argument will gain traction in next year's congressional elections, as the law's big push to cover the uninsured gets underway. Foes are betting the coverage rollout will be full of problems, particularly since about half the states have refused to support the federal effort.

Story continues

Under the law, middle-class people with no access to job-based coverage will be eligible for subsidized private insurance, while low-income uninsured people will be steered to an expanded version of Medicaid in states that accept it.

The health care law contains coverage requirements for individuals as well as companies with 50 or more workers. Both requirements were originally scheduled to take effect next Jan. 1.

Last week, the White House unexpectedly announced a one-year delay in the employer requirement, saying the administration needed more time to work out technical details that employers find too burdensome. Some saw a political motive, since Republicans have criticized the requirement on businesses as a ""job killer.""

But administration officials said that the individual mandate would remain in place.

The two requirements are different. While the mandate on individuals is expected to play a major role in getting people to sign up for coverage, the employer requirement is more of a backstop, designed to deter companies from shifting to the government their traditional role in providing health benefits.

The individual mandate applies to virtually every U.S. resident, with exceptions for financial hardship, people who entered the country illegally, and prison inmates. The coverage requirement survived a determined legal challenge by ""Obamacare"" opponents. A divided Supreme Court upheld the mandate last year, reasoning that the penalties which enforce it are taxes constitutionally levied by Congress.

Those individual penalties start small — as little as $95 next year — but they build up with time. The Congressional Budget Office estimated last year some 4 million individuals without insurance will pay about $55 billion in penalties over the course of nearly a decade. The overwhelming majority of Americans already have coverage — through an employer, a government program, or by buying their own plan — and will not have to worry about the fines.

The GOP leaders' letter also requested that the administration provide detailed information on the impact of its decision to delay the employer mandate.

Jan Brewer (R) through the state legislature on Thursday.

Although Obama's health care law continues to divide elected officials and the public along starkly partisan lines, Brewer is one of nine Republican governors who have bucked their party and embraced the Medicaid expansion.

""With landmark votes today in the House and Senate, legislators have tackled the issue that is Job One every session -- adoption of a responsible State budget -- and enacted Arizona’s most sweeping health care legislation in decades,"" Brewer said in a news release after the vote Thursday. ""It will extend cost-effective care to Arizona’s working poor, using the very tax dollars our citizens already pay to the federal government.""

The Arizona governor aggressively promoted the Medicaid expansion since taking her surprising public stand earlier this year. Brewer assembled a coalition of health care interests and business groups and worked alongside Democratic legislators in addition to campaigning across the state in service of extending health coverage to hundreds of thousands of poor Arizonans using Obamacare funding.

Brewer played hardball with Republican legislative leaders in the state to get her way, earning their ire in the process. She followed through on her threat to veto any bill not addressing the Medicaid expansion last month. On Tuesday, she raised the stakes by calling a special session and forcing the temporarily adjourned legislature back to work on Medicaid and the state's budget.

Democratic lawmakers in both chambers unanimously voted for the Medicaid legislation. ""We have done truly the right thing for the people of this state,"" state Senate Minority Leader Leah Landrum Taylor said during the vote Thursday.

Republican legislative leaders and conservative lawmakers have bristled at Brewer's embrace of the expansion, a key component of Obamacare, and objected to her calling a special session when the legislature was scheduled to reconvene later in the week anyway.

""I'm deeply and profoundly disappointed at the manner in which this came down,"" said Senate President Andy Biggs, before voting against the measure Thursday.

""This proposal is not a freebie for Arizona taxpayers,"" said state Sen. Nancy Barto, a Republican and the chairwoman of the health committee, on the floor Thursday. ""Here we are, once again, putting ourselves at the mercy of the federal government.""

The political fallout from the split among Arizona Republicans won't have an immediate effect on Brewer's electoral future: She can't seek another four years as governor when her time runs out next year because of state term limits. She ascended from Arizona secretary of state to the governor's office when Obama tapped then-Gov. Janet Napolitano (D) to be his secretary of homeland security in 2009; voters reelected Brewer in 2010.

Arizona is among the 29 states and the District of Columbia with chief executives who support expanding Medicaid under Obamacare to anyone who earns less than 133 percent of the federal poverty level, which is $15,282 for a single person this year. Majority-Republican legislatures in a number of states have stymied expansions endorsed by their governors, including Florida's Rick Scott (R), Ohio's John Kasich (R), Michigan's Rick Snyder (R), Missouri's Jay Nixon (D) and others.

""This is a big deal because Arizona and Gov. Brewer are very conservative,"" said Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a consumer advocacy organization that supports the health care reform law. ""It shows that at least for this governor and this state, practicality and common sense has prevailed over ideology and partisanship,"" he said. ""This is a reflection of what we're going to see over time in many other states across the country.""

But about a dozen Republican governors, including Rick Perry of Texas and Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, remain opposed to broadening the program, citing opposition to Obama's health care law and the expense of the expansion. The Supreme Court ruling that upheld the law last year gave states the right to opt out of its Medicaid provisions.

Under the law, the federal government will pay the full cost of the Medicaid expansion from 2014 through 2016, after which the federal share will gradually decline until it reaches 90 percent in 2022 and beyond. Currently, the federal government covers an average of 57 percent of Medicaid costs and the states pay the remainder.

States that refuse the expansion risk losing $8.4 billion in federal money and face $1 billion in new state spending on programs to compensate hospitals that treat people without health insurance, according to an analysis released last week by the Rand Corporation. About 3.4 million people who could have gained health coverage under Obamacare will remain uninsured next year because of states that won't expand the program, Avalere Health estimated.

The uninsured rate in Arizona was 18 percent in 2011, when 1.2 million residents lacked health insurance, according to census data compiled by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation.

Unique factors affecting Arizona's Medicaid program, called the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System or AHCCCS, played a role in Brewer's decision to set aside her staunch opposition to Obamacare.

In 2011, a federal court allowed Brewer to freeze enrollment of adults without children into Medicaid to resolve a budget crunch, which resulted in more than 140,000 fewer people on the program, according to Brewer. Accepting Obamacare's federally financed expansion enables Arizona to reopen Medicaid without having to pay about half the cost. This is why Brewer consistently refers to her Medicaid plan as a ""restoration"" of the program.

Moreover, Arizona expanded Medicaid to cover all adults below the poverty line based on a ballot initiative approved by voters in 2000, which Brewer has cited as justification for participating in the Obamacare Medicaid expansion.

In 1982, Arizona became the last state to join Medicaid, a program President Lyndon Johnson enacted in 1965. Arizona pioneered the use of private health insurance companies to administer the program, an approach since copied by nearly every state.

Unfortunately, there is also no limit to the amount that can be billed against the Medicaid recipient's assets by the state. And Estate Recovery seeks a 100% payback of whatever each state determines are expenses they want to recover for. In other words, if you are 55-64, and depending on what state you are in and what services you use, Medicaid may not be an insurance program: it is a loan.



While it seems a lot of people are under the impression that Estate Recovery is only for long term care, this is not the case in many states. Hat tip to Phoebe Loosinhouse, who provided this link in a comment in the previous diary:

For those who want to submerge themselves in a real wonkfest AARP Medicaid Estate Recovery, a 2004 Survey of State Programs and Practices.

According to an AARP chart, states that seek to recover ALL costs, possibly including ""capitation charges"" (more on that in a minute) include:

AL, AZ, CA, DE, FL, HI, IL, IN, IA, KY, ME, MD, MN, MT, NE, NH, NJ, NY, ND, OH, OK, OR, RI, TN, UT, VA.

So on to some interesting articles I have been reading. Here's one:

Estates could owe Medicaid in which Beth Duffy writes:



For the sake of the 15 million individuals expected to accept their states’ forms of Medicaid expansion health care programs commencing this autumn — including a projected 150,000 Iowans — I hope they ask, “Hey, does this mean my estate is subject to Medicaid rules and therefore must reimburse the government for my health care benefits when I die?”

Will Iowa’s new federally mandated program perpetuate Medicaid’s status of “statutory loan program” subject to debt-obligation and estate reimbursement? If so, Medicaid expansion could unintentionally create a tragic new cycle of poverty.

And Professor Duffy concludes:If you're thinking that it should be easy and straightforward to get information on a state's Estate Recovery policies and procedures, guess again:

In Medicaid Estate Recovery Mystification, Attorney John Payne writes:



One of the core principles of government in the United States is transparency. Freedom of the press and laws that require government agencies to provide information to citizens on request are considered essential to keeping our bureaucrats, mandarins, syndics and pashas more honest than they might otherwise be. However, as in many states, Michigan Department of Human Services and Department of Community Health, which administer welfare programs, are exempt from the public notice and open meetings laws that govern other departments.

And now about those those pesky capitation charges:

Dr. Jane M. Orient writes in Medicaid is a tax on the estates of the poor:



In Arizona, where all Medicaid beneficiaries are enrolled in a managed-care plan, their estates could be repaying “benefits” even if the enrollee never actually received any goods or services. Information provided by the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System (Arizona’s Medicaid program) explains that the program makes a monthly capitation payment of around $3,340 to “program contractors,” who arrange for services, if any. It warns, in bold print: “It is important to be aware that capitation payments can exceed the actual costs of services provided during the month.”

Medicaid, supposed to be a program to help the poor, has become a cash cow for multibillion-dollar, managed-care companies, who milk federal and state taxpayers. Expanding Medicaid to persons with modest assets will enable estate recovery to become a cash cow for states to milk the poor and the middle class.

In a curious exercise of age discrimination, the recovery program only applies to people who are over age 55. Essentially, estate recovery turns government financial help to frail seniors of modest means into a loan program with collection taking place at death. If Medicaid helped pay for any of your care, your estate will be forced to repay the government after you die. Estate recovery is a Medicaid “death tax” imposed only on the elderly. The program has been referred to as “picking the bones of the poor,” and “sucking the last ounce of blood from the corpse.”

Dr. Orient concludes:Elderlaw attorney Jeffrey Marshall writes in: Medicaid Estate Recovery - A Medicaid Death Tax In case you're thinking: well, this isn't so bad - it won't affect you until you're dead, right? Not so fast.

Here's a piece by Carol J. Wessels, who is an attorney in Wisconsin: Will Medicaid Recipients Ever be Able to Sell Their Homes Under Wisconsin’s New Budget Law?

A summary of the Kafkaesque system she describes wouldn't make much sense. As with the rest of these articles, it's best to just go read the whole thing. At the end of it she asks:



This causes me to wonder why the state is taking such draconian steps against elderly individuals, just because they had the foresight to invest in the American Dream, a home. An individual who was less frugal, frittered money away and did not invest in a home, would receive the same Medicaid benefits, and not be penalized for being a homeowner. Even more offensive is that as far as I can tell, a homeowner can commit a crime and go to prison, receive food, housing and medical care there, which the State is required to provide, and still come out with no lien on their home. If I am wrong about that, I hope someone will point it out. Said another way, should Wisconsin treat its frail elderly worse than criminals? I guess our legislature thinks so.

Thanks for reading. Let's keep the discussion going."

Two-year improvement in Medicare finances over last year%27s report

Social Security trust fund outlook unchanged from last year

President Obama determined to work with Congress on long-term plan%2C Lew said

WASHINGTON -- The federal Medicare trust fund will be exhausted in 2026, two years later than last year's forecast, according to the Medicare trustees report released Friday.

The report, which also projected the Social Security system trust fund would be exhausted by 2033, is expected to influence upcoming congressional debates over the nation's debt ceiling, proposals to reduce the deficit and the future of entitlement programs.

Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew called the change for Medicare a modest improvement.

""But more has to be done,"" Lew said. ""The president recognizes how essential reform is, and he is determined to work on a bipartisan basis to put Social Security and Medicare on stronger footing.""

Last year, the report said the Medicare and Social Security trust funds were both on ""unsustainable paths"" — as they have been for years — and will be exhausted by 2024 and 2033, respectively. The Social Security projection was unchanged.

But after several reports of continuing lowered costs in health care spending, including a reduced projection of spending from the Congressional Budget Office, it was expected that the trustees might change that date for Medicare.

Earlier this month, the CBO determined projected Medicare and Medicaid spending would drop $618 billion over the next decade. That's 5% less than they projected in early 2010.

While some of that decrease can be attributed to the recession, analysts say changes in Medicare payment systems, reductions in hospital readmissions, a move toward generic medications and better efficiency from providers have affected both government and private spending.

""The Medicare report demonstrates once again the importance of the Affordable Care Act, which has strengthened Medicare's finances by reining in health care costs,"" Lew said. The trustees extended Medicare projections by eight years when the law was passed in 2010.

Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius cited the reduced hospital readmissions, fraud and payment changes as reasons for the improved Medicare outlook and that the improvement came without cutting mandatory Medicare benefits.

""With the health care law, our goal was to put Medicare on more stable footing,"" she said, adding that it was just a start.

Sebelius cited recent reports that show the slowdown in health care spending is due to factors beyond the recession, saying that costs have slowed for the past three years. Medicare spending is at 1% below the GDP, and Medicaid spending is down 2%, she said. She also said the Medicare Part B premium will remain the same for next year as it was this year.

While Medicare's outlook improved, policy makers should not overlook bad news for the Social Security disability program, said Pamela Villarreal, senior fellow for the National Center for Policy Analysis, a conservative think tank. That program is expected to be insolvent in three years, after which time, the government would be able to pay only 80% of scheduled benefits.

""America just got poorer,"" she said in a statement. ""We've promised benefits that far exceed expected revenue. The total amount we owe is more than four times the size of the economy.""

Her group also said it is ""by no means certain"" that Affordable Care Act cuts in physicians' fees would be enacted as Republicans continue to try to gut the law.

Trustee Robert Reischauer acknowledged that both Medicare and Social Security are on unsustainable paths, though he said he is ""cautiously optimistic"" that health spending will continue to slow and the health care law will continue to help. He said there is ""low-hanging fruit,"" such as addressing hospital infection rates, for continued cost savings.

Trustee Seth Harris, the acting secretary of Labor, said the improving economy is helping both programs. Comprehensive immigration reform is needed, Harris said, to bring ""millions out of the shadows"" so they can contribute to the funds.

The trustees emphasized the need to find ways to improve the long-term financial outlook for both trust funds, and interest groups reacted Friday by saying reduced benefits should not be the answer.

""The best way to preserve and reinforce our social safety net over the long haul is to ensure that millionaires and billionaires pay the same Social Security contribution rates on all wages just like everybody else,"" said Jim Dean, chairman of the advocacy group Democracy for America.

Americans pay Social Security taxes up to $113,700 in annual income; any income higher than that is not taxed for Social Security.

Projections for lower Medicare spending are ""due to successful innovations in the private sector,"" said Mary Grealy, president of the Healthcare Leadership Council, which opposes reductions in Medicare funding. Anything that cuts payments for Medicare services would damage such innovations, she said.

The American Hospital Association also released a statement praising private-sector decreases in health care costs: ""The Trustees Report states that actual 2012 benefit payments were lower than projected in large part due to lower wage and price growth at hospitals and health systems,"" said president Rich Umbdenstock. ""Hospitals are contributing to these trends, with hospital cost growth at its lowest rate in 10 years.""

Proposed changes in immigration laws could also boost Medicare, according to a report released earlier this week by researchers at Harvard University Medical School. That showed that immigrants contributed about $115 billion more from their paychecks to the Medicare Trust Fund than they took out over a seven-year period in the past decade, and that the number could be greater if more people were allowed to remain in the country legally.

Last year's 2024 date for exhaustion of the Medicare trust fund was the same as predicted in 2011, while trustees moved up the date for the Social Security fund exhaustion by three years compared with 2011. The trustees have predicted the depletion of the Medicare trust fund every year since they began issuing reports in 1970. After 2033, income from the dedicated payroll tax is expected to finance about three quarters of scheduled benefits through 2087.

Last year, then-Treasury secretary Timothy Geithner predicted the law would lower costs and that without it Medicare's trust fund would be exhausted in 2016."

So far, it doesn't look like he's succeeding. By the end of the day Tuesday, Boehner will present a plan that attempts to fake out Senate Democrats and force any possibility of a shutdown into their court.

The plan reportedly is to pass what they're calling a ""clean"" continuing resolution bill for funding the government for the next three months that includes a separate House concurrent resolution to defund Obamacare. They would create a rule to govern debate on the bill that said the House wouldn't send the funding part of the bill over to the Senate until that body voted on the Obamacare defunding part of the bill. The Senate would vote down the defunding measure so they could go onto the spending bill. That would allow Republicans to declare that Senate Democrats ""own"" Obamacare, a threat that said Democrats can probably live with.

The proposal has gone over like a lead balloon with the far right. Club for Growth president Chris Chocola calls the proposal a ""bad joke,"" and said ""[t]rying to fool Republicans into voting to fund ObamaCare is even worse than offering a bill that deliberately funds it."" Teabagger House members are also not mollified, still demanding a continuing resolution that defunds Obamacare. Eighty of them signed a letter to Boehner to that effect, and an aide told The Hill that they ""are still expected to vote against any continuing resolution that does not defund ObamaCare.""

But the Obamacare defunding might just be a sideshow for Boehner and Majority Leader Eric Cantor, who have their eye on another prize: maintaining the sequester level of federal spending for everything but defense. Cantor told his caucus that this would be their victory, forcing the president to sign a continuing resolution that ""wipes away all the increases he and congressional Democrats made while they were in charge and returns us to a pre-2008 level of discretionary spending.” Salon's Brian Beutler outlines this part of the plan Boehner and Cantor might decide to take.



The new fiscal year starts on October 1. To adhere to the debt limit deal, Congress would pass a CR appropriating $1.058 trillion — $552 billion for defense, $506 billion for non defense. Then, sequestration would automatically reduce that to an annualized rate of $967 billion. The advantage off writing the CR this way is that if at any point Congress manages to agree on a plan to replace sequestration, discretionary spending will automatically increase to the levels agreed up on in 2011. But GOP leaders keep hinting at writing the CR to reflect a maximum appropriation of $988 billion — the same amount the government is spending under sequestration right now.

The sequestration measure would then kick in to make the actual spending level $967 billion for the next year. The $21 billion difference between the appropriated $988 billion and the $967 billion limit would be plowed into defense spending, while cash-starved domestic programs would continue to have to function on their sequester-reduced budgets. Cute trick for Boehner, if he can pull it off. But Democrats are full aware of his plans, and are demanding a truly ""clean"" continuing resolution with ""no funny business,"" according to an aide to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.

If this is the path Boehner decides on, he also has to get it past his own Republicans, because he won't have any Democratic support. Given how devoted the extremists in his caucus are to really, truly defunding Obamacare (or at least trying to) he might not get that far, and he might have to shoulder responsibility for a shutdown fight anyway."

http://news.yahoo.com/sarah-palin-tells-iowa-conservatives-time-stiffen-backs-055045732--sector.html,,[],Sarah Palin tells Iowa conservatives it's time 'to stiffen our backs',"By Kay Henderson DES MOINES, Iowa (Reuters) - Former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, who rallied members of the Tea Party in their failed effort to defund Obamacare, lashed out on Saturday against members of the Republican Party who agreed to end the government shutdown. The 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee's comments during a speech in Des Moines come at a time of division within the party over the strategy conservative members of Congress adopted in forcing a 16-day shutdown of the federal government last month. Polls have shown voters blamed Republicans for the shutdown. Palin, who was speaking to hundreds of attendees at the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition's annual fall banquet, was joined by Senator Mike Lee, a Republican from Utah. Lee, along with fellow Tea Party movement star Senator Ted Cruz, was instrumental in the ill-fated attempt to defund Obamacare, the popular name for the healthcare reform law championed by President Barack Obama. Palin told the Christian conservatives in attendance it was time to ""stiffen our spines"" for the 2014 elections. ""I want to encourage you to make your voice heard, to hold politicians accountable,"" Palin said. The bulk of Palin's speech was focused on the nation's current political climate. She drew thunderous applause with her sharp attack on Republicans in Congress who voted in October to raise the nation's debt ceiling and reopen the government. ""They promised that they would do everything in their power to fight against socialized medicine, against Obamacare, but when it came time to stand and defund it, they waved the white flag of surrender and they threw under the bus the good guys who did stand up and fight for us,"" Palin said. Palin named Lee and Cruz as leaders in that fight. Last month, Cruz also made a stop in Iowa, a key state in presidential campaigns because the Iowa caucuses are the first electoral event in the nominating process. In 2010 Lee defeated three-term Republican Senator Bob Bennett in a primary on his way to winning the Senate seat. In his speech on Saturday, he called on Republicans to offer up ""market-based alternatives"" that could replace Obamacare if the Republicans hope to have success at the polls in 2014. ""Frustration is not a platform. Anger is not an agenda and outrage, as a habit, is not even conservative,"" Lee said. (Editing by Alex Dobuzinskis)"

http://news.yahoo.com/study-health-overhaul-raise-claims-cost-32-pct-173335479--politics.html,,[],Study: Health overhaul to raise claims cost 32 pct,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Insurance companies will have to pay out an average of 32 percent more for medical claims on individual health policies under President Barack Obama's overhaul, the nation's leading group of financial risk analysts has estimated.

That's likely to increase premiums for at least some Americans buying individual plans.

The report by the Society of Actuaries could turn into a big headache for the Obama administration at a time when many parts of the country remain skeptical about the Affordable Care Act.

While some states will see medical claims costs per person decline, the report concluded the overwhelming majority will see double-digit increases in their individual health insurance markets, where people purchase coverage directly from insurers.

The disparities are striking. By 2017, the estimated increase would be 62 percent for California, about 80 percent for Ohio, more than 20 percent for Florida and 67 percent for Maryland. Much of the reason for the higher claims costs is that sicker people are expected to join the pool, the report said.

The report did not make similar estimates for employer plans, the mainstay for workers and their families. That's because the primary impact of Obama's law is on people who don't have coverage through their jobs.

The administration questions the design of the study, saying it focused only on one piece of the puzzle and ignored cost relief strategies in the law such as tax credits to help people afford premiums and special payments to insurers who attract an outsize share of the sick. The study also doesn't take into account the potential price-cutting effect of competition in new state insurance markets that will go live on Oct. 1, administration officials said.

At a White House briefing on Tuesday, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said some of what passes for health insurance today is so skimpy it can't be compared to the comprehensive coverage available under the law. ""Some of these folks have very high catastrophic plans that don't pay for anything unless you get hit by a bus,"" she said. ""They're really mortgage protection, not health insurance.""

Story continues

A prominent national expert, recently retired Medicare chief actuary Rick Foster, said the report does ""a credible job"" of estimating potential enrollment and costs under the law, ""without trying to tilt the answers in any particular direction.""

""Having said that,"" Foster added, ""actuaries tend to be financially conservative, so the various assumptions might be more inclined to consider what might go wrong than to anticipate that everything will work beautifully."" Actuaries use statistics and economic theory to make long-range cost projections for insurance and pension programs sponsored by businesses and government. The society is headquartered near Chicago.

Kristi Bohn, an actuary who worked on the study, acknowledged it did not attempt to estimate the effect of subsidies, insurer competition and other factors that could mitigate cost increases. She said the goal was to look at the underlying cost of medical care.

""Claims cost is the most important driver of health care premiums,"" she said.

""We don't see ourselves as a political organization,"" Bohn added. ""We are trying to figure out what the situation at hand is.""

On the plus side, the report found the law will cover more than 32 million currently uninsured Americans when fully phased in. And some states — including New York and Massachusetts — will see double-digit declines in costs for claims in the individual market.

Uncertainty over costs has been a major issue since the law passed three years ago, and remains so just months before a big push to cover the uninsured gets rolling Oct. 1. Middle-class households will be able to purchase subsidized private insurance in new marketplaces, while low-income people will be steered to Medicaid and other safety net programs. States are free to accept or reject a Medicaid expansion also offered under the law.

Obama has promised that the new law will bring costs down. That seems a stretch now. While the nation has been enjoying a lull in health care inflation the past few years, even some former administration advisers say a new round of cost-curbing legislation will be needed.

Bohn said the study overall presents a mixed picture.

Millions of now-uninsured people will be covered as the market for directly purchased insurance more than doubles with the help of government subsidies. The study found that market will grow to more than 25 million people. But costs will rise because spending on sicker people and other high-cost groups will overwhelm an influx of younger, healthier people into the program.

Some of the higher-cost cases will come from existing state high-risk insurance pools. Those people will now be able to get coverage in the individual insurance market, since insurance companies will no longer be able to turn them down. Other people will end up buying their own plans because their employers cancel coverage. While some of these individuals might save money for themselves, they will end up raising costs for others.

Part the reason for the wide disparities in the study is that states have different populations and insurance rules. In the relatively small number of states where insurers were already restricted from charging higher rates to older, sicker people, the cost impact is less.

""States are starting from different starting points, and they are all getting closer to one another,"" said Bohn.

The study also did not model the likely patchwork results from some states accepting the law's Medicaid expansion while others reject it. It presented estimates for two hypothetical scenarios in which all states either accept or reject the expansion.

Larry Levitt, an insurance expert with the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, reviewed the report and said the actuaries need to answer more questions.

""I'd generally characterize it as providing useful background information, but I don't think it's complete enough to be treated as a projection,"" Levitt said. The conclusion that employers with sicker workers would drop coverage is ""speculative,"" he said.

Another caveat: The Society of Actuaries contracted Optum, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, to do the number-crunching that drives the report. United also owns the nation's largest health insurance company. Bohn said the study reflects the professional conclusions of the society, not Optum or its parent company.

http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/10/us/politics/10obama.text.html,2009-09-10 00:00:00,[],Obama’s Health Care Speech to Congress,"Well the time for bickering is over. The time for games has passed. Now is the season for action. Now is when we must bring the best ideas of both parties together, and show the American people that we can still do what we were sent here to do. Now is the time to deliver on health care.

The plan I'm announcing tonight would meet three basic goals:

It will provide more security and stability to those who have health insurance. It will provide insurance to those who don't. And it will slow the growth of health care costs for our families, our businesses, and our government. It's a plan that asks everyone to take responsibility for meeting this challenge – not just government and insurance companies, but employers and individuals. And it's a plan that incorporates ideas from Senators and Congressmen; from Democrats and Republicans – and yes, from some of my opponents in both the primary and general election.

Here are the details that every American needs to know about this plan:

First, if you are among the hundreds of millions of Americans who already have health insurance through your job, Medicare, Medicaid, or the VA, nothing in this plan will require you or your employer to change the coverage or the doctor you have. Let me repeat this: nothing in our plan requires you to change what you have.

What this plan will do is to make the insurance you have work better for you. Under this plan, it will be against the law for insurance companies to deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition. As soon as I sign this bill, it will be against the law for insurance companies to drop your coverage when you get sick or water it down when you need it most. They will no longer be able to place some arbitrary cap on the amount of coverage you can receive in a given year or a lifetime. We will place a limit on how much you can be charged for out-of-pocket expenses, because in the United States of America, no one should go broke because they get sick. And insurance companies will be required to cover, with no extra charge, routine checkups and preventive care, like mammograms and colonoscopies – because there's no reason we shouldn't be catching diseases like breast cancer and colon cancer before they get worse. That makes sense, it saves money, and it saves lives.

That's what Americans who have health insurance can expect from this plan – more security and stability.

Now, if you're one of the tens of millions of Americans who don't currently have health insurance, the second part of this plan will finally offer you quality, affordable choices. If you lose your job or change your job, you will be able to get coverage. If you strike out on your own and start a small business, you will be able to get coverage. We will do this by creating a new insurance exchange – a marketplace where individuals and small businesses will be able to shop for health insurance at competitive prices. Insurance companies will have an incentive to participate in this exchange because it lets them compete for millions of new customers. As one big group, these customers will have greater leverage to bargain with the insurance companies for better prices and quality coverage. This is how large companies and government employees get affordable insurance. It's how everyone in this Congress gets affordable insurance. And it's time to give every American the same opportunity that we've given ourselves.

For those individuals and small businesses who still cannot afford the lower-priced insurance available in the exchange, we will provide tax credits, the size of which will be based on your need. And all insurance companies that want access to this new marketplace will have to abide by the consumer protections I already mentioned. This exchange will take effect in four years, which will give us time to do it right. In the meantime, for those Americans who can't get insurance today because they have pre-existing medical conditions, we will immediately offer low-cost coverage that will protect you against financial ruin if you become seriously ill. This was a good idea when Senator John McCain proposed it in the campaign, it's a good idea now, and we should embrace it."

Ted Cruz rallied conservatives to keep up the fight to unravel ObamaCare, ahead of a White House meeting where his colleagues were expected to dial back their demands for changes to the health law as part of a possible deal to end the partial government shutdown.

Cruz and his Tea Party-aligned colleagues spoke at the annual Values Voter Summit in Washington, D.C., Friday morning.

The Texas senator, who along with Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, helped drive the showdown with the White House over ObamaCare, joked that he'd be heading next to the meeting with his colleagues at the White House, and ""if I'm never seen again, please send a search-and-rescue team.""

But Cruz also delivered a stern message to conservatives, amid signs that the upcoming meeting could lead Senate GOP leaders to dial back their demands on ObamaCare.

""We're nearing the edge of a cliff,"" Cruz said, focusing his remarks almost exclusively on the health law. ""What does it take to win this fight? It takes the men and women in this room.""

Cruz also urged the House of Representatives to keep ""standing strong.""

Cruz and his allies had demanded that ObamaCare be defunded as part of any spending bill. Failure to reach an agreement with Democrats resulted in the partial government shutdown which started Oct. 1. Lawmakers are now grappling with both the spending debate and a looming Oct 17 deadline to raise the debt ceiling.

House Republicans pitched a plan to the White House Thursday night to approve a short-term debt-ceiling increase, but President Obama pushed back because it did not address the partial shutdown.

Senate Republicans are now crafting an alternate proposal that deals with both. It includes a provision dealing with ObamaCare, but is far short of what Cruz campaigned for -- and advocated with a 21-hour address on the Senate floor last month.

The emerging proposal comes from Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and others. It would propose a six-month extension of government spending, a repeal of the health care law's medical device tax and greater flexibility for agencies to deal with across-the-board spending cuts in effect this year.

Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said the goal was ending the partial shutdown and raising the debt limit, but said, ""We will not defund ObamaCare.""

Cruz, decrying the health law as a ""train wreck,"" claimed the American people remain ""energized"" around the goal of gutting the law. He claimed it is causing ""enormous harm"" to the economy -- though the administration says there's no hard evidence that the economy is being hurt by the roll-out.

Cruz was also interrupted more than a half-dozen times by protesters. To the delight of the audience, he repeatedly accused them of being Obama's ""political operatives.""

""How scared is the president?"" Cruz asked, as another protester was escorted.

Where the budget and debt talks go from here is unclear. One reason Senate Republicans might step up with a new plan is because Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid seemed to dismiss a key detail of the proposal from House Speaker John Boehner.

Reid said negotiations before the government reopens -- a key part of Boehner's proposal -- were ""not going to happen.""

Reid has proposed extending the debt limit through 2014, which would boost the current $16.7 trillion debt limit by around $1 trillion. He has been planning for a test vote by Saturday on the measure, which has no other conditions, but Republicans may have enough votes to block it unless he agrees to changes.

(CNN) - While some Republican senators are calling for Congress to defund Obamacare altogether, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine used the GOP weekly address Saturday to call for an adjustment in the health care law, not a rejection of the law in its entirety.

Collins takes issue with the Affordable Care Act's characterization of a full-time employee as someone who works 30 hours a week.



The president's health care reform, which was passed by Congress in 2010 and upheld by the Supreme Court last year, will require businesses that employ at least 50 full-time workers to provide health insurance or face a penalty, starting in 2015. The provision was originally supposed to kick in next year, but the administration delayed it to give employers more time to prepare for the change.

Collins said the 30-hour mark for ""full-time"" employees will ""only cause some businesses to reluctantly reduce the hours of their workers to fewer than 30 hours per week.""

She gave an example of a school system in Maine that is already ""preparing to track and cap the number of hours that substitute teachers can work to ensure that they don't work more than 29 hours a week.""

""Fewer hours means less money in the teachers' paychecks and more disruption for their students,"" she added.

She introduced a bill, ""Forty Hours is Full Time Act,"" in April that seeks to modify the federal definition of a full-time employee.

""Of course, fixing this one flaw won't solve the countless problems caused by Obamacare. But it would help ensure that millions of American workers do not have their hours, and their paychecks, reduced,"" she said.

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney argued in a press briefing last month that there is no data to indicate businesses are not hiring full-time employees because of the 30-hour mark.

""I would say broadly that if you look at the economic data, the suggestion that the ACA is reducing full-time employment is belied by the facts,"" he said.

1. All Americans, even those with pre-existing conditions, should have access to affordable health insurance

2. All Americans, even those currently healthy, should be required (or induced) to buy insurance to spread the risks as broadly as possible to keep the costs reasonable

3. There should be subsidiess to prevent the ""mandate"" from becoming too onerous, so that the cost of premiums as a share of income can be held down.

As to whether this approach can work, despite the Republican predictions that it will fail, we of course have the example of Romneycare in Massachusetts (based, I remind people, largely on a proposal from the Right-leaning Heritage Foundation). Krugman then explores whether larger starters with significant numbers of uninsured can duplicate what happened in the Bay State.

The answer to this question depends, in the first place, on whether insurance companies are willing to offer coverage at reasonable rates. And the answer, so far, is a clear “yes.” In California, insurers came in with bids running significantly below expectations; in New York, it appears that premiums will be cut roughly in half.

apologies, but the latter link counts against your monthly quota from the NYTimes, so you might not be able to see it.

Krugman offers two paragraphs that frame the issue succinctly. In the first he writes



Over all, then, health reform will help millions of Americans who were previously either too sick or too poor to get the coverage they needed, and also offer a great deal of reassurance to millions more who currently have insurance but fear losing it; it will provide these benefits at the expense of a much smaller number of other Americans, mostly the very well off. It is, if you like, a plan to comfort the afflicted while (slightly) afflicting the comfortable.

So far the American people do not yet fully grasp that the vast majority of them will be better off with respect to medical insurance without being hit directly financially by the cost of premiums. A small number of better off Americans will wind up paying somewhat more. If the American people understand this, attempting to sabotage Obamacare will have serious political implications for Republicans.

There is also another problem for the GOP:



And the prospect that such a plan might succeed is anathema to a party whose whole philosophy is built around doing just the opposite, of taking from the “takers” and giving to the “job creators,” known to the rest of us as the “rich.” Hence the brinkmanship.

Krugman is very blunt about that philosophy, but then, we can remember a certain presidential candidate who complained about he 47% who are takers.

brinkmanship - the willingness of the Republicans, particularly among their tea party caucus members in the House, to risk shutting down the government and crashing the economy in order to prevent the success of Obamacare,

when their own leaders have admitted that confrontations over the budget inflict substantial harm on the economy.

It will not be because of fear of what is now a rapidly falling budget deficit.

Nor, Krugman opines, will it be because they true believe that the slashing of federal spending will actually lead to increased prosperity.



No, Republicans may be willing to risk economic and financial crisis solely in order to deny essential health care and financial security to millions of their fellow Americans. Let’s hear it for their noble cause!

Let me if I may explain just a bit what that noble cause is, paraphrasing well-known words of the first (and greatest) Republican President:

Government of the wealthy, by the Republicans, for the corporations

Anything that might threaten that paradigm is to be fought fiercely

- that includes suppressing the votes of those who might vote for a different paradigm

- that means fomenting fear and hatred on issues like guns in order to gin up an angry mob to vote against their own economic interests

- that includes gerrymandering to minimize the impact of votes of the masses of people who either do not agree with their paradigm or who may not be able to be misled by the promotion of fear and hatred

It is the mentality of the American Colonel who said in Vietnam that in order to save the village we had to destroy it.

It is the petulance of the child who if he can't have his way wants to take the ball and go home, even if someone else brought the ball.

If you wonder why the House Republicans have now voted almost 40 times to try to kill Obamacare, it is because if it succeeds, not only will they not be able to roll it back, but it also undercuts any arguments about the other social programs that for half a century or more they have tried to kill - Medicare, Medicaid and most of all Social Security.

Panic is the right words to describe Republican actions towards Obamacare.

Petulance is another appropriate description.

Which is why the White House and the Democrats have to hold firm

- for the health (physical and economic) of the American people

- for the future (economic and political) of the United States."

USA TODAY

Former president says national health care law will help many get insurance coverage

Clinton urges opponents and supporters to work together to implement law

Republicans have criticized law as %27Obamacare%2C%27 say it%27s costly government intrusion

Bill Clinton wore his ""Secretary of Explaining Stuff"" hat Wednesday to defend President Obama's health care law, arguing that it's time to drop opposition to what Republicans slam as ""Obamacare.""

""We need all hands on deck here. The health of our people, the security and stability of our families and the strength of our economy are all riding on getting health care reform right and doing it well,"" Clinton said in remarks at his presidential library in Little Rock. ""That means we have to do it together.""

The speech by the 42nd president is the first in a series of events planned this fall by the Obama White House aimed at improving public awareness of the law as key provisions take effect. On Oct. 1, open enrollment and health insurance exchanges in states will begin. Those exchanges will help people find and buy insurance coverage.

Clinton outlined why he says the law will help health care costs go down and give more people greater access to insurance coverage. He took a step-by-step approach, going through everything in the law from who gets covered to how exchanges work and what needs to be improved.

""This does give us the best chance we have to achieve nearly universal coverage, provide higher quality health care and lower the rate of cost increases, which we have got to do in a competitive global economy,"" he said.

Republicans generally view the law as a costly government intrusion into people's lives. The Tea Party movement and congressional allies, such as Sen. Mike Lee of Utah and Ted Cruz of Texas, have spent the summer drumming up support to withhold funding to implement the Affordable Care Act.

These lawmakers say they are prepared to vote against any bill to fund the government that doesn't bar spending for the health care law – even if it prompts a government shutdown.

""If this was the best defense of the increasingly unpopular law that the administration could muster, it doesn't bode well for Democrats running in 2014,"" RNC Chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement. ""And it certainly isn't fair to all of the people who trusted the president to keep his promise that this would make health care more affordable. Instead, Americans across the country are feeling the real effects of this law all across the country — hours cut, jobs lost, premiums rising.""

It's not the first time Obama has turned to Clinton, with whom he once had a frosty relationship, to help him explain policies and garner public support.

Clinton campaigned often for Obama in the 2012 election and delivered a forceful speech at the Democratic National Convention arguing why Obama was worthy of a second term. Obama joked afterward that he should appoint his predecessor the ""Secretary of Explaining Stuff,"" and the moniker stuck.

Working more could ultimately mean thousands of dollars less for you under a quirk in the new health-care law going into effect this fall. This could prompt some people to cut back on their hours to avoid losing money.

""Working more can actually leave you worse off,"" the price-comparison site ValuePenguin.com notes in a new analysis.

""It's sort of an absurd scenario,"" said Jonathan Wu, ValuePenguin.com's co-founder. ""It's something for people to be aware of.""

In that scenario, an individual or family whose annual income surpasses maximums set by the federal government—if only by $1—will totally lose subsidies available to buy health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.

(Read more: Obamacare fraud?)

The loss of those subsidies in some cases will mean that people potentially would have been better off financially if they had worked less during the year, Wu said. And they then would have to work significantly more to make up for the lost subsidy.

""I think they'd be surprised to see how drastic it is,"" said Wu. ""I'd be kind of shocked to see if I make $100 less (in total income each year), I get all these benefits, but if I make $100 more, I get nothing.""

""You basically don't want to fall in that hole,"" said Wu, adding that he believed contractors and others with more control over their incomes would be apt to adjust their hours worked to avoid the subsidy cliff.

He also said that because of lower insurance premiums often offered to younger people, the effect will more likely be seen by older people. But ""you will see it across all age groups"" in the seven states including New York and Vermont where insurance premiums are either barred from being affected by age, or restricted from being dramatically affected, he said.

Under the ACA, federal subsidies in the form of tax credits to buy insurance on new state health insurance exchanges will be available to millions of people who can start enrolling on those exchanges Oct. 1. The subsidies are available to people or families whose incomes total 400 percent above the federal poverty level or less, and are designed to cap their insurance premiums at 9.5 percent of their total income.

For a single person, that FPL income maximum is $45,960 per year. The maximums are adjusted upward for couples and families until maxing out at $94,200 for a family of four.



(Read more: Doctors skeptical, confused about Obamacare)

Under a scenario that ValuePenguin.com identified, a couple in Ohio, both age 50, would be eligible for subsidies worth $3,452 to purchase a so-called silver insurance plan—a moderately priced level of benefits under the ACA's scheme—that costs $9,346 annually if they made up to $62,040 per year.

But if they made just $1 more than that, they would lose the subsidy. Wu noted that the couple then would have to earn at least $65,492 to make up for the lost subsidy.

In New York, a family of three whose annual income totals $78,120, would pay $12,784 for the second-lower-priced silver plan on that state's insurance exchange. After getting a $5,363 tax credit, the family's net cost for the insurance would be $7,421.

But if the family earned even slightly more than $78,120, they would have to pay the entire $12,784 for the insurance because they then wouldn't qualify for the subsidy.

To make up for that, the family's annual income would have to reach $83,483, Wu said.

The stark effect of peoples' age in determining their risk from the subsidy cliff is seen in two examples from Connecticut.



(Read more: This could put Obamacare in the ER)

There, Wu said, a 27-year-old single man would pay $3,636 annually for the second-cheapest silver plan—less than the $4,366 cap on insurance premiums for individuals earning $45,960 or less annually. That person would not be eligible for subsidies, and thus would see no disincentive in working more hours.

But the annual premiums for a 50-year-old Connecticut couple buying that plan would be $12,468. If their combined incomes were $62,040 or less, they would receive $6,575 in subsidies to offset the cost.

However, if their income was more than that, they would lose the subsidies, leaving them out of pocket $6,575. They then would have to earn at least $68,615 to make up for that lost subsidy, Wu said.

Officials say the plan would be part of a broader effort to save Detroit tens of millions of dollars in health costs each year, a major element in a restructuring package that must be approved by a bankruptcy judge. It is being watched closely by municipal leaders around the nation, many of whom complain of mounting, unsustainable prices for the health care promised to retired city workers.

Similar proposals that could shift public sector retirees into the new insurance markets, called exchanges, are already being planned or contemplated in places like Chicago; Sheboygan County, Wis.; and Stockton, Calif. While large employers that eliminate health benefits for full-time workers can be penalized under the health care law, retirees are a different matter.

“There’s fear and panic about what this means,” said Michael Underwood, 62, who retired from the Chicago Police Department after 30 years and has diabetes and Parkinson’s disease. Mr. Underwood, who says he began working for the city when employees did not pay into future Medicare coverage, is part of a group suing Chicago over its plan to phase many retirees out of city coverage during the next three and a half years. “I was promised health care for myself and my wife for life,” he said."

Paul Ryan is emerging as the key congressional Republican in negotiating with Democrats to solve Washington’s two fiscal crises with a plan that only delays efforts to defund ObamaCare, not derail them.

Ryan, chairman of the House Budget Committee, is proposing a plan to increase the federal debt that is tied largely to simplifying the tax code, make enough changes to Medicare to offset cuts to domestic spending and defense programs and a solid promise from Senate Democrats and President Obama to continue talks about reopening the federal government.

Failure to increase the debt limit within roughly the next week would result in the country defaulting on its debt for the first time in history. The partial government shutdown started Oct. 1.

“I'm working to get a budget agreement,” Ryan told a group of conservatives meeting this weekend in Washington. “We need to completely rethink government’s role in helping the most vulnerable. … That means we can never give up on repealing and replacing ObamaCare.”

His remarks, in a video message for the Value Voters summit, were reassuring to conservatives concerned that Ryan in a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed piece seemed to have abandon the idea of defunding or altogether dismantling ObamaCare as part of fiscal negotiations -- considering how hard they, led by Tea Party favorites Sens. Ted Cruz, Texas, and Mike Lee, Utah, worked to garner support for the effort.

Still, Ryan appears to have support from establishment and conservative Republicans as well as a good relationship with Washington Democratic Sen. Patty Murray, chairwoman of the Senate Budget Committee, with whom he has yet to meet on the fiscal issues but will likely negotiation with her.

House Republicans pitched a plan to the White House on Thursday night to approve a short-term debt-ceiling increase, but President Obama pushed back because it did not address the partial shutdown.

Senate Republicans are now crafting an alternate proposal that deals with both. It includes a provision dealing with ObamaCare, but is far short of what Cruz campaigned for -- and advocated with a 21-hour address on the Senate floor last month.

The Senate on Saturday planned to take up a one-year extension of the debt limit. Democratic sponsors, though, may have difficulty advancing the measure given the ongoing negotiations.

The emerging proposal comes from Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and others. It would propose a six-month extension of government spending, a repeal of the health care law's medical device tax and greater flexibility for agencies to deal with across-the-board spending cuts in effect this year.

Returning from a two-hour meeting at the White House, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell told reporters Friday that the session with Obama was useful and he hoped that Senate Republicans could find a way out of the impasse.

Where the budget and debt talks go from here is unclear. Obama called House Speaker John Boehner at mid-afternoon Friday, and Michael Steel, a spokesman for the leader of House Republicans, said, ""They agreed that we should all keep talking.""

Jay Carney, the president's press secretary, said Obama ""appreciates the constructive nature of the conversation and the proposal that House Republicans put forward. Yet, the spokesman said, ""He has some concerns with it.""

http://news.yahoo.com/veterans-fight-changes-disability-payments-070421575--politics.html,,[],Veterans fight changes to disability payments,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Veterans groups are rallying to fight any proposal to change disability payments as the federal government attempts to address its long-term debt problem. They say they've sacrificed already.

Government benefits are adjusted according to inflation, and President Barack Obama has endorsed using a slightly different measure of inflation to calculate Social Security benefits. Benefits would still grow but at a slower rate.

Advocates for the nation's 22 million veterans fear that the alternative inflation measure would also apply to disability payments to nearly 4 million veterans as well as pension payments for an additional 500,000 low-income veterans and surviving families.

""I think veterans have already paid their fair share to support this nation,"" said the American Legion's Louis Celli. ""They've paid it in lower wages while serving, they've paid it through their wounds and sacrifices on the battlefield and they're paying it now as they try to recover from those wounds.""

Economists generally agree that projected long-term debt increases stemming largely from the growth in federal health care programs pose a threat to the country's economic competitiveness. Addressing the threat means difficult decisions for lawmakers and pain for many constituents in the decades ahead.

But the veterans' groups point out that their members bore the burden of a decade of war in Iraq and Afghanistan. In the past month, they've held news conferences on Capitol Hill and raised the issue in meetings with lawmakers and their staffs. They'll be closely watching the unveiling of the president's budget next month to see whether he continues to recommend the change.

Obama and others support changing the benefit calculations to a variation of the Consumer Price Index, a measure called ""chained CPI."" The conventional CPI measures changes in retail prices of a constant marketbasket of goods and services. Chained CPI considers changes in the quantity of goods purchased as well as the prices of those goods. If the price of steak goes up, for example, many consumers will buy more chicken, a cheaper alternative to steak, rather than buying less steak or going without meat.

Story continues

Supporters argue that chained CPI is a truer indication of inflation because it measures changes in consumer behavior. It also tends to be less than the conventional CPI, which would impact how cost-of-living raises are computed.

Under the current inflation update, monthly disability and pension payments increased 1.7 percent this year. Under chained CPI, those payments would have increased 1.4 percent.

The Congressional Budget Office projects that moving to chained CPI would trim the deficit by nearly $340 billion over the next decade. About two-thirds of the deficit closing would come from less spending and the other third would come from additional revenue because of adjustments that tax brackets would undergo.

Isabel Sawhill, a senior fellow in economic studies at The Brookings Institution, a Washington-based think tank, said she understands why veterans, senior citizens and others have come out against the change, but she believes it's necessary.

""We are in an era where benefits are going to be reduced and revenues are going to rise. There's just no way around that. We're on an unsustainable fiscal course,"" Sawhill said. ""Dealing with it is going to be painful, and the American public has not yet accepted that. As long as every group keeps saying, 'I need a carve-out, I need an exception,' this is not going to work.""

Sawhill argued that making changes now will actually make it easier for veterans in the long run.

""The longer we wait to make these changes, the worse the hole we'll be in and the more draconian the cuts will have to be,"" she said.

That's not the way Sen. Bernie Sanders sees it. The chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs said he recently warned Obama that every veterans group he knows of has come out strongly against changing the benefit calculations for disability benefits and pensions by using chained CPI.

""I don't believe the American people want to see our budget balanced on the backs of disabled veterans. It's especially absurd for the White House, which has been quite generous in terms of funding for the VA,"" said Sanders, I-Vt. ""Why they now want to do this, I just don't understand.""

Sanders succeeded in getting the Senate to approve an amendment last week against changing how the cost-of-living increases are calculated, but the vote was largely symbolic. Lawmakers would still have a decision to make if moving to chained CPI were to be included as part of a bargain on taxes and spending.

Sanders' counterpart on the House side, Rep. Jeff Miller, R-Fla., the chairman of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, appears at least open to the idea of going to chained CPI.

""My first priority is ensuring that America's more than 20 million veterans receive the care and benefits they have earned, but with a national debt fast approaching $17 trillion, Washington's fiscal irresponsibility may threaten the very provision of veterans' benefits,"" Miller said. ""Achieving a balanced budget and reducing our national debt will help us keep the promises America has made to those who have worn the uniform, and I am committed to working with Democrats and Republicans to do just that.""

Marshall Archer, 30, a former Marine Corps corporal who served two stints in Iraq, has a unique perspective about the impact of slowing the growth of veterans' benefits. He collects disability payments to compensate him for damaged knees and shoulders as well as post-traumatic stress disorder. He also works as a veterans' liaison for the city of Portland, Maine, helping some 200 low-income veterans find housing.

Archer notes that on a personal level, the reduction in future disability payments would also be accompanied down the road by a smaller Social Security check when he retires. That means he would take a double hit to his income.

""We all volunteered to serve, so we all volunteered to sacrifice,"" he said. ""I don't believe that you should ever ask those who have already volunteered to sacrifice to then sacrifice again.""

That said, Archer indicated he would be willing to ""chip in"" if he believes that everyone is required to give as well.

He said he's more worried about the veterans he's trying to help find a place to sleep. About a third of his clients rely on VA pension payments averaging just over $1,000 a month. He said their VA pension allows them to pay rent, heat their home and buy groceries, but that's about it.

""This policy, if it ever went into effect, would actually place those already in poverty in even more poverty,"" Archer said.

The changes that would occur by using the slower inflation calculation seem modest at first. For a veteran with no dependents who has a 60 percent disability rating, the use of chained CPI this year would have lowered the veteran's monthly payments by $3 a month. Instead of getting $1,026 a month, the veteran would have received $1,023.

Raymond Kelly, legislative director for Veterans of Foreign Wars, acknowledged that veterans would see little change in their income during the first few years of the change. But even a $36 hit over the course of a year is ""huge"" for many of the disabled veterans living on the edge, he said.

The amount lost over time becomes more substantial as the years go by. Sanders said that a veteran with a 100 percent disability rating who begins getting payments at age 30 would see their annual payments trimmed by more than $2,300 a year when they turn 55.

In a preview of the message Democrats will carry into the 2014 midterm elections, the president acknowledged that the Affordable Care Act may have flaws that will need to be fixed, but emphasized that it has already brought substantial benefits to Americans with insurance and will soon help the 30 million who are without it.

He asserted that the GOP wanted only to scrap the law, not find a solution for the uninsured. “There’s not even a pretense now that they’re going to replace it with something better,” he said.

But Obama also said he did not believe Republicans would shut down the federal government in a standoff over the heathcare law, even though many have threatened to do just that. The federal budget expires on Sept. 30, and Obama and Congress will have to reach agreement by then to keep the government running.

“I can tell you that the American people would have difficulty understanding why we would weaken our economy, shut down our government, shut down vital services … because Republicans have determined that they don’t want to see these folks get healthcare,” he said. “I have confidence that common sense in the end will prevail.”

Obama also called on House Republicans to pass immigration reform, saying the bipartisan Senate bill would pass if it were brought to the floor. “The problem is internal Republican caucus politics,” he said.

He said Republicans should embrace reform because reports have shown that it would bolster the economy, bringing new buyers to the housing market and new foreign workers for high-tech firms. He also noted that it would secure the border with “unprecedented resources.”

“I think that the speaker [of the House] and others have said they need to do something. And I’d urge, when they get back [to the Capitol], to do something. Put forward a bill that has an opportunity to actually pass,” he said. “It may not be precisely what’s in the Senate bill. My preference would be for them to go ahead and call the Senate bill, but if they’ve got some additional ideas, I think the Senate’s happy to consider them.”

The president’s defense of his top domestic priorities came in an hourlong White House news conference a day before he was scheduled to head to Martha’s Vineyard for a vacation.

Obama also defended his unilateral decision to delay a requirement that large employers provide insurance or pay a fine, a key part of the Affordable Care Act. He characterized it as “a technical change” that he should have been able to work out with Congress.

“In a normal political environment, it would have been easier for me to simply call up the speaker and say, ‘You know what? This is a tweak that doesn’t go to the essence of the law,’” Obama said.

That remark irritated Republicans.

“We were all scratching our heads when he claimed that he couldn’t get Congress to help him delay the mandate, because Republicans in Congress tried to delay the mandates only to have the president issue a veto threat,” said Don Stewart, a spokesman for Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.

Republicans want to overturn Obama’s healthcare law, said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio), “because it is driving up costs, decreasing access and destroying American jobs.”

“We should enact a step-by-step, common-sense approach that starts with lowering costs,” Buck said.

Obama suggested that there would be other problems with the healthcare law besides his decision to delay the employer mandate, but he said that none would be reason to abandon his top domestic achievement.

“There is no doubt that in implementing the Affordable Care Act — a program of this significance — there are going to be some glitches. No doubt about it. There are going to be things where we say, ‘You know what? We should have thought of that earlier, or this would work a little bit better, or this needs an adjustment,’” the president said. He said the same was true for Social Security, Medicare, new cars and Apple iPads.

“Our goal is to actually deliver high-quality, affordable healthcare for people and to reform the system so costs start going down and people start getting a better bang for the buck,” he said. “And I make no apologies for that.”

Aaron Schock', 'R-Il']",ObamaCare Delays Show Law Is Unworkable,"Before the dust settled on the news that the Obama Administration was delaying the intrusive employer mandate until 2015, a new 606-page regulation was issued on Friday by the Department of Health and Human Services stating it would now rely on self-reported income and employment verification in the state-run exchanges under ObamaCare. In other words, a welcome mat for fraud.

This is another startling development which is becoming part of a larger theme as ObamaCare is rolled out to the public. It is clear that the Affordable Care Act is unworkable. For those like myself who opposed it from the start, we saw the writing on the wall early on as President Obama’s signature health care legislation was rammed through the halls of Congress. If only then-Speaker Pelosi had insisted that her party read the legislation before passing it, maybe some of this would have come to light earlier on. While the eventual passage of the legislation was certain under Democrat control of Congress, maybe some Democrats now sounding the alarm about the devastating impact of the legislation would have done so sooner if they had read it while it was still a bill, not only after it became law.

As of now, ObamaCare is $1 trillion over budget; I say “as of now” because it’s almost certain that with the elimination of the anti-fraud measures the cost will further skyrocket, and there are examples to back up this theory.

In January, the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services began an effort to remove ineligible people from the state’s Medicaid rolls. The initial audit concluded that of the first 20,500 recipients screened, it was recommended 13,709 be removed from eligibility. The Chicago Tribune reports that “since 2000, Illinois Medicaid rolls have doubled, from fewer than 1.4 million people to nearly 2.8 million, or more than 1 in 5 Illinoisans.” In part because of the rising Medicaid rolls, the state’s backlog of unpaid bills is expected to grow to $21 billion by fiscal year 2018.

States are fascinating laboratories of democracy that can provide brilliant blueprints for other states and the federal government to follow. However, states can also serve as flashing red lights when plans go wrong. Illinois is a great example of how a lack of anti-fraud measures can drain a state’s coffers. As President Obama’s home state, he would be wise to take notice.

President Reagan famously said “trust but verify.” In light of the notion that the U.S. health care system makes up one-eighth of the economy, it’s my hope that this administration will grasp hold of this sensible advice."

One Arizona couple, Claudia and Joseph Schulz, just quit their jobs, in fact, and launched a husband-and-wife real estate team, largely because they can sign up this week for health insurance not tethered to any position.

“That was the fear before. We felt too much on our own,” says Claudia Schulz, 33, of Phoenix. “Now, if we’re able to make our dream come true of owning our own business, or at least giving it a shot, it’s worth it.”

Starting a business or retiring early will suddenly become an option under the new exchanges, experts say, especially for the many employees who have felt trapped by so-called “job lock” -- being stuck in a position because of the benefits, usually health insurance, it provides.

“The Affordable Care Act completely changes the playing field,” says Paul Fronstin, director of the health research programs at the Employee Benefit Research Institute. “You don’t need your employer any more for health benefits.”

It may be particularly attractive for older workers -- those in their late 50s and early 60s still too young for Medicare -- who will find they can get affordable insurance despite health problems. That will free them from the trap of needing to work, but being too sick to stay on the job, experts say.

Entrepreneurs of all ages will be able to choose careers “based on the job where they’re going to be most productive,” says Laurel Lucia, a policy analyst at the Center for Labor Research and Education at the University of California, Berkeley.

But experts also caution there are many unknowns lurking in the launch of the exchanges. They’re a cornerstone of the ACA, widely known as Obamacare -- the 2010 law aimed at boosting access to coverage so that more Americans will take care of their health.

Despite years of discussion, many Americans aren’t aware that the ACA may apply to them, including the 27 million it aims to cover by 2017. In late August, a month before the launch, four in 10 Americans were still unsure about whether the ACA remained law, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll.

“There’s very little knowledge out there at this point,” says Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a liberal-leaning think tank in Washington, D.C. “We don’t know exactly what these plans will look like.”

Costs, provider choices and which benefits will be available on the range of basic “bronze” to cover-everything “platinum” plans have been estimated and modeled, but they won’t be certain until the exchanges go live as expected on Tuesday. Even then there will be changes and glitches, experts say. The federal government will run or help run the plan in 36 states; the rest plan to run their own.

About 7 million people are expected to sign up on the insurance exchanges, according to the Congressional Budget Office. That could include up to 1.5 million newly self-employed people as a result of ACA, according to a joint study by the Urban Institute’s Health Policy Center and Georgetown University.

“The idea is that when people have employer-sponsored insurance, even if they would like to start their own business, they might be reluctant to leave that job that provides them insurance coverage if they’re not confident they would be able to access affordable health coverage some other way,” Carole Gresenz, a health economist at Georgetown, told NBC News.

That was certainly the case for Claudia and Joseph Schulz, the Phoenix couple who campaigned for health care reform in red-state Arizona, never knowing they’d need it themselves.

“We both worked for national builders. We both made a six-figure income,” Claudia Schulz says.

Then, in 2008, when the recession hit the construction industry hard, they both lost their jobs. At the same time, Claudia discovered a lump in her breast and Joseph developed a swollen lymph node in his groin, a possible sign of testicular cancer.

“I was going to lose my health insurance a week before my surgery,” she says. “I remember thinking, if it does turn out I have cancer, how am I going to keep my insurance? I remember thinking, oh my god, health insurance is a trap.”

Neither turned out to be sick, but the effects of the scare lingered. Joseph Schulz, a mortgage broker, took a job at an online university temporarily just to have insurance to cover the family, which includes three children ages 10, 7 and 2. Claudia went back to school for a master’s degree.

They were both hired back into corporate real estate jobs, but the Schulzes always wanted to work on their own. That’s when they remembered Obamacare.

“We thought, that law is actually going to be real now,” Claudia Schulz says. “Hey, we could get that insurance. We never thought of that for us.”

In September, Joseph Schulz quit his job as a mortgage broker and Claudia Schulz arranged to work as a consultant for her former firm. They have employer-sponsored insurance through Monday.

On Tuesday, they plan to sign up for the new exchanges in Arizona, where five insurers have filed to offer care. Based on their projected $150,000 income, plus family size, the Schulzes may pay about $1,250 a month in premiums for a silver plan, or more for the top-tier platinum plan they favor, according to a calculator offered by the Berkeley labor center. At 544 percent of the federal poverty level, that’s well out of range for any government subsidies.

The care will start Jan. 1. Until then, the Schulzes figure they’ll pay about $1,600 a month for COBRA benefits to extend their insurance. That’s all a big bite out of the family’s budget, far more than the $420 a month they’ve been paying.

The extra cash -- and talk in Congress of defunding Obamacare -- raises some questions about their decision, they admit.

“To be honest, we have that fear, that they might cancel it and it may not happen. We’d have to go back to employer-based insurance,” Claudia Schulz says. “But we’re still going through with it.”

In fact, a family emergency this week reinforced their support for affordable, independent insurance. Joseph Schulz’s 57-year-old stepfather suffered a sudden stroke on Tuesday that may leave him permanently disabled. The lifelong construction worker was recently laid off from his job and has no insurance. He may qualify for Social Security disability, but he’ll also be able to get health care through the new exchange.

Still, others considering quitting their jobs for Obamacare remain cautious. Jay Narey, a 49-year-old flight attendant in Dallas, says he plans to leave the skies and start a commercial real estate business -- but not until late next year, after any glitches are addressed.

“I’m definitely interested,” says Narey. “Having access to health insurance is absolutely critical to self-employed individuals like me who no longer wish to be chained to a specific employer.”

And one 35-year-old Austin, Texas, man tells NBC News he plans use Obamacare to leave his “not exactly fulfilling” corporate job to become an independent consultant for a favorite food product. But he doesn’t want to share his name because he hasn’t told his boss – and he still needs insurance to cover his wife’s rheumatoid arthritis, a pre-existing health condition.

“I don’t know that we want to be the ones to lead out on the experiment,” the man says. “We’re probably going to wait and see how it all shakes out.”

What’s more, he added, most people do not understand that.

By his point that evening, the president was referring to the widespread and incorrect view, especially among older Americans, that Medicare recipients get only what they have paid for through taxes, premiums and medical co-payments. Now that misperception is making it all the harder for politicians to consider trimming those benefits or raising out-of-pocket expenses as they seek to restrain Medicare spending that is rising unsustainably while baby boomers age and medical prices increase.

There has long been similar confusion about Social Security, although the current generation of new beneficiaries is roughly breaking even.

Late in 2012, for a sixth straight year, Medicare trustees issued a warning required by law whenever more than 45 percent of the health program’s costs must be covered by general revenues from all taxpayers."

There are important questions about whether the fix President Obama offered today for Americans whose insurance policies were cancelled will help them, whether it will hinder the broad goals of the health insurance reform law, and whether it will satisfy the opponents of reform. We will start to address them later on the editorial page.

But this was also one of those moments when a nation takes stock of its president. And it seemed worth noting here that Mr. Obama has dealt another blow to his own already damaged credibility with this latest reminder of how he and his team bungled the rollout of health care reform.

Hovering over the press conference at the White House today was the question of whether Mr. Obama lied — whether he deliberately said what he knew not to be true with the intention of deceiving people — when he said repeatedly that Americans who like their policies would be able to keep them.



“There is no doubt that the way I put that forward unequivocally ended up not being accurate,” Mr. Obama said today.

He said he was thinking of the 95 percent of insured Americans who are covered by group insurance provided by employers, unions, Medicare or Medicaid. He also said he believed that a “grandfather clause” would cover those in the remaining 5 percent who wanted to hang onto current policies even if they were not as good as what is available on the new exchanges.

Those explanations are not likely to be terribly persuasive even to those who liked Mr. Obama and supported health care, but have come to doubt him. His political enemies will scoff at them.

I have seen no proof that Mr. Obama knew the details of the grandfather clause when he made his famous promise. But there had to be many, many people in his administration who did know the details. They could have, and should have, told the president that what he was saying was flat wrong – that the grandfather clause would not deliver on his broadly drawn promise.

In order to be covered, you had to have a policy that you bought before the law was signed in 2010 and was still in effect without significant changes at the end of 2013 — no major change in premiums, co-pays or coverage. How likely is that in the volatile world of individual health insurance, where policies last for a year and are subject to change at the whim of insurance companies?

On one level, it should surprise no one that a politician faced with either seeming like a liar or seeming like a fool would choose the fool. But that still leaves us with the disturbing impression — and not for the first time in this administration — that Mr. Obama sometimes shoots from the hip, that he is still struggling to handle the politics of the presidency after nearly five years in office, and that he is surrounded by people who are too incompetent or too weak to help him."

http://news.yahoo.com/last-minute-obamacare-exemption-those-canceled-plans-044422611.html,,[],Last-minute Obamacare exemption for those with canceled plans,"By Roberta Rampton WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration made a major last-minute policy shift on Thursday, saying the change would help Americans meet a looming deadline to replace insurance plans canceled because of new standards under Obamacare reforms. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said that this group of people - estimated by the administration to be fewer than 500,000 in number - will be allowed to claim a ""hardship exemption"" from the requirement in the 2010 Affordable Care Act to buy insurance. Armed with the exemption, they then have the option to buy ""catastrophic"" insurance plans - cheaper insurance with a minimal coverage level that, under the law, is normally available only to people under the age of 30. ""This is a common-sense clarification of the law,"" said Joanne Peters, a spokeswoman for Sebelius. ""For the limited number of consumers whose plans have been canceled and are seeking coverage, this is one more option."" In the law, there are 14 categories of ""hardships"" that can be used to get an exemption from the mandate to buy insurance, such as a recent eviction or bankruptcy. But this is the first exemption prompted by the administration's botched rollout of the law, and comes after months of insistence that there would be no delays in implementing the individual mandate. The rocky rollout of President Barack Obama's signature policy achievement has been embarrassing and politically damaging, helping push Obama's approval ratings to the lowest point of his presidency. Part of the backlash came when millions of people received policy cancellation notices, forcing Obama to apologize for a promise he made that people who liked their insurance policies could keep them under the Affordable Care Act reforms. The latest twist comes just days before a December 23 deadline for arranging insurance coverage to begin on January 1. In effect, it will provide the administration and Democrats in Congress some political cover, because people won't be able to claim they don't have insurance purely because their policy was canceled and alternatives are too expensive. The change was suggested by a group of Democratic senators, some of whom face difficult reelection campaigns in 2014. But the exemption comes after a series of other delays in enforcing or implementing various parts of Obamacare, and instantly sparked more political criticism that the government is unevenly and unfairly applying the law. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican who is vice-chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said in a statement that the change was a ""holiday surprise"" that showed the White House was ""in full panic mode"" ahead of the deadline. ""Rather than more White House delays, waivers and exemptions, the administration should provide all Americans relief from its failed law,"" Blackburn said. The head of the lobby group for insurance companies also panned the change. ""This latest rule change could cause significant instability in the marketplace and lead to further confusion and disruption for consumers,"" said Karen Ignagni, president of America's Health Insurance Plans. MORE 'BUMPS IN THE ROAD' AHEAD Millions of Americans don't have health insurance, a gap Obamacare aimed to fix. But enrollment got off to a painfully slow start because of the poorly designed HealthCare.gov website used to shop for plans. Only 365,000 people had signed up by the end of November, when the site finally began to work well for most people. Officials said there has been a surge in enrollments in December. They said more than 70 percent are people who were stymied by the technical problems earlier on, but they declined to release new enrollment data. ""Folks have come back, and they're coming back in droves,"" one of the officials told reporters. The administration is also girding for the next phase of the rollout, when they anticipate newly insured Americans could encounter problems with coverage as they seek care at pharmacies and doctors' offices. The insurance, required by law, is sold by private companies. To prepare for gaps, officials said they have trained call center staff to connect consumers with their providers. ""This is a big transition that we are going through,"" one of the officials said. ""There will be bumps in the road."" COUNTER-NARRATIVE The White House also concluded on Thursday a three-week barrage of events designed to trumpet good news it feels has been lost amid stories about the botched rollout. It released a state-by-state report showing how many Americans have already gained new protections from reforms, such as the numbers now prevented from being denied coverage because of pre-existing medical conditions. The information provides a ""counter-narrative"" for congressional Democrats, who are anxious a backlash against the law could hurt them in 2014 elections, said Tevi Troy, a White House aide and former Deputy Health and Human Services Secretary in the George W. Bush administration. But the White House also is trying to burnish Obama's legacy achievement, he said. ""I think it's about changing the damaging story about Obamacare,"" Troy said. Republicans have repeatedly voted to repeal the law, shutting down the government for 16 days in October over the issue. They have said they will continue to push for changes. ""The fact is, premiums are going up, millions of people are losing the plans they had, and access to doctors and hospitals is being restricted as a result of Obamacare,"" said Don Stewart, deputy chief of staff to Mitch McConnell, the top Republican in the Senate. But on a conference call organized by the White House on Thursday, Democratic congressman Joaquin Castro from Texas told reporters he is not worried the law will hurt him in 2014. ""I believe that by November 2014, the reality will overtake the propaganda,"" Castro said, explaining he thinks consumers will appreciate the ""tangible benefits"" of the law and will forgive the ""glitches"" in the rollout.

http://news.yahoo.com/u-senate-republicans-start-closing-ranks-spending-bill-181022720.html,,[],Cruz brings Tea Party fight on Obamacare to U.S. Senate,"By Richard Cowan and Thomas Ferraro WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Ted Cruz, a renegade Tea Party favorite, took his fight to defund President Barack Obama's healthcare overhaul to the Senate floor on Tuesday, but most of his Republican colleagues refused to join him. In fact, a majority of the 46 Republicans in the Senate may end up lining up instead with their party leaders, who want to pass an emergency spending bill by September 30 that would avoid a federal government shutdown and would undercut Cruz's high-stakes effort to stop Obamacare. Standing in a nearly empty Senate, Cruz began an attention-grabbing speech in the early afternoon Tuesday that could stretch into Wednesday in favor of withholding funds to operate the government unless Obamacare is gutted. ""I intend to speak in support of defunding Obamacare until I am no longer able to stand,"" said the freshman Texas senator who has his eye on a 2016 run for president. He went on to talk about his father ""flippin pancakes,"" making ""green eggs and ham,"" ""the travesty of Obamacare,"" and, proudly, about his unpopularity among many fellow Republicans. Practically every day, he said in his marathon speech, ""I now pick up the newspaper to learn what a scoundrel I am."" It had the look and sound of an old-fashioned ""filibuster"" used traditionally by senators to block legislation, except that in this case, it won't. Under Senate rules, Cruz must yield the floor for a procedural vote on Wednesday when Democrats and many Republicans are expected to band together to begin moving the must-do spending bill toward passage, likely on Sunday. It will then go back to the House, which will have one day to pass the bill or find a compromise with the Senate. Unless new funding is quickly approved, a government shutdown would begin on Tuesday. Republicans uniformly want to repeal Obamacare. But many see that as a political impossibility in the face of Democratic opposition and do not want to trigger a government shutdown in a battle that even Cruz has acknowledged is futile. For the most part, Democrats sat back enjoying the display of a Republican in a dog fight with other Republicans. Cruz has a following however. Club for Growth, a conservative group influential among Republicans, put senators on notice that it expected them to support Cruz's bid and block Democrats' from eliminating the provision to defund Obamacare. But his fellow Republicans were moving in the other direction one day after the party's top two leaders in the Senate, Mitch McConnell and John Cornyn, refused to lend their support to Cruz. Senator Orrin Hatch, the senior Republican on the Senate Finance Committee that oversees Obamacare, announced he would side with McConnell rather than Cruz. Senator Lindsey Graham said he expects a majority of the Senate's 46 Republicans will reject Cruz's high-stakes maneuver that has been embraced by the Republican-led House of Representatives. ""I think most Republicans believe, no matter how sincere you are about defunding Obamacare, that this approach would blow up in our face,"" Graham told Reuters in a brief hallway interview on Capitol Hill. A government shutdown could ruin the party's chances of winning back control of the Senate in the 2014 elections. At the urging of Cruz and other legislators aligned with the anti-government Tea Party movement, the Republican-led House of Representatives passed the bill providing government funding but without money for Obamacare. Passage came on a party-line vote on Friday. Since Cruz launched his bid, Republican senators and their aides have been unusually candid in their impatience with him, laying bare a deep split within the Republican Party. ""We will end up not shutting the government down and we will not defund Obamacare. That's how the movie ends,"" Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona told reporters. As the Senate slowly moved through a debate that likely will lead to passing a government funding bill by Sunday, House Republicans continued to weigh their options once they receive the Senate's work. Some congressional aides have said that a new round of House amendments were being weighed, possibly including one to repeal an unpopular medical device tax aimed at generating $30 billion in revenues over a decade to help pay for Obamacare subsidies. SENATE PASSAGE POSSIBLE SUNDAY The Senate is expected to pass a new bill by Sunday. It would then be returned to the House for concurrence. The chamber could then approve the Senate version or try to amend it - but would only have a day or so before current government funding expires. At this point, it is unclear what the House Republican leadership would decide to do, generating plenty of questions and anxiety. House Republican leaders have not informed rank-and-file members what the final stage of the fight over the spending bill will look like, according to an aide to one junior Republican. ""First and foremost, he doesn't want the government to shut down,"" the aide said, though adding that the lawmaker was under intense pressure from conservatives back home to stop Obamacare. ""He is definitely stressed,"" the aide said. Once the battle over government funding bill is resolved, Congress will grapple with another fiscal crisis - a possible and unprecedented U.S. government default unless it agrees to raise the $16.7 trillion U.S. borrowing authority by sometime next month or early November. Republicans are expected to place demands on any bill to increase the debt limit, including one to delay for a year implementation of Obamacare, now set to begin to kick in next month.

The president’s team acknowledged struggling with how to present its message to the public, but some senators left the meeting more concerned that there were no immediate fixes forthcoming more than a month after healthcare.gov went live.

With reelection battles looming, fellow Democrats have been left to explain the website failures while hoping that the benefits of the Affordable Care Act are just around the corner.

The frustration was on full display Wednesday as 15 Senate Democrats up for reelection and the senator in charge of their coordinated campaigns urged Obama to get the troubled launch behind him and his party.

“It’s absolutely unacceptable in this day and age that the administration can’t deliver on the promises it made to all Americans because of technical problems with a website,” said Sen. Mark Begich (D-Alaska). “Alaskans should be appreciating the critical benefits of the Affordable Care Act, but there is an understandable crisis in confidence because the administration has yet to get it off the ground.”

One Senate aide, who asked for anonymity to discuss the private conversation, said it was clear the White House knows it has a “messaging problem,” but not that it has “any immediate fixes to it, which was disconcerting.”

Obama advisors are fighting a crisis of faith among Democrats as they try to muscle the marketplaces through the rough patch and into widespread use. Already, 11 Senate Democrats have signaled their support for extending the enrollment deadline, a delay that administration officials fear could lead to an unraveling of the larger policy.

White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough has personally led efforts to reassure balky Democrats, traveling to Capitol Hill and routinely talking with those up for reelection in 2014.

But nervousness remains.

“I am very frustrated with the rollout of the exchanges. The dysfunction and delays are unacceptable,” Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) said after the meeting. “I remain deeply convinced that this is a ‘show me’ moment. This will not be resolved until Americans can, day after day, sign onto the health marketplace, review their options and complete their applications.”

Another Senate Democratic aide, who also was not authorized to comment publicly about the private conversation, described the meeting as “civil.”

“The White House understands the situation folks going into reelection are in,” the aide said. “It’s still a concern.”

The chaos surrounding the rocky startup has given ammunition to critics and forced Obama to answer tough questions about his plan, instead of touring the country drawing crowds for healthcare recruiters. Among the questions is whether he described the program accurately over the last three years when he said people could keep their old plans if they desired. But plans that don’t meet the new Obamacare standards are grandfathered in only if they were purchased before the law was signed in 2010.

House Republicans stoked concerns about the grandfather clause Wednesday by announcing the House would vote next week on the “Keep Your Health Plan Act,” which would allow insurance plans being offered today to continue into next year.

The bill’s author, Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton (R-Mich.), calls it a “voluntary escape hatch” for people who want to keep their old coverage.

PHOTOS: 2013’s memorable political moments

After the White House meeting, Obama traveled to Dallas for a Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee fundraiser and to promote healthcare enrollment. Texas is one of 36 states dependent on the federal website because it has declined to create its own exchange.

Speaking to a crowd at Temple Emanu-El in Dallas, Obama thanked a group of volunteers for promoting Obamacare even though state Republican leaders aren’t doing much to help implement the law.

Texas GOP Gov. Rick Perry has refused federal money to expand Medicaid to cover more low-income families. And the state is considering new requirements for recruiters hired under federal grants to help people sign up for Obamacare. A quarter of the state’s population is uninsured, the biggest share in the country. That amounts to about 6 million Texans.

“This task is especially challenging in the great Lone Star State,” Obama told the crowd. “There’s no state that actually needs this more than Texas.”

In a statement, Perry accused the president of coming to Texas “in a desperate attempt to salvage his ill-conceived and unpopular program from a Titanic fate by preaching expansion of the same Medicaid system he himself admits is broken.”

Earlier in the day, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius testified before the Senate Finance Committee, where even Democratic champions of the healthcare law were upset by the administration’s past failure to keep them informed of potential problems.

“You’ve got to tell us what’s going on candidly, fully,” said Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.), chairman of the committee and a chief architect of the law. “The more you don’t tell us, the greater the problem is going to be.”

Fortunately all the data suggest that Obamacare is actually working. Americans will now have brochures with actual plans and options to choose from. They can now compare reality with the lies they heard.

Anyone wondering why Right Wing Republicans are in overdrive to shut the government down lest Obamacare is defunded realizes the eyes of many Americans are about to be opened. The millions that will see not a giveaway but help in getting access to affordable health insurance, screenings, and health care for the first time in years are also voters. They are voters that will wonder how a politician could be so convincingly evil to have wanted them denied something many needed for their health care or financial survival.

Kentucky Republican Senator Mitch McConnell is adamant that Obamacare be defunded. But Kentucky citizens are yearning for health insurance.

The crush of people don't greet Diaz-Dempsey with tea party dogma or amateur constitutional scholarship. No one is there to complain about the individual mandate or heckle about death panels. They have questions. They wonder if they could get coverage despite having a pre-existing medical condition, how much it will cost them. They ask if Indiana has a similar program, or if this was only for Kentucky. Could they just enroll their child? They talk about their sons and daughters, neighbors going without health care, and ask about the subsidies. The vast majority are relieved to learn about the health exchange. Linda Parrish, 47, showed up at the table and gushed to Diaz-Dempsey: ""This is what I've been waiting on."" Parrish has health insurance, but her best friend doesn't.

It is not all roses in Kentucky. The tea party has been calling people telling them not to sign up because they falsely claim there are no real health insurance exchanges. Many low income workers are against it because they were lied to about what the costs would be.

Christopher McClure hobbles through the doors, his inner thigh hurting from what he suspects are a pair of spider bites. He is not employed and does not have health insurance. His wife Michelle, 29, works as an assistant manager at a pizza chain making $12,000 a year. She also has no insurance and would qualify for the Medicaid expansion. But she's against Obamacare, convinced that it will wipe out her meager earnings. “Next enrollment season,"" she says, ""they’re going to sock it to me.”

The McClures under Obamacare would be fully subsidized. They are so misinformed that they have no clue that Obamacare is that one leg on the stool that removes a financial burden that is materially affecting their access to real financial independence. It makes sense to remove the health care anchor from people’s neck giving them the wherewithal to go seek a job or make their own job.

The reelection of President Obama which makes it impossible to kill Obamacare before implementation is the best thing that has happened to the uninsured, the poor, and the working middle class. The pilfering of the last disposable dollar by insurance companies will eventually end. Medical bankruptcy will cease and families’ economic stabilization will begin."

The president defended his health care law at the White House Thursday, the day after House Republicans voted again to repeal it. (The Washington Post)

Transforming the nation’s health-care system stands as Barack Obama’s most crucial piece of unfinished business, with much of his presidential legacy riding on whether it is deemed to have succeeded or failed.

While other presidents have managed to overcome intense opposition to major new social initiatives, Obama faces a degree of difficulty with health care that has no historic parallel.

So there was a certain urgency in the speech that Obama gave Thursday, the morning after the Republican-led House voted for the 38th and 39th times to dismantle all or part of the Affordable Care Act.

“There are still a lot of folks — in this town, at least — who are rooting for this law to fail. Some of them seem to think this law is about me. It’s not,” he said.

The process of implementing the law promises to be “many orders of magnitude more complicated” than establishing such programs as Social Security and Medicare, said David Blumenthal, president of the Commonwealth Fund, an organization that produces research on health and public policy issues.

Blumenthal, the Obama administration’s former coordinator of health information technology, also wrote a book on how 20th century presidents dealt with health-care policy.

He noted that both Social Security and Medicare are national programs that basically consist of paying bills and making payments to those who are eligible.

The new health-care law seeks to establish new health-insurance marketplaces and transform how care is delivered, while giving states more leeway in determining how that will be done.

Obama must also implement the new law against a united opposition party that is determined to throw as many obstacles as it can in his path.

“Obamacare is a disaster,” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said in a speech on the Senate floor shortly after the president’s remarks. “Mr. President, the plan is already failing.”

Some Republican lawmakers, who routinely help their constituents with concerns about Social Security and Medicare, have even served notice that they do not plan to assist those who come to them for aid in navigating the new health-care system.

“All we can do is pass them back to the Obama administration. The ball’s in their court. They’re responsible for it,” Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) told the Hill newspaper last month.

The question of who is to blame for the fact that the bill passed without a single Republican vote is likely to remain a matter of dispute between the parties for years to come.

If the president ever had any real hope that Republicans would embrace the new law after the Supreme Court upheld its constitutionality and he won reelection, he has since given that up.

But current and former administration officials say Obama and his team have been surprised at how steadfast the opposition has remained.

“It used to be that you had a fight, and it was over, and you moved on,” said Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist Jonathan Gruber, who consulted with the administration and congressional Democrats in putting together the law.

The drumbeat of House votes against the law is little more than political theater, but the decision by nearly half the nation’s states to reject federal money to expand their Medicaid programs — a crucial element of achieving near-universal health coverage — has the potential to be far more damaging.

In some states, nearly everyone will have some kind of health coverage under the new law.

In others, a perverse result is likely: Many people who earn up to the poverty level will remain uninsured, while those who make more will receive government subsidies to purchase policies in the newly established marketplaces known as exchanges.

Administration officials say that as the benefits of the new law become more apparent, opposing it will become more difficult for Republicans.

They note that the Democrats went through much the same evolution before and after the establishment of the Medicare prescription drug program in 2003 under President George W. Bush.

After initially denouncing the drug program and vowing to repeal it, Democratic lawmakers ultimately embraced it, and even devoted town hall meetings to helping constituents sign up for it.

“We know the American people think the bill should be implemented, and if there are problems along the way, we need to address them,” said White House communications director Jennifer Palmieri. “Our goal is to implement it well. We do think the further along we get, as people get more and more benefits, the less attractive it should be for people to fight it.”

But some of those who support the new system say that will not happen without a big push from the president himself. Thursday’s event at the White House, for instance, highlighted an often-overlooked aspect of the law that has already taken effect: its requirement that insurance companies spend 80 percent of the premiums they receive on providing health care, rather than taking the payments as profit or using them to pay for overhead.

”If he had one shortcoming during the passage of the law, it was failing to be out there personally as much as he should have been,” Blumenthal said. “His legacy is on the line, and there is probably no point in holding any of his political capital back. He is all-in for making this work.”"

Ban on over-16-ounce drinks was set to take effect Tuesday

Mayor Bloomberg calls it %22portion control%22

A New York State judge says loopholes defeated the purpose

Talk about a sugar high.

New York City's soft drink sellers celebrated a sweet victory Monday when Mayor Michael Bloomberg's controversial ban on large-size sugary beverages was overturned by a New York state judge.

""We're excited. We're happy,"" said Russell Levinson, general manager of Movieworld in Queens. He said he is relieved that, at least for now, the theater doesn't have to ditch the four drink sizes that would have been banned under the new regulations.

The size limit had been set to take effect Tuesday.

On Monday afternoon, New York Supreme Court Judge Milton Tingling ruled that the city health board didn't have the authority to limit or ban a legal item under the guise of ""controlling a chronic disease.""

""The Board of Health may supervise and regulate the food supply of the city when it affects public health,"" and can do so when the city ""is facing imminent danger due to disease,"" but that was not proven in this case, Tingling said in his written decision.

The limit put a 16-ounce cap on sweetened bottled drinks and fountain beverages sold at city restaurants, delis, movie theaters, sports venues and street carts.

The size limit applied to beverages with more than 25 calories per 8 ounces. It didn't include 100% juice drinks or beverages with more than 50% milk.

""We are elated with today's decision,"" the National Association of Theatre Owners said in a written statement. ""This issue was never about obesity, nor about soda. This was all about power. The court rejected the mayor's attempt to unilaterally tell New Yorkers what to drink.""

At a news conference Monday evening, Bloomberg said he disagreed with the court decision and that the city would appeal. With a rising number of overweight and obese people, he said, ""it is reasonable and responsible to draw a line.""

Bloomberg has been going full force with his efforts to show the detriments of sweetened drinks. On Monday, he released data that showed a correlation between sugary-drink consumption and obesity.

And on Sunday, Bloomberg defended the regulation. ""We're not banning anything,"" he said on CBS' Face the Nation. ""It's called portion control.""

""All we're doing in New York is reminding you that it's not in your interest to have too many empty calories,"" he said. ""If you want to have 32 ounces, just buy two 16-ounce cups.""

The group that filed suit against the rule applauded the decision. ""The court ruling provides a sigh of relief to New Yorkers and thousands of small businesses in New York City that would have been harmed by this arbitrary and unpopular ban,"" said Chris Gindlesperger, spokesman for the American Beverage Association, one of the plaintiffs. ""With this ruling behind us, we look forward to collaborating with city leaders on solutions that will have a meaningful and lasting impact on the people of New York City.""

The suit against the city health board and health department was brought by the New York Statewide Coalition of Hispanic Chambers of Commerce, the New York Korean-American Grocers Association, the Soft Drink and Brewery Workers Union Local 812, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, the National Restaurant Association, the National Association of Theatre Owners of New York Stateand the American Beverage Association.

Soft-drink sellers had taken different approaches to the coming ban. Some bought smaller cups. Some planned to ask patrons to sweeten their own beverages.

Movieworld 's Levinson had planned to wait out the 90-day grace period before making any changes.

He said the fact that the ban wouldn't affect beverages sold in grocery or convenience stores made it ""terribly unfair"" to the businesses that were covered.

Levinson also worried about longer-term ramifications. The legislation had opened up ""the possibility of (Bloomberg) or someone like him — or the health department — creating similar laws on candy or popcorn,"" he said. ""It's opening up a door that can lead to the government really telling you what you can and can't drink and eat.""

By Monday, Brother Jimmy's BBQ, a restaurant chain with five Big Apple outposts, had already bought 1,000 new 16-ounce cups to replace its 24-ounce cups. It already recycled the old cups, so it's stuck with the smaller size.

Bloomberg said he hopes soft-drink sellers in general will follow the ban voluntarily. ""I don't think it'll hurt your bottom line,"" the mayor said. Even if it did, he said, saving lives is more important than profits: ""We all have an obligation to do what we can to help each other."""

EMPLOYERS SLASHING COVERAGE - UVA dumps spouses - The University of Virginia announced Wednesday it will stop offering health insurance to some employees’ spouses citing rising costs under ObamaCare. According to a press release on the university’s website, “Provisions of the federal Affordable Care Act are projected to add $7.3 million to the cost of the University health plan in 2014 alone.” This follows news that UPS would be dumping an estimated 15,000 from the company’s plan. Chief National Correspondent Jim Angle follows the story today.

OBAMA TURNS COLLEGE RECRUITER - Ed Henry wants to know: “The White House says the bus tour through universities and high schools is focused on college affordability. But since a new Gallup poll found young adults are least likely to say they're familiar with the health law, will he also use this swing to rally his campaign base ahead of the Oct. 1 sign up deadline?”

Welcome to Buffalo, Mr. President - President Obama travels to Buffalo today, part of a two-day economic bus tour that will take him thru upstate New York and Pennsylvania. At the University of Buffalo, Obama will pitch his “better bargain for the middle class” with a call for more education spending. In an e-mail to supporters, the President wrote, “We have to fundamentally rethink about how higher education is paid for in this country.”

Tuition spike - The Albany Times Union reports Gov. Andrew Cuomo, D-N.Y., scheduled to appear with the president, “…created the NYSUNY 2020 program, which raised tuition 30 percent at all SUNY campuses over five years, from $4,970 to $6,470.” According to US News and World Report, 63 percent of Buffalo University students receive some kind of need-based assistance.

Teacher union angst - The Buffalo Teacher’s Federation is fuming that their teacher’s make $20,000 less than their counterparts in other districts. Buffalo News reports, in some cases, $45,000 less. Census figures reveal the city’s 29.9 percent poverty rate.

Local schools losing ground - The president will wrap-up the day speaking at Henninger High School in Syracuse. Obama will be joined by Education Secretary Arne Duncan to tout the school’s involvement with a government program that pays the tuition for students at failing schools accepted at public colleges and participating private institutions. According to New York’s Department of Education, graduation rates in the city stand at 48%.

[Daniel Henninger, (no relation) writes: “The president gives essentially the same speech everywhere. In part it is a meditation on the meaning of middle class—‘Americans are gritty, resilient and work hard.’ In part it is populist paranoia.”]

Bad to worse - The Syracuse Post Standard reports students in the district are failing to meet the state’s new curriculum standards. “[O]nly 8.7 percent of third- through eighth-graders met the standard in English language arts. In math, only 6.9 percent of students met the standard.”

BAIER TRACKS: FED FLUSTER… Bret Baier: “If anyone needs more evidence of the supercharged role of the Federal Reserve in the economy, here's another piece. Just the mere hint of different analyses of the minutes of the central bank's July meeting released yesterday sent stocks lower. That's essentially someone in analysis circles whispering, ‘You know, it looks like the Fed may really start turning off the spigot soon.’ Well, imagine what happens when the Fed does slow or stop the flood of new US dollars into the economy. Bottom line: Fed policy is a huge economic driver. At his last news conference, President Obama said picking a new Fed chairman, ‘is definitely one of the most important economic decisions that I’ll make in the remainder of my presidency.’ Many experts characterize that as a big understatement.”

GALLUP: UNEMPLOYMENT’S 30 DAY JUMP - Gallup’s latest unemployment figures show a significant jump from July’s 7.7 percent to 8.9 percent released Wednesday. Their figures also show underemployment increased from 17.1 percent to 17.9 percent in the same 30-day period.

NSA HAD EYES ON US COMMUNICATION - Washington Examiner reports the NSA gathered over 56,000 “wholly domestic” communications before a secret court struck the program down. The revelation comes in 100 pages of documents declassified by the agency. Most are secret opinions from the FISA court; they detail major compliance problems. The NSA worked with Congress and the FISA court to correct the problem but ultimately decided it could not salvage the data collected and it was purged in 2012.

GRENELL: POWER A NO SHOW ON SYRIA - Newly confirmed UN Ambassador Samantha Power was absent from an emergency meeting of the Security Council Wednesday on a chemical weapons attack that killed hundreds. Power, who has previously called the UN’s failure to intervene in Syria “a disgrace,” was reportedly traveling at the time of the meeting. Fox News Contributor Richard Grenell, a former member of George W. Bush’s UN team, wants to know where she was: “Samantha Power has been on the job exactly 19 days. In that time, she’s already traveled from New York to Los Angeles to deliver a speech. Her absence from the UN on Wednesday sends a terrible message at a time when U.S. credibility in the region is suffering.”

Some have suggested the penalty could be delayed, given the problems with the Web site might prevent people who otherwise want insurance from obtaining it.

The White House on Wednesday announced it would give Americans six weeks longer than previously thought -- until March 31 -- to enroll before facing a penalty, but also said the change had nothing to do with the Web site problems.

""Extending this period will give consumers critical time in which to become familiar with the website and choose a plan that is best for them,"" the letter states. ""Individuals should not be penalized for lack of coverage if they are unable to purchase health insurance due to technical problems.""

The letter doesn’t state how long the senators would like to extend open enrollment, only that it should be beyond March 31. One of the signers, Sen. Kay Hagan (D-N.C.), called for a two-month delay in remarks on Thursday. Separately, another Democratic senator, Joe Manchin (W.Va.), has called for a one-year delay in the individual mandate.

The signatories to the letter are Shaheen and Sens. Mark Begich (D-Alaska), Mark Pryor (D-Ark.), Mary Landrieu (D-La.), Hagan (D-N.C.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Mark Udall (D-Colo.), Tom Udall (D-N.M.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) and Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.).

Begich, Pryor, Landrieu and Hagan are all top GOP targets in red states in 2014, and Bennet is likely to be targeted in 2016. (Shaheen and Mark Udall face reelection in swing states in 2014 but aren't considered among Republicans' top targets.)

Feinstein stands out as a long-time liberal senator from California. Tom Udall is considered largely safe for reelection in New Mexico next year and Heinrich was just elected in 2012 in the same state.

Here's the text of Shaheen's letter:

Dear Secretary Sebelius:

When fully implemented, the Affordable Care Act represents a bold step forward in reforming our nation’s health care system. It has the potential to improve the quality of care we all receive and provides the opportunity for millions of Americans to purchase quality, affordable health insurance.

The newly created federal and state health insurance marketplaces are intended to allow consumers the opportunity to compare health insurance options and find a plan that fits their needs and their budgets. For three years, we have been eagerly waiting for the launch of these marketplaces. However, now that the marketplaces are open, we have become discouraged and frustrated with the problems and interactions that are occurring with the Affordable Care Act’s federally-administered website, healthcare.gov.

As long as these substantial technology glitches persist, we are losing valuable time to educate and enroll people in insurance plans. Our constituents are frustrated, and we fear that the longer the website is not functional, opportunities for people to log on, learn about their insurance choices, and enroll will be lost.

Given the existing problems with healthcare.gov and other state-run marketplace websites that depend on the federally-administered website, we urge you to consider extending open enrollment beyond the current end date of March 31, 2014. Extending this period will give consumers critical time in which to become familiar with the website and choose a plan that is best for them. Individuals should not be penalized for lack of coverage if they are unable to purchase health insurance due to technical problems.

The Affordable Care Act has already had a significant impact on the lives of millions of Americans; seniors are now paying less for their prescription drugs, critical preventive care services are available for free and important work is being done to improve the quality of care we receive. Americans will now have the opportunity to receive tax credits to purchase quality health insurance, and starting in January 2014, insurance companies will no longer be able to deny health coverage because of a pre-existing condition or drop coverage if someone is sick.

We appreciate your efforts to fully implement this law and look forward to working with you to accomplish that goal. Thank you for considering our requests to extend the open enrollment period if the healthcare.gov substantial technology glitches continue."

She agrees that everyone should have access to healthcare and no one should be denied coverage because of pre-existing conditions.

But here’s the problem:

She knows firsthand, as the new law of the land rolls clumsily into being, that it’s not working out to everyone’s advantage.

“I’m a 55-year-old woman in excellent health and have a catastrophic health plan,” she wrote recently to Obama and California Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer. “I am completely happy with my plan. I received notice that the plan is being canceled and that to stay with a “comparable” plan my premiums would increase 88%, or $200 extra per month. To add insult to injury, the plan is INFERIOR to my existing plan.”

If you guessed that she got no response from any of those elected officials, you win a box of cough drops.

But public officials didn’t throw a complete shutout at Davis. She wrote to U.S. Rep. Karen Bass (D-Los Angeles) when she didn’t hear from the others, and one of Bass’ staffers called Davis to say she’ll be looking into the specifics of her case.

“Any time you do a huge policy change like healthcare, there’s going to be all sorts of problems and glitches that need to be worked out,” Bass told me Tuesday from Washington, where she said there were new calls for allowing people to keep the policies they have, as President Obama had repeatedly promised they’d be able to do.

President Clinton has urged such a move, and Feinstein’s office backed the idea Tuesday. She noted in a statement that her office had received 30,832 contacts from Californians, “many of whom are very distressed by cancellations of their insurance policies and who are facing increased out-of-pocket expenses.”

“The Affordable Care Act is a good law, but it’s not perfect,” the Feinstein statement said.

No, not by a longshot, beginning with the federal website debacle and highlighted by Obama’s now-laughable promises of a smooth transition. But Bass worries that the problems will further embolden critics who were determined from the beginning to do a grave dance on healthcare reform.

Hundreds of people attended a town hall conference hosted by Bass on Sunday in West L.A. She said some attendees were in the same situation as Davis and not very happy about it; others were confused by their options. Bass said many were assisted as they enrolled in new plans through the state exchange, Covered California.

“But overall, people were like Margaret,” said Bass, who called Davis on Tuesday to discuss her case. “They really want this to work, and they’re just trying to figure it out.”

Which hasn’t been all that easy for Davis, an accountant and software consultant who couldn’t believe “how botched up” the healthcare.gov website was, among other problems.

And would anyone be shocked if insurance companies were trying to take advantage of all the confusion?

Davis lives with her husband and two teenage sons but chose not to be covered by her husband’s healthcare plan, which would have added $600 per month to the cost. All she wanted from her own plan was the peace of mind that came with knowing she wouldn’t go broke if she were seriously ill or injured.

She paid Kaiser $224 a month with a $5,000 deductible.

Under the new Kaiser plan, her premium would rise to $420.46 a month. The plan carries a lower deductible, of $4,500, after which she would then pay 40% of the cost of care up to a cap of $6,350.

Though Davis appreciates the goal that all policies must meet minimal standards of coverage, she doesn’t anticipate needing either the maternity or mental health care that would be part of her new plan.

“I had a feeling my cost would go up,” said Davis, who makes just enough money to be ineligible for a government subsidy, “but I was floored when I saw that it was an 87.7% increase.”

Davis checked the federal and state websites for a better option but couldn’t find one, so she called an insurance broker.

Steve Jakowchik found Davis a deal at Anthem Blue Cross that essentially splits the difference between her current Kaiser plan and the replacement plan. Davis told me she’s inclined to go with the Blue Cross deal unless there’s a reprieve and people are allowed to keep existing policies.

Jakowchik, meanwhile, told me that among the roughly 100 clients he’s assisting, about 30 are getting plans that are more comprehensive, cheaper or both. The other clients are paying anywhere from a little bit more to a lot more for plans that are inferior to what they had, better than what they had or about the same.

The most striking change he’s seeing, Jakowchik said, is among clients who can get pretty good deals, but only if they give up access to the doctors and hospitals they now use. Because his practice is on the Westside, he’s hearing from clients who aren’t happy about losing Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and UCLA Medical Center as hospital options.

“I just ran into one of these today,” said Jakowchik, who told me about a Marina del Rey family that has to decide between a big premium increase and access to Cedars, or much lower premiums but a choice between hospitals in Torrance or the San Fernando Valley.

In six months, a year, or maybe longer, it’s possible that the rocky transition will be behind us and the most well-intended goals of healthcare reform will be met.

But as the signature initiative of the Obama presidency, you’d think this would have been managed with a little more attention to detail.

Sarah Palin urged Americans to light up Capitol Hill switchboards to urge senators to live up to their campaign promises and support Senators Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Mike Lee (R-UT) in their effort to defund Obamacare.

“Remember, we elected these senators precisely for moments like this. If they can’t do anything with the power we’ve given them through their elected office, then perhaps it’s time for them to retire and let someone else have a go,” Palin said. “Opposition to Obamacare carried us to victory in 2010. And 2014 is just around the corner.”

On Saturday, Palin wrote an exclusive op-ed for Breitbart News backing Lee and Cruz. In her Facebook post on Monday, the day the Obamacare fight started in the Senate, Palin said it was even more important for Americans living in red states–like Alaska, Arkansas, Louisiana, and North Carolina–represented by Democrats to “politely” let their senators know there will be consequences at the ballot box if they vote procedurally to shut down debate in the Senate:

Please call your senators and politely ask them to stand with Senator Cruz. This is especially important if your senator is a Democrat up for re-election in a red state in 2014. That would be Senators Mark Begich (D-AK), Mark Pryor (D-AR), Mary Landrieu (D-LA), and Kay Hagan (D-NC). Remind them politely that we are watching their votes very carefully and even a procedural vote that shuts down this debate will be regarded as a vote for Obamacare, and there will be consequences for them at the ballot box next year. The same goes for Republicans up for re-election. We definitely expect them to stand shoulder to shoulder with Senator Cruz through thick and thin.

The House passed a short-term resolution to fund the government except for Obamacare on Friday. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) is attempting to insert an amendment to that bill that funds Obamacare before sending the bill back to the House. On Monday, Cruz asked that there be a 60-vote threshold for amendments on the House bill being taken up in the Senate.

Palin reiterated, “We shouldn’t preemptively surrender the fight to those who rammed through this outrageously burdensome and unaffordable ploy for government control of health care even though some are trying to convince us that the fight is futile.”

“Just because a fight isn’t easy, doesn’t mean it’s not worth fighting,” she said.

Palin then included information about where Americans could find the contact information for their senators:"

That's because one of the assistance programs most vulnerable to a government shutdown is one that provides supplemental nutrition for pregnant mothers and young children.

Known as the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, or WIC, the program is designed to provide low-income pregnant women, new mothers and children up to the age of five with additional healthy food in an effort to stave off adverse health effects, learning disabilities and other complications stemming from premature births or childhood malnourishment.

""No additional federal funds would be available,"" to continue the program in the event of a shutdown, the United States Department of Agriculture, which runs WIC, said on its website. ""States may have some funds available ... to continue operations for a week or so, but states would likely be unable to sustain operations for a longer period.""

Share your story: Are you worried about losing your WIC benefits?

There are just under nine million women and children on the program, according to USDA. The average monthly benefit is about $45.

That often comes on top of about $135 a month in food stamp benefits. WIC benefits mandate the money can only be spent on an approved list of healthy foods.

Suspending the program is a terrible idea, said Rev. Douglas Greenaway, head of the National WIC Association, which represents the regional offices that administer the programs.

While a suspension would only be temporary, it would send the wrong message to mothers, and perhaps convincing some that it's not worth signing up for, he said.

Greenaway said the program actually saves taxpayers money.

It costs $20,000 per pound to bring a premature child up to normal weight, he said. All told, for every $1 spent the program saves $4.21 in medical costs, he said.

And that's not even counting the long-term benefits. Children who receive WIC supplements are better prepared to enter school than those from similar socioeconomic backgrounds not in the program, he said.

""We have members of Congress who don't think the government should be in this business, whose ideology is to shrink the size of the federal government,"" said Greenaway. ""But there are huge human and health care costs for failing to fund a program like this."""

His remarks came as a bipartisan bill was introduced in the Senate to delay the implementation of the individual mandate of ObamaCare by one year, meaning Americans would avoid a $95 penalty for not having health insurance that is scheduled to kick in next year.

Referring to those who are losing their health insurance plans, Obama told NBC News, ""I am sorry that they are finding themselves in this situation based on assurances they got from me. We've got to work hard to make sure that they know we hear them and we are going to do everything we can to deal with folks who find themselves in a tough position as a consequence of this.”

The White House, while defending the health care law and vowing to fix the problems with the website, has not explicitly ruled out the possibility of delaying the individual mandate.

House Speaker John Boehner responded to Obama's apology late Thursday, saying ""an apology is certainly in order, but what Americans want to hear is that the president is going to keep his promise.""

More On This...

Thursday's bill was introduced by Senators Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Mark Kirk, R-Ill., who said since the Affordable Care Act was passed, there have been “many identifiable problems exposed in the law that need to be addressed.”

“We need to start working together to fix this law and make it work so that all Americans have access to affordable and reliable health care coverage,” Manchin said in a statement. “We can start with a one-year delay of the individual mandate to eliminate penalty fees if individuals choose to not enroll for a health care plan in 2014.

""This common sense proposal simply allows Americans to take more time to browse and explore their options, making 2014 a true transition year.”

The legislation acknowledges there are many positive components of the Affordable Care Act that will lead to health care becoming more affordable for all Americans, and these reforms must “continue to be implemented.”

“Nevertheless, it is important to recognize when a new program is not meeting the high standards that the American people expect,” the bill reads. “So far, the federal healthcare exchanges have failed, and we must deliver a better product.”

The bill also says that delaying the entire implementation of ObamaCare would not be “responsible,” but Congress should take action to make “commonsense reforms” to the law.

“Healthcare should not be a burden on consumers, which is why we must delay the penalty for individuals,” Kirk said in a statement. “Last July, American businesses were given more time to provide employees health coverage. If a delay is good enough for businesses, it should be good enough for all Americans.”"
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/09/12/House-Pulls-Spending-Bill-Over-ObamaCare-Fight,2013-09-12 00:00:00,['Mike Flynn'],House Pulls Spending Bill Over ObamaCare Fight,"Wednesday night, House Leadership withdrew legislation to fund the government through December in response to growing conservative criticism that the measure didn’t strip funding for ObamaCare. Congress must pass legislation to authorize continued government spending before September 30, or the government will shut down. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor had unveiled a plan that would split the ObamaCare funding from the underlying government spending, but conservatives balked at the plan. Any action on spending now has been pushed to next week.

Conservatives, led by Sens. Ted Cruz and Mike Lee, have argued that any measure to extend government spending authority should also include language to defund ObamaCare. On October 1, the health care exchanges authorized by ObamaCare, where individuals can presumably shop for health insurance, are set to open. On January 1, all Americans are mandated to have health insurance. On that date, as well, large subsidies and tax credits to supplement those insurance premiums will begin. Unless the law is uprooted now, it will likely remain.

Cantor’s plan envisioned the House passing a “clean” resolution to continue government spending, one which absorbed the sequester cuts. It also would include a separate resolution that defunded all aspects of ObamaCare. Under Cantor’s plan, the Senate would receive the “clean” resolution until it had voted on funding ObamaCare. The Senate would have to definitively vote on funding ObamaCare before it could vote to keep the government open.

Conservatives rebelled, arguing that the split resolutions offered nothing more than a symbolic vote against ObamaCare and removed all leverage against the unpopular law. Democrats in control of the Senate could vote down the ObamaCare defunding and then quickly authorize legislation to keep the government functioning.

The issue is, however, far more complicated. Funding ObamaCare requires about $13 billion in annual appropriations that is subject to Congressional authorization. More than $70 billion a year, however, is funded by mandatory spending that isn’t subject to Congressional authorization. In other words, Congress could eliminate all spending for ObamaCare, but 70% of the program would march on.

That said, everything in life is done on the margins. Eliminating just a fraction of the overall spending on ObamaCare could upend the whole program. That is the hope of conservatives. And that hope cause GOP Leadership to blink."

Peters']",U.S. Shutdown Nears as House Votes to Delay Health Law,"WASHINGTON — The federal government on Sunday morning barreled toward its first shutdown in 17 years after the Republican-run House, choosing a hard line, voted to attach a one-year delay of President Obama’s health care law and a repeal of a tax to pay for it to legislation to keep the government running.

The votes, just past midnight, followed an often-angry debate, with members shouting one another down on the House floor. Democrats insisted that Republicans refused to accept their losses in 2012, were putting contempt for the president over the good of the country and would bear responsibility for a shutdown. Republicans said they had the public on their side and were acting to protect Americans from a harmful and unpopular law that had already proved a failure.

The House first voted 248-174 to repeal a tax on medical devices, then voted 231-192 to delay the law’s implementation by a year — just days before the uninsured begin enrolling in the law’s insurance exchanges. The delay included a provision favored by social conservatives that would allow employers and health care providers to opt out of mandatory contraception coverage.

But before the House had even voted, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, declared the House bill dead. Senate Democrats are planning to table the Republican measures when they convene on Monday, leaving the House just hours to pass a stand-alone spending bill free of any measures that undermine the health care law."

Baristas are eager to tell their customers about the humaneness and the moral responsible stances taken by the company. Starbucks states at their site that:

We have always believed Starbucks can – and should — have a positive impact on the communities it serves. One person, one cup and one neighborhood at a time.

They preach community, ethical sourcing of their products, environmental footprint minimization, and global responsibility. Their support for the well-being of their employees is probative.





Starbucks’ stance is in stark contrast to companies like UPS and Papa John’s who have blamed the law for reduced health benefits, potential job losses, and potential store closings. Some small and medium sized businesses are keeping their headcount under 50 and/or their workers under 30 hours to skirt the law. Most corporations will simply fit the new law into their business model as they understand it is the moral thing to do.

It is time for the companies that intend to expand their benefits or companies that do not intend to go through hoops to penalize their employees by denying them the ability to get affordable healthcare through the company, to speak up. It is time for Americans to know which corporations are with the working middle class and which corporations are against the working middle class."

Officials say the plan would be part of a broader effort to save Detroit tens of millions of dollars in health costs each year, a major element in a restructuring package that must be approved by a bankruptcy judge. It is being watched closely by municipal leaders around the nation, many of whom complain of mounting, unsustainable prices for the health care promised to retired city workers.

Similar proposals that could shift public sector retirees into the new insurance markets, called exchanges, are already being planned or contemplated in places like Chicago; Sheboygan County, Wis.; and Stockton, Calif. While large employers that eliminate health benefits for full-time workers can be penalized under the health care law, retirees are a different matter.

“There’s fear and panic about what this means,” said Michael Underwood, 62, who retired from the Chicago Police Department after 30 years and has diabetes and Parkinson’s disease. Mr. Underwood, who says he began working for the city when employees did not pay into future Medicare coverage, is part of a group suing Chicago over its plan to phase many retirees out of city coverage during the next three and a half years. “I was promised health care for myself and my wife for life,” he said."

The problem is, if Republicans get anything close to their way—and remember, it's Democrats they're bargaining with, so there's a good chance Republicans do get much of what they want— the solution could be as bad as the problem of sequestration. Social Security and Medicaid aren't sequestered. But cutting those programs has been on the Republican wish list for a long time, and will be one of their demands.

The question is how hard Democrats will fight to protect the programs that seniors rely on and that give non-seniors the promise of being able to retire without living in abject poverty.



""The president has made one of his bottom lines that significant revenues have to be on the table,"" said Chuck Loveless, the director of legislation for AFSCME, a major public services employees union. ""If he sticks to his guns on that I'm not worried, but chained CPI is on his shortlist. We oppose that, and it is a significant cut to social security.""

It should go without saying that if Democrats agree to cut Social Security benefits, even at the insistence of Republicans, come 2014 and 2016, Republicans will wage campaign attacks against Democrats for having cut Social Security. But with Republicans so insistent, and a few Democrats wobbly on the issue, New York Democratic Rep. Jerry Nadler says that ""If you go in and decide to fix sequestration, how much longer can you exempt entitlements. It's difficult to do if you want to get bipartisan agreement.""

This is the fight. Can Republicans protect tax subsidies for oil companies by cutting Social Security benefits for seniors? Are Democrats going to make that deal? If Americans don't want Social Security cut—and they don't, even if politicians are calling it ""chained CPI"" and pretending it's not really a cut—that needs to be crystal clear to Congress and the president.

Tell Congress it's time to end tax loopholes for corporations and the wealthy."

Last year, 12,000 employees were vaccinated under the Air Force's program, free of charge. Now, only beneficiaries of TRICARE, the Defense Department health system, will be eligible, along with members of the military, their families and military retirees.

""In the past, AFMC has offered both the flu vaccine and wellness programs because civilian health and wellness is an important factor that supports our command mission,"" said Col. James King, AFMC command surgeon, in a statement this week. ""Unfortunately, limited resources required us to prioritize and ultimately fund broader health programs that provide more resources for the total health of our civilian workforce.""

The Air Force added that it had had to purchase vaccines in early 2013, ""when this year's budget numbers were less certain""; sequestration went into effect on March 1.

""Analysis determined that less than 20 percent of the civilian population used the AFMC-provided flu vaccine program and officials elected to instead fund AFMC's more comprehensive civilian programs, the Employee Assistance Program and Civilian Health Promotion Services,"" King added.

The Navy said it will not be following the path taken by the Air Force and will continue to offer free flu shots to civilian employees.

""The Navy is not taking this measure with its civilian workers,"" said spokesman Paul Ross. ""We intend to vaccinate all civilian health care workers providing direct patient care and those where it is written in their position description as a condition of employment.""

""We highly encourage vaccination of other Navy civilian personnel if flu vaccine is available at the medical treatment facility, but priority groups must be vaccinated first (e.g. service members, and health care workers),"" he added. ""We anticipate being able to offer this opportunity this year.""

Army spokeswoman Alayne Conway said their policy on flu shots had not changed due to sequestration, and civilians are still eligible to receive the vaccination.

Lisa Novak, a spokeswoman with the Coast Guard, was not aware of any changes to their flu shot policy due to sequestration.

""The seasonal flu vaccine is mandatory for all Coast Guard Active Duty and Selected Reserve personnel and is also mandatory for Child Development Services personnel and civilian, contract and Auxiliary healthcare personnel who provide direct patient care in clinics,"" she said. ""After these mandatory groups, the next highest-priority groups are deploying civilian employees and others enrolled at Coast Guard Regional Practice clinics and deemed high-risk by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria.""

""One these priority populations are immunized, Coast Guard Regional Practice clinics may offer the flu vaccine to all other beneficiaries, and all Coast Guard civilian employees as supplies allow,"" she added.

The Marines did not return a request for comment on how sequestration was affecting flu season preparation.

Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, is also concerned that sequestration will make it harder to fight the flu. He recently told The Huffington Post that a universal flu vaccine could potentially be developed in the next five years, but that work will be significantly slowed due to budget cuts.

""If you want to convert this into real meaningful numbers, that means people are going to die of influenza five years from now because we don't yet have the universal vaccine,"" said Collins. ""And God help us if we get a worldwide pandemic that emerges in the next five years, which takes a long time to prepare a vaccine for. If we had the universal vaccine, it would work for that too.""

I think most people would agree that the American healthcare system has a lot of flaws. One of the biggest flaws is our fee-for-service system in general. It doesn't make any sense, but I get paid the same to see someone for an ear infection as I do to see someone with high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes. Someone comes for an appointment, and based on the level of detail I obtain in the history, the level of detail needed in physical examination, and the complexity of medical decision-making, that determines the fee for the visit. So as you can imagine, an ear infection or sore throat requires a LOT less work than managing three or more chronic problems, and the medications, labs, monitoring tests, etc. that go along with them. But again, you are paid the same to see the ear infection patient as you are to see the person with uncontrolled diabetes, high BP, and high cholesterol.

On the surface, that makes no sense at all, but the thinking is that it probably costs too much for the ear infection, too little for the diabetes/BP/cholesterol patient, but it all evens out in the long run. The rules for 'coding' a level of service for an appointment govern the fees, and they are relatively simple, as otherwise it would just be too complicated to have a different fee structure for every diagnosis. Anyway, the idea is that it all comes out in the wash. That might be true in a simple world, but of course we live in a complex world with a lot of moving parts.

As you can see, the fee-for-service environment does not really incentivize physicians to focus their efforts on chronic disease management. I'm not implying that physicians are not trying to do a good job or are just in it to make as much money as possible, but let's face it: if you make the same amount per patient, and you can see 30 patients with ear infections or 15 diabetic/hypertensive/hyperlipidemic patients, which would you choose? How would you set up your schedule?

Everyone agrees that prevention is the most cost-effective way to keep people healthy. Vaccines, for example, are arguably the single most cost-effective thing in all of medicine (get your flu vaccine if you have not already done so, by the way!). Preventative care is now covered without a co-pay because of the ACA. That is awesome. However, better care/control of chronic disease doesn't pay well, as discussed above. But better control of diabetes, of BP, of cholesterol, of COPD, of asthma, of heart failure will save lots and lots and lots of money in the long run because complications of all these diseases are expensive. It costs a LOT to be in the hospital, to have a heart bypass, to have dialysis, etc. A rough estimate is that a well-controlled diabetic costs the system an average of $4,000 per year to take care of, but an uncontrolled diabetic will cost $16,000 or more. So why would we pay doctors the same for an ear infection as we would to take care of serious chronic disease?

Part of the answer unfortunately is that people switch insurances and by the time they develop more significant complications, they are on Medicare anyway, so UHC, Humana, Anthem don't need to worry about paying for dialysis. In the long run, though, it saves us all money if we do a better job of taking care of chronic illness. So it makes sense to try to incentivize doctors to improve our chronic disease management instead of incentivizing doctors to just see as many patients as possible in the day.

So enough background. Here's the good stuff. The ACA provides funding and guidance for a new way to approach health care. The Comprehensive Primary Care initiative is a program that involves about 500 practices across the country, in several geographic areas. Southwest Ohio/N. KY, New Jersey, Arkansas, Colorado, New York, Oregon, and Oklahoma have participating practices. Practices were selected based on a number of factors, including past willingness to participate in such things as NCQA quality recognition, and patient-centered medical home (PCMH) certification. You can read more here: http://innovation.cms.gov/...

Basically, CMS (center for Medicare and Medicaid services) provides funding outside of the fee-for-service environment for practices to do a better job of chronic disease management. There is/was a detailed application process, and multiple milestones you have to meet, but a lot of it boils down to CMS providing additional monies for practices to use as they see fit in order to help improve the care for their patients, particularly (although not exclusively) those with higher risk chronic illness.

The whole thing is actually really interesting. While there are quite a lot of specifics, there are also a lot of areas open to interpretation. CMS is partnering with multiple private insurance carriers to provide a monthly fee (outside of any appointment or fee-for-service interaction) to physician practices in order to help those practices invest in infrastructure which will help improve patient care. The amount per patient per month is based on risk assessment. Basically, the more diagnoses, and the more complicated a patient is, the higher the monthly fee. A well-controlled diabetic would have a lower fee than a diabetic with chronic kidney disease, heart disease, and neuropathy. So right off the bat, you can see how this is a paradigm shift from the traditional fee-for-service environment. You may actually be paid more to take care of a more complicated person and try to keep them out of the hospital.

However, and this is a BIG part, the money from this CPC initiative can NOT be paid to physicians as compensation. It is to be used to improve infrastructure. This is actually pretty cool because instead of just paying doctors more and saying, ""hey, if we pay you more, you'll do a better job, right?"", CMS is saying, ""we will give you money to use as you see fit (within the structure of our program and its milestones) to improve patient care which should improve outcomes, decrease severe complication rates, improve patient satisfaction, and eventually decrease overall costs through an investment up front.""

If you hadn't already guessed, my group has several practices involved in the CPCI program and we are excited about it. I don't know what the other 490-some practices across the country are doing, but we have used the money to hire more staff, including what we call Care Coordinators for each office, an RN who can reach out to patients before, during and after appointments to see how we can better coordinate care. We try to have labs drawn before folks come for appointments, so we can have already reviewed the results before walking in the room. This allows for more efficient care. If someone's cholesterol is not to goal, for example, we can increase the dose of their cholesterol medication while sitting with them and explaining why an LDL goal of under 70 is the target. This works a lot better than a medical assistant calling someone and playing phone tag three days after their appointment to try to make sure they know that the new dose is 40 mg instead of 20. Anyway, the Care Coordinator can help reach out to people who might need help paying for meds and see what assistance programs might help someone. She can help someone who was recently in the hospital understand their new medication regimen and help set up their follow up. If someone doesn't go for the colonoscopy or mammogram that we ordered, she can call them and find out why and/or encourage them to go (and maybe mention that preventative care is covered 100% now!). She can review their chart ahead of time and put in a reminder for the doctor that the patient is due for a pneumonia vaccine or a shingles vaccine. This is all part of the team-based approach to care which is helping to improve patient outcomes. Our practice would not really been able to afford a Care Coordinator without the CPCI monies. Our group has also decided to hire a diabetes educator. Insurance is often squirrelly about paying for diabetes education, despite study after study clearly showing the benefits. Now we will be able to offer diabetes eduction free of charge to all of our patients. This is pretty great all around. The doctors get more help, the patients get more individualized attention and care, outcomes improve, which specifically means someone didn't have a stroke. Someone didn't lose their vision because of diabetes. Someone had a precancerous colon polyp removed instead of being diagnosed with metastatic cancer a couple years later. Someone's grandmother didn't lose her foot. Oh, and all that stuff also saves money.

That's the other piece of the CPCI, which is a multi-year venture: ""shared savings."" You can calculate how much a population of patients is likely to cost over say, three years, based on how sick they are. If people get their blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar, asthma under better control, they will cost less to take care of because they will have fewer ER visits, fewer hospitalizations, fewer procedures. Sure, they might take more medications, get more frequent lab tests, maybe more frequent (outpatient) doctor appointments, but this leads to an overall reduction of the cost of care. So for the additional work to do a better job of taking care of patients, practices in each region get a chance to share in the $$ saved by providing more efficient care. This will be calculated and distributed equally among the 75 or so practices in each region.

There's of course a lot more to the story, but this diary is already rather lengthy. I'm excited about the program though. It really is a win-win. It has a lot of the things that us progressives like: government-initiated innovation. Science-based (or to use the medical buzzword, evidence-based) care. Regulations on how the money can be used, with the greater good in mind. Short term investment for long term success (I didn't mention that the money is eventually phased out with the hope that the infrastructure improvements will lead to overall better reimbursements, and a focus on ""pay-for-performance"" or better pay for better quality care). Using government dollars to help those who need it most (ie sicker patients). Shared benefits in the long run for all of us. If we are all healthier, we cost less to the healthcare system. We are more productive workers. We have fewer people on disability. We end up putting more $$ back into the economy and indirectly increase government revenue (if you can work more and make more money because you are healthier, you end up paying more taxes and of course can purchase more goods and services).

Anyway, it's a relatively small part of the ACA, and unless you go to a practice involved in the CPCI, you likely would never hear about it. But in the long run, the idea is that the extra $$ will help to transform how we provide care, therefore leading to a sea change in primary care across the country. If you get better outcomes, improve patient satisfaction AND save money while practicing a certain way, every practice is going to want to adopt these methods. Over the next few years, the 500 practices will be sharing (HIPAA-compliant) data, successes and failures, to try to come up with ""best practices"" we can all use to keep people healthier longer. Because everyone benefits from that, and that is really what the Affordable Care Act is about."

Even as President Obama and congressional Republicans gear up for a new budget battle, Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which together provide coverage to more than 1 in 5 Americans and almost 1 in 3 Californians over the course of a year, appear off-limits despite their huge price tag.

The president protected Medicaid in 2011 when Congress and the White House slashed $1.2 trillion in federal spending, including on Medicare — the healthcare plan for seniors and disabled people — as part of a deal to raise the nation’s debt limit.

Medicaid was spared again last month in the budget compromise that raised tax rates on high-income households — a deal that included even more Medicare cuts.

Now, with Obama banking on a dramatic Medicaid expansion next year under his landmark healthcare law, the White House is drawing another bright line around the program. The president explicitly defended Medicaid in his inaugural address, and top aides have amplified his words since.

“Medicaid cuts, from this president, from this administration, are not on the table,” Gene Sperling, the head of the National Economic Council at the White House, declared in a speech Thursday to a healthcare conference, explicitly ruling out even cuts that the administration previously had considered.

“We’ve made a tough choice” to wall off Medicaid from cuts, he said, making the budgetary trade-off explicit: “It means we will have to look harder for Medicare savings.”

A major reason for the White House position is the key role that Medicaid plays in Obama’s health reform effort. The president’s law is slated to provide nearly $1 trillion in new federal aid to states over the next decade to help them open Medicaid to all low-income Americans for the first time starting in 2014. That is central to the law’s program for expanding insurance coverage to an estimated 30 million people by 2022.

Preserving Medicaid funding became even more crucial to the Obama administration after the Supreme Court ruled last summer that states were not required to expand their Medicaid coverage. Administration officials are working hard to convince states to expand and do not want any federal funding cuts that could discourage governors from implementing the law.

“There is a big irony,” said Ron Pollack, executive director of Washington-based Families USA, a leading Medicaid advocate. “The fact that the Supreme Court undermined the Medicaid expansion is now resulting in greater support and a deeper commitment to making sure the program is not cut back.”

Paying for Medicaid remains a major challenge for states. The program has been jointly funded by states and the federal government since it was created. And many states, including California, Illinois and New York, have had to make painful cutbacks in recent years to balance their budgets by reducing physician fees and paring benefits, such as dental care.

At the same time, Republicans are working to slash Medicaid spending to balance the federal budget. They advocate turning the program into a block grant to states, which they say would be more efficient and also put a limit on future federal spending.

Cutting Medicaid was a centerpiece of budget plans pushed by Rep. Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), the House Budget Committee chairman. Ryan’s running mate on the GOP presidential ticket, Mitt Romney, advocated similar cuts.

House Republicans are gearing up for another run at trimming Medicaid as they prepare a budget blueprint that they say would balance the budget in 10 years without raising taxes, a goal that would likely require trillions of dollars in new cuts.

“The need for reform is that much more urgent,” said Rep. Todd Rokita (R-Ind.), who sponsored legislation last year backed by 48 GOP lawmakers to cap federal Medicaid spending, which would have effectively cut approximately $2 trillion over the next decade. “It is a matter of saving these things for future generations.”

But congressional Republicans, who tried unsuccessfully in the 1990s to scale back Medicaid, will likely have an even harder time now.

Enrollment in Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which was created in 1997 to expand government-subsidized coverage for children, has surged by more than 70% since 2000 as states expanded their safety nets after businesses laid off workers or eliminated health benefits.

That has meant Medicaid, a program established in 1965 to help Americans on welfare, is increasingly essential to millions of working families who cannot afford health insurance and to elderly and disabled Americans in need of long-term care. Medicaid is the single largest payer for nursing homes in the country.

“This is now a middle-class entitlement that touches far more Americans than many people realize,” said Colleen M. Grogan, a Medicaid authority at the University of Chicago. Half of all Americans in 2011 either received Medicaid or had a friend or family member who received it, according to a national survey by the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation.

Romney and other conservatives criticized this as a debilitating dependency during the 2012 presidential campaign. But many state leaders — Republican and Democratic — have come to rely on Medicaid, despite its flaws, to protect their most vulnerable residents.

Medicaid also draws important support from influential hospital and physician groups, which have rallied behind the program even as many criticize it for paying too little. Without Medicaid, many medical providers would have to care for even more patients unable to pay their bills.

Just last month, a coalition of medical societies, including several from conservative states, helped defeat an attempt by congressional Republicans to cut federal aid intended to increase Medicaid fees paid to primary care physicians.

Similar lobbying in state capitals has also convinced several Republican governors to drop opposition to expanding Medicaid under the healthcare law. Most recently, Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer announced last month that she would take the assistance, after an intense lobbying effort by hospitals and businesses, which argued that without the additional aid healthcare providers would be swamped by uninsured patients.

Medicaid’s political clout will only increase in the coming years as close to 20 million more Americans come to depend on the program under the Affordable Care Act, Grogan predicted. In some states, as much as a quarter of the population could soon be on Medicaid.

Federal spending on the program, which topped $262 billion last year, is expected to surpass $581 billion by 2021, according to estimates by independent actuaries at the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

Obama’s healthcare law is creating other challenges for many states, which are scrambling to get ready for the historic Medicaid expansion while also trying to ensure their programs pay for healthcare more efficiently.

“We’re a long way from seeing many of these issues resolved,” said Diana Dooley, California’s health and human services secretary, who oversees one of the most cash-strapped Medicaid programs in the country. “But I’m encouraged that there seems to be a recognition of the importance of the Medicaid program. The conversations are going in the right direction.”

Sen. Menendez contacted top officials in friend’s Medicare dispute

Sen. Robert Menendez raised concerns with top federal health-care officials twice in recent years about their finding that a Florida eye doctor — a close friend and major campaign donor — had overbilled the government by $8.9 million for care at his clinic, Menendez aides said Wednesday.

Menendez (D-N.J.) initially contacted federal officials in 2009 about the government’s audit of Salomon Melgen, complaining to the director overseeing Medicare payments that it was unfair to penalize the doctor because the billing rules were ambiguous, the aides said.

Last year, in a meeting with the acting administrator of the agency in charge of Medicare and Medicaid, Menendez again questioned whether federal auditors had been fair in their assessment of Melgen’s billing for eye injections to treat macular degeneration, the senator’s aides said.

The agency had ordered Melgen to repay the $8.9 million, and at the time of both conversations, Melgen was disputing the agency’s conclusion. His appeal continues to this day.

Menendez’s office provided this account of his contacts with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services after The Washington Post asked about the role he had played in the long-standing dispute between Melgen and the agency over his billing practices.

Menendez, who became chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee this month, is under scrutiny because of his close relationship with Melgen. The doctor donated more than $700,000 last year to Menendez’s reelection campaign and other Senate Democrats. And when Melgen needed help with a port security contract in the Dominican Republic last year, Menendez urged U.S. officials to press the country to carry out the multimillion-dollar agreement.

Menendez is facing a Senate ethics inquiry about two free trips he took in 2010 on Melgen’s private plane to the doctor’s seaside mansion in the Dominican Republic. Menendez acknowledged this month that he had not properly disclosed the trips. He wrote a personal check for $58,500 to reimburse Melgen.

Meanwhile, a federal investigation of what law enforcement officials say are allegations of health-care fraud by Melgen escalated last week when FBI agents and health-care investigators raided medical offices in West Palm Beach where he runs Vitreo-Retinal Consultants. The teams spent nearly 24 hours searching the premises and removing dozens of boxes containing billing and medical records and computer files.

Federal investigators and health-care auditors have had concerns about Melgen’s billing practices at various times over the past decade, two former federal officials said. In part, they have examined the volume of eye injections, surgeries and laser treatments performed at his West Palm Beach clinic.

But a Menendez aide said Wednesday that the senator did not know Melgen was under formal investigation for possible fraud until the well-publicized raid last week.

“Senator Menendez was never aware of and has not intervened in any Medicare fraud investigation on behalf of Vitreo Retinal Consultants,” his office said in a statement.

The senator’s conversation with federal officials about Melgen’s case was unrelated to the current investigation, Menendez aides said.

“On a separate issue regarding Medicare reimbursement, he has in the past raised concerns with CMS about conflicting guidelines and ambiguity in CMS rules that are difficult for providers to understand and can lead to judgments after the fact,” the statement said. “His interest was in making sure providers were not penalized if CMS clarified or changed the rules of the game retroactively.”

Alan Reider, Melgen’s attorney, said Wednesday that his client has returned the government money in dispute but is contesting the CMS audit finding so he can reclaim the money. Reider said Melgen believes he was following Medicare guidelines. Reider added that Melgen was not aware that his practice was under investigation until federal agents arrived at his clinic last week.

At issue in the reimbursement dispute is Melgen’s multiple use of individual vials for eye injections to treat macular degeneration. Federal auditors have said Melgen often billed the government three to four times for injections from a single vial, according to two federal officials and lawyers familiar with the case.

The government’s Medicare program reimburses providers $2,000 for each vial, so Melgen was billing $6,000 to $8,000 for each vial.

Melgen’s attorneys said the doctor was properly billing for treating four patients with medical injections, albeit from one vial.

After CMS ruled in 2008 that Melgen would have to repay the government, he and his legal representatives contacted Menendez’s office, arguing that the finding was unfair, the senator’s aides said. Menendez’s staff members had several conversations with agency officials to learn more about the billing rules and the details of Melgen’s case in particular, the aides said.

In July 2009, Menendez called Jonathan Blum, the Medicare director at CMS, to express concern, the aides said. Menendez brought up Melgen’s case, they said, in the context of broader concerns about the guidelines.

Then, in June 2012, Menendez raised Melgen’s case again at a meeting with CMS Acting Administrator Marilyn Tavenner, aides recounted. They said the primary subject of the meeting was the implementation of President Obama’s health-care overhaul.

The aides said Menendez never urged the CMS to take specific action on Melgen’s case.

Blum and Tavenner declined to comment through a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services.

Melgen frequently cited his connection to Menendez, according to two former federal officials and doctors in South Florida.

When federal health-care fraud investigators were questioning him several years ago about his billing practices, he invoked the senator’s name, the former officials said.

“He used Menendez’s name all the time. He would say, “Menendez is a good friend of mine, and he knows I never did anything wrong,’ ” said a former senior federal official familiar with the investigation.

In Florida, it was more threatening, several doctors in the South Florida region recounted. After one local eye surgeon criticized Melgen’s treatment methods in discussions with other Florida doctors, Melgen warned that he had important friends in the Senate, including Menendez, said two doctors familiar with the exchange. They said Melgen cautioned that his Washington friends could arrange an intensive federal audit of the surgeon’s practice.

Reider, the attorney, said he had no knowledge of any comments Melgen may have made mentioning his friendship to Menendez.

Melgen came to the attention of fraud investigators amid complaints from other local eye doctors alleging that his treatments were often unnecessary, a waste of money and sometimes harmful to patients’ eyesight, the two former federal officials and several doctors said.

At the same time, investigators considered him an “outlier” compared with his peers because of the volume of his billing and the rate at which he administered eye injections and performed procedures on government-insured patients, the former officials said. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation is still ongoing.

Melgen “was somebody who consistently showed up on the radar and was being looked at quite a bit,” said a former senior health-care fraud investigator. “The sheer volume itself is going to keep him on the radar.’’

When federal investigators interviewed Melgen, he tried to exert pressure on them by mentioning the names of Menendez and other influential politicians, the former fraud investigator said. “We thought it was odd because Menendez was in New Jersey and this guy was in Florida,’’ the official said.

A second former federal official recounted that Menendez’s name came up repeatedly when Melgen was interviewed by investigators from the Justice Department and the inspector general’s office at the Department of Health and Human Services.

“He was using Menendez more as a character reference,” the official said. “He thought he was untouchable.”

The federal interest in Melgen stretches back 10 years, when investigators interviewed Philip Rosenfeld, a nationally known retina specialist, about the volume of treatments Melgen was performing, said several eye doctors in South Florida.

These doctors said Rosenfeld, who pioneered the use of Avastin injections for macular degeneration to stem eyesight loss, had long been troubled by Melgen’s methods.

FBI agents recently interviewed Rosenfeld again, this time two days before they raided Melgen’s clinic, the doctors said.

Reached at his home in Key Biscayne, Rosenfeld declined to comment.

Doctors in south Florida said that they have been fearful of criticizing Melgen publicly, and that his Washington connections may be protecting him.

In 2010, Melgen scolded eye surgeon Randy Katz for publicly criticizing the quality of his care. According to two fellow doctors, Melgen cited his Senate connections and told Katz that he could face a Medicare investigation.

Katz did not respond to requests for comment. Melgen’s attorney declined to discuss his client’s conversations with Katz or allegations that his client had threatened other doctors.

Soon after the encounter, according to a copy of a letter obtained by The Post, Katz wrote to Palm Beach doctors in praise of Melgen.

“It has come to my attention that certain statements I made have been misunderstood as criticisms of Dr. Melgen,” Katz wrote in the open letter. “To be clear, I know Dr. Salomon Melgen to be a capable and

highly-skilled vitreo-retinal surgeon. . . . If you hear any suggestion that I have said otherwise, you should disregard that suggestion as being false.”

So far, it doesn't look like he's succeeding. By the end of the day Tuesday, Boehner will present a plan that attempts to fake out Senate Democrats and force any possibility of a shutdown into their court.

The plan reportedly is to pass what they're calling a ""clean"" continuing resolution bill for funding the government for the next three months that includes a separate House concurrent resolution to defund Obamacare. They would create a rule to govern debate on the bill that said the House wouldn't send the funding part of the bill over to the Senate until that body voted on the Obamacare defunding part of the bill. The Senate would vote down the defunding measure so they could go onto the spending bill. That would allow Republicans to declare that Senate Democrats ""own"" Obamacare, a threat that said Democrats can probably live with.

The proposal has gone over like a lead balloon with the far right. Club for Growth president Chris Chocola calls the proposal a ""bad joke,"" and said ""[t]rying to fool Republicans into voting to fund ObamaCare is even worse than offering a bill that deliberately funds it."" Teabagger House members are also not mollified, still demanding a continuing resolution that defunds Obamacare. Eighty of them signed a letter to Boehner to that effect, and an aide told The Hill that they ""are still expected to vote against any continuing resolution that does not defund ObamaCare.""

But the Obamacare defunding might just be a sideshow for Boehner and Majority Leader Eric Cantor, who have their eye on another prize: maintaining the sequester level of federal spending for everything but defense. Cantor told his caucus that this would be their victory, forcing the president to sign a continuing resolution that ""wipes away all the increases he and congressional Democrats made while they were in charge and returns us to a pre-2008 level of discretionary spending.” Salon's Brian Beutler outlines this part of the plan Boehner and Cantor might decide to take.



The new fiscal year starts on October 1. To adhere to the debt limit deal, Congress would pass a CR appropriating $1.058 trillion — $552 billion for defense, $506 billion for non defense. Then, sequestration would automatically reduce that to an annualized rate of $967 billion. The advantage off writing the CR this way is that if at any point Congress manages to agree on a plan to replace sequestration, discretionary spending will automatically increase to the levels agreed up on in 2011. But GOP leaders keep hinting at writing the CR to reflect a maximum appropriation of $988 billion — the same amount the government is spending under sequestration right now.

The sequestration measure would then kick in to make the actual spending level $967 billion for the next year. The $21 billion difference between the appropriated $988 billion and the $967 billion limit would be plowed into defense spending, while cash-starved domestic programs would continue to have to function on their sequester-reduced budgets. Cute trick for Boehner, if he can pull it off. But Democrats are full aware of his plans, and are demanding a truly ""clean"" continuing resolution with ""no funny business,"" according to an aide to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.

If this is the path Boehner decides on, he also has to get it past his own Republicans, because he won't have any Democratic support. Given how devoted the extremists in his caucus are to really, truly defunding Obamacare (or at least trying to) he might not get that far, and he might have to shoulder responsibility for a shutdown fight anyway."

A report released yesterday by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce reveals the devastating reality many Americans will face when Obamacare is in full force next year. While the majority of Americans will likely see their healthcare premiums increase, no one will swallow the cost burden more than young Americans.

Previous studies have reported that youth healthcare premiums could increase as much as 45 percent, but the the House Committee report concluded that young Americans could see an increase as much as 203 percent.

“Recent college graduates with entry-level jobs who are struggling to pay off student loan debt could see their premiums increase on average between 145 and 189 percent,” the report said. “Some studies estimate young adults could experience premium increases as high as 203 percent. Any increase, let alone tripling current costs, could break the bank for young adults who have just started out on their own.”

The current average payment for health care premiums among young Americans is $648, but will increase to $1,872 under the Obamacare legislation. The graph below breaks down the average increases in healthcare premiums for young Americans in major cities:

According to the report, young Americans are disproportionately affected by Obamacare for three reasons:

Guaranteed Issue and Community Rating: In other words, price controls. Obamacare mandates that all Americans pay healthcare premiums regardless of anticipated medical expenses. Young Americans must subsidize retirees who use healthcare far more often to level the insurance price disparity between younger and older Americans. Essential Health Benefits: Obamacare mandates certain health servives be covered by health insurance. These include coverage for preventive and wellness services, chronic disease management, rehabilitative and habilitative services, and many more. In short, the more categories you are forced to cover, the more expensive your premium will be. No more affordable catastrophic plans. Taxes and Fees on Plans, Drugs, and Medical Devices: The total cost of new taxes and fees on drug manufacturers, device manufacturers, and health care plans is $165 billion. This will ultimately be passed on to the consumer in higher premiums.

Families will also see a significant increase in their healthcare premiums. One of the studies in the report found that a family could see the costs of their premiums rise to $7,186 in the next decade.

With a stagnant economy, unprecedented levels of unemployment (youth unemployment currently 17.6 percent), and average household expenses on the rise (gas, food, energy, etc), there are very few people that can afford $800-$4,000 more to pay for the rise in healthcare premiums.

Remember when President Obama said, “if you like your healthcare plan, you can keep your healthcare plan”? Or that Obamacare would “bring down premiums by $2,500 for the typical family.” Me too."
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/02/business/economy/why-the-health-care-law-scares-the-gop.html,2013-10-02 00:00:00,['Eduardo Porter'],Why the Health Care Law Scares the G.O.P.,"Republicans’ efforts raise the same perplexing question posed by The Missourian: What drives Tea Party Republicans and their financial backers? What calculation persuades them that repealing the health care law is worth the risk? Indeed, whose interests do they represent?

Nearly 6 in 10 Americans disapprove of trying to stop the law by cutting its financing. Even among those who don’t like the law, less than half want their representatives in Congress to try to make it fail.

It is tempting to discard the Tea Party activists driving the Republican Party as crazy — as some commentators have — motivated by fear and willing to believe that default won’t cause much harm and might even act as a purgative to free the economy of a bloated government.

“They listen to nobody but themselves,” the Harvard political scientist Theda Skocpol told me. “They are convinced of their rectitude and convinced that they alone are qualified to save America from the dire threat of Obama and his polices. They have worked themselves into a dangerous place.”

Their relationship with reality can take peculiar turns. Reflexive opponents of “government,” they can exhibit little sense of what the government actually does.

And yet the argument that half the Republican Party has simply lost its mind has to be an unsatisfactory answer, especially considering the sophistication of some of the deep-pocketed backers of the Tea Party insurgency.

There is a plausible alternative to irrationality. Flawed though it may turn out to be, Obamacare, as the Affordable Care Act is popularly known, could fundamentally change the relationship between working Americans and their government. This could pose an existential threat to the small-government credo that has defined the G.O.P. for four decades."

USA TODAY

Questionable Medicaid reports coming from states including Illinois%2C Texas and Michigan

Woman due in February fears she%27ll be without insurance coverage when her baby is born.

More complete Medicaid files going from HHS to states this week

The federal health care exchange is incorrectly determining that some people are eligible for Medicaid when they clearly are not, leaving them with little chance to get the subsidized insurance they are entitled to as the Dec. 23 deadline for enrollment approaches.

State and industry officials haven't quantified the problem yet, but the National Association of State Medicaid Directors may release information next week after following up on reports from around the country, says Executive Director Matt Salo.

Here's what happens: When consumers applying for insurance put their income information into subsidy calculators on HealthCare.gov — the exchange handling insurance sales for 36 states — it tells them how much financial assistance they qualify for or that they are eligible for Medicaid. If it's the latter, consumers aren't able to obtain subsidies toward the insurance, although they could buy full-priced plans.

If the Medicaid determination is wrong, consumers should file an appeal with the federal marketplace, says Department of Health and Human Services spokeswoman Joanne Peters, but she says she does not have an estimate on how long that would take.

Brokers are reporting that some of their clients are in insurance limbo as they wait for the error to be corrected by HHS or their states so they can reapply.

Jessica Waltman, top lobbyist for the National Association of Health Underwriters, says she's heard a number of reports from around the country of people making as much as $80,000 a year being told they qualify for Medicaid on HealthCare.gov.

""I have heard on multiple occasions from brokers in various states over the past eight weeks that they have had wacky Medicaid determinations with people who clearly make way too much money for Medicaid,"" she says.

HealthCare.gov is ""working smoothly for the vast majority of users,"" says Peters, but she noted some people may have technical difficulties or complicated family or tax situations that require extra assistance.

HHS has added more call center employees and in-person assistants for people who need extra help, she says.

But insurance brokers say that when people call the HealthCare.gov ""800"" number to explain that they can't possibly be eligible for Medicaid, they are told they are eligible if the site says so.

""It's a very, very unfortunate state of affairs,"" says Waltman.

HHS said it will begin sending Medicaid application files to states this week given that HealthCare.gov's mechanism to transfer accounts to state Medicaid offices still isn't working. The data received up until now haven't given states enough information to determine Medicaid eligibility, says Salo, but he hopes that, as promised, the new files will.

""Claims from some states about our process for testing the Medicaid eligibility and enrollment systems are inaccurate,"" says Peters. ""We are eager to work with states to ensure their systems are functioning properly and to extend Medicaid coverage to those who are eligible through the generous Medicaid funding made possible by the Affordable Care Act.""

HHS is working ""extremely hard"" to make sure people will have coverage no matter what on Jan. 1, says Salo. While states support that goal, ""some want more assurances that people enrolled in Medicaid are actually eligible,"" he says.

HHS has told states they won't be penalized if they enroll people in Medicaid who HHS erroneously said were eligible, says Salo.

That's little consolation for consumers who can't buy subsidized insurance on the exchange because of apparent mistakes.

Jacob Hawkins of Plano, Texas, makes about $50,000 a year as a self-employed pool builder, yet his family of three was deemed eligible for Medicaid. His wife, Holly, is due to have their second child in February and is worried she won't have insurance in time. She filed an appeal of the Medicaid determination, but doubts it will be approved before the Dec. 23 deadline.

""I'm frustrated, mad and there's no one to help,"" says Hawkins.

Being married with a $50,000 income will get you a decline from Medicaid, even with a pregnant wife, says Hawkins' broker, Connie Louanne Trebing. "" I know, because I just had a couple declined in a similar situation,"" she says.

Some of the files of those supposedly eligible for Medicaid in Texas include people who don't live in Texas and who are already signed up for Medicaid, says Stephanie Goodman, spokeswoman for the Texas Health and Human Services Commission.

Illinois expects about 19,000 files shortly from HHS. Illinois state spokesman Mike Claffey says he doesn't know how many may have problems, but Chicago broker Jordan Wishner says seven of them will be from his office and definitely will be wrong.

He has three clients of his own and an agent in his office has another four who are clearly above 138% of the federal poverty limit ($32,499 for a family of four), yet are being told they are eligible for Medicaid, which blocks their efforts to buy subsidized insurance.

""What am I supposed to do with the clients that are being told they qualify for Medicaid when they actually do not?"" asks Wishner, who owns The Health Insurance Shoppe, a retail insurance store. ""Send in an appeal with 16 days left? Seriously?""

With this much uncertainty, ""it's frustrating that there is no place for a broker to get help with errant cases and try to avert problems,"" says Waltman.

State exchanges and insurance companies have dedicated customer service support for insurance agents and brokers who try to correct problems ""before they escalate,"" says Waltman. On the federal exchange, brokers call the same help line as consumers.

""We do not want this woman giving birth and not having coverage,"" says Waltman, referring to Hawkins. ""This is absolutely what the law was trying to prevent from ever happening again.""

Ted Cruz (R-TX) in his filibuster-like Senate floor speech Tuesday evening, Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) challenged the assertion that Senate Republicans must vote for cloture to support the House-passed continuing resolution (CR) that defunds Obamacare, offering two alternative methods for passage which preserve that element of the legislation.

“Now, it’s interesting that what we’re discussing here today, much of what we’ve been discussing today has been on the upcoming cloture vote,” Lee said. “There have been those who have argued that if you want to support the continuing resolution passed by the House of Representatives–remember, this is the continuing resolution that will keep our federal government funded while defunding Obamacare–if you want to support that, that you must vote yes on the cloture vote on the bill.”

Lee then questioned the logic of that argument, which has been presented by GOP Senate leadership.

“It’s anticipated that Senator Harry Reid… and 53 democratic allies, as I understand, will all be voting for cloture on that bill,” he said. “That begs the question… does that mean that Harry Reid and the 53 Democrats likely to follow him are supporting the House-passed Continuing Resolution, the one that keeps government funded while defunding Obamacare? I find that a little strange. I find it a little counterintuitive.”

Lee argued the logic is not sound.

“That’s a problem, indeed, because that… [allows] neither an open amendment process nor an up-or-down vote on the House-passed resolution in as-is condition–in either of those circumstances, we would be fine,” Lee said. “But we’re not getting that. We’re getting stuck with something else. He wants to gut the House-passed continuing resolution of the defunding language without an open amendment process and without the opportunity for an up-or-down vote.”

“So in that circumstance, I don’t understand why it would be the case that Republicans would feel that voting ‘yes’ would be supporting the House of Representatives and voting ‘no’ would be voting against the House of Representatives.”

Then Lee told Cruz that it seems to him that such a move “would be quite the opposite of that.”

“It seems to me, Senator Cruz, that if–if one, in fact, wanted to stand behind the House of Representatives and stand behind their willingness to defend the American people and protect them from this harmful law… [one] would necessarily need to vote ‘no’ if, in fact, Senator Reid does what we expect him to do later this week.”"

USA TODAY

Similar cutbacks in medical services are occurring across military medicine

Officials worry they may spend more money to save money

Experienced personnel are quitting to work someplace else

Patients at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and other premier military hospitals are being sent to private doctors and having surgery and other treatment delayed because of furloughs to medical personnel, according to interviews and internal documents.

""Please show (patients) the utmost understanding and care while we are asking them to accept longer wait times and in some cases, curtailed or limited services,"" Rear Adm. Alton Stocks, hospital commander, told staff in a July 12 message.

A ""colleagues"" memo issued in recent days says inpatient beds are in ""critically short supply"" because of furloughs of civilian staff triggered by federal spending cuts known as sequestration.

The memo encourages ""dispositions/discharges as soon as possible."" Hospital spokesperson Sandy Dean explained this direction, saying, ""We are are encouraging health care providers to be more efficient when handling their paperwork instead of writing discharge orders later in the day ... no patient has been or will be discharged before it is medically appropriate.""

With cases of post-traumatic stress disorder and other mental health problems at an all-time high, Dean says civilian caregivers in the hospital's in-patient mental health section are furloughed, reducing beds there from 28 to 22.

Most serious combat wounded and other medical cases are given priority as routine treatments are delayed, officials said.

Military families complain on the National Military Family Association website of waiting longer for medical appointments, immunizations for infants and getting someone to answer the phone at small medical clinics.

Similar cutbacks occurring across military medicine are ""definitely impacting our ability to deliver health care,"" said Maj. Gen. Richard Thomas, commander of 11 Army hospitals in the western United States. Just in the first month of furloughs, 10,000 routine patient appointments in the western Army medical region been delayed because of staffing shortages, Thomas says.

The Pentagon's top medical official, Jonathan Woodson, assistant secretary of Defense for health affairs, called the cuts illogical and a significant threat.

""We simply cannot continue to sustain the burdens placed on the military medical system if sequester remains the law of the land,"" Woodson says. ""The men and women who have fought tirelessly on the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan ... deserve much, much more than this.""

Thomas said that by sending patients to a network of private doctors who contract with the government for services, the Pentagon will spend more money in order to compensate for the automatic spending cuts.

""As we curtail ... we will inevitably refer more care out to the network,"" he says. ""We'll end up spending more money in the long run.""

The automatic cuts, which many in Congress have vowed to keep in place through 2014, led the Pentagon to furlough more than 640,000 civilian workers for 11 days between July 8 and the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30.

For the Army, which has the largest medical system within the military, all but 6,600 of its 44,000 civilian medical workers are being furloughed.

""The impact on morale is huge,"" says Thomas, adding that some caregivers have quit, lured to the Department of Veterans Affairs for jobs. ""VA is parked right outside our installations and they're poaching our players.""

For Erika Townes, a nurse at the Malcolm Grow Medical Center, an out-patient clinic at Andrews Air Force Base near Washington, D.C., furloughs mean canceling family vacation, cutting groceries and losing $200 per paycheck every two weeks.

""It frustrates me because I make less than $50,000 a year and, not to toot my own horn, but I'm a damn good nurse. ... I put a lot of passion into what I do. So you're going to punish me because you can't fix your own budget?"" says the veteran nurse, a mother of four whose husband is disabled.

At Walter Reed, the primary care facility for troops wounded in Afghanistan, the number of operating rooms has been cut from 23 to 20 Monday through Thursday and to 10 on Friday, when most civilians take their weekly furlough day, according to a memo July 15 from Navy Capt. Philip Perdue, deputy chief of surgery.

""Sorry to be the bearer of bad news; this is being forced on all of us,"" he writes.

The sprawling Walter Reed campus in Bethesda outside Washington is a joint military operation that in 2011 combined the National Naval Medical Center and the Walter Reed Army Medical Center.

With the spending cuts, 10%-20% of beds are now left vacant in surgery, in-patient mental health, maternal child services and critical care. Surgeons are urged to finish operations by 3 p.m. each day, according to an internal memorandum.

An even higher number of 53% favor a partial government shutdown until “Democrats and Republicans can agree on what [general] spending to cut.” Only 37% oppose.

For obvious reasons, the media refuse to make clear that it is not the GOP proposing any kind of government shutdown, partial or otherwise. The GOP’s plan is to kill the ObamaCare debacle with a bill that funds everything but the president’s job-killing health care plan. It is up to the president and Democrat-led Senate, then, to decide if this wildly unpopular drag on our economy is worth shutting down the government.

Both the media and the president are eager for this showdown; both relish the idea of replaying the 1990s when the media and the Clinton White House worked together to bludgeon then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich over a similar gambit.

This poll, though, shows that this tactic might not work as well this time. Just for starters, people are much more concerned about the deficit today than they were in the mid-nineties; and there was no boondoggle like ObamaCare hanging out there as a prize in a shutdown showdown.

Make no mistake, the media will ignore this poll. The results do not fit the media’s pro-ObamaCare Narrative, and only interferes with the reality they are attempting to manufacture that says a shutdown can only mean disaster for the GOP.

But to those interested in reality, this poll should be food for thought.

http://news.yahoo.com/unity-democrats-push-back-obama-175506793--politics.html,,[],"After unity, some Democrats push back on Obama","WASHINGTON (AP) — Just two weeks after President Barack Obama saw his Democratic Party put up an unyielding front against Republicans, his coalition is showing signs of stress.

From health care to spying to pending budget deals, many congressional Democrats are challenging the administration and pushing for measures that the White House has not embraced.

Some Democrats are seeking to extend the enrollment period for new health care exchanges. Others want to place restraints on National Security Administration surveillance capabilities. Still others are standing tough against any budget deal that uses long-term reductions in major benefit programs to offset immediate cuts in defense.

Though focused on disparate issues, the Democrats' anxieties are connected by timing and stand out all the more when contrasted with the remarkable unity the party displayed during the recent showdown over the partial government shutdown and the confrontation over raising the nation's borrowing limit.

""That moment was always going to be fleeting,"" said Matt Bennett, who worked in the Clinton White House and who regularly consults with Obama aides. ""The White House, every White House, understands that these folks, driven either by principle or the demands of the politics of their state, have to put daylight between themselves and the president on occasion.""

Obama and the Democrats emerged from the debt and shutdown clash with what they wanted: a reopened government, a higher debt ceiling and a Republican Party reeling in the depths of public opinion polls.

But within days, attention turned to the problem-riddled launch of the 3-year-old health care law's enrollment stage and revelations that the U.S. had been secretly monitoring the communications of as many as 35 allied leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel. And with new budget talks underway, Democratic Party liberals reiterated demands that Obama not agree to changes that reduce Social Security or Medicare benefits even in the improbable event Republicans agree to increase budget revenues.

Story continues

The fraying on the Democratic Party edges is hardly unraveling Obama's support and it pales when compared to the upheaval within the Republican Party as it distances itself from the tactics of tea party conservatives. But the pushback from Democrats comes as Obama is trying to draw renewed attention to his agenda, including passage of an immigration overhaul, his jobs initiatives and the benefits of his health care law.

The computer troubles that befell the start of health insurance sign-ups have caused the greatest anxiety. Republicans pounced on the difficulties as evidence of deeper flaws in the law. But Democrats, even as they defended the policy, also demanded answers in the face of questions from their constituents.

""The fact is that the administration really failed these Americans,"" Rep. Allyson Schwartz, D-Pa., told Medicare chief Marilyn Tavenner at a hearing this week. ""So going forward, there can be just no more excuses.""

In the Senate, 10 Democrats signed on to a letter seeking an unspecified extension of the enrollment period, which ends March 31. ""As you continue to fix problems with the website and the enrollment process, it is critical that the administration be open to modifications that provide greater flexibility for the American people seeking to access health insurance,"" Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., wrote.

Another Democratic senator, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, has called for a one-year delay in the requirement that virtually all Americans have health insurance or pay a fine.

On Thursday, White House chief of staff Denis McDonough, Tavenner and the White House's designated troubleshooter for the health care website, Jeffrey Zients, met privately with Senate Democrats.

Officials said some of the lawmakers spoke critically of the website's widely publicized problems and sought reassurances they would soon be fixed.

In response, Zients said there already have been some improvements and individuals are now able to sign up in larger numbers than was the case a month ago. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity, saying they were not authorized to discuss events at a private meeting.

And in an interview on CNN, Vice President Joe Biden apologized for the problems. ""There's no excuse,"" he said, ""We just have to fix it.""

Democrats who have talked to White House officials in recent days describe them as rattled by the health care blunders. But they say they are confident that the troubled website used for enrollment will be corrected and fully operational by the end of November.

The spying revelations also have created some tensions between the administration and Democrats. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and until now a staunch supporter of the NSA's surveillance, called for a ""total review of all intelligence programs"" following the Merkel reports.

She said that when it came to the NSA collecting intelligence on the leaders of allies such as France, Spain, Mexico and Germany, ""Let me state unequivocally: I am totally opposed.""

In the House, Rep. Jan Schakowsky of Illinois, a Democratic member of the House intelligence committee, complained that the intelligence committees had been kept out of the loop about the collection of data on foreign leaders.

""Why did we not know that heads of state were being eavesdropped on, spied on?"" she asked Obama administration intelligence officials on Tuesday. ""We are the Intelligence Committee. And we did not -- we didn't know that. And now all of us, all of us, are dealing with a problem in our international relations. There will be changes.""

With Congress renewing budget talks Wednesday, liberals have been outspoken in their insistence that Democrats vigorously resist efforts to reduce long-term deficits with savings in Social Security or Medicare. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an independent who usually votes with Democrats, has been the most outspoken, saying he fears a budget deal will contain a proposal in Obama's budget to reduce cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security and other benefit programs.

Obama, however, has proposed that remedy only if Republicans agree to raise tax revenue, a bargain that GOP lawmakers involved in the discussions made clear they would reject. Moreover, leaders from both parties as well as White House officials have signaled that in budget talks, they are looking for a small budget deal, not the type of ""grand bargain"" that would embrace such a revenue-for-benefit-cuts deal.

Still, many liberals warn that such cuts aren't palatable even if coupled with additional revenues.

""The idea, the notion that we're going to solve this problem or it's going to be OK if we were able to raise revenue and cut this thing back at the same time, it just isn't going to fly outside of Washington,"" said Jim Dean, chairman of the liberal advocacy group Democracy for America.

Baucus warns of 'train wreck' for Obama health law,"A senior Democratic senator who helped write President Obama's health care law stunned administration officials Wednesday, saying openly he thinks it's headed for a ""train wreck.""

""I just see a huge train wreck coming down,"" Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus, D-Mont., told Obama's health care chief during a routine budget hearing that suddenly turned tense.

Baucus is the first top Democrat to publicly voice fears about the rollout of the new health care law, designed to bring coverage to some 30 million uninsured Americans through a mix of government programs and tax credits for private insurance that start next year.

The six-term Democrat is also expected to face a tough re-election in 2014. Baucus is still trying to recover from approval ratings that nosedived amid displeasure with the health care law in his home state.

Normally low-key and supportive, Baucus challenged Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius at Wednesday's hearing.

He said he's ""very concerned"" that new health insurance marketplaces for consumers and small businesses will not open on time in every state, and that if they do, they might just flop because residents don't have the information they need to make choices.

""The administration's public information campaign on the benefits of the Affordable Care Act deserves a failing grade,"" he told Sebelius. ""You need to fix this.""

Responding to Baucus, Sebelius pointedly noted that Republicans in Congress last year blocked funding for carrying out the health care law, and she had to resort to raiding other departmental funds that were legally available to her.

The administration is asking for $1.5 billion in next year's budget, and Republicans don't seem willing to grant that either.

""I don't know what he's looking at,"" Sebelius told reporters following her out of the room after Baucus adjourned the hearing. ""But we are on track to fully implement marketplaces in Jan. 2014, and to be open for open enrollment.""

That open-enrollment launch is only months away, Oct. 1. It's when millions of middle-class consumers who don't get coverage through their jobs will be able to start shopping for a private plan in the new marketplaces, or exchanges. They'll also be able to find out if they qualify for tax credits that will lower their premiums. At the same time, low-income people will be steered to government programs, mainly an expanded version of Medicaid.

But half the states, most of them Republican-led, have refused to cooperate in setting up the infrastructure of Obama's law. Others, like Montana, are politically divided. The overhaul law provided that the federal government would step in and run the new markets if a state failed to do so. Envisioned as a fallback, federal control now looks like it will be the norm in about half the country, straining the resources of the department Sebelius leads."

Coined by the health insurance industry, the term “young invincibles” has come to describe 18-to-34-year-olds who go without coverage because they expect to remain healthy. But young invincibles are crucial to making the Affordable Care Act work: The White House is counting on them to buy coverage under the new law, helping to spread the risk and hold down premiums for everybody. Let’s debunk a few myths about who these uninsured young people are and what they want from the health-care system.

1. Young adults are uninformed about the health-care law.

Young adults tend to be about as aware of the health-care law as the rest of the population. A Kaiser Family Foundation poll in August found that 33 percent of adults had heard nothing about their state health insurance exchanges. That figure was 43 percent among 18-to-25-year-olds and 41 percent among 26-to-35-year-olds. Separate polling from the Pew Research Center found that young adults were more aware than any other demographic that the health-care law offers subsidies for low-income Americans to purchase insurance. However, they were less aware of the requirement to buy coverage.

Young Americans are especially aware of the provisions that affect their own coverage options, most prominently the option to stay on their parents’ insurance plans until age 26. A Commonwealth Fund poll in March found that 62 percent of young adults knew of that program.

2. They don’t want health insurance.

Young adults do have the highest uninsured rate of any demographic, with about 27 percent of people between 19 and 34 lacking insurance coverage, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Health-care experts say this doesn’t necessarily mean that they don’t want insurance, but rather that they are less likely to be offered coverage through their employers. That’s because more young people work part-time or hourly-wage jobs that do not offer health benefits. When offered coverage by their employers, about 80 percent of young adults sign up — about the same rate as older workers.

Millions of young adults have also gained coverage under the health law’s provision that allows them to stay on their parents’ health insurance until they’re 26. The Department of Health and Human Services estimates that, since this option became available in 2010, more than 3 million young adults have taken advantage of their parents’ insurance plans.

When the Kaiser Family Foundation surveyed young adults about health insurance coverage in June, it found that about three in four said it is “very important” to them to have health insurance.

3. They don’t need health insurance.

While young adults tend to have lower health-care costs, without coverage they can incur substantial bills. One Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study found that 17 percent of women ages 18 to 29, and 13 percent of men, have a chronic condition such as cancer or diabetes. Federal data show that young adults have higher rates of car accidents, which could lead to pricey medical bills. The high cost of maternity care can be another concern for young adults, with the average charges ranging upward of $32,000, according to a study published this year by Truven Health Analytics.

Young adults without insurance report difficulties accessing care and paying their medical bills. A 2011 study from the Commonwealth Fund found that more than half of uninsured young adults reported having a medical problem but not seeking treatment. Among insured young adults, that number was 19 percent. That same survey found that 51 percent of uninsured young adults had difficulty paying medical bills, with 26 percent having been contacted by a collection agency.

4. Young people will face steep premiums in the insurance exchanges.

The health-care law makes radical changes to the market for buying health coverage as an individual. For the first time, it requires insurers to accept all customers regardless of any preexisting health conditions. It also limits the amount that insurers can charge the oldest adults — premiums for elderly customers can’t exceed three times the amount charged to the youngest subscribers.

To make the math work — and to cover the medical bills of older, sicker enrollees — insurers have often had to raise rates for young adults. They have also had to cancel some of the plans they offer younger subscribers, which tend to have lower premiums but less-robust benefit packages. That means that, in the exchanges, young shoppers might see much higher sticker prices and experience what the news media has called “rate shock.”

However, many young adults won’t have to pay the full price. Instead, most will qualify either for Medicaid — the public health program that serves low-income Americans — or for tax subsidies to help buy coverage. The nonprofit Families USA, which supports the health-care law, estimates that about 9.3 million people between 18 and 34 will qualify for a subsidy to purchase health insurance. Between these subsidies and Medicaid, the government estimates that about four in 10 young Americans will pay a monthly premium of less than $100 for a plan under the federal law.

Emily Wright, a 28-year-old student in Tennessee who had previously been without health insurance because of a preexisting condition, found a top-tier plan that cost $244 per month. Because she qualifies for a federal subsidy of $119, she is paying only $125 each month toward that premium. Since Tennessee isn’t expanding Medicaid, she worried that she might not receive financial help: “I was nervous about what I was going to be paying, but it was actually a great deal.”

5. Young people aren’t signing up for Obamacare yet.

While they haven’t made up the majority of the health-care law’s participants so far, young adults do account for some enrollment. In states that have released demographic information, such as Washington and California, young adults were about 20 percent of the first month’s enrollment. In California, the state exchange had 6,924 people between ages 18 and 34 sign up for coverage, accounting for almost 24 percent of all enrollments in October.

Officials at state insurance exchanges say they expected older and sicker consumers to sign up first. They think younger people will sign up later in the open-enrollment period, which runs through March. “Those are pretty solid enrollment numbers for a younger demographic,” said Michael Marchand, a spokesman for Washington state’s Healthplanfinder. “Ideally we’d like to see the number go up in coming months.” White House officials have said they need about 40 percent of the consumers who buy plans on the exchanges to be younger than 35.

Five myths about the Affordable Care Act

Why are we still fighting over Obamacare? Because America was designed for stalemate.

Why Obamacare isn’t settled

Friend us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/11/08/CNN-Blames-Christians-for-Obamacare-Problems,2013-11-08 00:00:00,['Joel B. Pollak'],CNN Blames Christians for Obamacare Problems,"CNN has blamed Christians for the problem of Americans without health insurance, calling it “The Obamacare ‘scandal’ you haven’t heard about.” In an article on CNN.com’s Belief Blog, CNN writer John Blake says that, while famous pastors “preach in states where crosses and church steeples dot the skyline,” they do nothing about “the poor who can’t get the health insurance they would receive if they lived elsewhere.”

That refers, in turn, to the decision of twenty-five states not to participate in Obamacare’s expanded Medicaid funding. The states were allowed to opt out following last year’s controversial Supreme Court decision on Obamacare, which upheld the law as a whole but struck down the mandatory state participation in Medicaid expansion, citing the protection provided to state powers under the Tenth Amendment.

Some Republican states took the funding anyway, which provides health insurance subsidies for households with incomes up to 138% of the poverty level. Though the federal government will initially cover almost all of the cost, many Republican governors are wary of potential future costs, and are also worried about the effect on the federal budget itself. Many are also opposed to participating in the Obamacare program on principle.

CNN seems to think that the choice to opt out of Obamacare is somehow the responsibility of well-known pastors such as Joel Osteen and T.D. Jakes, who declined to comment for Blake’s article. One minister, Rev. Phil Wages, said he would not preach that states should accept Medicaid funding because he does not believe that care for the poor is the primary responsibility of the government, according to Christian teachings.

Beyond that, most churches are non-profit organizations whose tax-exempt status might be threatened if they became involved in political causes. Blake recognizes that, but strongly suggests that churches have a duty regardless. (Curiously, he does not suggest that churches should preach against Obamacare because of the millions of families that are losing their health insurance plans, contrary to the president’s promises.)

Blake covers different perspectives on the question of speaking out. But the premise of CNN’s article is that churches are to blame for Obamacare’s failures–not the federal government, not the Democrats who passed it, and not President Barack Obama himself. The thinly-veiled implication–a repeated theme in leftist critiques–is that Christians are hypocrites who care about personal salvation, but not about good works."
http://news.yahoo.com/insurers-warn-overhaul-induced-sticker-shock-152538504--finance.html,,[],Insurers warn of overhaul-induced sticker shock,"Some Americans could see their insurance bills double next year as the health care overhaul law expands coverage to millions of people.

The nation's big health insurers say they expect premiums — or the cost for insurance coverage — to rise from 20 to 100 percent for millions of people due to changes that will occur when key provisions of the Affordable Care Act roll out in January 2014.

Mark Bertolini, CEO of Aetna Inc., one of the nation's largest insurers, calls the price hikes ""premium rate shock.""

""We've done all the math, we've shared it with all the regulators, we've shared it with all the people in Washington that need to see it, and I think it's a big concern,"" Bertolini said during the company's annual meeting with investors in December.

To be sure, there will be no across-the-board rate hikes for everyone, and there's no reliable national data on how many people could see increases. But the biggest price hikes are expected to hit a group that represents a relatively small slice of the insured population. That includes some of the roughly 14 million people who buy their own insurance as opposed to being covered under employer-sponsored plans, and to a lesser extent, some employees of smaller companies.

The price increases are a downside of President Barack Obama's health care law, which is expected to expand coverage to nearly 30 million uninsured people. The massive law calls for a number of changes that could cause premiums for people who don't have coverage through a big employer to rise next year — at a time when health care costs already are expected to grow by 5 percent or more:

— Changes to how insurers set premiums according to age and gender could cause some premiums to rise as much as 50 percent, according to America's Health Insurance Plans, or AHIP, an industry trade group that's funded by insurers.

— A new tax on premiums could raise prices as much as 2.3 percent in 2014 and more in subsequent years, according to a study commissioned by AHIP. Policyholders with plans that end in 2014 probably have already seen an impact from this.

Story continues

— Requirements that insurance plans in many cases cover more health care or pay a greater share of a patient's bill than they do now also could add to premiums, depending on the extent of a person's current coverage, according AHIP.

The Obama administration says the law balances added costs in several ways, including tax credits that will bring down what many consumers will pay for insurance.

""The health care law will bring down costs and save money for young people and families,"" said Erin Shields Britt, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services. ""It's misleading to look at one provision of the law alone. Taken together, the law will reduce costs.""

WHERE 'RATE SHOCK' MAY STRIKE

The impact of some cost hikes will be wide ranging. The new premium tax, for instance, will affect individual insurance, some employer-sponsored coverage and Medicare Advantage policies, which are privately-run versions of the government's Medicare program for the elderly and disabled.

Other price hikes will vary due to factors like a person's current coverage and age. Young people who currently have low-cost coverage may see some of the biggest hikes.

In many states, insurers charge a 60-year-old customer $5 in premiums for every $1 they collect from a 24-year-old. The logic behind that is that older people use health care more and generate more expensive claims than younger customers, so insurers need to collect more to help pay their bills.

But the overhaul will narrow that ratio to 3-to-1. That alone could cause the premium for a 24-year-old who pays $1,200 annually to jump to $1,800, according to AHIP. Meanwhile, the 60-year-old who currently pays $6,000 will see a 10 percent drop in price.

Gender also can be a factor in whether premiums go up or down. The law will prohibit insurers from setting different rates based on gender — something they currently do because women generally use more health care. That means premiums for some men could rise, while they fall for women.

Prices also may change depending on a person's current coverage. Many policies on the individual market (coverage not sold through employers) exclude maternity coverage, but that will be considered an essential health benefit under the overhaul. That could mean higher prices for some.

Vikki Swanson, 49, of Newport Beach, Calif., resents that the added benefit may lead to higher costs for her. ""I had a hysterectomy, I have no need for maternity coverage, but I have to now pay for it,"" she said.

As a self-employed accountant and financial analyst, Swanson has paid for her insurance coverage on the individual market for about 13 years. She watched her monthly premium climb from around $136 in 2001 to more than $600 before she could find cheaper coverage. She's frustrated that the overhaul may add to her bill.

""I have to pay not only my own premium but I have to subsidize everybody else,"" she said.

CUSHIONING THE BLOW

While insurers forecast instant premiums hikes starting next January, the overhaul also is expected to tame health care costs for many.

Starting next year, the law will require insurers to cover everyone who applies. That means health care costs could fall dramatically for people who have been unable to find coverage due to a chronic condition like diabetes or high blood pressure.

There also will be tax credits, or subsidies, given to people with incomes that fall within 400 percent of the federal poverty level. For 2013, 400 percent of the poverty level for all states except Alaska and Hawaii would be $94,200. These credits won't lower premiums, but they can ease the insurance bill depending on a person's income.

The credits should help the 20-something customers that insurers warn will see big premium hikes, said Linda Blumberg, an economist with the Health Policy Center of the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan policy research organization. She noted that people in that age range are more likely to be either working for an employer that doesn't offer coverage or earning low wages that would entitle them to a sizeable credit.

""While these folks are potentially facing some premium increases due to all these reforms, they also are the ones most likely to get the financial help from the exchanges,"" she said.

There are other changes that will benefit young and poor people. Some may qualify for coverage under the state-federal Medicaid program for the poor and disabled, which will expand in many states next year.

Additionally, people under age 30 who face big premium hikes will be able to buy plans that charge low premiums and just provide coverage for big or catastrophic costs. Those plans also will be available to people required to pay more than 8 percent of their income for coverage.

Plus, people who are age 26 and under are eligible to receive coverage under a parent's plan, thanks to another overhaul provision that already started.

In addition to those changes, insurers will have to compete for business on the exchanges, which could restrain price hikes, said Larry Levitt, a private health insurance expert with the Kaiser Family Foundation, which analyzes health policy issues. He noted, for instance, that some are already creating narrow networks of low-cost providers to help keep costs in check.

""Plans are very focused on trying to get these premiums down,"" he said.

But Robert Laszewski, an industry consultant and former insurance executive, said that theory assumes there is no competition in the marketplace now. He noted that a small company may get quotes from as many as 10 insurers competing for business when it tries to find coverage through a broker.

""I haven't had one person in the industry remark to me, 'Gosh, I wonder what the other guy's charging,'"" he said. ""They're worried that all this stuff is so expensive, they're not going to get the pricing right."""

After seven months of steady decline, public approval of Obama’s job performance has ticked upward, according to a new Pew Research Center survey. The poll finds 45% of Americans approve of Obama’s work and 49% disapprove.

That’s the highest approval and closest margin since mid-summer, when the president’s ratings first turned negative. Obama’s low point came last month as the administration struggled to fix the HealthCare.gov website and placate Americans who had discovered, contrary to his promise, that their insurance policies were being canceled.

The problems of the last year – including the stalemate or defeat of major legislation on gun control and immigration, the standoff over the budget and the bungled rollout of the Affordable Care Act – have all taken a toll on how the public sees Obama. The percentage of those who say he is “not able to get things done” has risen steadily from a little more than one-third in the spring to just over half in the latest survey, which was conducted Tuesday through Sunday for USA Today.

But several factors continue to buoy the president, most notably the deep unpopularity of his opponents.

Only 21% of those surveyed said they approve of the job Republican leaders in Congress are doing, with 72% disapproving. Those numbers are essentially unchanged from the low point the GOP hit during the government shutdown in October.

Feelings about the Republican Party as a whole are also negative, with 35% having a favorable view and 59% an unfavorable one.

By contrast, the public divides almost evenly on the Democratic Party, 47% to 48%. Their view of congressional Democratic leaders is better than their view of the GOP, but still worse than their feelings about the president – 34% approve and 58% disapprove.

Americans divide sharply when asked if they have confidence in Obama on healthcare policy, with 50% saying they have a “great deal” or “some” confidence and 48% saying they have “little” or none. But their view of the GOP on that issue is much more one-sided, with only 32% expressing even “some” confidence and 66% having little or none.

Obama also can continue to draw on positive feelings the public has about him. His ratings on several key attributes, although lower than they have been during much of his presidency, remain positive. For example, just over half of Americans view Obama as “trustworthy,” down from roughly 6 in 10 during most of his presidency. That’s the lowest rating of Obama’s presidency, but still positive.

Similarly, 58% say Obama “cares about people like me” – a number that is down just slightly from the level he has seen during most of his tenure.

More than 3 out of 4 say he “stands up for what he believes in.”

In addition to doubting his ability to get things done, however, the public divides evenly on Obama’s leadership skills. Half of Americans see him as a strong leader, compared with 48% who do not.

As has consistently been true since the healthcare law passed, a majority of Americans disapprove of it, with just over half in the current survey disapproving of Obamacare. But those numbers are no worse than they were in September, before the law’s problem-plagued introduction.

And the percentage who say that elected officials who oppose the law should do what they can to make it fail, rather than try to fix it, has gone down. Just 1 in 5 Americans takes that view. Among self-identified Republicans, however, 40% say elected officials should try to make the law fail. And among Republicans who identify with the tea party, 60% want lawmakers to do what they can to make the law fail.

Among self-identified Democrats and independents, majorities either approve of the law or want lawmakers to find ways to make it work as well as possible.

Asked to assess several reasons that might have played a role in the healthcare law’s problems, a majority of Americans said each one had played a major role: poor management by the administration, flaws in the law, the complexity of the health insurance system and opposition from politicians who tried to undermine it.

Democrats and Republicans both cited the complexity of the health insurance system as a reason for the law’s problems. But a predictable partisan divide surfaced on the three other reasons, with nearly three-quarters of self-identified Democrats citing sabotage by opposition lawmakers as a major reason, while 8 in 10 Republicans cited mismanagement and flaws in the law.

The percentage of people who say the law has had a negative effect on the country has gone up, but the percentage who expect it to continue to be a negative in the future has declined. Americans are now closely divided on their expectations of the law’s future impact, with 39% saying they expect it will be mostly positive and 45% expecting mostly negative.

The slow but steady improvement of the economy may have helped Obama. The percentage of Americans rating their personal financial situation as “poor” -- 19% -- is the lowest since before the economic crash in 2008. One in 4 says his or her personal conditions are “fair” or “good.”

Just under half of Americans say they have a “great deal” or a “fair amount” of confidence that Obama will “do the right thing” on the economy. By contrast, just over one-third feel that way about Republican leaders in Congress.

Americans divide almost evenly on the question of whether Obama’s presidency so far has been a success (46%) or a failure (48%). That number closely mirrors the ratings that President George W. Bush received at roughly this point in his presidency. In Bush’s case, the public’s view of his presidency continued to sour throughout his second term. Whether Obama can steady his presidency at its current level or rebound remains to be seen.

The survey was based on telephone interviews with 2,001 American adults. The margin of error for the full sample is plus or minus 2.6 percentage points.

(CNN) - While some Republican senators are calling for Congress to defund Obamacare altogether, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine used the GOP weekly address Saturday to call for an adjustment in the health care law, not a rejection of the law in its entirety.

Collins takes issue with the Affordable Care Act's characterization of a full-time employee as someone who works 30 hours a week.



The president's health care reform, which was passed by Congress in 2010 and upheld by the Supreme Court last year, will require businesses that employ at least 50 full-time workers to provide health insurance or face a penalty, starting in 2015. The provision was originally supposed to kick in next year, but the administration delayed it to give employers more time to prepare for the change.

Collins said the 30-hour mark for ""full-time"" employees will ""only cause some businesses to reluctantly reduce the hours of their workers to fewer than 30 hours per week.""

She gave an example of a school system in Maine that is already ""preparing to track and cap the number of hours that substitute teachers can work to ensure that they don't work more than 29 hours a week.""

""Fewer hours means less money in the teachers' paychecks and more disruption for their students,"" she added.

She introduced a bill, ""Forty Hours is Full Time Act,"" in April that seeks to modify the federal definition of a full-time employee.

""Of course, fixing this one flaw won't solve the countless problems caused by Obamacare. But it would help ensure that millions of American workers do not have their hours, and their paychecks, reduced,"" she said.

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney argued in a press briefing last month that there is no data to indicate businesses are not hiring full-time employees because of the 30-hour mark.

""I would say broadly that if you look at the economic data, the suggestion that the ACA is reducing full-time employment is belied by the facts,"" he said.

Earlier in the day, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka had urged the White House to act within a week to address labor unions’ concerns over ObamaCare.

The sit-down with President Obama and Vice President Joe Biden came amid concerns from Republicans that Obama might be preparing to offer the unions a special deal to assuage their concerns.

But on Friday night, the White House said the Treasury Department had issued a letter ""making clear that it does not see a legal way for individuals in multi-employer group health plans to receive individual market tax credits as well as the favorable tax treatment associated with employer-provided health insurance at the same time.""

However, the White House did not specify exactly what it might do instead, if anything. It said only it would work with various plans to create ""new, high-quality, affordable options"" for everyone.

Later, spokesmen for ranking House member Orrin Hatch of Utah and Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp of Michigan issued a joint statement saying,“There has been far too much special treatment for politically-favored friends of ObamaCare. But when it comes to employers and taxpayers picking up the health care tab for labor unions – it appears that is a price that is simply too high.

""Perhaps even this Administration recognizes that there are limits to them stretching the law to reward their friends.”

The AFL-CIO just passed a resolution blasting ObamaCare as “highly disruptive,” and the administration has been trying to convince the unions to lower the volume on their complaints about the law’s implementation.

The Republican National Committee asked Friday whether the president would “cave” to the unions.

Trumka was coy after emerging from the meeting with Obama and Biden.

He called the meeting a ""problem-solving session,"" but declined to specify exactly what type of fixes were discussed.

“We’re going to try to get it done in the next week,” he said. Asked if that meant a new regulation or Congress-approved law, he said: “A solution.”

The meeting comes days after the AFL-CIO approved a resolution warning the law would drive up the cost of union-sponsored health plans and encourage some employers to drop coverage.

Unions want members to be eligible for the same federal subsidies available to low-income workers in the new health exchanges. The White House has resisted that remedy, saying the law doesn't allow it.

Capitol Hill Republicans, though, are now pursuing legislation that would prevent the administration from offering extra subsidies to union workers.

Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., on Monday introduced the ""Union Bailout Prevention Act,"" which would stop the granting of subsidies to offset premium costs for the multi-employer plans held by many union members. Separately, the House voted on Thursday to stop all subsidies until the administration launches a system to verify recipients are eligible.

Unions argue that workers without additional subsidies will switch to less-expensive, major-insurer plans, creating a withering effect on the so-called Taft-Hartley plans.

Thune and others argue the plans are already government-subsidized and the workers’ contributions are already tax-exempt.

“A deal such as this by the administration for the union would be illegal,” Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch and Michigan Rep. Dave Camp said in a letter Tuesday to the Treasury Department. “Giving union workers exchange subsidies in addition to the income-tax exclusion would be double dipping.”

After the full implementation of Obamacare in 2014, many will remain uninsured because Texas Gov. Rick Perry is not accepting the Medicaid expansion to the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). Perry runs around Texas telling his constituents that it would bankrupt the state . He says this even though 100 percent of the cost of the expansion is paid for by the federal government for the first 3 years. Thereafter the states are responsible for only 10 percent.

Most of the states with the highest uninsured rates are the ones neither setting up exchanges nor accepting the Medicaid expansion to Obamacare. These states have chosen the status quo. Millions of American citizens that could qualify for healthcare insurance through the Medicaid expansion will be left in the cold.

Make no mistake, the governors of these states have choices. They could take the 3 year Medicaid expansion at 100 percent and then opt out in year 4 if they really thought their state would get bankrupted. Their citizens could have at least 3 years’ worth of preventative care, coverage for their children, and much more. They could make the poor and the working poor in their states healthier.

Opposition to Obamacare has characteristics of an addiction. One knows intrinsically when one is doing wrong or doing something detrimental. However, the cravings make one disregard reality and acquiesce to the drug. What is the drug? The drug is hate for all things Obama.

Politics is a blood sport. Politicians and parties attempt to get an advantage at every turn. That is okay as long as it does not materially or deliberately affect the overall well-being of the constituent.

There are many stories detailing the plight of the poor whose only recourse is the emergency room. They get to the emergency rooms only to be stabilized and not really diagnosed in detail. Generally, not until it is too late do they get care at a point when it is most expensive and deadly. One of the most gut-wrenching stories was detailed by a Galveston, Texas, medical student where she literally watched a patient die over a few months. The patient died not because they could not help his cancer, but because he was uninsured.

There are so many real stories out there that every politician opposing Obamacare has access to. They instead promote stories that are generally debunked soon after they are released to the public. They choose to continue promoting stories they know are debunked.

More on these Obamacare lies below the fold."

http://news.yahoo.com/ap-sources-revised-gop-attack-obamacare-071338155--finance.html,,[],AP sources: A revised GOP attack on 'Obamacare',"WASHINGTON (AP) — House GOP leaders Wednesday announced that they will move quickly to raise the government's borrowing cap by attaching a wish list of GOP priorities like blocking ""Obamacare,"" forcing construction of the Keystone XL pipeline and setting the stage for reforming the loophole-cluttered tax code.

They also, as expected, promised tea party lawmakers a chance to first use a routine temporary government funding bill to try to muscle the Democratic-controlled Senate into derailing President Barack Obama's health care law.

""That fight will continue as we negotiate the debt limit with the president and the Senate,"" said House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va.

Obama said again that he won't knuckle under to the GOP's demands

The GOP strategy appears to assume that the Senate will strip out the ""defund 'Obamacare'"" provision and send it back. The House would then face a choice: pass the measure without the health care provision or continue the battle and risk a partial government shutdown when the new budget year begins Oct. 1.

Speaking to CEOs of the Business Roundtable Wednesday, Obama called on the corporate leaders to use their influence to avoid a potentially damaging showdown over the debt ceiling. He reiterated his promise to not negotiate over the need to raise the nation's borrowing limit, which the government is expected to hit as early as next month.

He blamed ""a faction"" of the Republican Party for budget brinkmanship designed to undo his three-year-old health care law.

""You have never seen in the history of the United States the debt ceiling or the threat of not raising the debt ceiling being used to extort a president or a governing party and trying to force issues that have nothing to do with the budget and have nothing to do with the debt,"" Obama said.

""So I'm happy to negotiate with them around the budget, just as I've done in the past,"" he added. ""What I will not do is to create a habit, a pattern, whereby the full faith and credit of the United States ends up being a bargaining chip to set policy. It's irresponsible. The last time we did this, in 2011, we had negative growth at a time when the recovery was just trying to take off.""

Story continues

GOP leaders telegraphed that they would likely concede to the Senate's demand for a stopgap spending bill shorn of the Obamacare provision — but that they would carry on with the fight on legislation to increase the government's borrowing cap.

""There should be no conversation about shutting the government down. That's not the goal here,"" Said House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio.

The latest strategy was presented to rank-and-file Republicans at a closed-door meeting Wednesday. GOP lawmakers and aides said it was received well.

It's a reversal from an earlier strategy, rejected last week by angry conservatives, that would have sent the measure to the Senate as two bills to ensure that the Democratic-controlled chamber would be able to ship the spending measure straight to the White House and more easily avert a government shutdown after the Sept. 30 end of the budget year.

The idea then was to avoid a subsequent vote on a ""clean"" stopgap spending bill in the House after Senate Democrats voted to strip out the provision. Stopgap funding bills are typically routine, with neither House nor Senate looking to use them to pick a fight.

There's some risk, however, that if the Senate were to send the measure back, angry GOP conservatives might be looking for a fight and could withhold their votes rather than surrender to the Senate and its top Democrat, Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada.

The latest move attempts to shift the battle to must-pass legislation to raise the government's $16.7 trillion borrowing cap on their own terms by pairing it with a roster of conservative priorities, including a renewed assault on the health care law and a mandate to build the Keystone XL pipeline.

""In the coming week, we will unveil a plan to extend our nation's ability to borrow while delaying Obamacare,"" Cantor said. ""Those discussions will also focus on a path forward on tax reform and the Keystone pipeline.""

Conservatives want to take a must-pass bill hostage and add the assault on the Affordable Care Act in an attempt to force Obama and congressional Democrats to make concessions. GOP leaders have viewed the effort with skepticism since Democrats would never go along.

The idea of defunding Obama's health care law has been a goal of tea party conservatives such as Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and outside groups like the Heritage Foundation.

Meanwhile, a large group of House conservatives intends to unveil legislation providing an expanded tax break for consumers who purchase their own health coverage and increasing the government funding for high-risk pools, according to lawmakers who said the plan marked the Republicans' first comprehensive alternative to Obama's health care overhaul.

Conservatives are frustrated that Republicans control only one chamber of Congress and have little chance to enact their agenda over the opposition of Obama and Senate Democrats.

Also Wednesday, White House budget office director Sylvia Burwell sent agencies a memo to guide them in their planning in the event of a lapse in funding authority on Oct. 1. As in prior shutdowns, many agency programs would continue.

A shutdown impasse would leave the government without funding authority to pay its workers, including the military, or enter into new contracts until a bill is passed. But essential programs like the military, air traffic control, food inspection, disaster relief and firefighting would continue to function since they're related to protecting life and property. So-called mandatory programs like Social Security and Medicare, which are funded as if on autopilot, would also continue.

National parks would mostly close, most passport applications could not be processed and the space program would largely be put on hold, among other results.

A top House Democrat, Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, said Tuesday he would not support the stopgap funding bill under any circumstance since it would fund programs at an annualized funding rate of $986 billion, a level consistent with automatic, across-the-board spending cuts known as sequestration that Democrats are trying to reverse.

But if the Democratic Senate goes along with that funding level, as insiders have signaled, and if Obama endorses the straightforward funding measure, House Democrats likely could be counted upon to provide the votes. The question is whether GOP leaders would want to pass the measure with help from Democrats, which Boehner did on several occasions earlier this year to the consternation of conservatives.

He Joined Fnc In As A Senior White House Correspondent.']","ObamaCare in Trouble? Exchange provision delayed, as lawmakers push to repeal another","Parts of ObamaCare are starting to fray, even before full implementation.

The Obama administration now says a special system of exchanges designed to make it easier for small businesses to provide insurance will be delayed an entire year -- to 2015.

""Lots of small businesses struggle with providing insurance for their workers so this was supposed to facilitate it and make it easier for small business to do this,"" said Jim Capretta of the Ethics and Public Policy Center. ""It was a huge portion of the sale job. When they passed the law in 2010 there were many senators and members of Congress who were saying 'I am doing this because it's going to help small businesses.'""

The exchanges were designed to give workers a range of choices supported by dollars from their employers. But now they will have only one choice until 2015, which could mean they can't shop for insurance that includes their current providers. Capretta said the administration is ""way"" behind schedule.

Since insurance is more expensive for small businesses, many of which have no obligation under the law to provide coverage, analysts now fear many might just stop trying and let workers go on the soon-to-be-launched state exchanges.

More On This... Delays and Denials Threaten Obama Health Law

Sara Teppema of the Society of Actuaries -- which did an exhaustive study of ObamaCare -- said that ""even if it's just a small change of people who are leaving the employment-based insurance and coming into the individual insurance market, their costs and their numbers will overwhelm those who are currently uninsured.""

That means costs would increase.

Meanwhile, 79 senators including several liberal lawmakers recently voted to repeal a new tax on medical devices contained in the health care law following a similar vote in the House.

""The House and the Senate agreeing? This is a harmonic convergence, it doesn't happen,"" said former Democratic Sen. Evan Bayh. ""But on this it's happened because the adverse consequences to our economy and the quality of health care are so apparent.""

The two separate votes have not become law but show widespread opposition to the 2.3 percent sales tax on medical devices. Critics say the law is unfair to the industry since it's a tax on gross sales -- meaning it adds up to a much bigger percentage of a company's profits.

But supporters such as Paul Van de Water of the Center for American Progress oppose any repeal.

""I think that repealing the device tax would be irresponsible. We need the revenue and it's not going to be a job killer,"" he said.

The theory was that ObamaCare would insure 30 million more people and that device makers, like pharmaceutical companies, would get lots of new customers and a steady stream of new revenue to make up for the tax. Van de Water predicted that would still happen.

""These device manufacturers are for the most part going to be getting a large increase in business thanks to health reform, thanks to ObamaCare,"" he said.

But the CEO of one company said that's not true for the 7,000 small companies with 400,000 employees who make a wide range of devices.

Christine Jacobs of Theragenics said: ""We make widgets -- hips, knees, stents, pacemakers, and implants, even, for prostate cancer. Those widgets tend to be used by people that are elderly. As the body parts wear out, we're needed.""

But Jacobs notes that most people whose body parts wear out are already on Medicare, so ObamaCare does not provide a new revenue stream for her company -- only financial pain.

""In the case of a small company, that medical device tax is equal to our R-and-D budget for this year,"" Jacobs said.

Bayh said in his own state of Indiana, one company planned to open up to five facilities over the next five years but had to scrap those plans because of the ""uncertainty created by this tax.""

Jacobs said the huge multinational device makers might be able to handle the burden but not the small companies.

""It's just such a disproportionate burden for little guys,"" she said. ""Because we're all being told that it's the little companies that create the jobs. And that's not message that we're getting.""

The tax will even be applied to sutures used on pets that Theragenics developed for the veterinary market.

She sought FDA approval to demonstrate the quality of her products. But now she said ""it's hard for me not to get frosted on this one"" -- she explained that whoever wrote the regulations said ""if you have FDA approval, you will be taxed.""

President Obama has vowed to veto any repeal of the tax, but Bayh notes that 79 votes in the Senate would be more than enough to override any veto."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/06/24/Schumer-Corker-Hoeven-Bill-Incentivizes-Employers-To-Fire-Americans-and-Hire-Amnestied-Immigrants,2013-06-24 00:00:00,['Dr. Susan Berry'],Senate Bill Incentivizes Employers To Fire Americans and Hire Amnestied Immigrants,"Under the Gang of 8’s backroom immigration deal with Senators Schumer, Corker and Hoeven, formerly illegal immigrants who are amnestied will be eligible to work, but will not be eligible for ObamaCare. Employers who would be required to pay as much as a $3,000 penalty for most employees who receive an ObamaCare healthcare “exchange” subsidy, would not have to pay the penalty if they hire amnestied immigrants.

Consequently, employers would have a significant incentive to hire or retain amnestied immigrants, rather than current citizens, including those who have recently achieved citizenship via the current naturalization process.

The issue is really an “interaction effect” of the immigration proposal and ObamaCare itself.

Beginning in January, businesses with 50 or more full-time employees, that do not currently offer healthcare benefits that are considered “acceptable” by the Obama administration, must pay a penalty if at least one of their workers obtains insurance on a new government-run “exchange.” The penalty can be as much as $3,000 per employee.

Many employers have been preparing to cope with the new regulations by slashing the hours of full-timers to part-time status. Since “full-time,” in the language of ObamaCare, is averaging 30 hours per week, employers will, in general, receive the penalty if they have 50 or more employees who are working an average of 30 hours per week.

If the immigration bill becomes law, many employers could receive incentives of hundreds of thousands of dollars to hire amnestied immigrants over American citizens. In addition, these newly legalized immigrants could work “full-time,” an advantage for companies and businesses as well, while employers could lay off or diminish to “part-time” status, American workers.

Philip Klein of the Washington Examiner explains that he spoke with Alex Conant of Sen. Marco Rubio’s staff in April about the wrinkle, and was told that this was an issue that could be addressed during the legislative process.

“[T]he scenario you raise illustrates both the absurdity of ObamaCare, and why we have insisted on a lengthy process to review this legislation before any votes are taken,” Conant emailed Klein. “We always expected there might be a need for amendments to fix technical problems, and we’ll be interested in seeing what sort of amendments might be offered to improve this part of the legislation without giving ObamaCare to illegals- something Sen. Rubio has always said he will not support.”

However, as Klein said a couple of weeks ago, the issue has not been addressed and, in fact, the Schumer-Corker-Hoeven deal carries out what appears to be a major complication for American workers. Klein said that Conant did not respond to further requests for comment on this issue.

As for Conant’s comment in April about Rubio insisting on a “lengthy process to review this legislation before votes are taken,” that seems to have gone with the wind as well."

In a preview of the message Democrats will carry into the 2014 midterm elections, the president acknowledged that the Affordable Care Act may have flaws that will need to be fixed, but emphasized that it has already brought substantial benefits to Americans with insurance and will soon help the 30 million who are without it.

He asserted that the GOP wanted only to scrap the law, not find a solution for the uninsured. “There’s not even a pretense now that they’re going to replace it with something better,” he said.

But Obama also said he did not believe Republicans would shut down the federal government in a standoff over the heathcare law, even though many have threatened to do just that. The federal budget expires on Sept. 30, and Obama and Congress will have to reach agreement by then to keep the government running.

“I can tell you that the American people would have difficulty understanding why we would weaken our economy, shut down our government, shut down vital services … because Republicans have determined that they don’t want to see these folks get healthcare,” he said. “I have confidence that common sense in the end will prevail.”

Obama also called on House Republicans to pass immigration reform, saying the bipartisan Senate bill would pass if it were brought to the floor. “The problem is internal Republican caucus politics,” he said.

He said Republicans should embrace reform because reports have shown that it would bolster the economy, bringing new buyers to the housing market and new foreign workers for high-tech firms. He also noted that it would secure the border with “unprecedented resources.”

“I think that the speaker [of the House] and others have said they need to do something. And I’d urge, when they get back [to the Capitol], to do something. Put forward a bill that has an opportunity to actually pass,” he said. “It may not be precisely what’s in the Senate bill. My preference would be for them to go ahead and call the Senate bill, but if they’ve got some additional ideas, I think the Senate’s happy to consider them.”

The president’s defense of his top domestic priorities came in an hourlong White House news conference a day before he was scheduled to head to Martha’s Vineyard for a vacation.

Obama also defended his unilateral decision to delay a requirement that large employers provide insurance or pay a fine, a key part of the Affordable Care Act. He characterized it as “a technical change” that he should have been able to work out with Congress.

“In a normal political environment, it would have been easier for me to simply call up the speaker and say, ‘You know what? This is a tweak that doesn’t go to the essence of the law,’” Obama said.

That remark irritated Republicans.

“We were all scratching our heads when he claimed that he couldn’t get Congress to help him delay the mandate, because Republicans in Congress tried to delay the mandates only to have the president issue a veto threat,” said Don Stewart, a spokesman for Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.

Republicans want to overturn Obama’s healthcare law, said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio), “because it is driving up costs, decreasing access and destroying American jobs.”

“We should enact a step-by-step, common-sense approach that starts with lowering costs,” Buck said.

Obama suggested that there would be other problems with the healthcare law besides his decision to delay the employer mandate, but he said that none would be reason to abandon his top domestic achievement.

“There is no doubt that in implementing the Affordable Care Act — a program of this significance — there are going to be some glitches. No doubt about it. There are going to be things where we say, ‘You know what? We should have thought of that earlier, or this would work a little bit better, or this needs an adjustment,’” the president said. He said the same was true for Social Security, Medicare, new cars and Apple iPads.

“Our goal is to actually deliver high-quality, affordable healthcare for people and to reform the system so costs start going down and people start getting a better bang for the buck,” he said. “And I make no apologies for that.”

As Paul Taylor, who follows immigration for Pew Research, puts it: “It’s better politics if the president wins, but it’s still good politics if he loses.”

Rebalance foreign policy.

For years the administration has talked of “rebalancing” our military strategy to address an increasingly assertive China. The Pentagon, liberated from Iraq and drawing down in Afghanistan, has taken some modest steps in this direction, deploying more of the Navy to Asia, devoting more resources to China’s space and cyber threats. But our rivalry with China is not, and should never be, primarily military. We need to compete on the fields of economics and diplomacy. Unfortunately the civilian custodians of our foreign policy have been bogged down in the Middle East, a region that matters a lot, but not as much as it did when we were more dependent on imported oil.

In the Middle East, Obama is now pretty much where he wants to be — jaw-jaw, not war-war, as Churchill liked to say — and that is clearly where the American people prefer him to be. Talks (hopeful) are underway to rid Syria of chemical weapons and (less hopeful) to find a diplomatic end to that country’s civil war. There is fitful progress in the talks aimed at testing whether Iran’s new president has the will and the authority to put a verifiable lid on that country’s nuclear program. Talks are taking place on the eternal conundrum of Israel’s coexistence with the Palestinians. Success at any of those tables would be a blessing to humanity and a great lift for the president.

But while diplomats are patiently tending these negotiations, there is time to pay attention to unfinished Asia business. The biggest item awaiting some Washington juice is the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an immense, stalled, Asian free-trade agreement that would do more to counter burgeoning China than any number of battleships.

Like most free-trade agreements, it has opposition, from critics who fear it would insufficiently protect labor, consumers, the environment and intellectual property. It’s time for the administration to cut some deals, crack some heads and open up those Asian markets.

Forget the Grand Bargain. Go for little bargains.

The idea of a grand fiscal bargain — a megadeal that wins bipartisan support on the whole complex of spending, taxes and entitlements — was all the rage a year ago, but it has passed its sell-by date. Not only has it proven politically unattainable as long as the House is in thrall to a band of least-government ideologues, it has also been overtaken by reality. Even relatively conservative economists concede that the deficit — a very sustainable 4 percent of gross domestic product — is not the problem, at least not in the foreseeable future. There is a distant problem for Social Security and Medicare as my baby-boom generation retires, and it would be nice to address it before young Americans find the cupboard bare. But the immediate and urgent problems are sluggish growth and too few jobs."

Like the previous 39 votes, this action will have no effect whatsoever. But it was a stand-in for what Republicans really want to do: repeal reality, and the laws of arithmetic in particular. The sad truth is that the modern G.O.P. is lost in fantasy, unable to participate in actual governing.

Just to be clear, I’m not talking about policy substance. I may believe that Republicans have their priorities all wrong, but that’s not the issue here. Instead, I’m talking about their apparent inability to accept very basic reality constraints, like the fact that you can’t cut overall spending without cutting spending on particular programs, or the fact that voting to repeal legislation doesn’t change the law when the other party controls the Senate and the White House.

Am I exaggerating? Consider what went down in Congress last week.

First, House leaders had to cancel planned voting on a transportation bill, because not enough representatives were willing to vote for the bill’s steep spending cuts. Now, just a few months ago House Republicans approved an extreme austerity budget, mandating severe overall cuts in federal spending — and each specific bill will have to involve large cuts in order to meet that target. But it turned out that a significant number of representatives, while willing to vote for huge spending cuts as long as there weren’t any specifics, balked at the details. Don’t cut you, don’t cut me, cut that fellow behind the tree.

Then House leaders announced plans to hold a vote on doubling the amount of cuts from the food stamp program — a demand that is likely to sink the already struggling effort to agree with the Senate on a farm bill."

House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) yielded to his right flank by agreeing to attach the healthcare law repeal to a must-pass bill to keep the government funded past Sept. 30. A vote is expected Friday on a bill that would allow the government to stay open for the next few months.

The measure is all but certain to pass the Republican-led House, but faces rejection in the Senate, where the Democratic majority has shown little interest in undoing Obama’s signature domestic achievement.

Without a resolution by Oct. 1, the start of the new federal fiscal year, the government will run out of money to keep federal workers on the job and provide basic services.

Boehner and his leadership team had tried to avoid a prolonged battle over government funding, but the speaker saw no other option after the most conservative House members revolted last week.

“Every member in this room is for defunding Obamacare,” Boehner told his colleagues in a private meeting in the Capitol basement, according to a source in the room. “We’re going to send it over to the Senate, so our conservative allies over there can continue the fight.”

Top Republicans worry the party will be blamed if government services are interrupted, much the way the party suffered during the last shutdowns in the mid-1990s. They were hoping to hold off the fight over repealing the healthcare law until next month, when Obama may be forced to bargain in exchange for the administration’s request to raise the debt limit to borrow money to avoid defaulting on the nation’s bills.

But many rank-and-file Republicans believe stopping the healthcare law is their constituents’ top priority.

“We’re doing what the American people are asking us to do,” said third-term Rep. Marlin Stutzman (R-Ind.). “I think now is the time. You take the best opportunity that you have.”

Rep. Tom Graves (R-Ga.), among those leading the fight, said, “I think over the next 12 days there’s going to be a strong argument from the American people saying this is the path forward.”

Advertisement

Polls show more Americans oppose the law, the Affordable Care Act, than support it, even as the online health insurance marketplaces are set to open Oct. 1. Obama on Wednesday asked the Business Roundtable, an organization of top business leaders, to use its influence to encourage lawmakers to “not promise apocalypse every three months.”

“I think this is the time for us to say once and for all we can’t afford these kinds of plays,” Obama said. “I know the American people are tired of it. I’m tired of it, and I suspect you’re tired of it too.”

Advertisement

A similar message was sent to Capitol Hill from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which warned that it was “not in the best interest of the U.S. business community or the American people to risk even a brief government shutdown.”

The fight to keep the government running is the first in series of choke points this fall that Republicans intend to use to pressure Obama since they have failed repeatedly to stop the healthcare law.

Advertisement

By mid-October, Congress will be asked to raise the debt limit, and Republican leaders are gearing up to demand a one-year delay of the healthcare law as part of any deal with the White House. The funding bill, if approved, would keep the government open through Dec. 15.

How Congress will handle the Sept. 30 deadline for a government funding resolution remains an open question.

Advertisement

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) will probably ask Democrats to strip the healthcare law repeal from the resolution, but Republicans in the Senate will be under enormous pressure to prevent that.

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), a potential presidential contender who has been a vocal opponent of the healthcare law, and other conservative senators are being urged by their House colleagues to mount a round-the-clock filibuster, if needed, to thwart Democrats.

Advertisement

The senator, however, did not appear to promise heroics as he acknowledged Reid probably had enough votes. But Cruz’s spokesman said “all options remain on the table.”

Intensifying the threat of a shutdown, Boehner does not appear to have a backup plan if the Senate sends the funding bill back to the House without the healthcare law repeal.

Advertisement

Many House Republicans appear unprepared for that scenario, which could unfold late next week. Others, such as Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R-Kan.), insisted they would not vote for a bill that did not kill the healthcare law.

“This is the line in the sand,” he said.

Boehner may need to rely on Democrats to help pass the bill, which he has been increasingly reluctant to do because it could threaten his already shaky hold over his Republican majority.

On Monday, President Obama both criticized and defended the Web site. While he conveyed an all-hands-on-deck attitude and his commitment to solving the problems, he did not give sufficient specifics.

But there are five things we can do now to right the ship of Obamacare.

The president should create a new position: an independent chief executive of the federal exchange. On Tuesday, the White House announced that the economic adviser Jeffrey D. Zients will oversee the “tech surge” in the short term. Mr. Zients is a great manager and was a health care industry consultant, but he is also about to take on an important job as director of the National Economic Council. We need someone who can not just begin the repair process, but also run and refine the exchange’s operations for at least the next two years.

This C.E.O. should meet one on one with the president every week to ensure he or she has full authority to carry out the job. The candidate should have management experience, knowledge of how both the government and health insurance industry work, and at least some familiarity with IT systems. Obviously this is a tall order, but there are such people. And the administration needs to hire one immediately, while Mr. Zients works to put out the fires.

Second, the system needs to borrow from other exchanges. While the federal exchange has been a fiasco, many state exchanges have been working well since they launched earlier this month. One of the assignments for the students in my health policy class at the University of Pennsylvania this semester was to window-shop for insurance policies on the California exchange. They found the site easy to use and said there were many choices and the prices were competitive, even before subsidies. These students are the key demographic — young and healthy — that the sites need if they are going to succeed. Mr. Zients and the new C.E.O. should be looking carefully at the California, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Maryland, New York and any other successful state-run exchanges, and seeing which aspects can be adopted into the federal exchange, without reinventing it wholesale.

Next, the administration needs to be candid with the public. Given the disappointing rollout of the Web site, Americans are justifiably suspicious. Starting now, the administration needs to initiate a concerted effort to win back the public’s trust. There should be twice-weekly briefings that feature honest and complete descriptions of both the problems and solutions that the tech team is working on — in all the gory detail. We need to hear from those “best and brightest” experts whom President Obama has enlisted in the tech surge. Transparency is the only way to convince the American people that the situation is under control."

Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said Wednesday in a letter to Speaker John A. Boehner that the debt limit would be reached “no later than” Oct. 17.

While Mr. Obama’s ratings sag, he can take some solace in the standing of the Republican opposition in Congress. Nearly three-quarters of Americans disapprove of Congressional Republicans. More of the public supports Mr. Obama than Republicans to make the right decisions on the deficit, health care and the economy.

“I would blame the Republicans for a shutdown,” said Barbara Nemeth, 70, an independent in Port Richey, Fla. “It’s not their job to stalemate the government. It’s their job to work cooperatively and compromise. That has been traditionally the American democratic way. They are acting like a bunch of overgrown, spoiled brats.”

But there is little doubt that the president is being hurt by questions over his health overhaul. Only one in five Americans say they expect to be positively affected by the law.

The survey also suggests that Republicans could pay a political price going into next year’s midterm elections if there is a government shutdown. Eight in 10 Americans find it unacceptable for either the president or members of Congress to shut down the government to achieve their goals during budget negotiations. And while half the country sees Mr. Obama as working with Republicans, only one in four Americans see Congressional Republicans as working with the president to get things done.

A plurality say they would blame Congressional Republicans if a shutdown occurred.

“It’s bad on both sides,” said Gerald Muller, 86, an independent from Austin, Tex. “President Obama is not checking with experts. He’s a man who has been working alone and he’s isolated himself and now he has no one to turn to, or he won’t turn to them. He has a lot of learning to do, in my opinion. And the Republicans have their own agenda. They are kind of stubborn and don’t seem willing to compromise.”"

Congress must pass legislation to authorize continued government spending before September 30, or the government will shut down. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor had unveiled a plan that would split the ObamaCare funding from the underlying government spending, but conservatives balked at the plan. Any action on spending now has been pushed to next week.

Conservatives, led by Sens. Ted Cruz and Mike Lee, have argued that any measure to extend government spending authority should also include language to defund ObamaCare. On October 1, the health care exchanges authorized by ObamaCare, where individuals can presumably shop for health insurance, are set to open. On January 1, all Americans are mandated to have health insurance. On that date, as well, large subsidies and tax credits to supplement those insurance premiums will begin. Unless the law is uprooted now, it will likely remain.

Cantor’s plan envisioned the House passing a “clean” resolution to continue government spending, one which absorbed the sequester cuts. It also would include a separate resolution that defunded all aspects of ObamaCare. Under Cantor’s plan, the Senate would receive the “clean” resolution until it had voted on funding ObamaCare. The Senate would have to definitively vote on funding ObamaCare before it could vote to keep the government open.

Conservatives rebelled, arguing that the split resolutions offered nothing more than a symbolic vote against ObamaCare and removed all leverage against the unpopular law. Democrats in control of the Senate could vote down the ObamaCare defunding and then quickly authorize legislation to keep the government functioning.

The issue is, however, far more complicated. Funding ObamaCare requires about $13 billion in annual appropriations that is subject to Congressional authorization. More than $70 billion a year, however, is funded by mandatory spending that isn’t subject to Congressional authorization. In other words, Congress could eliminate all spending for ObamaCare, but 70% of the program would march on.

That said, everything in life is done on the margins. Eliminating just a fraction of the overall spending on ObamaCare could upend the whole program. That is the hope of conservatives. And that hope cause GOP Leadership to blink."

“I think the bottom line here is that the ‘winners’ greatly outnumber the ‘losers’ in general and in the individual market in Obamacare, but the media and political math is different from the actual math. A significant minority of ‘losers’ or self-perceived losers and a few high profile bad outcomes (possibly NH) are more than enough to cause real political problems.”

According to Robert J. Blendon, a professor at Harvard’s School of Public Health, the New Hampshire type of problem is more endemic:

“This is the next big political story. The president promised people they could keep their doctor and implicitly their hospital. A number of state exchanges are like New Hampshire in that they are offering what are called narrow network plans. Some of these plans exclude coverage at children’s hospitals as well, which means some parents with sick children will have to change their source of care. This too is not what was promised.”

In the state of Washington, the Seattle Children’s Hospital was initially left off the list of approved care providers by five of the seven insurers operating in Kings County through the state exchange, Healthplanfinder. The hospital was forced to sue state officials in order to gain eligibility.

Obama and his party's elected officials not only have the elections of 2014 and 2016 to worry about, but also the future prospects of the liberal agenda writ large, which had appeared to be slowly gaining momentum before the Obamacare portal snafu.

The degree of political damage inflicted so far is reflected in this RealClearPolitics graph (Figure 1) of voter responses to the question: “If the election for the U.S. House of Representatives were being held today, would you vote for the Republican candidate or for the Democratic candidate in your district?”

The graph shows a collapse in Democratic voting intention. In effect, all the gains Democrats made during the period Republicans shut down the government and demanded an end to Obamacare have been lost since Obamacare was actually launched.

More granular analysis of Democratic losses in recent weeks can be found by comparing two Quinnipiac polls, the first released on Oct. 1, 2013 when Democrats had a nine point, 43-34, advantage on the generic voting question; and the second released on Nov. 13, when the Democratic lead was erased and the parties were tied at 39-39.

The biggest drops were among self-identified independents, who went from slightly favoring Democrats, 32-30, to decisively Republican, 37-26; men, an 11-point shift; voters making less than $50,000, 11 points; and young voters 18-29 who showed the largest shift of all, 24 points. The dropoff among lower income and young voters strikes at the heart of the Obama coalition. Voters 65 and over, who had backed Republicans by large margins in 2010, but who favored Democrats 43-37 in the October poll, were back in the Republican fold, 41-38, by November.

“The redistributive arithmetic of Obamacare’s architecture could never add up,” Steven Hayward, a visiting scholar in conservative thought and policy at the University of Colorado, wrote in Forbes magazine: “The wonder is that Obama’s political team didn’t see this coming and prepare a pre-emptive strategy for dealing with the inevitable exposure of the duplicity at the heart of Obamacare’s logic.”"

Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said Sunday that the budget blueprint he plans to unveil this week will promote repealing President Obama’s signature health-care law.

“Yes, our budget does promote repealing Obamacare and replacing it with a better system,” Ryan, chairman of the House Budget Committee, said on “Fox News Sunday.”

Past House Republican efforts to repeal the president’s health-care law failed, and the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the law last year.

Ryan’s budget proposal, which includes controversial proposals for giving states more authority over Medicaid, is sure to encounter stiff resistance from Democrats in Congress who are committed to protecting Obamacare. That push back is likely to complicate Obama’s efforts this week to advance a dialogue he reopened with Republicans last week on reaching a grand bargain on budget cuts and entitlement reform.

On Thursday, Ryan lunched at the White House with Obama and Rep. Chris Van Hollen (Md.), the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee. Ryan said Sunday that only time will tell how effective the president’s recent outreach to him and other congressional Republicans will be.

“The proof will be in the coming weeks as to whether or not it is a real sincere outreach to find common ground,” Ryan said.

The 2012 Republican vice-presidential candidate made his comments as he pitched a budget proposal that would wipe out the deficit in 10 years rather than in more than 20, as he proposed last year.

He said the more ambitious timetable would “not really” require much deeper cuts than those outlined previously, because of recent events. They include a rise in tax rates for the very wealthy enacted in January, and budget sequestration that took effect this month.

“We don’t have to do huge things to get the balance because of the new baseline,” he told “Fox News Sunday” host Chris Wallace.

Key parts of Ryan’s plan are items he and Mitt Romney campaigned on in the election they lost to Obama in November.

One is turning Medicare from a one-size-fits-all insurance program to one that helps subsidize the purchase of policies “based on who you are — total subsidy for the poor and the sick, less of a subsidy for wealthy seniors.” Another is turning Medicaid, which pays for health care for the very poor, into a block-grant program that would allow states to craft their own programs.

Ryan’s budget calculus includes a $770 billion cut to Medicaid over the next 10 years. Under Obama’s health-care plan, Medicaid would expand rather than contract, bringing in about 20 million more users.

Asked whether his plan was realistic, Ryan averred that parts of it were not.

“Will the president take our premium support program and block-granting Medicaid? My guess is he won’t,” Ryan told Wallace. “We think that’s the best way to make these programs work better. But are there things you can do short of that — that gets you closer to balancing the budget, that delays the debt crisis from hitting this country? Yes, I think there are.”

Ryan said the lunch at the White House was “the first time I’ve ever had a conversation with the president lasting more than, say, two minutes, or televised exchanges. I’ve never really had a conversation with him on these issues before.”

Sounding a conciliatory note, Ryan said: “I think there are things that we can do that don’t offend either party’s philosophy, that doesn’t require someone to surrender their principles.”

Republicans on other Sunday talk shows also expressed hope that Obama’s gestures would lead to substantive negotiations.

“I think he’s genuinely reaching out,” Sen. Tom Coburn ­(R-Okla.) said on NBC News’s “Meet The Press.” “But you know, you’ve got a lot of scabs and sores on people, and it’s going to take awhile for that to heal.”

Sen. Ronald H. Johnson (R-Wis.), one of Obama’s dinner guests, said on ABC News’s “This Week With George Stephanopoulos” that he would “give the president the benefit of the doubt.”

Both Coburn and Johnson were among a group of Republican senators who dined with Obama last week. The president is set to meet with leaders of both parties on Capitol Hill this week as the budget debate heats up.

Steve Beshear have not always been friendly. When Obama paid his first presidential visit in May 2011, his fellow Democrat was somewhere else. Later, Beshear lashed out at the administration’s environmental regulators, telling them to “get off our backs.”

But leading one of the nation’s poorest, sickest states, Beshear has improbably overseen one of the most successful rollouts of Obama’s troubled healthcare overhaul and become, deep in his long public career, a hero to Democrats grasping to find a redeeming figure amid the political wreckage.

He’s an unlikely champion, not least because Kentucky’s two U.S. senators are both implacable opponents of the program.

“I knew if I was going to make a huge difference in the health status of Kentucky, it was going to take some kind of transformational tool to do that, and that’s what the Affordable Care Act is for me,” Beshear, white-haired and greyhound-lean, said as he sat behind a big maple desk in his office. “I think we’ve started something here,” he later added, “that a generation from now you’ll see a very different Kentucky than what you see today.”

For now, Kentuckians may feel understandably whiplashed.

While Beshear, serving his second and final term, has become one of the foremost proponents of Obamacare, the state’s senior senator, Republican leader Mitch McConnell, has been an even more visible foe. Facing a tough 2014 reelection fight, he calls the law “a disaster,” “a huge mistake” and “a monstrosity” that “needs to be pulled out root and branch.” The sentiment is seconded by Kentucky’s junior senator, Republican Rand Paul, who was elected in 2010 in a tea party fever born of seething opposition to the president and his healthcare plan.

Both sides marshal selective facts to argue their cases. About 640,000 Kentuckians, or about 1 in 6, lack healthcare insurance. As of this week, more than 60,000 of them had signed up for coverage through the state’s insurance marketplace, which has operated smoothly from the start.

At the same time, about 280,000 Kentucky residents could lose their existing health insurance under standards set by the new federal law, which would force them to scramble in the next few weeks to find replacement coverage in the state exchange or elsewhere.

The need for care in this pretty but hard-pressed state is unarguable. Kentucky leads the nation in cancer deaths and preventable hospitalizations and suffers some of the highest rates of diabetes, cardiovascular illness and premature death. Extending healthcare to as many as possible could make a difference, the 69-year-old Beshear said, long after he is gone. “To me,” he said, “it was the morally responsible and the right thing to do.”

Born in rural western Kentucky, the son of a Baptist minister, Beshear first won office at age 29. After three terms in the Legislature, he was elected state attorney general at 35. But unlike a young, ambitious Democrat from Arkansas whose early success propelled him to the White House, Beshear’s political career stalled after a series of setbacks, including an unsuccessful 1996 Senate run against McConnell.

After several years practicing law, Beshear staged a political comeback in 2007 when he beat a scandal-stained Republican to become governor. He arrived just in time for the Great Recession, which, along with an intransigent GOP-led state Senate, thwarted most of his larger ambitions. A signature plan to expand legal gambling to boost education funding has stalled. An attempt at overhauling the state tax system appears similarly stymied.

Obamacare presented a chance to do something big, and lasting.

Empowered to act without the Legislature’s approval, Beshear became the only Southern governor to embrace a provision vastly expanding Medicaid eligibility and open a state-run exchange for others seeking insurance. He conceded, with a small smile, that it was easier knowing he would never face voters again. “But,” he went on, “I’m convinced that in the end this is not going to [be] a negative political issue.”

He acted, Beshear said, only after independent analysts predicted the healthcare overhaul would inject more than $15 billion into Kentucky’s economy over the next eight years, create about 17,000 new jobs and produce about $800 million in state revenue. “You cannot afford not to do this,” he said he was told.

Paul, for one, is skeptical. At a sort of impromptu debate at the Kentucky Farm Bureau’s annual breakfast this summer, the senator followed Beshear to the microphone and challenged his optimistic forecast. “It’s going to bring $15 billion to our state. From where?” Paul demanded, his voice rising. “From the Federal Reserve, which is already sitting at minus-$17 trillion. It’s not free. There are consequences to this.”

Embracing Obamacare is not without political risk. Undaunted by the early success in Kentucky, Republicans plan to make the controversial program a major issue in 2014, when the GOP will be vying to take control of the state House for the first time in close to a century.

Beshear, who steps down in a little over two years, insisted he was not concerned about his legacy. But there is something he hopes to leave behind in Frankfort: His son, Andy, is running for attorney general in 2015.

“Obviously, his mom and I are excited about that, and we’re going to fully support him,” Beshear said, grinning. The healthcare issue, the governor suggested, won’t make a difference in the race for the state’s law enforcement chief one way or the other.

He chose one of the cheapest plans “as a show of support” for the millions of Americans his administration is trying to steer towards the new online exchanges.



All presidents and their immediate families get coverage through the military. As Commander-in-Chief, any president has a personal physician and he and his family get full care at the White House Medical Unit and the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Md.

Obama didn’t wait until the last possible minute, a White House official says. Monday’s the last day to enroll on the federal exchange and on most of the state exchanges as well as Washington, D.C.’s, exchange.

“Over the weekend and in advance of today's deadline, the president enrolled in a health care plan made available by the Affordable Care Act on the D.C. marketplace,” the official said.



Obama, who is on vacation in Hawaii, had a staffer do the heavy lifting for him, a White House official says. He had to be enrolled in person, in no small part because his personal information is not readily available in the variety of government databases HealthCare.gov uses to verify identities.

“The act of the president signing up for insurance coverage through the DC exchange is symbolic since the president's health care will continue to be provided by the military,” the official added.

“But he was pleased to participate in a plan as a show of support for these marketplaces which are providing quality, affordable health care options to more than a million people. The president selected a bronze plan.” Bronze plans have the lowest premiums and tend to have higher deductlbles.

Obama doesn’t qualify for a federal subsidy to help pay premiums, both because of his income and because he is already covered.

(CNN) —

A moment of truth approaches for President Barack Obama’s signature health care reforms with Saturday’s self-imposed deadline to get the website to work properly for most users.

Obama and officials in charge of HealthCare.gov say the “vast majority” of people who go to the website to sign up at the end of the month will have a much improved experience than the crashes, error messages and delays users faced when it launched October 1.

However, problems continue to plague the system, and technology experts question if the fixes being deployed by a team of government workers, outside contractors and specialists can get it functioning smoothly as soon as Saturday.

Luke Chung, president of Virginia-based software developer FMS Inc., called the administration’s prediction that HealthCare.gov would work at 80% capacity on or around November 30 an impractical threshold in the software world.

“I don’t know how to build something that’s only 80% complete,” Chung told CNN. “I don’t even understand how that works.”

The website woes raised questions about the viability and security of the system, and opened the reforms known as Obamacare to fresh attacks by conservative Republicans who seek to dismantle or eliminate them.

More bad news emerged Wednesday when the administration announced the website will be unable to enroll small businesses online for another year.

White House: Enroll in Obamacare, but not too fast

Small businesses can enroll in other ways in the special small business system known as SHOP, but problems with HealthCare.gov have prevented their online enrollment so far. It was the third delay of the SHOP Marketplace component of the website, this time until November 2014.

For now, “small businesses will be able to enroll directly in a SHOP plan through an insurer, agent or broker and can get certified for a tax credit after they enroll,” said Julie Bataille, a spokeswoman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services that oversees the rollout of the reforms.

The Affordable Care Act doesn’t require companies with fewer than 50 employees to buy insurance for workers, though workers are required to have coverage. Employers who choose to provide coverage for their workers may qualify for subsidies to reduce their costs.

“We expect that making direct enrollment, tax credit applications and comparison shopping easier will help to ensure that small businesses can take full advantage of the marketplace and tax credits worth up to 50% of employee premiums in 2014,” Bataille said.

However, the head of the International Franchise Association complained the delay in online enrollment made it harder for small business owners to get all the information they need to enroll.

“With this delay, it will also call into question how the small business tax credit is applied,” said Steve Caldeira, the group’s president and CEO. “Not having the ability to apply electronically will now make this process more confusing, cumbersome and time-consuming for employers.”

Republicans pounced on the news, with House Speaker John Boehner urging Obama to delay implementation of the entire Affordable Care Act.

“This law has been an absolute disaster, leaving us to ask, ‘What’s next?’ ” the Ohio Republican said in a statement. “If the President won’t repeal it, he should at least delay the entire law before it wreaks any more havoc on American families and small businesses as well as our economy.”

Boehner signs up for Obamacare

Meanwhile, insurance industry insiders told CNN on condition of not being identified that problems continue with the transmission of data submitted by people signing up for coverage through HealthCare.gov.

“There’s no part of us that thinks all of this will be fixed in three days from now,” an industry official said, referring to the November 30 date for the site to run smoothly for most users.

Robert Zirkelbach, a spokesman for the insurance trade group America’s Health Insurance Plans, said that “there is still a lot of work to be done to make sure that enrollments can be done and processed accurately.”

Insurers: Despite deadline, Obamacare glitches persist

Wednesday’s developments came as the Obama administration prepared for a potential surge in online enrollment over the weekend.

According to a White House official, the administration suggested this week that allied organizations hold off on launching campaigns to drive traffic to the website in the first week of December.

Officials fear another huge surge in volume that the site can’t handle, which is what occurred around its launch in October.

HealthCare.gov was originally planned to handle 50,000 concurrent users, and will reach that capacity by Saturday, the White House official said.

However, big spikes in traffic – such as the 200,000 who tried to get on at the same time on October 1 – would cause users to go into a queue to receive e-mails advising them when to return, the official noted.

Publicly, Obama and Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius have been urging Americans to give HealthCare.gov another try, though they make clear it remains a work in progress.

The November 30 target for website improvements “does not represent a relaunch of HealthCare.gov; it is not a magical date,” Bataille told reporters. “There will be times after November 30 when HealthCare.gov does not function properly.”

Website woes aside, a new CNN/ORC International poll released Wednesday showed a majority of Americans believe the current Obamacare problems can be solved, and the figures for overall support and opposition remain little changed from a month ago.

In a conference call Tuesday with state and local officials, Sebelius listed steps taken so far to improve the website’s performance.

“We’ve added hardware, we’ve added software; we’re continuing to work on the parts of the website that were too confusing to people,” she said, urging the officials “to not hesitate to recommend that people go to HealthCare.gov and get signed up because that experience is currently working much better and it will continue to work much better.”

Sebelius: Obamacare website improvements ‘on track’

A properly functioning website is crucial to implementing the most vital provisions of the Affordable Care Act that require people to have health coverage.

The failure of HealthCare.gov to enable people to enroll when the sign-up period began last month undermined the launch of new health insurance exchanges intended to provide affordable coverage for millions who previously were uninsured or under-insured.

In theory, the exchanges create large pools of customers that include generally healthier and less-costly younger people as well as older folks who tend to require more expensive health care.

Such large markets would hold down prices by allowing insurance companies to offset the higher costs of aging consumers with the money from lower-cost policy holders, the thinking goes.

For the program to work, it needs to sign up younger people less inclined to pay for health coverage they don’t believe they need.

The GOP opposition targets the entire health care law, not just the website woes, as the ultimate example of big government run amok.

Enrollment figures for the first month after the opening of the new insurance exchanges were much lower than initially expected. Now some states have reported stronger numbers.

According to a CNN count based on available figures, a little more than 200,000 people have signed up for new private health insurance under Obamacare – either through the national system or networks set up in 14 states and the District of Columbia.

In addition, more than 370,000 have signed up for Medicaid under state programs expanded through the health care reforms, the CNN count shows.

The enrollment period runs until March 31, and officials have said the target for the first year was 7 million people. To ensure they have coverage starting on January 1, consumers must sign up by December 23, the administration recently announced.

Chung, the software expert, cited December 23 as the most significant deadline, noting that demand would be huge because people by nature wait until the last minute.

Success for the website would be determined by both the number of users as well as how long they are in the system, Chung said, comparing it to a highway on which 50,000 people traveling 60 mph is smooth traffic while the same number going 10 mph is a jam.

Also Wednesday, seven Democratic senators, including some up for re-election next year, asked Obama to appoint a special health care overseer to ensure continuity in efforts to fix the problems.

Sebelius is technically the top administration official in the implementation of Obamacare, but former White House aide Jeff Zients was brought in last month to oversee efforts to fix the site. Zients will become a top economic adviser to Obama in January.

In a letter, Sens. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Mark Warner of Virginia, Christopher Coons of Delaware, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, Mark Udall of Colorado and Tim Kaine of Virginia called for Obama to name a successor to Zients.

Separately, an HHS official confirmed the government will go with a new Web-hosting contractor, Hewlett-Packard, for HealthCare.gov early next year. The current contract with Terremark ends in March.

The official said the decision to go with a different vendor was made months before any problems with HealthCare.gov were identified and was unrelated to an outage that struck the site in late October, which the administration blamed on the Verizon subsidiary. The HP contract was signed in July.

Doctor Walker is ready for you.

Scott Walkers #1, #2, and #3 top concerns have always been the same: Scott Walker.

In elected office nearly his entire adult life, he has used each office he's held exclusively as a stepping stone to his next elected office. Well known for rewarding donors and continually inflicting as much damage as possible as possible on those he identifies as enemies, Walker has amassed a zealous following among the most ideological Republican voters by resorting to the most petty politics imaginable.

Sitting in the Wisconsin State Legislature, he leapt on the opportunity to become Milwaukee County Executive in a recall election (yes, you read that right) when residents of Milwaukee County became angry at a pension deal that mainly benefitted the County Exec and several long-serving members of the Board of Supervisors. RW hate radio and the Republican-loving Milwaukee corporate media fanned the flames and paved the way for Walker. The rest is history. Walker won the recall.

As Milwaukee County Executive, Walker began to travel the state (at county taxpayer expense, of course) to increase his name recognition. His next office, naturally, would be state-wide since he was already at the top of the heap in the Milwaukee area. He cut taxes for business, pummeled Milwaukee County labor unions, squeezed public services to near extinction, shifted money out of building maintenance, privatized as many jobs as he could (ultimately costing the county millions in lawsuits), was relentless in reducing social programs, and made use of his Milwaukee County staff and facilities for political purposes including the installation and use of a secret router and private email accounts to circumvent public records laws.

In short, he didn't manage his public duties as much as use elected office for politicking for his next job. Poor bashing, union bashing, and dog whistle blowing are very attractive to Republican voters and tossing in a blind hatred of taxes appeals to far too many independents and low information voters.

The governors seat was hardly even warm from the heat of his butt when he unveiled the most horrific legislation possible. Taking nearly a billion dollars out of public schools, slashing state shared revenue to local governments, virtually abolishing unions for every public employee in the entire state whose union didn't endorse him in the election, slashing programs for the disabled, extreme reductions in state public assistance and health programs along with, of course, massive tax reductions (to business) led tens of thousands of normally politically sleepy Wisconsinites to surround the State Capitol for weeks.

He knew something would happen so he made sure to activate the Wisconsin National Guard. His attempt to use them as his palace guard or goon squad fell flat due to the good leadership of the Guard. I doubt he imagined the full extent of public pushback at his extremism. No doubt he and his staff had to order super sized containers of Poop-B-Gone to get the stains out of their underwear that first week, but Walker just loved the attention of the media as could be seen at his 2-3 pressers he held every day.

He became a national Republican Super Star and loved every minute of it. I'm surprised he could control the drool of anticipation at his next political office. Forget running for Herb Kohls Senate seat; he was becoming popular enough to run for President! He knew exactly how to lure extremist Republican primary voters and doubled down on the crazy laws he signed into office no matter how many times the courts smacked down those laws as Unconstitutional.

Campaign donors loved him and funneled plenty of payola into his coffers to enable him to put out tons of ads during the protests to promote his ""concerns for the taxpayer"" and bash protesters. A hundred million dollars flowed into his hands through the end of the recall election and that doesn't even count the ads run by Koch-funded groups like Americans for (the Koch Brothers) Prosperity and similar astroturfs.

Republicans love Scott Walker."
http://money.cnn.com/2013/09/05/news/economy/obamacare-exchanges/index.html,2013-09-05 00:00:00,['Tami Luhby'],Avoiding Obamacare exchanges,"Americans who buy their own health insurance next year won't have to get coverage through their state-based exchange.

Many insurers will offer individual policies outside the Obamacare exchanges in 2014. Consumers can avoid the exchanges by buying plans directly from insurers or through brokers.

But should they?

First, anyone earning less than 400% of the poverty line will be eligible for federal subsidies toward exchange-based plans, so going off the exchange would likely not make sense.

But those who make too much to qualify for subsidies should look both on and off the exchanges for a plan that best fits their needs, experts say.

The off-exchange policies are required to have many of the same Obamacare protections as plans sold on the exchanges, like maternity and mental health benefits, plus insurers can't exclude enrollees because of pre-existing conditions. Only a handful of current individual policies that meet strict guidelines will be grandfathered in.

So why might one want to go off the exchange?

#1: Possible better coverage: Some insurers may opt to offer richer policies or continue grandfathered plans off the exchange to hold onto long-time customers. These policies may have more comprehensive doctors' networks or lower drug co-pays ... with a higher premium to boot, said Dan Mendelson, chief executive of Avalere Health, an advisory company for insurers. But they could be more attractive to current customers than the exchange policies, which may be more restrictive in order to keep premiums under control.

Share your story: Will you just pay the Obamacare penalty?

But some insurers intend to sell the same plans -- with the same premiums -- both on and off the exchange. Those companies are betting on other advantages to make their plans attractive.

#2: Less paperwork: The off-exchange policies may also attract enrollees who won't want the additional work of going through the exchange, which involves gathering pay stubs or W2 forms, settling up an account and waiting for income and citizenship status to be verified by federal agencies.

""You don't necessarily need to go through the extra steps of applying for an exchange policy if you are not subsidy eligible,"" said Bruce Allen, marketing director at Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina, which is selling policies both on and off the exchange there. ""We can get you enrolled in minutes.""

#3: Less government involvement: Some consumers have also told Blue Cross that they intend to go off the exchange because they don't want anything to do with Obamacare, either because they oppose it politically or they equate it with government assistance programs such as Medicaid.

But shopping off the exchange has its challenges. One thing that will be tougher for consumers opting to buy insurance off the exchange is comparing plans and premiums. The exchanges will have websites where consumers can browse through the various plans being offered. But policies available outside the exchange will be sold primarily through independent agents or insurance companies, which could make it harder for consumers to weigh their options.

""Compared to the exchanges, the off-the-exchange market for consumers will continue to be the Wild West in regards to shopping and comparing benefits and prices,"" said Kevin Lucia, senior research fellow at Georgetown's Center on Health Insurance Reforms."

Against a backdrop of closer-than-expected election results in Virginia that some attributed to opposition to the health law, Mr. Obama again expressed regret for the troubles at the federal website that have prevented many people from enrolling for insurance. But he said the Texas government — by refusing to take federal funds and expand Medicaid eligibility — had left more than a million people uninsured. He promised to get problems with the health program fixed.

“As challenging as this may seem sometimes, as frustrating as HealthCare.gov may be sometimes, we are going to get this done,” Mr. Obama told about 150 volunteers and paid navigators helping in enrollment who had gathered to meet him at Temple Emanu-El here. “We’re on the right side of history.”

The president made his remarks as leaders of both parties carefully examined the results of Tuesday’s elections, searching for indications of what went wrong and how they could perform better next year."

Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.) escalated his conflict with fellow Republicans Tuesday when he stepped up his attacks on President Obama’s health-care law, complicating House GOP efforts to pass a funding bill that would avert a government shutdown next week.

Launching a marathon speech modeled on old-fashioned filibusters, Cruz also informed his Senate GOP colleagues that he would try to stretch the debate well into the weekend, according to senators who attended private huddles Tuesday. With Senate passage all but certain, including funds for the health law, senior Republicans had hoped to allow the measure to advance quickly to give House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) more time to respond with a different version of the legislation.

Instead, the freshman senator took the floor Tuesday afternoon promising to speak “until I am no longer able to stand.” His effort to block the legislation had almost no chance of success, as the series of votes advancing it are locked in and most of his fellow Republicans have abandoned him in the effort.

The Cruz talkathon was the latest example of the increasingly stark division among Republicans, both on Capitol Hill and nationally. The Texas newcomer, just 42 and nine months into office, is carrying the banner for conservatives urging a take-no-prisoners approach in confronting the president, even if it means shuttering the government.

“A great many Texans, a great many Americans feel they do not have a voice, and so I hope to play some very small role in providing the voice,” Cruz declared.

But the move angered senior Republicans, who complained that Cruz and the junior senators pushing this strategy did not understand the wounds the GOP suffered during the mid-1990s shutdown battles with President Bill Clinton. Back then, the party controlled both the House and Senate, a luxury when compared to its tenuous majority in the House today.

“I just don’t believe anybody benefits from shutting the government down, and certainly Republicans don’t. We learned that in 1995,” said Sen. Orrin Hatch (Utah), the dean of the GOP caucus. “We’re in the minority. We have to find a way of standing up for our principles without immolating ourselves in front of everybody, in a way when we don’t have the votes to do it.”

Some suggested that this was the latest example of a party adrift, both on policy and strategic thinking. “We haven’t had much of a strategy on anything to this point. Everybody’s shooting from the hip,” said Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.).

Boehner and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) originally preferred a different approach that would have required Democrats to vote for the health-care funds, while GOP senators could have symbolically opposed.

Cruz played a leading role, along with outside conservative groups, in pushing House Republicans to take a harder line. House Republicans relented and on Friday passed a bill exactly as Cruz wanted.

“We don’t need fake fights. We don’t need fake votes. We need real change. We need a better economy. We need more jobs,” Cruz said early Tuesday afternoon, rejecting the original Boehner-McConnell plan.

Throughout the afternoon and evening, a half-dozen colleagues joined Cruz on the floor, among them Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.), two 2016 presidential aspirants. Cruz could yield to colleagues for long-form questions but could not leave the floor or sit.

In the opening hours, Cruz discussed an unusual mix of subjects, ranging from opposition to the health-care law; the unemployment rate among African American teenagers; how his father, Rafael Cruz, used to make green eggs and ham for breakfast; a recent acceptance speech by actor Ashton Kutcher at an awards show; and the restaurants Denny’s, Benihana and White Castle.

Later in the evening, Cruz read Twitter messages he was receiving from supporters and “bedtime stories” to his two young daughters, who he said were in Texas watching with his wife. He quoted from “King Solomon’s Wise Words” from the Book of Proverbs and read the Dr. Seuss classic, “Green Eggs and Ham,” noting that it was one of his favorite children’s books.

When he yielded briefly to take questions, the other senators would give extended remarks on their opposition to the health-care law and then ask Cruz questions that set up the Texas senator to continue his remarks.

By holding the floor, Cruz and his allies launched what looked to most Americans like a traditional filibuster, fixed in the popular imagination by Jimmy Stewart’s performance in “Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.”

But even if Cruz were physically capable of speaking for more than 24 hours — the longest filibuster in U.S. history is 24 hours, 18 minutes by Sen. Strom Thurmond (S.C.) and other Southern senators opposed to civil rights laws — there are parliamentary procedures in place dictating that Cruz will have to yield the floor by Wednesday afternoon at the latest.

At that point, the Senate is scheduled to hold a key procedural test vote that is near certain to pass with bipartisan support. McConnell had hoped that he could get Cruz and his band of allies to relent so that the Senate could pass something by Friday. He even convened an extra meeting, in addition to the weekly Tuesday policy luncheon, at which several senators said Cruz was encouraged to drop some of his delaying tactics or Boehner would not get the legislation until late Sunday or early Monday.

Cruz told the group that he would use every tool possible to drag out the vote.

“My own view is that it would be to the advantage of our colleagues in the House, who are in the majority, to shorten the process, and if the majority leader were to ask us to shorten the process, I would not object,” McConnell told reporters after the two meetings.

“If the House doesn’t get what we send over there until Monday, they’re in a pretty tough spot,” McConnell said later. “My own view is the House, having passed a bill that I really like and that I support . . . I hate to put them in a tough spot.”

If Cruz holds firm, Boehner will have just hours to decide his next move. He might try to quickly pass a new version of the funding legislation, with some conservative sweeteners, but Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) warned that such a move done just hours before Monday’s stroke-of-midnight deadline would guarantee a federal government shutdown. There would simply not be enough time to get through the Senate’s messy parliamentary hurdles to avoid at least a temporary shutdown.

Cruz, who began speaking at 2:41 p.m., was quickly joined by Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), who was the original architect of the strategy to defund Obama’s health-care law or shut down the government. Their filibuster is the culmination of a strategy they began developing in the summer when Lee, first elected in 2010, started looking for allies to defund the law by using annual spending bills for federal agencies as potential leverage.

Lee and Cruz launched a commercial campaign that targeted fellow Republicans with ads designed to pressure GOP senators to support the pair’s shutdown strategy. Senior colleagues have rejected the approach, and instead have grown more angry."

Cruz ends anti-Obamacare talkathon after 21 hours

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) ended his marathon talking attack on President Obama’s health-care law Wednesday after 21 hours and 19 minutes — a feat of stamina that seems likely to complicate House GOP efforts to pass a funding bill aimed at averting a looming government shutdown.

The freshman senator ceded the floor — and got his first opportunity for a bathroom break — at noon, after running up against a deadline imposed by Senate procedural rules. A little over an hour later the Senate voted to choke off the first filibuster hurdle on its own version of the funding bill, which is the first step toward allowing Democrats to include funding for the health-care law that had previously been stripped out by the House.

Both houses of Congress must reach agreement on funding legislation by Monday night to avoid most federal agencies closing on Tuesday.

( Read a transcript of Cruz’s remarks on Tuesday. )

Meanwhile, a similarly contentious debate is simmering over raising the federal debt ceiling, with Treasury Secretary Jack Lew warning Wednesday that the nation will exhaust its emergency borrowing capacity no later than Oct. 17.

Despite urging from some of his colleagues not to stage the talkathon, Cruz took the floor Tuesday afternoon promising to speak against the health-care law “until I am no longer able to stand.”

To most Americans, it looked like a traditional filibuster, fixed in the popular imagination by Jimmy Stewart’s performance in “Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.” But parliamentary procedures already in place meant that Cruz eventually would have to yield the floor.

Cruz’s controversial strategy shrank the window available for House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) and his colleagues to respond with a different version of the legislation.

(INTERACTIVE: Longest filibusters of all time )

By 5 a.m., the length of Cruz’s marathon discourse had surpassed lengthy filibusters by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) in March and the late Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.) in 1964. He earned a lead spot on all three network morning news shows, acknowledging that he was “a little bit” tired but still looking remarkably fresh. The television anchors dubbed Cruz’s effort a “talkathon,” even as they explained to viewers that his effort would not derail the legislative process.

The senator, still wearing the dark suit and light blue tie he had donned the previous day, kept his composure throughout his marathon presentation.

The Cruz talkathon was the latest example of the increasingly stark division among Republicans, both on Capitol Hill and nationally. The Texas newcomer, just 42 and nine months into his first term in office, is carrying the banner for conservatives who urge a take-no-prisoners approach in confronting the president, even if it means shuttering the government.

Hatch (Utah), the dean of the GOP caucus. “We’re in the minority. We have to find a way of standing up for our principles without immolating ourselves in front of everybody, in a way when we don’t have the votes to do it.”

Some suggested that the clashing approaches were the latest evidence of a party adrift, both on policy and strategic thinking. “We haven’t had much of a strategy on anything to this point. Everybody’s shooting from the hip,” said Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.).

Boehner and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) originally preferred a different approach that would have required Democrats to vote for the health-care funds, while GOP senators could have symbolically opposed.

Cruz played a leading role, along with outside conservative groups, in pushing House Republicans to take a harder line. House Republicans on Friday passed a bill without funding for Obamacare, exactly as Cruz wanted.

McConnell had hoped that he could get Cruz and his band of allies to relent so that the Senate could pass something by Friday. He even convened an extra meeting, in addition to the weekly Tuesday policy luncheon, at which several senators said Cruz was urged to drop some of his delaying tactics so that Boehner could get the legislation before late Sunday or early Monday.

But Cruz would not budge.

“We don’t need fake fights. We don’t need fake votes. We need real change. We need a better economy. We need more jobs,” Cruz said early Tuesday afternoon, rejecting the original Boehner-McConnell plan.

All through the night and well into the morning, Cruz’s oratory touched on a broad mix of subjects and sources, including lyrics from a song by country music star Toby Keith; quotations from the popular reality television show “Duck Dynasty;” recollections of how his father, Rafael Cruz, used to make green eggs and ham for breakfast; and a recent acceptance speech by actor Ashton Kutcher at an awards show.

At one point Tuesday night, Cruz opted to read bedtime stories to his two young daughters, who he said were home in Texas watching television with his wife. Cruz first read King Solomon’s Wise Words from the Book of Proverbs and then the Dr. Seuss classic “Green Eggs and Ham,” which he said was one of his favorite children’s books.

Several times Cruz read supportive messages sent to his office via Twitter.

Cruz was permitted to yield to colleagues for long-form questions but could not leave the floor or sit while his effort was under way.

Several like-minded Senate conservatives took turns giving him respite Tuesday evening, including Paul and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), two 2016 presidential aspirants. Rubio returned to the Senate floor Wednesday morning, along with Sen. James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.).

Cruz’s most frequent partner has been Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), who at times phrased “questions” that stretched for almost an hour and included detailed critiques of Supreme Court decisions and a series of recollections from his younger years, all designed to draw attention to his concerns about the health-care law.

The extended discourse by Cruz and Lee is the culmination of a strategy they began developing in the summer when Lee, first elected in 2010, started looking for allies to defund the health-care law by using annual spending bills for federal agencies as potential leverage.

Lee and Cruz launched a commercial campaign that targeted fellow Republicans with ads designed to pressure GOP senators to support the pair’s shutdown strategy. Senior colleagues have rejected the approach, and instead have grown more angry.

A series of junior Democratic senators presided over the Senate chamber through the night, as Cruz talked on and on and on. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) passed the time scanning her iPad. Reporters spotted Sen. Chris Murphy (Conn.) returning to the U.S. Capitol shortly before 11 p.m. with a Red Bull in hand.

“There’s no point to this other than advancing the career of one or two senators,” Murphy said as he wrapped up his two-hour shift around 1 a.m.

As dawn neared, Cruz began leaning more on the podium at his desk, which was surrounded by binders and stacks of paper. In case he ever lost his sense of place, a large yellow Post-it note reminded him in blue ink: “Yield only for the purpose of a question. Be careful!”

Each, in a different way, represents the relatively small part of America that the Obama administration did not talk about while campaigning for the Affordable Care Act: people who have health insurance that they like, but who will be unable to keep it under the law.

Now that new insurance marketplaces are opening, insurance companies are canceling millions of individual plans that fail to meet minimum standards. The dropped plans have become the political talking point of the moment — and, according to many Republicans, a symbol of the president’s flawed ambitions.

GOP talking about killing Obamacare is a liability,"The financial planner told a group of older voting Conservatives that Obamacare was good for their financial well-being. Ironically, a commenter on the post in the same age bracket had the same experience with another group. Now that reality has set in, money managers are advising baby boomers appropriately.

On Monday the New York Times had an excellent article titled “In New Health Law, a Bridge to Medicare.” It details the benefits for those retiring before they qualify for Medicare and the benefits for Americans with pre-existing conditions that had to stay on their jobs lest they would be left without health care. The following paragraphs from the article are prescient.

THE sweeping federal health care law making its major public debut next month was meant for people like Juanita Stonebraker, 63, from Oakland, Md., who retired from her job in a hospital billing office a year and a half ago. She was able to continue her health insurance coverage from the hospital for a time, but when she tried to find an individual policy on her own, none of the insurers she contacted would cover her because she was diabetic. “I didn’t even get to tell them about the heart attack,” said Ms. Stonebraker, who has been without health insurance since July. She is a little over a year away from qualifying for Medicare, the federal insurance program for people 65 and older. She now worries a recent hospitalization will leave her several thousand dollars in debt. Under the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, insurers must now offer coverage to people like Ms. Stonebraker, and they will not be able to set the premiums they charge on the basis of someone’s health. Starting Oct. 1, she and millions of other Americans are expected to be able to buy one of the plans available through newly created online state marketplaces, or exchanges, for coverage that begins in 2014. For those with low incomes, subsidies are available to help pay premiums.



Does anyone know anyone over 50 without some pre-existing condition that an insurance company would not have used to deny coverage entirely or red-lined some pre-existing ailment from coverage?

At this point it is unnecessary to attempt to have any type of argument with Obamacare naysayers. This is the time for the enlightened to help relatives, neighbors and friends to navigate their health insurance head winds. One should encourage them to discuss their medical situation and where applicable hold their hands to assist in getting the coverage they need. One should encourage them to get their information from healthcare.gov and not from political radicals maligning the law.

In a state like Texas where more than 25 percent of the population is uninsured, every fourth person you are in contact with is likely uninsured and a fall or accident away from a bankruptcy inducing medical bill. Many of the uninsured are unaware that Obamacare is the law of the land and are unaware of the benefits that will materially make their lives better.

Given that when Americans are provided with the individual benefits of Obamacare they love it, one should personalize the way it is explained with the specific benefits one's relative, neighbor, or friend's need in such a manner that the benefits are stressed and not the politics. This will ultimately prevent that carnal resistance that can cause someone to make decisions against their own interest to save face.

Many part time workers will face employers like Trader Joe’s who may find it more economical to send those employees to state health insurance exchanges. While many corporations will blame Obamacare, over the years corporations have been offloading health care costs. One should explain that as more and more employees go to the exchanges the exchanges become more economical. Moreover not being tethered to the employer’s health care plan allows one to make decisions based on work satisfaction and not the requirement for health care.

Dissuade those opting for paying the penalty instead of premiums by reminding them that the new policies cover screenings at no additional charge. After all, many of the uninsured have been without insurance for many years and in need of physicals and screenings.

As Obamacare becomes more and more real to Americans, they won’t necessarily claim to like it. However, they will not want to give it up for an alternative that does not exist. They won’t leave it for financial insecurity. Henceforth that is the biggest fear of the Republicans that oppose the bill. Americans will see Republicans as a liability to their well-being if they continue to disparage a law they come to see as beneficial."

Lew, in a written statement, warned that upcoming payments for the following could all be jeopardized before Nov. 1:

Social Security payments

Medicare payments

Veteran benefit payments

Active-duty military salaries

""The United States should not be put in a position of making such perilous choices for our economy and our citizens,"" Lew said.

Lew said missing that deadline would cause financial chaos, hurting the economy and shaking the financial markets to a degree that could cripple the economic recovery. He urged Congress to promptly raise the debt ceiling and pass a spending bill to restore confidence.

The appearance was yet another public restatement of the administration's stance that Congress needs to pass a spending bill and lift the U.S. borrowing cap before President Obama will negotiate over the nation's budget ills.

Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, though, argued that the nation's overspending needs to be dealt with, and he bristled at Obama's repeated claims that the debt ceiling should be raised to pay for spending Congress racked up. ""It is a problem that all of us ... need to deal with,"" Hatch said.

He also said it is ""disconcerting"" to hear Social Security and other payments could be stopped.

In a glimmer of hope for a possible deal, some Republicans are discussing the possibility of permitting a short-term increase in the debt ceiling to allow for further negotiations. Obama is hosting top House Republicans on Thursday afternoon to discuss the impasse, which so far has resulted in a partial government shutdown.

The next big deadline is Oct. 17, when the Treasury Department says the government will exhaust ways to pay all its bills without an increase in the debt ceiling.

Credit-rating agency Moody's, though, released an analysis on Wednesday that claimed even if the government missed that deadline, a default on the debt would not happen. Moody's argues that the Treasury Department would find a way to pay interest on its debt above all else.

""We believe the government would continue to pay interest and principal on its debt, even in the event that the debt limit is not raised, leaving its creditworthiness intact,"" the analysis said. ""The debt limit restricts government expenditures to the amount of its incoming revenues; it does not prohibit the government from servicing its debt. There is no direct connection between the debt limit (actually the exhaustion of the Treasury's extraordinary measures to raise funds) and a default.""

The analysis also noted that the next interest payment -- of $5.9 billion -- is not due until the end of the month.

Still, few would claim that the implications of not raising the debt ceiling are minor. Even if the government can pay interest on the debt, it would be unable to pay myriad other obligations -- officials say the government would have to choose between priorities like Social Security checks and many other functions of the federal government.

The uncertainty could severely damage the economy and shake the financial markets.

Some officials argue, though, that since this is uncharted territory it's ultimately unclear whether the Treasury Department could prioritize payments -- and that a default on debt is a possibility.

""A default would be a financial heart attack,"" Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said Thursday.

Lew on Thursday also questioned his ability to prioritize payments.

Republican fissures over the expansion of Medicaid, a critical piece of the 2010 health-care law designed to provide coverage to millions of uninsured Americans, continue to deepen, with battles in Arizona and elsewhere showing just how bitter the divisions have become.

Despite expressing distaste for the new law, some GOP governors have endorsed an expansion of Medicaid, and three — Jan Brewer of Arizona, John Kasich of Ohio and Rick Snyder of Michigan — are trying to persuade their Republican-controlled legislatures to go along. The governors are unwilling to turn down Washington’s offer to spend millions, if not billions, in their states to add people to the state-federal program for the poor. But they face staunch opposition from many GOP legislators who oppose the health-care law and worry that their states will be stuck with the cost of adding Medicaid recipients.

In one of the most explosive of the internal Republican battles, Brewer, a firebrand tea party favorite who once wagged her finger at President Obama, has declared a “moratorium” on all other legislation until her Medicaid plan, which would add 300,000 Arizonans to the program, is approved. She has backed up her threat by vetoing five unrelated bills.

In Ohio and Michigan, the governors are pressing for last-minute compromises before their legislatures adjourn this summer. The Florida legislature, which has adjourned, rejected Republican Gov. Rick Scott’s plan to expand Medicaid.

These conflicts over the health-care law illustrate a larger divide within the Republican Party over an array of issues, including immigration and automatic budget cuts.

The Medicaid expansion is one of the two main ways the health-care law would provide coverage to the uninsured. The other is through health insurance exchanges, which will sell policies to individuals whose incomes are too high for Medicaid; many of those people will receive subsidies to buy the health plans.

Medicaid eligibility varies from state to state and depends on income and other factors. The health-care law, in an effort to make eligibility uniform, mandated that anyone earning up to 138 percent of the poverty level, or $15,856 in 2013 dollars, be eligible for the program. But last June, the Supreme Court, while upholding most of the health-care law, ruled that states could refuse to expand their Medicaid programs. That set the stage for bitter debates — ones ruled as much by ideology and politics as by financial realities — that have been occurring in state capitals nationwide.

Under the law, the federal government will pay 100 percent of the cost of newly eligible Medicaid recipients for the first three years, beginning in January. After that, the federal contribution will taper, leveling off at 90 percent for 2020 and beyond.

Twenty-three states and the District have agreed to the Medicaid expansion. Nineteen states have decided against the expansion and eight are debating it, according to Avalere Health, a consulting firm. States that decline to expand Medicaid now can still sign up in later years.

The debate over Medicaid has been emotional and vitriolic in many states. In Texas, Gov. Rick Perry (R) was heckled during a recent speech for opposing an expansion. In Montana, chaos erupted after a lawmaker accidentally voted against expanding the program, causing the measure to fail. Medicaid advocates in some states, frustrated by inaction from their elected leaders, are working to put the matter to voters in the form of ballot initiatives.

The hostility is evident in Arizona, where authorities are investigating a threatening phone call and e-mails directed at lawmakers who support expanding the program. Opponents of the expansion have condemned the alleged threats.

Brewer’s support for the expansion has stunned longtime backers, who have come to relish her gritty, confrontational persona. These supporters were gleeful last year when photos showed her defiantly pointing a finger at the president on a tarmac in Phoenix during what she later described as a tense conversation about her characterization of Obama in her memoir, “Scorpions for Breakfast.”

Now, her former fans label her a traitor and deride her Medicaid proposal as “Obrewercare.”

“It’s typical of these politicians,” said Dara Vanesian, chairman for the Navajo County Republican Committee. “This is not truly about the individual or rights or what’s best for Arizona. This is Brewer looking at dollars that are supposedly going to come from the federal government.”

Brewer may win, despite the opposition. Her measure has passed the Republican-controlled state Senate. There is stronger opposition in the House, which has a larger and more conservative Republican majority. State Rep. John Kavanagh (R), chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said the committee plans to strip the Medicaid expansion from the budget.

He acknowledged that his members are feeling the heat after Brewer’s vetoes. Still, he added, conservative lawmakers would be hard-pressed to vote yes on the Medicaid expansion after years of railing against the health-care law and federal spending.

“For the last five years, almost every one of us Republicans have been bashing Obamacare and vilifying the federal government for irresponsible government spending,” Kavanagh said. “I have never seen a more toxic vote for Republicans than to vote yes on this expansion.”

Matthew Benson, a spokesman for Brewer, said the governor is confident that the Medicaid proposal will ultimately pass the House. Despite the vocal opposition from within her party, he said she has the support of many traditionally conservative groups, including 14 of the state’s 15 sheriffs and the Arizona Chamber of Commerce.



“We recognize that the ‘Obamacare’ title is what makes this controversial,” Benson said. “If it weren’t for that aspect of it, this plan would have gotten done months ago.”

Brewer, who joined the unsuccessful lawsuit last year to strike down the health-care law, has tried to walk a blurry line on the issue. She has maintained her opposition to the legislation and insisted that her Medicaid proposal is not the same as Obama’s.

Her office has argued that the Medicaid plan will spur growth by providing money to hospitals and pumping $2 billion into the Arizona economy. And she has said she will pull the plug if it appears that the federal government will not come through on its promise to fully or mostly fund the expansion.

“When I introduced my Medicaid restoration plan in January, I knew it wasn’t going to be easy,” Brewer said at a rally in Tucson. “I knew the road was going to be tough. And I knew there were going to be opponents. But let me tell you something else. I don’t think the opponents realize how hard we are going to fight.”

Arizona was the last state to join Medicaid, signing on in 1982, 17 years after the program was created. Today, it covers many childless adults who earn up to $11,490, the federal poverty level for that demographic and a more generous amount than most states."

Jan Brewer pushes through Obama’s Medicaid expansion,"TUCSON — Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer won a battle with state lawmakers this week, defying most other conservatives in her party to get a key component of President Obama’s Medicaid expansion through the Legislature.

The Arizona Senate voted Thursday to approve the measure 18 to 11. That followed approval earlier this week by the state House of Representatives.

The issue had inflamed passions and divided the Legislature for weeks. Things came to a head Tuesday when Brewer called lawmakers into the Capitol in Phoenix for a surprise special session.

Brewer — a vocal opponent of President Obama’s healthcare reform law — came out in support of Medicaid expansion for her state in January and ended up leading a contingent of moderate Democrats and Republicans who won over the objections of some conservative Republicans.

“By joining me in extending health coverage to hundreds of thousands of Arizonans, legislators of my own party have come under sharp criticism in some quarters. Some have had threats made not just against their political future, but also their personal livelihood,” Brewer said in a prepared statement.

Brewer added: “But I also know this in my heart: The great majority of Arizonans stand with us. Our citizens have — time and again — voted to extend cost-effective care to the working poor.”

Opponents of Medicaid expansion blasted Brewer and those who supported her, charging that the expansion would raise insurance premiums for Arizona residents.

“Tyranny rears its head in Arizona,” tweeted state Sen. Kelli Ward. “Those of us who voted against it were unable to stop the hijacking of the legislative process by the few. It was a sad day in AZ.”

Brewer, whose state joined 25 others in fighting Obama’s Affordable Care Act in court, later became a staunch proponent for Medicaid expansion in Arizona. She said the expansion effort would secure a stream of federal revenue — $1.6 billion — that would cover the costs of the uninsured who already show up in doctors’ offices and emergency rooms across the state.

Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld Obama’s healthcare overhaul but allowed states to opt out of Medicaid expansion.

Like other GOP governors, Brewer opted out of the health insurance exchange component of the law, leaving it to the federal government to set up the marketplace where the uninsured in the state and businesses can choose their providers.

Still, the federal funding for Medicaid expansion was too good an opportunity to pass up. The $1.6 billion in federal funding will enable Arizona to provide health insurance for an additional 240,000 residents and continue insuring 50,000 childless adults.

Arizona would become the 24th state to move toward participating in expanded Medicaid, according to the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit organization that tracks the issue.

NEW YORK, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Caught flat-footed by the challenges of building the financial-management and accounting parts of the U.S. government's new online marketplace for health insurance, officials rushed to hire a familiar contractor without seeking competing bids, according to government procurement documents reviewed by Reuters.

The documents dated in August - less than two months before the opening of online marketplaces established by President Barack Obama's landmark healthcare law - showed the agency in charge had only ""recently learned"" that building the financial management functions was ""beyond (its) currently available resources.""

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) documents shed more light on the problems facing the agency as it worked on the marketplaces established by the law commonly called Obamacare and on its revelation this week that at least 30 percent of the marketplace is still being built.

Those problems and others have been revealed by congressional oversight investigators who released emails and outside reports that paint an administration scrambling to meet the technological challenges of the marketplace - and usually failing to do so.

CMS spokeswoman Joanne Peters said on Friday and on Saturday that representatives of the agency were unavailable to comment on the contract or on an estimate of when the financial management part of the marketplace is expected to be finished.

Although the consumer-facing part of the marketplace, the HealthCare.gov website, opened for enrollments on Oct. 1, CMS had a goal of Jan. 1, 2014 for the financial components of the system to be operational.

""The prospect of a delay...even for a few days, would result in severe consequences, financial and other,"" CMS said in a ""justification and approval"" document explaining the lack of competition for the contract.

The contract, valued at nearly $12 million, was awarded on Aug. 9 to Novitas Solutions, according to the documents. Novitas has numerous contracts with CMS, including to administer doctor and hospital claims in the federal Medicare program for elderly Americans.

The problem-plagued HealthCare.gov is being worked on by contractors racing to fix it by the end of November so that people can enroll in insurance plans for 2014 under the 2010 Affordable Care Act. The law aims to provide health care insurance to millions of uninsured people.

OBAMA ASKED FOR FEWER 'NO-BID' CONTRACTS

Federal agencies are normally required to solicit bids for work, so as to get the best deal for taxpayers, but can award a contract to a favored company in emergencies as long as they document the urgency.

A few weeks after taking office in 2009, Obama issued a memorandum to government agency heads ordering them to minimize the use of non-competitive contracts, calling them potentially ""wasteful, inefficient, subject to misuse.""

The procurement documents made clear how crucial the financial functions on the healthcare portal are. If payments were not made on time and accurately, CMS said, ""operation of the Marketplace and the Affordable Care Act will certainly be jeopardized.""

Financial management includes such functions as transmitting premium payments to insurers. Building that capability into the Obamacare marketplace ""is already minimally two months overdue,"" according to the August documents.

Just a few weeks before the financial-management contract was awarded, according to emails released last week by the House Energy and Commerce Committee, CMS officials were becoming increasingly concerned about the status of the federal insurance marketplace, asking for assurance that the lead contractor was not ""going to crash the plane at take-off.""

On Tuesday, CMS's deputy chief information officer, Henry Chao, author of the ""crash"" email, told a congressional panel that 30 to 40 percent of the federal marketplace was still under construction.

Invisible to consumers are what Chao called the ""back office systems."" Those include accounting and payment systems to send premiums to insurers and transfer funds to insurers that attract more than their share of customers with high medical costs.

The no-bid contract awarded to Novitas includes these systems. Novitas is a subsidiary of Diversified Service Options, which is wholly-owned by Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida .

Asked about how Novitas was awarded the contract and the work it is doing, Florida Blue spokesman Mark Wright said a company official told him, ""We're not going to be able to get into this right now.""

Chao told a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee that CMS and its contractors had focused on building HealthCare.gov so it could launch on Oct. 1, postponing construction of ""the financial management aspects of the system.""

The lead contractor on HealthCare.gov, the U.S. subsidiary of Canada's CGI Group Inc, is also involved in building the financial management piece of the marketplace, a company official said.

The construction ""is a bigger problem than people realize,"" said Robert Booz, a vice-president and healthcare specialist at technology consultant Gartner.

""Everyone recognizes it's going to be a problem in January,"" he said, referring to financial management. In the worst case, if financial records are wrong, then people who have signed up for, and paid a monthly premium for, insurance may be told incorrectly that they are not covered.

The charge that ObamaCare is driving Americans into part-time work is one of the central claims that opponents make in arguing for the law to be defunded or delayed. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, reiterated the claim during his 21-hour floor speech against ObamaCare this week.

But the president, while promoting the law to a friendly audience in suburban Washington, brushed off the argument.

""Most of the stories you'll hear about how ObamaCare just can't work, they're just not based on fact,"" Obama said.

He continued: ""They said this would be a disaster in terms of jobs. There's no widespread evidence that the Affordable Care Act is hurting jobs. ... Reforming health care's going to help the economy over the long-term.""

More On This...

The claim flies in the face of what union leaders have been telling the White House and Democratic lawmakers for months.

In a widely noted letter to Democratic leaders over the summer, the heads of the Teamsters and other unions argued that ""perverse incentives"" were hurting jobs.

Unless the law is changed, they wrote, ""the ACA will shatter not only our hard-earned health benefits, but destroy the foundation of the 40-hour workweek that is the backbone of the American middle-class.""

They, and employers across the country, point to provisions of the law that would require businesses with 50 or more full-time workers to provide health insurance to those workers. The argument is that businesses are scrambling, then, to make more workers qualify as part-time, by reducing their hours to fewer than 30 a week.

""Numerous employers have begun to cut workers' hours to avoid this obligation, and many of them are doing so openly,"" the union leaders wrote.

The Obama administration, in a surprise move, delayed the employer mandate by a year. But that hasn't stopped businesses from cutting hours.

Investor's Business Daily has compiled a list of more than 300 employers that have cut worker hours or staffing levels, many as recently as this month.

Among them was SeaWorld, in Florida, cutting back part-time hours from 32 to 28 per week.

The Washington Free Beacon reported Wednesday on a South Carolina cleaning business claiming it will hire only part-time workers in order to stay under the 50-worker threshold.

Obama was promoting the law in Maryland in advance of the Oct. 1 launch of the so-called insurance ""exchanges."" These are regulated marketplaces where Americans will be able to shop for approved insurance plans -- enrollment begins Tuesday.

Obama tried to counter ""misinformation"" about the law, and noted: ""If you already have health care, you don't have to do anything."""

Over the past two years, 21.5 million health insurance consumers have gotten $1.6 billion in rebates because their providers spent less than 80 percent of the premiums they paid on medical care, rather than overhead or profit, as the Obama administration announced last month. On Thursday, Obama sought to heighten awareness of such parts of the health care law that already are in effect, ahead of a major campaign to enroll a targeted 7 million more people in health insurance starting Oct. 1.

""If you're one of the 85 percent of Americans who already have health insurance -- could be through your employer or through Medicare or through Medicaid -- you already have an array of new benefits in place,"" Obama said during remarks at the White House. ""You don't have to wait until Oct. 1. You're already getting benefits even if you don't know if it's because of the Affordable Care Act.""

The administration faces significant challenges to getting those health insurance exchanges ready for the six-month enrollment period that begins in October, and it is embarking on a major effort to promote enrollment in health insurance and Medicaid among people -- especially the young, healthy, and poor -- who are uninsured or currently buy their own health insurance. The difficulty of the task and doubts about the administration's readiness are underscored by the White House's decision to delay a separate requirement that large employers cover their workers of face penalties of up to $3,000 per worker.

The biggest parts of the health care law not yet online -- and the hardest measures to put into place -- will affect the uninsured.

""Our broken health care system threatened the hopes and dreams of families and business across the country who feared that one illness or one accident could cost them everything they spent a lifetime building. Step by step, we're fixing that system,"" Obama said Thursday. ""Affordable health care is not some privilege just for the few. It's a basic right that everybody should be able to enjoy.""

But he also must assuage concerns of the majority of Americans who already are covered by job-based health insurance and government programs like Medicare and Medicaid that Obamacare will upend their benefits. The president sought to promote the insurance rebates as an example of how the law has positively affected currently insured people.

""Millions of Americans opened letters from their insurance companies, but instead of the usual dread that comes from getting a bill, they were pleasantly surprised with a check,"" he said. ""Most folks wouldn't know when that check comes in that this was because of Obamacare.""

Obama also touted the news, reported Wednesday by The New York Times, that health insurance premiums in New York state will decline by as much as half under Obamacare next year, not counting the tax credits available to low- and middle-income people.

Health insurance premiums in 10 states and the District of Columbia will be lower on average than projected by the Congressional Budget Office, the Department of Health and Human Services reported in an analysis released Thursday. Premiums will vary greatly from state to state and based on individuals' ages and other factors, and will be higher for some people next year.

On average, the lowest premium for a ""silver"" plan -- the second-least-generous of four levels of coverage available to anyone on the exchanges -- in those states will be $321 a month for a single person, compared to the $392 the CBO predicted, according to HHS. That represents an 18 percent difference, although the prices in those states could change before October.

HHS produced charts comparing the lowest and second-lowest average premiums for a silver-level plan in those 10 states and the District of Columbia. The first bar on the right represents the department's analysis of the CBO projections and the second shows the average across the states. New Mexico will have the lowest average health insurance premiums among the states, at $226, while the highest will be in Vermont, at $400, according to the analysis.

Republican opposition to Obamacare remains fierce, and the GOP brushed aside Obama's messages about New York's premiums and other positive effects of the law, emphasizing instead its potential negatives, like that some Americans may pay more for coverage next year. The House voted Wednesday to to repeal parts of the law, marking nearly 40 such attempts to eliminate, scale back or defund Obamacare since 2011.

""The picture that the president paints of his health care law looks nothing like the reality facing struggling American families,"" House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) said in a press release after Obama's speech Thursday. ""House Republicans will continue our efforts to fully repeal the president’s health care law in its entirety once and for all.""

In his speech, Obama acknowledged political opposition to the law was affecting his administration's ability to carry it out and criticized House Republicans for ""re-fighting these old battles.""

But it's resistance to Obamacare at the state level that is having a more tangible impact on the law's reach. Just 16 states and the District of Columbia elected to manage their own health insurance exchanges, leaving the federal government responsible for the remainder, and as many as half of states won't expand Medicaid to more poor people under the law.

""In states that are working hard to make sure that this law delivers for their people, what we're seeing is that consumers are getting a hint of how much money that's going to be saved because of this law,"" Obama said, citing California, New York, Oregon and Washington state, where health insurance premiums for next year beat estimates.

""It's hard, it's a big country, and the health care industry is massive,"" he said. ""As we implement, there are going to be glitches and there are going to be certain states that, for political reasons, are resisting implementation. And we're just steadily working through all that stuff.""

Millions of health insurance plans have been cancelled after ObamaCare went into effect, and President Obama backed away Monday from his previous oft-repeated statement that “if you like your plan, you can keep your plan.”

But he may want to glance at his own website, WhiteHouse.gov, which still states: ""For Americans with insurance coverage who like what they have, they can keep it. Nothing in this act or anywhere in the bill forces anyone to change the insurance they have, period.""



That appears in a section of the WhiteHouse.gov website labeled ""health reform details."" The exact same language also appears in the Department of Health and Human Services' online description of the law.

But that web description is very different from what Obama said Monday to top backers of Organizing for Action, his permanent campaign arm.

“What we said was, ‘You could keep it [your plan] if it hasn’t changed since the law was passed,’” Obama said.

Critics say the conflicting language is dishonest.

More On This...

“Even though millions of Americans are getting cancellation notices in the mail because of the President’s health care law, the White House website still promises that Americans can keep the care they like,"" Senator John Barrasso, R-Wyo., who is also an orthopedic surgeon, said in a statement to FoxNews.com.

""If the President was being honest, he would finally tell the American people that his law won’t allow them to keep their coverage, premiums won’t be cheaper than a cell phone bill, and the website won’t be as easy to use as Amazon. It’s time for the White House to tell the truth – instead of doubling down on dishonesty,” Barrasso added.

A Department of Health and Human Services spokeswoman said on Monday that she would check on the issue, but did not comment as of Tuesday.

White House spokesman Eric Schultz, reached by FoxNews.com, did not say whether the administration stood by the website's wording, but he instead referred to statements by spokesman Jay Carney from Tuesday.

Carney, in his remarks Tuesday, defended all the President’s statements.

""Look, the [grandfathering] provision within the Affordable Care Act was the manifestation of the President’s promise that if you had a plan that you liked, you could keep it,” Carney said, before putting the blame on insurers.

""If you had a plan and your insurance company didn’t cancel it, you could keep it,"" Carney said.

However, the insurance company cancellations were largely due to a rule issued by the Department of Health and Human services which disqualified plans that have changed at all since the law passed from being “grandfathered” in and exempted from the regulations.

“When the rule was issued, Secretary Sebelius and others spoke to the press about it, specifically about the fact that… if insurance companies changed their plans or canceled their plans, they would give up the opportunity to grandfather those plans in,” Carney said.

Yet critics point out that the website reads: “Nothing in this act or anywhere in the bill forces anyone to change the insurance they have, period.”

A Republican Senate health policy staffer told FoxNews.com he thought the wording on the website was inaccurate and surprising.

""It does surprise me, because the Obama team owes their success in no small part to social media and web savvy. And they know that any narrative is subject to a quick check via Google.""

The staffer added, ""the President's defenders will say he was just trying to simplify a complicated public policy into terms that people can understand... But I think there's a difference between trying to simplify things and fundamentally changing the meaning.""

Most Americans are happy with their existing plans, he noted.

""Polls have repeatedly shown that 85% of Americans who have coverage are satisfied with it,"" he said. Two Quinnipiac polls from 2009, before ObamaCare passed, put the number at between 85 and 88%.

Some in Congress say they're trying to do something to help people keep their plans.

""Millions of Americans are slated to lose the individual health insurance they already like and own,"" Re. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., told FoxNews.com.

""I recently joined Congressman Ron DeSantis to introduce the 'If You Like Your Health Care Plan You Can Keep It Act of 2013' to make good on the President’s promise,"" he added.

Asked on Tuesday whether such a plan would be considered by the President, Jay Carney did not answer directly.

Asked whether the President would take back his ""if you like your health plan, you can keep it"" comments from the past if he could, Carney replied:

""Well, the President, as awesomely powerful as the office is, can't go back in time. And what the President is focused on is what we're all focused on, which is getting this right for the American people and getting it right for everyone.""

Oh, yes, it has. And is.

Faced with a blizzard of bad PR as a result of a faltering website that had been designed as the main portal for those seeking insurance under the plan, Obama went to Boston to park himself in the place where Republicans and Democrats passed a state health program that served as a model for the national one.

His intent was multi-pronged: By location, he sent the reminder that in places where all parties worked to pass and improve healthcare reform, the program has succeeded. (And, he pointed out, that was accomplished under a Republican governor, Mitt Romney, the man he defeated in 2012). By topic, he accented the popular aspects of healthcare reform, as if to remind people that there was a reason that politicians have tried to pull off insurance reform for decades.

But in trying to re-argue the case for a program passed several years ago — and not sold well in the interim — Obama faces an intractable question: Is anyone listening?

Recent polling shows that views of healthcare reform have frozen in place, and along partisan lines.

According to a survey taken by the Pew Research Center in mid-October, about 4 in 10 Americans approved of the healthcare law and 5 in 10 disapproved.

But among Democrats, 75% approved. Among Republicans, 85% disapproved. And their views have apparently hardened; apart from a slight increase in disapproval among Republicans, hardly any group changed their tune from a September Pew poll.

Republicans have noted time and again that the national plan was passed by Democrats against GOP objections, making it different at the outset from the bipartisan Massachusetts measure. Nonetheless, the president’s remarks Wednesday appeared intended to reach over the squabbling right-left divide to reassure Americans that what was passed wasn’t as life-altering as its opponents have made it out to be and in fact had some popular components.

“A true patients’ bill of rights,” he called it. “No more discrimination against kids with preexisting conditions. No more dropping your policy when you get sick and need it most. No more lifetime limits or restricted annual limits. Most plans now have to cover free preventive care like mammograms and birth control. Young people can stay on their parents’ plans until they are 26. All this is in place right now. It is working right now.”

He implored those who are uninsured and want to sign up for coverage, or those whose existing insurance is being replaced, to have patience as the kinks are worked out of the system. He repeatedly said that he was confident those groups would find affordable plans -- once they can gain access to the system, that is.

He also nodded to the blast of criticism from people whose bargain-basement plans have been canceled because they did not comport with the new minimum coverage requirements for health insurance. He called the insurers who had sold those plans “bad apple” insurers. And he altered his often-uttered statement, as the law was proposed and since, that Americans who were happy with their insurance could keep it. Now what you can keep, he said, is “health insurance that works,” as defined by the law.

“If you’re getting one of these letters, just shop around in the new marketplace,” he said. “That’s what it’s there for.... You’re going to get a better deal.”

The danger in Obama’s remarks, nearly a full month after the rocky debut of the insurance marketplaces that were supposed to benefit the most needy, is that they came after a considerable chunk of the country has either gone to their partisan corners or thrown their hands up in frustration or disgust. A calm rendering of the facts as he saw them might have at least minimized some of the partisan tension, but Obama did not pass up the opportunity to dig at the other side.

He spoke of governors, including some Republican executives, who have worked to put the healthcare law into place, and chastised those who had worked to block it.

“Some are so locked into politics that they won’t lift a finger to help their own people,” he said, with an edge of bitterness. “If they put as much energy into making it work as they do to attacking the law, Americans would be better off.”

And, he said, anyone defending the broken system that the law was meant to replace “should have to explain themselves ... because I don’t think we should go back to discriminating against kids with preexisting conditions. I don’t think we should go back to dropping people because they get sick or they make a mistake on their application.”

Selling the healthcare law has always been a stiff challenge, in some ways giving rise to the same fears that are summoned by discussions about changing Social Security and Medicare. People are always worried that they will lose what they have, imperfect as it is. When putting a plan in place whose most visible beneficiaries are people in the minority — the uninsured and the uninsurable — squawks are predictable.

At this point, however, Obama alone owns Obamacare, for better or worse.

According to a CNN report, though young people are now required to purchase insurance under Obamacare or pay a fine, “many low-income younger Americans won’t get any subsidy at all” because, as the Obama administration claims, the “cost of insurance is lower than the government initially expected.”

In April, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius “told a congressional subcommittee that any individual making under that $45,960 threshold–or four times the poverty level of $11,490 for an individual–would qualify for ‘an upfront tax subsidy.'”

According to CNN, “subsidies are based on a formula set by law, applying to individuals with annual incomes of one to four times the poverty level–or $11,490 to $45,960.” And to calculate the subsidies, “the government sets a maximum amount that low-income customers will have to pay for insurance as a percentage of their income. That cap is then subtracted from the cost of a mid-level insurance plan in the individual’s region, and the difference is their subsidy.”

And though insurance companies are required to “knock that amount off the price of premiums before the customer pays,” the subsidy is “zero” if the baseline plan insurance plans are cheap enough. That means many low-income younger Americans who are forced to buy insurance are discovering, to the surprise of many, that they will have to do so without the subsidies they were promised, as CNN noted:"
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/10/31/Media-need-not-be-caught-off-guard-by-Ocares-next-nuke,2013-10-31 00:00:00,['John Nolte'],Media Need Not Be Caught Off Guard By ObamaCare's Next Nuke,"Throughout the Obama administration, our dangerously incurious, acquiescent media have been collectively caught off guard by every White House scandal, from Benghazi to the IRS to “you can keep your insurance.” Each and every time, the media ignored conservatives who warned in advance of what was happening. But the next unexploded scandal — a nuclear bomb in ObamaCare — is an opportunity for the media to redeem itself.

Thursday, Forbes reported that the Obama administration knew in 2010 that by the time the dust settles, 93 million Americans will lose their insurance due to ObamaCare. This time, instead of being caught off guard and surprised by something that is an open secret, maybe the media can get ahead of this story before it is too late — if it isn’t already:

Section 1251 of the Affordable Care Act contains what’s called a “grandfather” provision that, in theory, allows people to keep their existing plans if they like them. But subsequent regulations from the Obama administration interpreted that provision so narrowly as to prevent most plans from gaining this protection.

“The Departments’ mid-range estimate is that 66 percent of small employer plans and 45 percent of large employer plans will relinquish their grandfather status by the end of 2013,” wrote the administration on page 34,552 of the Register. All in all, more than half of employer-sponsored plans will lose their “grandfather status” and get canceled. According to the Congressional Budget Office, 156 million Americans–more than half the population–was covered by employer-sponsored insurance in 2013.

Another 25 million people, according to the CBO, have “nongroup and other” forms of insurance; that is to say, they participate in the market for individually-purchased insurance. In this market, the administration projected that “40 to 67 percent” of individually-purchased plans would lose their Obamacare-sanctioned “grandfather status” and get canceled, solely due to the fact that there is a high turnover of participants and insurance arrangements in this market. (Plans purchased after March 23, 2010 do not benefit from the “grandfather” clause.) The real turnover rate would be higher, because plans can lose their grandfather status for a number of other reasons.

How many people are exposed to these problems? 60 percent of Americans have private-sector health insurance–precisely the number that Jay Carney dismissed. As to the number of people facing cancellations, 51 percent of the employer-based market plus 53.5 percent of the non-group market (the middle of the administration’s range) amounts to 93 million Americans.

Dear Media: This is science, math, and law. How about digging in a little bit on this one? Because it is coming and we all know it.

What’s more, he added, most people do not understand that.

By his point that evening, the president was referring to the widespread and incorrect view, especially among older Americans, that Medicare recipients get only what they have paid for through taxes, premiums and medical co-payments. Now that misperception is making it all the harder for politicians to consider trimming those benefits or raising out-of-pocket expenses as they seek to restrain Medicare spending that is rising unsustainably while baby boomers age and medical prices increase.

There has long been similar confusion about Social Security, although the current generation of new beneficiaries is roughly breaking even.

Late in 2012, for a sixth straight year, Medicare trustees issued a warning required by law whenever more than 45 percent of the health program’s costs must be covered by general revenues from all taxpayers."

Ted Cruz rallied conservatives to keep up the fight to unravel ObamaCare, ahead of a White House meeting where his colleagues were expected to dial back their demands for changes to the health law as part of a possible deal to end the partial government shutdown.

Cruz and his Tea Party-aligned colleagues spoke at the annual Values Voter Summit in Washington, D.C., Friday morning.

The Texas senator, who along with Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, helped drive the showdown with the White House over ObamaCare, joked that he'd be heading next to the meeting with his colleagues at the White House, and ""if I'm never seen again, please send a search-and-rescue team.""

But Cruz also delivered a stern message to conservatives, amid signs that the upcoming meeting could lead Senate GOP leaders to dial back their demands on ObamaCare.

""We're nearing the edge of a cliff,"" Cruz said, focusing his remarks almost exclusively on the health law. ""What does it take to win this fight? It takes the men and women in this room.""

Cruz also urged the House of Representatives to keep ""standing strong.""

Cruz and his allies had demanded that ObamaCare be defunded as part of any spending bill. Failure to reach an agreement with Democrats resulted in the partial government shutdown which started Oct. 1. Lawmakers are now grappling with both the spending debate and a looming Oct 17 deadline to raise the debt ceiling.

House Republicans pitched a plan to the White House Thursday night to approve a short-term debt-ceiling increase, but President Obama pushed back because it did not address the partial shutdown.

Senate Republicans are now crafting an alternate proposal that deals with both. It includes a provision dealing with ObamaCare, but is far short of what Cruz campaigned for -- and advocated with a 21-hour address on the Senate floor last month.

The emerging proposal comes from Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and others. It would propose a six-month extension of government spending, a repeal of the health care law's medical device tax and greater flexibility for agencies to deal with across-the-board spending cuts in effect this year.

Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said the goal was ending the partial shutdown and raising the debt limit, but said, ""We will not defund ObamaCare.""

Cruz, decrying the health law as a ""train wreck,"" claimed the American people remain ""energized"" around the goal of gutting the law. He claimed it is causing ""enormous harm"" to the economy -- though the administration says there's no hard evidence that the economy is being hurt by the roll-out.

Cruz was also interrupted more than a half-dozen times by protesters. To the delight of the audience, he repeatedly accused them of being Obama's ""political operatives.""

""How scared is the president?"" Cruz asked, as another protester was escorted.

Where the budget and debt talks go from here is unclear. One reason Senate Republicans might step up with a new plan is because Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid seemed to dismiss a key detail of the proposal from House Speaker John Boehner.

Reid said negotiations before the government reopens -- a key part of Boehner's proposal -- were ""not going to happen.""

Reid has proposed extending the debt limit through 2014, which would boost the current $16.7 trillion debt limit by around $1 trillion. He has been planning for a test vote by Saturday on the measure, which has no other conditions, but Republicans may have enough votes to block it unless he agrees to changes.

Possible Deal on Government Shutdown, Debt Ceiling; Muslims Gather in Mecca for Hajj

Aired October 15, 2013 - 04:00:00 ET

THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.



CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: Two weeks since the start of a partial government shutdown, two days before a deadline for the U.S. debt ceiling. Some political leaders say they are closer on a deal. Yesterday, one possibility was offered by Republican Senator Susan Collins and Democratic Senator Joe Manchin. It would set aside funds to end the shutdown, increase the debt ceiling and address parts of the Affordable Care Act - Obamacare. That`s been one focus of the debates in Washington. Nothing is finalized. Any deal would have to be passed by the House and the Senate and then signed by the president. But Senate leaders say they are feeling more positive.

SEN. HARRY REID (D) MAJORITY LEADER: I`m very optimistic, and we reach - we will reach an agreement that`s reasonable in nature this week.



SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R ) MINORITY LEADER: And we`ve had an opportunity over the last couple of days to have some very constructive exchanges of use (ph) about how to move forward. Those discussions continue, and I share his optimism that we`re going to get a result that will be acceptable to both sides.

AZUZ: One position you wouldn`t expect to find on an NFL team, an infectious disease specialist, but the Tampa Bay Buccaneers are working with one to deal with something that`s now affected three players: MRSA. It`s a nasty little bacteria that might look like a pimple or spider bite on someone infected. MRSA stands for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. What that means, is that it`s hard to cure because regular antibiotics don`t phase it. Three players in Tampa Bay have been diagnosed with the MRSA infection. They are cornerback Jonathan Banks, guard Carl Nicks and kicker Lawrence Tynes. We don`t know yet how they got MRSA, but one way it can spread is through skin to skin contact. People can also get it when they touch something with the bacteria on it. That`s more likely in places with shared equipment, so think hospitals, gyms and locker rooms. Depending on the severity of the infection, it is possible to continue playing after being treated. Carl Nicks did that before his infection recurred. It`s not necessarily life-threatening, if treated. And the NFL has dealt with dozens of cases before. Ways to prevent MRSA spread include washing your hands, showering right after exercising, but without sharing soaps or towels, keeping your cuts covered and washing and drying your workout clothes. As for the Bucs, they`ve had their locker room sanitized and they say they`ll everything they can to stop MRSA from spreading any further.

ANNOUNCER: Is this legit? Islam is the world`s second largest religion. It`s true. Christianity is a largest religion and Islam is second largest with around 1.6 billion Muslims worldwide.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



AZUZ: Some of these Muslims are gathering in Saudi Arabia right now. They are in the city of Mecca for an annual event called Hajj. Hajj is a pilgrimage, a religious journey to Mecca. And making that journey is one of the five pillars of Islam. One of the religion`s fundamental practices. Most years, about 2 million Muslims perform Hajj. It involves several days of detailed rituals, some of them take place around the Kaaba, that`s the large cube shaped structure you see right here. It` s a shrine, and for Muslims it`s the most sacred spot on Earth. Every Muslim who is physically and financially able to go, is supposed to perform Haj at least once in his or her life. Those who do can add Al Haj of Haji to their name.



Your economics classes teach you about supply and demand. Part of that concept says if there`s demand for something and the supply goes down, the price will go up. If the product is something like fish, then a drop a supply can have an environmental impact along with an economic one. In Hong Kong some high tech fishermen want to resupply by raising fish indoors.



(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)



DEAN IRVINE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The catch of the day landed at Hong Kong`s Aberdeen fish market. While this huge grouper is set to make a local dining table grown, the city`s live fish industry is facing leaner times.



MR. LEE, FISHERMAN (through translator): Business? It`s quite hard to do business now because there`s not much supply, they are just not that many fish in the sea.



IRVINE: Yet the demand for life seafood in Hong Kong and mainland China continues to grow: each day, boats unload around 30 tons of fish at this market, with wild fish coming from hundreds of miles away.



MR. CHOI, FISH SHOP OWNER (through translator): Actually, there aren`t many fish from local waters. I think less than five percent of them. Only around 20 percent of our fish docs come from the sea. Most of them, around 80 percent, are from fish farms.



IRVINE: Fish farms like this one have thrived with the decline of wild fish stocks. They are starting to attract some big fish. In a high rise in the city, the science of fish farming is being perfected.



LLOYD MOSKALIK, MANAGING DIRECTOR, OCEANETHIX: So, that there are 80,000 tons of water seating on the 15th floor, of the industrial building.



IRVINE: Oceanethix is operating an environmentally friendly system to grow and keep live fish indoors. Their operation looks like a scene from a science fiction movie, with the blue lights simulating the deep sea.



MOSKALIK: The ones we`re growing at the moment, the most expensive would be selling for about 90 to 100 U.S. dollars a kilogram. Wholesale, prices have been ratcheting up on ten to 15 percent per annum for the past five or six years.



IRVINE: And that means, good business. Live fish are a billion dollar a year industry.

And so, that took me to middle school choirs, middle school performances, church choirs. High school performances of all types. There is different obstacles in life. Yes, I`ve had several, you know, but I get really good advice when I was actually graduating from college, I paid attention, to this long speech and I remember the speaking saying you will all fail, but those of you who get right back up and continue to go forward, will have a career. You know what I love about my job? Is having the opportunity to express myself. This is one of my favorite areas from the opera Cosi Fan Tutte by Mozart. It`s called Una Uram Amorosa.

When they won their crowns district officials said it was the first time they could think of the two students with Down syndrome were named king and queen. Their teacher said he couldn`t be more proud of the school and the quarterback who`s also in the running for king, said homecoming is about bringing people together and having fun. He says that`s what Baba and Simone do.

HAYDEN GRIFFITTS, FOOTBALL CAPTAIN: We`re not doing this because we feel bad for them, or anything like that. We`re doing this because we genuinely like Baba and Simone.

AZUZ: Last week we featured a dog versus three chickens. Didn`t seem like a fair fight. That means this bout should be really one sided. That crab knows its fighting outside its weight class, right?



I don`t know which is more embarrassing for the dog. Being featured on YouTube or being shown up by a crab on YouTube. Maybe the dog`s regular sparring partner didn`t show up. The crab maybe a mismatch on paper, but it`ll do in the pincher. Maybe the crab is just trying to rope the dog in. If so, it`s playing an elaborate shell game. Maybe you can go eight rounds - OK, nine, but if it thinks it can last any longer once that dog decides to let loose, it`s just barking up the wrong tree. Hopefully, those puns don`t put you in a crabby mood. If so, we`ll claw our way back tomorrow. Have a great day.

http://news.yahoo.com/obama-aims-halt-perception-passive-president-074725712.html,,[],Obama aims to halt perception of passive president,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Faced with a trio of controversies, President Barack Obama is trying to halt a perception spreading among both White House opponents and allies that he has been passive and disengaged as unexpected developments consume his second term.

The new strategy, underscored in a flurry of new White House actions, signals an Obama team anxious to regain control amid controversies that have emboldened Republicans and threatened to plunge the president's second term into a steady stream of congressional investigations.

On Wednesday, Obama released a trove of documents related to the Benghazi attacks amid pressure from Republicans. He asked Congress to revive a media shield law that would protect journalists from having to reveal information, a step seen as a response to the Justice Department's widely criticized subpoenas of phone records from reporters and editors at The Associated Press. And he forced the resignation of the top official at the Internal Revenue Service after the agency targeted conservative political groups.

""Americans have a right to be angry about it, and I am angry about it,"" Obama said of the IRS actions. ""I will not tolerate this kind of behavior at any agency, but especially at the IRS, given the power that it has and the reach that it has into all of our lives.""

The president, seeking to have a more robust profile on the controversies, also said he would take questions from reporters Thursday at a previously scheduled news conference with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. And Obama is expected to nominate a new acting IRS commissioner this week to replace Steven Miller, who resigned Wednesday.

The president addressed the IRS controversy on Monday, but his measured words left many unsatisfied, particularly given that he had waited three days to address the developments. He also repeatedly asserted that he was waiting to find out if the reports were accurate, even though top IRS officials had already acknowledged the controversial actions.

Story continues

Adding to the narrative of a passive president were White House efforts to distance Obama from the IRS scandal, as well as revelations that the Justice Department had secretly obtained work and personal phone records of AP journalists. In both cases, the White House insisted the president had no prior knowledge of the events and learned about the matters as the general public did — from news reports.

Obama's cautious response, combined with his lack of awareness about controversies brewing within his administration, opened him to criticism from hisRepublican foes.

""If Obama really learned about the latest IRS and AP secret subpoena scandals in the news, who exactly is running the ship at the White House?"" Republican National Committee spokeswoman Kirsten Kukowski said.

But in a worrisome sign for the White House, some Democrats also criticized the president for not being more aggressive in responding to trouble within the government.

Robert Gibbs, Obama's former White House press secretary, said the president should have appointed a bipartisan commission of former IRS officials to look into the issue of targeting political organizations. And Gibbs gently chided his former boss for using passive language when he first addressed the political targeting during a White House news conference Monday.

""I think they would have a much better way of talking about this story rather than simply kind of landing on the, 'Well, if this happened, then we'll look at it',"" Gibbs said on MSNBC.

The fresh pair of controversies coincided with a resurgence in the GOP-led investigation into the Sept. 11, 2012, attacks on a U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya, that killed the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans.

Congressional Republicans launched another round of hearings on the attacks last week. And on Friday, a congressional official disclosed details of emails among administration officials that resulted in talking points, used to publicly discuss the deadly incident, being revised to downplay the prospect that the attacks were an act of terror.

Obama aides insisted the emails were either taken out of context or provided no new information, but they resisted pressure to make the emails public for five days before finally disclosing them to reporters Wednesday. The emails revealed that then-CIA Director David Petraeus disagreed with the final talking points, despite the White House's insistence that the intelligence agency had final say over the statements.

The White House has publicly defended its handling of the controversies. Obama spokesman Jay Carney has insisted it would be ""wholly inappropriate"" for the president, in the case of the Justice Department matter, to weigh in on an active investigation, and in the case of the IRS controversy, to insert himself in the actions of an independent agency.

However, legal scholar Jonathan Turley disputed those assertions, saying there is no legal reason a president would be precluded from learning about the investigations before the public did or from commenting on them, at least broadly.

""These comments treat the president like he's the bubble boy,"" said Turley, a law professor at George Washington University.

David Axelrod, Obama's longtime adviser, acknowledged the White House could have acted more aggressively in ""the interest of stagecraft."" But he insisted that the president's handling of the matters will ultimately be vindicated.

""One virtue he has is that he takes a long-range view,"" he said. ""It's easy to get whipped up by the frenzy, but it's responsible to react to the facts. It has short-term liabilities, but in the long-run, it's a quality you want in a president.""

USA TODAY

White House says it is %22a complex and difficult issue%22

Obama spokesman says the U.S. is not taking any sides in Egypt%27s dispute

U.S. law forbids aid to countries where an elected official is deposed by a military coup

WASHINGTON -- The White House is reviewing whether last week's removal of Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi constituted ""a coup"" -- a decision that will affect billions in U.S. aid to the embattled nation.

""This is a complex and difficult issue, with significant consequences,"" said White House spokesman Jay Carney on Monday.

Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and other lawmakers said what happened in Egypt last week was clearly a coup, as the military removed and detained a democratically elected Morsi, established an interim government and called for new elections.

They have called for suspension of aid, if only to pressure the Egyptian military to follow through on its promise to hold new elections as quickly as possible. ""If millions of Egyptians come to believe that democracy offers them no opportunity to advance their goals peacefully, it will only fuel violence and extremism,"" McCain said.

U.S. law forbids aid to countries where an elected official is deposed by a military coup. The United States supplies about $1.5 billion in annual aid to Egypt, much of it to the military.

Carney said that cutting off aid to Egypt right away wouldn't be in anybody's best interest. He also said the administration ""will review our obligations and requirements under the law, and we will consult with Congress"" as it reviews the incidents last week in Cairo.

The White House spokesman noted that many Egyptian citizens do not believe that the actions constituted a coup. Many protesters said they back the military and that it intervened against an increasingly authoritarian government.

The issue is ""highly charged for tens of millions of Egyptians who have differing views about what happened,"" Carney said, calling it ""an extremely polarized situation.""

Protesters in Egypt have also taken up the coup question. Said one sign: ""Dear Mr. Obama, Not A Coup But A Rise 4 Freedom."" Other signs have accused the administration of backing ""terrorists,"" in some cases an apparent reference to the military.

The U.S. decision on whether to declare a coup will be ""based on the time-line that is in the best interests of a democratic transition in Egypt, that is consistent with our legal requirements and our national security interest,"" Carney said.

Speaking just hours after more than 50 people reportedly died in clashes between the military and pro-Morsi demonstrators, Carney said ""we strongly condemn any violence, as well as any incitement to violence.""

As White House officials have done throughout the past week, Carney sought to walk a fine line between critics and supporters of Morsi and the military, saying the U.S. is not taking any sides in their dispute. He said decisions about the government in Egypt should be made by the Egyptians themselves.

The Egyptian military should exhibit ""maximum restraint responding to protesters,"" Carney said, but he also condemned ""the explicit calls to violence made by the Muslim Brotherhood.""

Said Carney: ""We call on all parties to exercise restraint.""

The United States' goal is to restore a democratically elected government, Carney said.

When asked if that specifically means the restoration of the Morsi government, he replied: ""We are calling for a return to democratic governance."""

By Global Public Square staff

Last week’s Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit saw the presidents of China, Mexico, Russia and many others in Bali, Indonesia. In the video, tucked away on the far right, you see John Kerry, the U.S. Secretary of State. And where is President Obama? Well, he was stuck in Washington, of course, dealing with the government shutdown and threats of default. Obama missed not only APEC, but also ASEAN, the Association of South East Asian Nations summit, as well as planned visits to Malaysia and the Philippines.

For Asians, the symbolism was clear. The United States was struggling to get its house in order. And perhaps to highlight a contrast, China was present in full force, putting on an exhibition of power and diplomacy. President Xi Jinping attended the APEC meeting and then made special trips to Malaysia and Indonesia. The Premier, Li Keqiang, attended the ASEAN meeting and traveled to Thailand.

Consider the deals that were struck last week. President Xi promised to triple his country's trade with Malaysia within four years. In Indonesia, he promised tens of billions of dollars in investment. And he courted Australia's new prime minister, Tony Abbott, to whom he promised more trade and more cooperation in technology and energy.

And it’s not just trade. A new report from the non-profit Rand Corporation outlines the dramatic escalation of China's foreign aid. In 2001, Beijing spent $1.7 billion dollars on foreign aid. By 2009, it was spending nearly $125 billion. In 2010, the figure rose to $169 billion, by 2011 it reached $189 billion dollars – about 3 percent of China's GDP – and it is still going up.

The money trail points to a country flush with cash, looking to snap up resources and opportunities around the world.

What has been less clear in the last two years is the effectiveness of Beijing's foreign policy. As the Chinese scholar Zheng Wang points out, not a single member of China's seven-member Standing Committee – the pinnacle of power in Beijing – is a foreign policy expert. The country’s foreign minister doesn't make it into Beijing’s 25-person Politburo.

More from CNN: World wants U.S. soft power

And China has made several missteps in the past three years. It escalated territorial disputes with Japan, the Philippines and Vietnam. It was seen as a bully flexing its muscles with its neighbors. These signals, mostly rhetoric, were a contradiction not only of China's stated policy of a “peaceful rise,” but also of its actual track record. Remember: China has actually not been involved in a single war since 1979, when it had a skirmish with Vietnam. But the moves worried its neighbors enough that they publicly asked for greater American involvement in Asia.

This past week, China's leaders were at pains to display a softer face. They described China as a gentle giant, not an aggressor. Meanwhile, they put the focus back on the economy and building business ties with their Asian neighbors. As Li put it last week, “We should make the pie bigger, and share this pie with our people.” It's a smart, win-win move. China's neighbors may worry about a big, powerful giant – but they still want to trade with it.

President Obama's pivot to Asia has been one of his wisest foreign policy moves, well-conceived and well executed. But it, too, has now been weakened, one more consequence of the vicious partisanship in Washington.

So you see a China that learns from its mistakes, smartens up, and moves ahead. Washington on the other hand, keeps returning to deadlock, repeats its most stupid moves, and continues to govern from crisis to crisis. It is a sad contrast that Asia and the world can see."

Special to USA TODAY

EU%27s foreign policy chief says Yanukovych %27intends to sign%27 deal

The West has increased pressure on Yanukovych

Protesters signal they may be unmoved even if Yanukovych agrees to sign

KIEV, Ukraine – A European Union official said Thursday that Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych intends to sign an agreement with the European Union, but some of those protesting in support of the deal said that won't stop their demonstrations.

""If the deal is signed now, I won't leave the protest,"" said Dmitry Zhuk, 24, a Kiev resident who has joined the protests after his workday almost every day since they started last month. ""I don't think anyone will leave.""



Earlier Thursday, EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said Yanukovych, who had rejected the proposed deal in recent weeks, ""made it clear to me that he intends to sign the association agreement.""

The about-face from Yanukovych could help ease tensions after three weeks of protests and building occupations in the capital city of Kiev, but experts and the protesters themselves said that in the wake of a violent crackdown that broadened the protesters' demands, they are unlikely to immediately disperse.

""People want to keep on building pressure definitely until the 17th of December,"" said Orysia Lutsevych, a non-resident fellow in the Russia and Eurasia program at the London-based Chatham House think-tank.

Yanukovych is scheduled to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss a potential strategic partnership on that date, Lutsevych said, adding that protesters remaining out on the streets could deter Yanukovych from signing any kind of agreement with Russia.

Protests have been taking place in Kiev's central Independence Square for weeks, and in the past week, violent clashes have erupted after large numbers of police and security forces tried to clear roadblocks and occupy buildings and the square itself.

The protests were sparked by Yanukovych's surprising decision, prompted by Russian pressure, not to sign a far-reaching trade and cooperation pact with the European Union at a summit in late November in the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius.

The parties have a chance to get talks back on track, but the frayed relationship between Ukraine and its would-be partners in the EU could hamper an agreement, Lutsevych said.

""The main story is that the EU, as always, says, 'We are open,' but they were also disgusted, and I'm sure the trust is lowering every day,"" she said. ""After Vilnius, it was very low, and now after all the violence they used overnight on the protesters … think about it.""

Lutsevych said the violent crackdowns against the protest were ""a kind of tipping point.""

The protesters ""saw that this government is not willing to listen to people and is trying to pretend it's business as usual,"" she said. ""But it's not business as usual for them.""

Zhuk echoed that sentiment.

""At first, it was indeed the protest for signing the association agreement with EU, but after what happened — all the force used against protesters — only someone who is completely ignorant can say, 'OK, now everything will change to the best' and go home,"" he said.

Lutsevych said a pact with the EU would entail far more than an agreement from Yanukovych to pursue it.

The status of former prime minister and opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko, whose arrest in 2011 and ongoing incarceration for abuse of power, which many in the EU establishment view as politicized, sits atop the list of potential issues.

""The EU agreement will not happen until Tymoshenko is released and all these things are done,"" Lutsevych said. ""They may have a declaration of intention to do something, but that's not enough.""

She said she expected the EU to ask Ukraine to make certain changes to the electoral code and to the prosecutor's office. The Ukrainian government is trying to ""divert attention to only economic things.""

On the streets, Ukrainians overwhelmingly supported accession to the EU. There were a few dissenters.

""The protesting students heard a fairy tale about Europe being a heaven, about a visa-free regime and about secure life for elderly people,"" said Anna Shyshkova, who witnessed protests in the southern Ukrainian city of Simferopol. ""But many of them don't even think about the price that Ukraine will have to pay to sign (the) association agreement.

""I don't want a Greece scenario for Ukraine, with 300 billion-euro debt, production quotas and destroyed vineyards,"" she said."

Americans overwhelmingly support universal background checks for gun buyers

Two-thirds back tracking gun sales%2C but there%27s a big partisan divide on the issue.

Gun-rights supporters much more likely to place a priority on the issue.

WASHINGTON — An ""activism gap"" between gun rights supporters and those who back stricter limits helps explain why gun control legislation has proved so difficult to enact, even in the wake of public outrage over shooting rampages.

A nationwide poll by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press finds Americans by 51%-45% say it's more important to control gun ownership than to protect the right of Americans to own guns.

However, those concerned about gun rights are much more likely to place a priority on the issue and be politically active about it. Nearly one in four have contributed to a group that takes a position on gun policy, for instance, compared with 5% of those who say it's more important to control guns. Gun rights advocates are nearly twice as likely to have contacted a public official to express an opinion about gun policy, 15%-8%.

The phone survey of 1,502 adults, taken Jan. 9-13, shows broad and bipartisan consensus in support of two particular proposals:

Making background checks on gun buyers universal, including at gun shows and in private sales, is backed by 85% of Americans, including about equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans.

Preventing people with mental illness from buying guns is backed by 80%, including 86% of Republicans and 78% of Democrats.

Both ideas are supported by close to nine in 10 gun owners, who made up about a third of those surveyed.

On other proposals, there are sharp partisan splits. Two-thirds endorse creating a federal database to track gun sales, but Democrats are nearly twice as likely as Republicans to back the idea. A ban on assault-style weapons is supported by 84% of Democrats but 44% of Republicans.

""My starting point is not to worry about the politics,"" President Obama said at a news conference Monday when asked about gun control one month after 20 children and six educators were shot to death at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn. ""My starting point is to focus on what makes sense, what works, what should we be doing to make sure that our children are safe and that we're reducing the incidence of gun violence.""

He said, ""If in fact — and I believe this is true — everybody across party lines was as deeply moved and saddened as I was by what happened in Newtown, then we're going to have to vote based on what we think is best. We're going to have to come up with answers that set politics aside. And that's what I expect Congress to do.""

What about the National Rifle Association's proposal to protect children by arming more adults in schools?

By 2-1, 64%-32%, those surveyed support the idea of using more armed security guards and police officers. A solid majority, 57%-40%, oppose arming more teachers. On that issue, the partisan divide is particularly stark: 56% of Republicans and 23% of Democrats say it's a good idea.

On some issues involving guns, men and women have different views. Two-thirds of women but fewer than half of men support an assault weapons ban. Nearly half of men but just a third of women endorse arming teachers with guns in schools.

The poll's margin of error is +/-2.9 percentage points."

Boxes and wooden crates filled with household items bound for the U.S. mainland are stacked high in the Rosa del Monte moving company’s cavernous warehouse, evidence of the historic rush of people abandoning this beautiful island.

The economy here has been in recession for nearly eight years, crimping tax revenue and pushing the jobless rate to nearly 15 percent. Meanwhile, the government is burdened by staggering debt, spawning comparisons to bankrupt Detroit and forcing lawmakers to severely slash pensions, cut government jobs and raise taxes in a furious effort to avert default.

The implications are serious for Americans outside Puerto Rico both because a taxpayer bailout would be expensive and a default would be far more disruptive than Detroit’s record bankruptcy filing in July. Officials in San Juan and Washington are adamant that a federal bailout is not on the table, but the situation is being closely monitored by the White House, which recently named an advisory team to help Puerto Rican officials navigate the crisis.

The island’s problems have ignited an exodus not seen here since the 1950s, when 500,000 people left for jobs on the mainland. Now Puerto Ricans, who are U.S. citizens, are again leaving in droves.

They are choosing the uncertainty of the job market in Orlando or New York City or Philadelphia over what they view as the certainty that their dreams would be crushed by the U.S. territory’s grinding economic problems.

“We used to move a lot of machinery into Puerto Rico, and executives who worked in the pharmaceutical industry here,” said Neftaly Rodriguez, whose father founded Rosa del Monte. “Now we are packing people up to go out. Everybody is looking for a better opportunity.”

Puerto Rico lost 54,000 residents — 1.5 percent of its population — between 2010 and 2012 alone. Since recession struck in 2006, the population has shrunk by more than 138,000 to 3.7 million, with the vast majority of the outflow headed to the mainland.

The brutal combination of a long recession, a shrinking population and overwhelming debt has left Puerto Rico’s political leaders struggling to manage a conundrum: How do they tame at least $70 billion in debt while marshaling the resources to grow a shrinking economy and battle corrosive social problems, including a homicide rate that is nearly six times the U.S. average?

The crisis has left Puerto Rican Gov. Alejandro Javier Garcia Padilla juggling competing demands for budget cuts and other types of austerity demanded by Wall Street rating agencies, and the incentives and other spending needed to ignite growth.

“Sometimes, you are between the wall and sword,” Padilla said in an interview.

Not long after Padilla took office in January, Wall Street debt rating agencies downgraded the island’s bonds to just one rung above junk status. Like states, the commonwealth of Puerto Rico cannot file for bankruptcy. Also, Puerto Rico’s constitution offers bondholders strong guarantees that they would be paid before pensioners and public workers if the government went broke.

“I can assure you that Puerto Rico will not default,” Padilla said. “Puerto Rico will pay our debts. It is a constitutional obligation. But for me it is also a moral obligation.”

Still, with Detroit’s bankruptcy filing fresh in the minds of investors, the downgrade ignited widespread concern that the island was sliding toward default, which would hurt many investors across the United States. Because of their high yields and exemption from federal, state and local taxes, Puerto Rican bonds are held by three out of four municipal bond mutual funds, according to Morningstar, a market research firm.

“Some people might say, ‘This is their problem.’ But Puerto Rico is part of the United States, you own this problem,” said Pedro Pierluisi (D), Puerto Rico’s nonvoting representative to Congress. “It is not like you can ignore it.”

For now, the debt problems have done damage mainly in Puerto Rico, where it substantially raised loan costs for a government that has come to rely heavily on borrowing to fund its daily operations.

“You cannot pay daily expenses with your credit card, and that’s what Puerto Rico has been doing for years,” said Deepak Lamba-Nieves, research director of the Center for a New Economy, a San Juan think tank. “We borrowed just to keep the lights on.”

Puerto Rico’s expansive web of debt includes standard government bonds as well as those floated by public corporations, including authorities for water and sewer, highways and electric power. Together, those bills have nearly tripled since 2000, as successive administrations turned to the bond market to plug gaping budget deficits. In addition to the $70 billion in government debt, the government also faces $37 billion in unfunded pension obligations, according to Morningstar.

The explosion of borrowing coincided with a marked slowdown in the economy, and when a lucrative tax credit for manufacturers was phased out in 2006, the island fell into recession.

For decades, Puerto Rico’s economy was powered by U.S. firms that set up factories here that allowed them to tap a large, relatively low-cost labor market and to book profits under the favorable tax laws, while keeping cash-intensive research and development operations — and the accompanying big tax write-offs — on the mainland.

First, shoe factories and textile mills dominated the economic landscape. Later, pharmaceutical firms turned the island into a hub of drug manufacturing. According to one investor research report, 16 of the 20 top-selling drugs in the United States are made on the island.

But eventually many of the clothing plants moved to more promising ports. Then a series of key drug patents expired, contributing to a sharp decline in manufacturing. Since 1996, the number of factory jobs in Puerto Rico plummeted from 160,000 to 75,000.

And while government workers make up about a quarter of the commonwealth’s workforce — much higher than the U.S. average of 16 percent — their ranks are shrinking as the pervasive debt and economic problems careen toward a reckoning. Now, just over 41 percent of working-age Puerto Ricans are in a job or even looking for one.

Miguel Rodriguez, 50, who was working on his résumé at a government employment office in San Juan, said he has been out of work for four years, making it difficult to support himself or pay child support. He noted that his plight is not unusual. “Here, it is very hard to find a job,” he said.

As work has disappeared, more Puerto Ricans have relied on the government to survive: About a third of the commonwealth’s population relies on food stamps, and residents of the island are twice as likely as those on the mainland to receive Social Security disability benefits, according to researchers.

All of those problems were compounded by a housing bust that took down three of the island’s banks, while leaving many Puerto Ricans as deeply in debt as their government. Now pawnshops and title loan operations, which give loans to people who put up their car titles as collateral, are a growing presence on the island.

At a Borinquen Title Loans office located in a former bank branch outside San Juan, an employee inspected a potential customer’s car in the small parking lot, while inside, employees were busy on computers.

“We see all kinds of people here,” from former professionals to out-of-work laborers, said area manager Rosemarie Velazquez. “Business has been good.”

Restoring economic growth is a top priority for Padilla, whose signature campaign promise was to create 50,000 jobs. That would normally call for spending, tax cuts and investments. But his other top priority, bringing the debt under control, calls for the government cutbacks and tax increases.

Since taking office, he has tried to do both. Under pressure from the Wall Street rating agencies, his administration has enacted reforms far more dramatic than those made by cash-strapped states on the mainland.

He enacted $1.3 billion in taxes including increased corporate taxes, a broadened sales tax and a new gross receipts levy. The percentage increase in taxes is far larger than what the federal government has ever imposed, according to Richard Larkin, senior vice president of H.J. Sims, an investment firm.

“To say that Puerto Rico’s tax increase for 2014 was monumental is an understatement,” Larkin wrote.

Padilla also has continued government job cuts begun by his predecessor as governor. Together the two leaders have cut about one in 10 jobs from the public payroll.

The changes have put the government on course to shrink the current year’s budget deficit from an estimated $2.2 billion to about $870 million. The plan going forward is to reduce the deficit by half every year, and totally eliminate it by 2016, officials said.

To bolster the severely underfunded government pension plans, Padilla shifted many government workers from traditional pensions to 401(k)-type retirement plans, while raising retirement ages and increasing employee contributions to the plans. He also promised a series of increases in the government’s pension contributions to fortify the severely underfunded plans.

Meanwhile, economic development officials are stepping up efforts to generate growth on the island. The government has enacted tax incentives and offered electricity credits to entice firms that might be discouraged by Puerto Rico’s electricity costs, which are double the average on the mainland.

Officials also are searching for an operator for a $300 million port project that can handle the mega-ships that will soon traverse an expanded Panama Canal, and they are working to bolster the tourism trade, which accounts for a paltry 6 percent of the tropical island’s economic activity. They say they already are seeing success, including new air routes to the island and commitments to build hundreds of new hotel rooms.

“[Previously,] we were lazy and complacent,” said Alberto Baco, Puerto Rico’s secretary of economic development and commerce. “Now we have to act fast.”

But it remains to be seen whether the government’s actions will be enough to stave off the crisis. Earlier this month, the rating agency Fitch warned that Puerto Rico’s general obligation bonds could be downgraded to junk status next summer because of concerns that the commonwealth would be unable to return to the market anytime soon to borrow more at a reasonable cost.

Another downgrade would be a severe blow for Puerto Rico, effectively cutting it off from the market and paralyzing its efforts to dig out from under its mountain of debt.

If that happens, Lamba-Nieves, the director of the Center for a New Economy, said the federal government could feel pressure to step in with some type of bailout. “Puerto Rico might be a little too big to fail,” he said.

Mr. Pena Nieto’s goal, like those of presidents before him, is to recharge Mexico’s economy by tackling areas that analysts agree hinder its expansion, which has averaged just 2.2 percent a year since 2001, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

Fifth annual U.S.-China Strategic Economic Dialogue now underway

Cyber hacking, theft of intellectual property, tariff wars high on agenda

Analysts: U.S.-China mutually dependent, cannot afford conflict

Thorny issues of unbalanced trade, cyber security and intellectual property rights stand stark in the spotlight at this year's U.S.-China Strategic Economic Dialogue now underway in Washington, D.C.

Top officials from both sides, including co-chairs U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and China's State Councilor Yang Jiechi, have expressed tempered optimism for ""a new chapter"" in bilateral ties -- despite recent stumbles.

The U.S. has slammed China on unfair subsidies on solar panels and the theft of secrets owned by U.S. technology companies. China has returned its own complaints -- most recently after NSA leak Edward Snowden alleged Washington has been hacking Chinese computers.

Yet leaders of both the U.S. and China -- the world's two largest economies -- know their nations are mutually dependent, especially on economy and foreign policy. Should either party try to distance itself from the other, the result would be mutually detrimental, analysts say.

""For the United States, the biggest issue is market access to China and making sure American companies have a level playing field,"" says Fred Neumann, HSBC Co-head of Asian Economics and Managing Director in Hong Kong.

In March, the U.S. Commerce Department attempted to balance the field on the issue of solar panels. Washington slapped tariffs on Chinese-made panels in response to alleged subsidies by Beijing. Under the ruling, Chinese panels were hit with tariffs from 2.9% to 4.7%, echoing similar spats between China and Europe over solar panels and European wines

The biggest technological thorn in U.S.-China ties is ""the respect for intellectual property created by U.S. firms"" -- and lack thereof, says Chris Bronk, IT Policy Fellow at Rice University's James A. Baker Institute.

This includes ""everything from pirated movies and software to R&D and corporate strategy documents"" because ""losses will cut into the capacity for additional development if the return on investment is insufficient.""

In June, the U.S. Department of Justice charged one of China's biggest wind turbine makers, Sinovel, with stealing source codes from a U.S. competitor and manufacturing new machines. American Superconductor Corporation claims Sinovel's theft resulted in $800 million in losses.

The United States loses some $300 billion each year mostly because of Chinese intellectual property theft, said former U.S. ambassador to China John Huntsman to CNN in June.

In addition to IP theft, U.S.-China cyber security issues have come to the fore in the past month after NSA leak Edward Snowden alleged U.S. intelligence agents have been hacking hundreds of Chinese computers since at least 2009.

China claimed Snowden's revelations would ""test developing Sino-US ties"" and exacerbate an already ""soured relationship"" on cybersecurity. Snowden's assertions, on top of alleged Chinese hacking of U.S. firms, depict a clear degree of mutual mistrust. The majority of headlines in China since then have referenced ""strain,"" ""tension,"" and even ""anger"" between the U.S. and China.

The potential and ease for cyber attacks between the U.S. and China will continue to grow, says Andy Mok, managing director of Beijing-based Red Pagoda and former technology researcher for RAND Corporation.

""When every physical object has an IP address ... the return on malicious behavior becomes much higher. So on both sides -- China and the U.S. -- the targets are increasingly attractive.""

National electrical grids and transportation networks are some of the most attractive marks in each country, adds Mok.

""That said, the sky is not falling and I don't believe we are weeks or months away from a cyberwar with China that will leave the U.S. power grid in tatters and the whole country sitting in the dark for months or years.""

The chances of direct conflict are low, agree analysts. Economic, military, and technological disparity between the U.S. and China is too great. China is not ready for a clash to occur. And the U.S. -- still on the mend from the 2008 financial crisis -- is unlikely to instigate a conflict with China because of its own fiscal binds to China.

Sentiment from top officials appeared to underline this. U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew told CNN's Fareed Zakaria China's pace toward market-oriented reforms ""will probably be slower than we would like"" but expects reforms to clearly proceed.

Chinese Vice-Premier Wang Yang penned a positive editorial in the Washington Post hoping the U.S. and China would ""forge a more cooperative relationship.

He noted that 70% of U.S. companies operating in China made a profit in 2012, the 1,500 McDonalds in China have outperformed outlets elsewhere in the world and a flight between the U.S. and China now takes off once every 24 minutes."

Story highlights Germany's Franz-Peter Tebartz-van Elst has been called the ""Bling Bishop"" The bishop's residence in Limburg, Germany, underwent a $42 million renovation The Vatican says the bishop must stay outside his diocese during the investigation

(CNN) —

The Vatican said Wednesday it has suspended a German bishop who has come under fire for his extravagant lifestyle.

Bishop Franz-Peter Tebartz-van Elst is under investigation for his spending after his residence in Limburg, Germany, was renovated for $42 million.

The Vatican says Tebartz-van Elst cannot carry out his ministry as long as the investigation in ongoing, and he’s been ordered to stay outside his diocese.

Called the “Bling Bishop,” Tebartz-van Elst, who is known as theologically conservative, has denied any wrongdoing, saying the cost overruns on the renovation are legitimate because surrounding structures had to be protected, including the old city wall.

But many people in Limburg and elsewhere want the bishop to step down.

“He built his office on lies,” said Limburg resident Patrick Dehm. “This must come to an end. The diocese doesn’t deserve this.”

For papal biographer Marco Politi it’s not that simple. “The Pope is sending Bishop Tebartz-van Elst into exile for two months,” he told CNN affiliate RTL. “That is indeed a punishment, but a lot now depends on what the investigating committee will say.”

Some German media have come down hard on the bishop, with Der Spiegel criticizing him for taking a first-class flight to India, where he visited with the poor. Tebartz-van Elst said that he had gotten an upgrade and that he’s no fan of champagne or caviar.

For his latest trip to the Vatican, he reportedly flew on a budget airline.

He spends much of his time fending off attacks from political opponents who accuse him of having already sold out the country’s rights when he was the nuclear negotiator by temporarily suspending uranium enrichment while under heavy international pressure in 2004.

Hoping to force Iran to stop enriching uranium and begin negotiating in earnest, the Obama administration has imposed tough economic sanctions that appear to be wreaking havoc on Iran’s economy. But if the presidential campaign is any indication, rather than forcing a capitulation, the sanctions seem only to have stiffened Iran’s will to resist.

“Year after year, America has imposed harsher sanctions on us,” said Nader Karimi Joni, an Iranian journalist who is critical of certain state polices. “Now, with these candidates, we see the consequences: the sanctions hurt, but they have made our leaders much more determined.”

The stances of Mr. Jalili, the current nuclear negotiator, and Mr. Rowhani, the former negotiator, illustrate how much Iran’s position has hardened after a decade of escalating sanctions and increasing international isolation.

Mr. Jalili, in particular, has turned the election into a referendum on the country’s nuclear stance, banking on the support of Iran’s governing establishment, a mix of conservative clerics and Islamic Revolutionary Guards commanders for whom anti-Western sentiment is a staple."

In a nation nicknamed the “graveyard of empires,” foreign forces are remembered for what they leave behind. The United States is leaving heaps of scrap in Afghanistan.

The armored trucks, televisions, ice cream scoops and nearly everything else shipped here for America’s war against the Taliban are now part of the world’s biggest garage sale. Every week, as the U.S. troop drawdown accelerates, the United States is selling 12 million to 14 million pounds of its equipment on the Afghan market.

Returning that gear to the United States from a landlocked country halfway around the world would be prohibitively expensive, according to U.S. officials. Instead, they’re leaving behind $7 billion worth of supplies, a would-be boon to the fragile Afghan economy.

But there’s one catch: The equipment is being destroyed before it’s offered to the Afghan people — to ensure that treadmills, air-conditioning units and other rudimentary appliances aren’t used to make roadside bombs.

“Many non-military items have timing equipment or other components in them that can pose a threat. For example, timers can be attached to explosives. Treadmills, stationary bikes, many household appliances and ­devices, et cetera, have timers,” said Michelle McCaskill, a spokeswoman for the Pentagon’s Defense Logistics Agency.

That policy has produced more scrap metal than Afghanistan has ever seen. It has also led to frustration among Afghans, who feel as if they are being robbed of items such as flat-panel televisions and armored vehicles that they could use or sell — no small thing in a country where the average annual income hovers at just over $500.

In Afghanistan, nicknamed the “graveyard of empires,” foreign forces are remembered for what they leave behind. In the 1840s, the British left forts that still stand today. In the 1980s, the Russians left tanks, trucks and aircraft strewn about the country. The United States is leaving heaps of mattresses, barbed wire and shipping containers in scrap yards near its shrinking bases.

“This is America’s dustbin,” said Sufi Khan, a trader standing in the middle of an immense scrap yard outside Bagram air base, the U.S. military’s sprawling headquarters for eastern Afghanistan.

The scrap yard looks like a post-industrial landfill in the middle of the Afghan desert, a surreal outcropping of mangled metal and plastic. There’s a tower of treadmills 50 feet high and an acre of American buses, trucks and vans, stripped of seats and engines. An ambulance is perched unsteadily atop a pile of scrap, as if it fell from the sky. A mountain of air-conditioning units sits next to a mountain of truck axles.

Some of the scrap still shows signs of its previous owners — vehicles spray-painted with American names, mattresses sunken from 12 years of use, bumper stickers from Hawaii or Oklahoma.

A torrent of scrap

The Bagram scrap yard is owned by Feda Mohammad Ulfat, who helped build the neighboring base more than a decade ago, transporting gravel and concrete. Now Ulfat is helping to dismantle the base, taking in thousands of pounds of American scrap metal every day.

“I never imagined we’d be getting this much stuff,” he said.

Not all of the equipment reaching the scrap yard was deliberately damaged: Some was already broken after a decade of use. Ulfat decided several years ago that he would invest in it anyway.

Some of his friends thought he was crazy, but Ulfat had an idea: The expensive American gear could be melted and reconstituted as raw material for an Afghan building boom. He’d gotten rich on dozens of other contracts with the U.S. military, and he assumed that this one would be no different.

When he signed the contract, the scrap metal was only trickling in. But over the past six months, the U.S. drawdown has reached a fever pitch in eastern Afghanistan, with dozens of bases being closed. Suddenly, a torrent of scrap metal was being delivered to Ulfat’s farm. He had to buy more land. Scrap was piled atop scrap. He now spends up to a half-million dollars a month on gear that has been shredded or flattened.

When U.S. officials began planning for their exit, the idea was to ship home the majority of their equipment, especially expensive military gear such as mine-resistant vehicles. That calculus has changed.

The Pentagon has budgeted $5 billion to $7 billion to ship gear back to the United States. But that sum isn’t enough to take everything currently in Afghanistan.

Wanting at least a small return on its investment, the U.S. military decided to sell the leftovers for pennies on the pound. That’s where Ulfat came in.

He has now opened his scrap yard for the public to rummage through. Small groups of men wander around, buying broken air conditioners that can be stripped of their copper wiring or sheets of corrugated iron that can be sold to Pakistani traders. Many of the supplies that the U.S. military used to fight its longest war have begun their second lives in South and Central Asia.

This month, Haji Montazer paced the scrap yard with his son. They were looking for generators that might be repairable or really anything that they could sell in Kabul or Pakistan. One of their customers makes bed frames out of the metal beams that once held up American military structures. Another takes metal pieces — parts of military vehicles and barbed wire — to Lahore, where they are melted and sold as corrugated rooftops for cheap Pakistani homes.

Not like the Russians

Montazer once bought equipment from the Soviet forces, which began their withdrawal in the late 1980s.

“But the Russians didn’t break their things before they sold them to us,” he said.

That bitter sentiment is shared by many who visit Ulfat’s scrap yard. The United States has not publicly explained why its gear is destroyed before being sold. U.S. officials are quick to point out that the Afghan government typically has an opportunity to express interest in American military equipment, which is sometimes handed over intact.

Lately, Ulfat’s dream of getting rich off the U.S. scrap has started to fade. Kabul’s real estate boom is over, he said. All he hears from Afghans are concerns about what will happen to the country after the U.S. withdrawal. His scrap yard tells the story of the drawdown.

“What will we do with all of this? Right now, no one will buy it. And if the future is as bad as people say it will be . . . .” His voice trailed off. “It could be bad.”

Hafizullah, an employee of Ulfat’s who goes by one name, wandered through the scrap yard one day this month, overseeing the latest delivery — a mix of blast walls and carburetors. With Bagram still the most active base in eastern Afghanistan, aircraft flew over his head incessantly.

One helicopter flew particularly close, hovering near the scrap yard. Hafizullah pointed to the Black Hawk and laughed.

“I can’t wait until they start selling those here,” he said."

Protesters waved handkerchief as if bidding government farewell

Austerity measures aimed to compensate for %u20AC4 billion bailout

LISBON, Portugal (AP) — Many thousands of demonstrators held marches in more than 20 cities in Portugal on Saturday to protest against government-imposed austerity measures aimed at lifting the ailing country out of recession.

Tens of thousands of people filled a Lisbon boulevard leading to the Finance Ministry carrying placards saying ""Screw the troika, we want our lives back."" The troika is a reference to the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank, the lenders behind the country's financial bailout.

Many protesters were singing a 40-year-old song linked to a 1974 popular uprising known as the Carnation Revolution. Some waved handkerchiefs in a symbolic gesture, saying goodbye to the government.

""If the government pays attention to what is happening and understands that the people are against them, they should get out,"" said Serafin Lobato, 65. ""If not, this won't stop.""

Portugal is expected to endure a third straight year of recession in 2013, with a 2 percent contraction. The overall jobless rate has grown to a record 17.6 percent.

The marches were powered mostly by young people. Unemployment among people under 25 is close to 40 percent.

The country's largest trade union, the General Confederation of Portuguese Workers, with some 600,000 members, also supported the marches and swelled numbers.

After several years of tax increases and welfare cuts, austerity is poised to deepen as the government looks for another €4 billion ($5.2 billion) to cut over the next two years, with the national health service, education, pensioners and government workers likely to be the hardest hit.

""There is no future without education, there is no future without culture,"" said student Ana Julia, 23. ""We have to protest to get back what they are trying to take away from us.""

The government is locked into debt-cutting measures in return for the €78 billion ($102 billion) financial rescue set up in 2011. More tax hikes this year sliced another chunk off wages."

(Ebrahim Noroozi/AP)

Iran’s economy is showing signs of foundering just as the country prepares to inaugurate its first new president in eight years, with Western sanctions cutting ever deeper into the Islamic republic’s financial lifelines and increasing pressure for a nuclear deal with the West.

A welter of new data shows accelerated financial hemorrhaging across multiple sectors, from plummeting hard-currency reserves to steadily falling oil exports, Iran’s main source of foreign cash. U.S. officials and analysts say the tide of bad news will complicate the task awaiting Hassan Rouhani, the incoming president, but it could also increase Iran’s willingness to accept limits that would preclude it from developing nuclear weapons.

Although many Iran experts think that the chances for a bargain remain small, recent warnings about the economy from within the regime suggest that the nation’s leaders may be looking for a way out, analysts say.

“The Iranian elite now publicly admits that the economy is in serious trouble, and this president was elected with a mandate to do something about that,” said Clifford Kupchan, a former State Department official and a Middle East consultant with the Eurasia Group. “Despite Iranian rhetoric, that can only make the prospect of a deal more attractive.”

Rouhani, a cleric and a moderate within the clique of conservative advisers to Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, assumes the presidency Sunday at a critical juncture in the country’s decade-long struggle with the West over its nuclear policies. The Obama administration, which has imposed a succession of increasingly harsh economic sanctions on Iran in the past two years, hopes to find a more accommodating negotiating partner in Rouhani, who campaigned on a promise of a more pragmatic foreign policy.

But the White House has been repeatedly outflanked by Congress, as lawmakers from both parties have pushed for still-tougher sanctions even before Rouhani takes office. Brushing aside warnings from U.S. diplomats, the House on Wednesday voted 400 to 20 to adopt measures intended to further decimate Iran’s economy by virtually shutting off the export of Iranian oil.

“If President Rouhani truly has the will and authority to make a bold gesture on Iran’s nuclear program — such as suspending enrichment — he has a small window of opportunity before this bill becomes law,” said Rep. Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.), one of the sponsors of the legislation.

An Iranian government spokesman on Friday called the punitive measures “counterproductive” and said they lessen the chance of a nuclear deal.

“There is no doubt that such decisions will unnecessarily complicate the current situation between the two countries,” said Alireza Miryousefi, a spokesman for Iran’s diplomatic mission to the United Nations in New York.

The grim economic reports contrast with a relatively buoyant atmosphere in Tehran on the eve of inaugural festivities for Rouhani, who scored a surprise victory over a slate of more-conservative politicians in the June presidential election. In speeches after his win, the president-elect repeated his promises to expand political and social freedoms for ordinary Iranians, reversing policies that defined the eight-year tenure of his predecessor, the deeply unpopular Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

Rouhani’s aides also have leaked the names of several key cabinet appointees, a slate dominated by veteran bureaucrats and pragmatists who, as a group, are more accustomed to dealing with the West. Rouhani in recent weeks has also repeated his campaign pledge to improve Iran’s economy. Yet his advisers have sought to temper expectations about how quickly relief could come, accusing Ahmadinejad of covering up the true extent of the economic crisis.

“The main domestic issue will be dealing with a bad economy,” said Hassan Beheshtipour, a ­Tehran-based analyst. “Unemployment, high prices, inflation and domestic production are the challenges Rouhani will face.”

Analysts in both Iran and the West agree that the key to improving the economy is finding a way to ease the pressure of sanctions. The only economic bright spot in recent weeks has been a stabilizing of Iran’s currency, the rial, which gained ground based on speculation that Rouhani would have a better chance of achieving a rapprochement with the West.

Throughout Tehran, Iranians who voted for Rouhani said they expect him to honor his promises of “moderation” in diplomacy and in domestic politics.

“I voted for Rouhani and think we have to give him at least three months to see how he is going to implement the promises he has made,” said Bahman Khalafi, 46, who works in marketing.

The sanctions have been blamed for slashing Iran’s oil exports and undermining the value of the rial. But in recent months, new Western restrictions and tougher enforcement have significantly deepened the pain.

Iranian officials last month reported an inflation rate of 45 percent — compared with 32 percent earlier in the summer — while also acknowledging that the economy is set to contract for the first time in three decades.

Iran’s oil exports, which had declined nearly 40 percent by the end of last year, have taken a further hit in recent weeks as Tehran’s remaining Asian customers have cut back on purchases of Iranian crude. And a draft analysis by the economic research firm Roubini Global Economics estimated that Iran’s foreign currency holdings are declining at a rate of about $15 billion a year as Tehran is forced to tap into savings to meet its current budget needs.

Worsening matters for Iran, banking sanctions are preventing the government from accessing some of its remaining overseas reserves, said Mark Dubowitz, director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington-based think tank that co-sponsored the Roubini study.

“Iran is in serious trouble,” said Dubowitz, a sanctions expert who advised on congressional legislation that authorized some of the harshest measures. Noting that Rouhani won the election in part because of popular discontent over the regime’s economic policies, Dubowitz said the “burden now is on Mr. Rouhani to persuade the supreme leader to compromise.”

Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has led the call to suspend the $1.5 billion in annual aid to Egypt, citing long-standing U.S. law that funds be cut off when an elected president is removed in a military coup.

""It was a coup,"" he said Sunday on CBS' ""Face the Nation,"" restating comments similar to those he first made Friday. ""Reluctantly, I believe we have to suspend aid, until free and fair election.""

Later in the day, Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker said the United States should first focus on trying to restore calm in Egypt, where street demonstrations and clashes between members of Morsi’s Muslim Brotherhood political party and Morsi opponents over the past several weeks have resulted in at least 36 deaths.

“Our role right now should be one of applying calm,” Corker, the highest-ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told “Fox News Sunday.”

He also urged Muslim Brotherhood members to “show some responsibility” in reacting to their leader being removed from power last week.

Sen. Jack Reed, D- R.I., agreed with Corker later on the show.

“We have to be a force of stability,” he said.

The Obama administration has not taken sides in the power struggle. Officials ordered a review of U.S. aid on Wednesday, the day the Egyptian military removed Morsi, but they have stopped short of calling the move a ""coup.”

Corker said some of the money goes toward long-standing treaties and that he didn’t think immediately cutting off aid is the best strategy.

“We’ll have plenty of time to assess that,” he said.

Reed said he didn’t think cutting off aid would help.

“We have to be very, very careful,"" he said.

McCain received support Sunday from congressional Republican and Democrat, despite Mohamed Tawfik, Egypt’s ambassador to the United States, emphatically telling ABC’s “This Week” that a military coup had “absolutely not” taken place when Morsi was removed, then replaced with Adly Mansour.

California Democrat Rep. Adam Schiff told Fox’s “America’s News Headquarters” that Morsi’s removal was a “popular” coup, but it also was a military one, as McCain has suggested.

Florida Republican Rep. Trey Radel said on the show that he also “agrees with Senator McCain and Representative Schiff” and that aid should be suspended until specific conditions are met, including the establishment of elections and a free press."

Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, revealed the options in a letter to Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin, D-Mich. The letter was sent as, on the other side of the Hill, the House Intelligence Committee signed off on the administration's call to arm the Syria opposition -- though the committee, which held that up for weeks, continued to voice reservations.

Dempsey's letter, released Monday, went far beyond arming the opposition in outlining potential options. He sent the letter after taking heat at last week's confirmation hearing from Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who pressed Dempsey for his advice on Syria while suggesting the administration had not done enough -- McCain threatened to place a hold on Dempsey's nomination until he got answers.

In the letter, Dempsey gave five options on Syria beyond providing humanitarian assistance, which the U.S. already is doing.

At the least invasive end, he said, is the option of training, advising and assisting the rebels. The next level up would be conducting limited strikes on ""high-value regime"" military targets.

The three other options are increasingly costly and risky.

They include:

A no-fly zone, which according to Dempsey could cost up to a billion dollars per month and would include shooting down regime aircraft and conducting strikes on their airfields.

The establishment of ""buffer zones,"" which would be ""specific geographic areas"" where the opposition would safely organize and train. This would require thousands of U.S. ground forces, Dempsey said, ""even if positioned outside Syria,"" to protect these zones.

A campaign to secure chemical weapons. This would entail destroying portions of Syria's stockpile, interdicting shipments and seizing other components. At minimum, Dempsey said, this would include a no-fly zone and thousands of special operations and other forces to secure critical sites.

Dempsey stressed that these are just options that have been prepared, and that some options ""may not be feasible in time or cost.""

On another front, the House Intelligence Committee gave tentative approval toward arming the opposition.

Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, R-Mich., said that despite ""very strong concerns about the strength of the administration's plans in Syria and its chances for success"" there was ""consensus that we could move forward with what the administration's plans and intentions are in Syria consistent with committee reservations.""

The Intelligence Committee had delayed the administration for weeks from fully implementing its Syria policy, including arming the rebels, Fox News has learned.

Fox also confirmed that a majority -- but not all -- of the Committee members signed off on moving forward with the plan.

House Speaker John Boehner, addressing the Syria crisis on Tuesday, said helping ""the right set of rebels is in our nation's best interest.""

It was not immediately clear how the new policy would be funded although money could be ""reprogrammed"" from other accounts, including possibly the defense spending bill.

(AKHTER GULFAM/EPA)

An escalating dispute between the Afghan government and the United States over customs procedures has halted the flow of U.S. military equipment across Afghanistan’s borders, forcing commanders to rely more heavily on air transport, which has dramatically increased the cost of the drawdown, according to military officials.

The Afghan government is demanding that the U.S. military pay $1,000 for each shipping container leaving the country that does not have a corresponding, validated customs form. The country’s customs agency says the American military has racked up $70 million in fines.

If left unresolved, the disagreement could inflate the price tag of the U.S. military drawdown by hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars because of the higher cost of shipping by air — an unwelcome expenditure at a time when the Pentagon is scrambling to cope with steep congressionally mandated budget cuts and the White House is attempting to jump-start negotiations over a long-term security cooperation deal with Kabul.

The Afghan government’s demand for payment is part of a broader dispute over Kabul’s authority to tax entities from the United States, its chief benefactor. As the war economy that for years bankrolled Afghanistan’s political elite starts to deflate, the government is increasingly insisting that U.S. defense contractors pay business taxes and fines for a range of alleged violations.

The latest fight has added a new irritant to negotiations over a bilateral security agreement that will address the possibility of a residual U.S. military force in Afghanistan after 2014, when the NATO combat mission formally concludes. Washington and Kabul remain at odds over several details of the security deal, including the types of taxes and customs fees that would be imposed on the force and its contractors.

The Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction warned in a letter to Congress last month that Afghan ministries were seeking to collect nearly $1 billion in business taxes and fines from U.S. contractors — an effort that some American officials see as a massive shakedown in one of the world’s most corrupt countries. U.S. funds intended to rebuild Afghanistan, inspector general John. F. Sopko said in his June 28 letter to lawmakers, are increasingly being used to “pay the cost of doing business in Afghanistan.”

Afghan officials dispute the charge. They say that U.S. contractors and government officials have flouted Afghan tax and customs regulations, citing operating agreements drafted shortly after the 2001 invasion. Those agreements gave the U.S. government vast leverage and protections.

A familiar dispute

Eager to boost the country’s aid-

dependent economy, Afghan officials have spent years trying to collect more tax and customs revenue from the international community, particularly the U.S. government. They have closed the border to U.S. cargo in the past during similar spats that neither government acknowledged publicly.

For the most part, the Americans have managed to resolve those impasses without paying large fines — a position they have taken because they fear that paying up would open the door to even bigger fines.

But this week the Kabul government took the unprecedented move of blocking inbound shipments of fuel and equipment for Afghan security forces.

With trucks loaded with U.S. military cargo piling up along the southern border, the top commander of U.S. troops in Afghanistan, Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., has asked for a meeting with Afghan President Hamid Karzai this week to find a resolution. But neither side appears willing to budge.

Afghan officials allege that U.S. contractors hired to transport equipment failed to turn in documentation for billions of dollars in equipment shipped into the country since the 2010 troop “surge.” This month, Karzai’s cabinet came up with the $70 million fine, citing at least 70,000 cases in which the United States failed to process the necessary customs paperwork.

“How do we collect the fines for these violations?” Najibullah Wardak, the director general of the Afghan Customs Department, said in an interview Wednesday. “The only way is to stop all trucks from crossing the border. What else can we do?”

Wardak said the Afghan government has long suspected that vast amounts of gear shipped in U.S. military containers find their way to the black market. “We worry that we are losing a lot of revenue,” he said.

Cost-effective route

U.S. commanders see Pakistani land routes as the best and most cost-effective channel to ship materiel out of the landlocked war zone. Bilateral tensions have prompted the Pakistani government to shut down the border in the past, but the Pakistanis have been largely cooperative as the U.S. drawdown has accelerated, American officials have said.

Early this year, the U.S. military was flying out about 70 percent of its gear as it tentatively explored the ease of shipping cargo out by land. Maj. Gen. Kurt J. Stein, the architect of the withdrawal effort, had expressed cautious optimism about getting equipment out through Pakistan, even as he acknowledged “corruption, taxes, tariffs, all kinds of delays.”

“The tide has changed, and now we’re flying out 30 percent,” he said in an interview in Kabul last month. “Obviously, there’s a tremendous cost saving there.”

In recent weeks, however, the tide has shifted yet again. A Pentagon spokesman said that during the most recent 30-day period, only 36 percent of equipment was leaving by land.

The Pentagon estimates that the Afghan drawdown will cost $5 billion to $7 billion, depending on what percentage of the equipment slated for shipment can leave by land.

In recent months, as U.S. military cargo began to flow at an unprecedented rate down the roads that lead to Pakistan, Afghan officials decided to take a tough stance, imposing the $1,000-per-container fine. The United States did not pay it, Afghan Finance Minister Omar Zakhilwal said.

“The goods they bring in and take out were stopped temporarily because the deadline that was given to them expired on July 11,” he said in an e-mail.

The borders remained closed for six days. Zakhilwal extended the transit exemption Wednesday for one month but denied a U.S. request for a three-month exemption, Afghan officials said.

Officials at the Pentagon did not answer detailed questions about the tax dispute. In a statement, Cmdr. Bill Speaks, a spokesman, said U.S. officials “are confident that the situation will be resolved shortly.” He would not say how.

“We are experiencing challenges with our equipment retrograde at the southern Afghan border crossing points,” the statement said. “These issues are recurring, and typically center around the interpretation of Afghan customs processes.”

The Afghan customs chief conveyed less optimism that a resolution is imminent.

“The U.S. is still not taking it seriously,” Wardak said. “It’s a compliance issue, and they’re not complying with our laws.”

prev Image 2 of 2

A Republican senator blasted the Pentagon after it entered into a new helicopter contract with a Russian company which is supplying the Syrian regime -- even as the U.S. moves to arm the Syrian opposition.

The contract was announced Monday with Russian arms firm Rosoboronexport, for military helicopters that will go to Afghan security forces. The Pentagon argues the helicopters are the only option, but Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, is adamant that the U.S. find an alternative considering the company's ties to the Bashar Assad government in Syria.

""American taxpayers should not be indirectly subsidizing the murder of Syrian civilians,"" Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said in a statement.

Cornyn first challenged the Pentagon over a prior contract with Rosoboronexport last year, and was able to successfully pass an amendment in November barring the use of funds for contracts with the company.

But the latest contract used money from the fiscal 2012 budget, which was approved before Cornyn's amendment.

More On This...

Cornyn said Tuesday that the Obama administration also could get around that amendment by arguing the contract was in the country's national security interests.

""In other words: they want us to believe that we are promoting U.S. security by doing business with a Russian arms dealer that is helping an anti-American, terror-sponsoring dictatorship commit mass atrocities,"" he said.

The $572 million contract announced Monday would purchase 30 Mi-17 helicopters for Afghan security forces, which deals with counterterrorism and other missions. The contract also includes spare parts, test equipment and engineering support services. The contract lasts through the end of 2014.

The Pentagon has defended its arrangements with Rosoboronexport, arguing that the Mi-17 helicopters are ""uniquely suited"" for Afghanistan.

Spokeswoman Maureen Schumann said Wednesday the Russian government has notified the U.S. that Rosoboronexport is the ""sole legal exporter of Mi-17s for military use.""

""The department explored whether there were any alternatives to contracting with Rosoboronexport to meet this requirement, but none were identified,"" she told FoxNews.com.

Gen. Joseph Dunford, commander of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, also said Tuesday that the Mi-17 is favored in part because of its ""simplicity.""

""I can tell you, having watched them very closely here over the last several months, the Mi-17 is actually operating very well for the Afghans. It seems to be going through their operational construct and they seem to be using it very effectively, both for casualty evacuation, to move troops around the battlefield, and in fact, this week we've just equipped it with a weapons system, so it's also now capable of providing some limited fire support,"" he said.

The contract comes as U.S. forces look to hand security responsibility in Afghanistan over to the Afghans.

As for the company's work with Syria, Russia's government has claimed the company's arms cannot be used against Syria's civilian population.

""Weapons do not shoot all by themselves. It is people who shoot from them. Unlike its partners, Russia has never tried to add oil to the fire,"" a Russian official was quoted as saying last year.

But Human Rights Watch claimed last year that Rosoboronexport nevertheless appears to be Syria's main weapons supplier, questioning how the company tracks how its weapons are being used.

The Pentagon contract comes at a vital time, as the Obama administration steps up its support for the anti-Assad opposition by pledging to provide small arms to certain opposition groups. The contract potentially puts the U.S. government in the uncomfortable position of funding a company that is aiding the other side of that civil war.

Despite Russia's claims, a Pentagon official wrote a letter to Cornyn in March 2012 that acknowledged ""evidence"" that Rosoboronexport's arms ""are being used by Syrian forces against Syria's civilian population."""

(Ebrahim Noroozi/AP)

Iran’s economy is showing signs of foundering just as the country prepares to inaugurate its first new president in eight years, with Western sanctions cutting ever deeper into the Islamic republic’s financial lifelines and increasing pressure for a nuclear deal with the West.

A welter of new data shows accelerated financial hemorrhaging across multiple sectors, from plummeting hard-currency reserves to steadily falling oil exports, Iran’s main source of foreign cash. U.S. officials and analysts say the tide of bad news will complicate the task awaiting Hassan Rouhani, the incoming president, but it could also increase Iran’s willingness to accept limits that would preclude it from developing nuclear weapons.

Although many Iran experts think that the chances for a bargain remain small, recent warnings about the economy from within the regime suggest that the nation’s leaders may be looking for a way out, analysts say.

“The Iranian elite now publicly admits that the economy is in serious trouble, and this president was elected with a mandate to do something about that,” said Clifford Kupchan, a former State Department official and a Middle East consultant with the Eurasia Group. “Despite Iranian rhetoric, that can only make the prospect of a deal more attractive.”

Rouhani, a cleric and a moderate within the clique of conservative advisers to Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, assumes the presidency Sunday at a critical juncture in the country’s decade-long struggle with the West over its nuclear policies. The Obama administration, which has imposed a succession of increasingly harsh economic sanctions on Iran in the past two years, hopes to find a more accommodating negotiating partner in Rouhani, who campaigned on a promise of a more pragmatic foreign policy.

But the White House has been repeatedly outflanked by Congress, as lawmakers from both parties have pushed for still-tougher sanctions even before Rouhani takes office. Brushing aside warnings from U.S. diplomats, the House on Wednesday voted 400 to 20 to adopt measures intended to further decimate Iran’s economy by virtually shutting off the export of Iranian oil.

“If President Rouhani truly has the will and authority to make a bold gesture on Iran’s nuclear program — such as suspending enrichment — he has a small window of opportunity before this bill becomes law,” said Rep. Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.), one of the sponsors of the legislation.

An Iranian government spokesman on Friday called the punitive measures “counterproductive” and said they lessen the chance of a nuclear deal.

“There is no doubt that such decisions will unnecessarily complicate the current situation between the two countries,” said Alireza Miryousefi, a spokesman for Iran’s diplomatic mission to the United Nations in New York.

The grim economic reports contrast with a relatively buoyant atmosphere in Tehran on the eve of inaugural festivities for Rouhani, who scored a surprise victory over a slate of more-conservative politicians in the June presidential election. In speeches after his win, the president-elect repeated his promises to expand political and social freedoms for ordinary Iranians, reversing policies that defined the eight-year tenure of his predecessor, the deeply unpopular Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

Rouhani’s aides also have leaked the names of several key cabinet appointees, a slate dominated by veteran bureaucrats and pragmatists who, as a group, are more accustomed to dealing with the West. Rouhani in recent weeks has also repeated his campaign pledge to improve Iran’s economy. Yet his advisers have sought to temper expectations about how quickly relief could come, accusing Ahmadinejad of covering up the true extent of the economic crisis.

“The main domestic issue will be dealing with a bad economy,” said Hassan Beheshtipour, a ­Tehran-based analyst. “Unemployment, high prices, inflation and domestic production are the challenges Rouhani will face.”

Analysts in both Iran and the West agree that the key to improving the economy is finding a way to ease the pressure of sanctions. The only economic bright spot in recent weeks has been a stabilizing of Iran’s currency, the rial, which gained ground based on speculation that Rouhani would have a better chance of achieving a rapprochement with the West.

Throughout Tehran, Iranians who voted for Rouhani said they expect him to honor his promises of “moderation” in diplomacy and in domestic politics.

“I voted for Rouhani and think we have to give him at least three months to see how he is going to implement the promises he has made,” said Bahman Khalafi, 46, who works in marketing.

The sanctions have been blamed for slashing Iran’s oil exports and undermining the value of the rial. But in recent months, new Western restrictions and tougher enforcement have significantly deepened the pain.

Iranian officials last month reported an inflation rate of 45 percent — compared with 32 percent earlier in the summer — while also acknowledging that the economy is set to contract for the first time in three decades.

Iran’s oil exports, which had declined nearly 40 percent by the end of last year, have taken a further hit in recent weeks as Tehran’s remaining Asian customers have cut back on purchases of Iranian crude. And a draft analysis by the economic research firm Roubini Global Economics estimated that Iran’s foreign currency holdings are declining at a rate of about $15 billion a year as Tehran is forced to tap into savings to meet its current budget needs.

Worsening matters for Iran, banking sanctions are preventing the government from accessing some of its remaining overseas reserves, said Mark Dubowitz, director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington-based think tank that co-sponsored the Roubini study.

“Iran is in serious trouble,” said Dubowitz, a sanctions expert who advised on congressional legislation that authorized some of the harshest measures. Noting that Rouhani won the election in part because of popular discontent over the regime’s economic policies, Dubowitz said the “burden now is on Mr. Rouhani to persuade the supreme leader to compromise.”

The International Energy Agency says achieving universal electricity access to sub-Saharan Africa by 2030 would require $300 billion.

Obama said his plan is meant to bring “light where there is currently darkness.”

The Obama White House released a statement saying that the president’s Africa plan “will commit more than $7 billion in financial support over the next five years,” including:

The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) will provide $285 million in technical assistance, grants and risk mitigation to advance private sector energy transactions and help governments adopt and implement the policy, regulatory, and other reforms necessary to attract private sector investment in the energy and power sectors. The Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) will commit up to $1.5 billion in financing and insurance to energy projects in sub-Saharan Africa. The U.S. Export-Import Bank (Ex-Im) will make available up to $5 billion in support of U.S. exports for the development of power projects across sub-Saharan Africa. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) will invest up to $1 billion in African power systems through its country compacts to increase access and the reliability and sustainability of electricity supply through investments in energy infrastructure, policy and regulatory reforms and institutional capacity building. OPIC and the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) will provide up to $20 million in project preparation, feasibility and technical assistance grants to develop renewable energy projects. These efforts will be coordinated through the U.S. – Africa Clean Energy Finance Initiative (US-ACEF) and supported by the recently launched U.S. – Africa Clean Energy Development and Finance Center (CEDFC) in Johannesburg, South Africa. The U.S. African Development Foundation (USADF) will launch a $2 million Off-Grid Energy Challenge to provide grants of up to $100,000 to African-owned and operated enterprises to develop or expand the use of proven technologies for off-grid electricity benefitting rural and marginal populations. In 2014, OPIC and USAID will jointly host an African energy and infrastructure investment conference. The conference will bring investors, developers, and companies together with U.S. and African government officials to demonstrate the opportunities for investment and the tools and resources available from the U.S. government and other partners to support investment.

Power Africa will also receive $9 billion from General Electric and other private companies."

The lower rating of BBB+, down from A- before, was still within Fitch’s scale of debt considered to be of investment grade for bondholders. But the agency gave Italy’s debt a “negative” outlook.

An inconclusive national election late last month has thrown the government into gridlock, and Fitch said it was “unlikely that a stable new government can be formed in the next few weeks.” As a result, reforms needed to reverse an economic recession that Fitch described as one of the deepest in Europe seemed unlikely to be enacted any time soon.

The downgrade comes after Moody’s, a rival ratings agency, late last month warned that the risk of prolonged political uncertainty in Rome could have implications “well beyond Italy itself,” and could threaten the ratings of other members of the union."

PETERSBURG, Russia – President Obama arrived here Thursday for a summit of world leaders that will be dominated by discussion of U.S. preparations to attack Syria and the president’s attempts to find some measure of support from the G-20 nations.

But Obama’s Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, was not there to greet him at the airport and didn’t send a high-ranking delegate. Instead, Putin met Obama as 33 world leaders checked in to begin two days of official meetings of the Group of 20 major economies, both smiling as they shook hands and chatted for just a few seconds.

Putin, an ally of Syrian President Bashar Assad, has expressed skepticism that his government would have launched a reported Aug. 21 chemical attack on the Damascus suburbs.

White House officials said the two leaders had no plans for a meeting, underscoring the dashed hope that Putin’s role as host would bring about a warming in relations and a possible break in the U.S.-Russia impasse over the Syrian civil war.

Putin has been put out with Obama for canceling a one-on-one meeting in Moscow after Putin refused to extradite Edward Snowden, the National Security Agency contract employee who leaked details of U.S. surveillance programs.

Obama was making telephone calls to foreign leaders and will use the summit, ostensibly about economic issues, to press his case for a strike against Syria.

“We would not anticipate every member of the G20 agreeing about the way forward in Syria, particularly given the Russian position,” said Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes, who talked to reporters on Air Force One during the flight to Russia from Sweden.

Obama will, however, “explain our current thinking” to allies and partners and explore what type of “political and diplomatic support they may express for our efforts to hold the Syrian regime accountable,” Rhodes said.

Obama’s first meeting at the summit was with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who thanked Obama for reaching out to him by telephone to discuss the situation in Syria.
