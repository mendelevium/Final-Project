USA TODAY

President Obama hits the road again Tuesday for another in a series of middle-class speeches, and a new offer to congressional Republicans.

During a trip to Chattanooga, Tenn., Obama will propose a cut in corporate tax rates -- a priority for the Republicans -- in exchange for new jobs programs, a prime White House objective.

""The president will call on Washington to work on a grand bargain focused on middle-class jobs by pairing reform of the business tax code with a significant investment in middle class jobs,"" said a statement from Obama senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer.

Previous attempts at grand bargains have fallen through. That includes efforts by Obama and House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, to strike a major debt cutting deal that included both budget cuts and higher taxes on the wealthy.

Some Republicans questioned the value of the latest proposed bargain, saying that Obama has backed corporate tax reform in the past, while Republicans also want to help families and businesses. Republicans also want to pair corporate and personal tax changes so that most people can take advantage of lower rates.

""This proposal allows President Obama to support President Obama's position on taxes and President Obama's position on spending, while leaving small businesses and American families behind,"" said Boehner spokesman Michael Steel.

During his Tuesday trip to Chattanooga, Obama will tour an Amazon shipping facility and speak on what the White House calls ""a better bargain for the middle class.""

The speech ""will focus on proposals to jump-start private sector job growth and strengthen the manufacturing sector,"" the White House said.

Obama is expected to make one specific offer to congressional Republicans: A cut in corporate tax rates in exchange for new investments in jobs programs.

It's the latest in a string of economic speeches that Obama began last week.

The president returns to the White House late Tuesday afternoon for a meeting with Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel.

http://news.yahoo.com/pentagon-most-furloughed-civilians-ordered-back-175149741--politics.html,,[],Pentagon: Most furloughed civilians ordered back,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Pentagon is bringing back to work at least 90 percent of the estimated 350,000 defense civilian employees who were furloughed in the partial government shutdown. The move takes a big bite out of the impact of the political impasse in Washington that has left the government without a budget.

The decision announced Saturday by Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel is based on a Pentagon interpretation of a law called the Pay Our Military Act. That measure was passed by Congress and signed by President Barack Obama shortly before the partial government shutdown began Tuesday.

Republican lawmakers had complained in recent days that the Obama administration was slow to bring back those workers even though the law allowed it.

In a written statement explaining his action, Hagel said the Justice Department advised that the law does not permit a blanket recall of all Pentagon civilians. But government attorneys concluded that the law does allow the Pentagon to eliminate furloughs for ""employees whose responsibilities contribute to the morale, well-being, capabilities and readiness of service members.""

Hagel said he has told Pentagon officials, including leaders of the military services, to ""identify all employees whose activities fall under these categories."" He said civilian workers should stand by for further word this weekend.

In remarks to reporters, Robert Hale, the Pentagon's budget chief, said he did not yet know the exact number of civilians who would be brought back to work but that it would be ""90 percent plus."" He said there are about 350,000 civilians on furlough, somewhat fewer than the 400,000 that officials had previously indicated. If 90 percent were recalled that would mean 315,000 coming off furlough.

Hale said that even with this relief, the effect of the furloughs has been severe.

""We've seriously harmed civilian morale; this (recall) will be a start back,"" he said.

Hale said he hoped that a ""substantial number"" could be returned to work on Monday but that an exact timetable is not available.

Story continues

Hagel had made clear earlier in the past week that Pentagon lawyers were trying to determine ways for some of the Defense Department's furloughed civilians to get back to work.

""It does have an effect on our relationships around the world and it cuts straight to the obvious question,"" he told reporters traveling with him Tuesday in South Korea. ""Can you rely on the United States as a reliable partner to fulfill its commitments to its allies?""

The law ensured that members of the military, who have remained at work throughout the shutdown, would be paid on time. It also left room for the Pentagon to keep on the job those civilians who provide support to the military."

The cuts, known as a sequester, will kick in March 1 unless Republicans agree to President Obama’s demand to a legislative package that combines spending reductions and tax increases. As of Thursday, with the deadline a week off, Republicans seemed determined to say no to any new tax increases.

“Spending is the problem,” declared the House speaker, John Boehner. “Spending must be the focus.” Reflecting the views of many of her Republican colleagues, Representative Martha Roby said Wednesday that Mr. Obama “already got his tax increase” as part of the January agreement over the “fiscal cliff” and that no further increases were necessary.

Both are wrong. To reduce the deficit in a weak economy, new taxes on high-income Americans are a matter of necessity and fairness; they are also a necessary precondition to what in time will have to be tax increases on the middle class. Contrary to Mr. Boehner’s “spending problem” claim, much of the deficit in the next 10 years can be chalked up to chronic revenue shortfalls from the Bush-era tax cuts, which were only partly undone in the fiscal-cliff deal earlier this year. (Wars and a recession also contributed.) It stands to reason that a deficit caused partly by inadequate revenue must be corrected in part by new taxes. And the only way to raise taxes now without harming the recovery is to impose them on high-income filers, for whom a tax increase is unlikely to cut into spending.

As it happens, those taxpayers are the same ones who benefited most from Bush-era tax breaks and who continue to pay low taxes. Even with recent increases, the new top rate of 39.6 percent is historically low; investment income is still taxed at special low rates; and the heirs of multimillion-dollar estates face lower taxes than at almost any time in modern memory."

McConnell accuses Obama of playing politics despite common ground A Senate vote on extending the current loan rate is planned for next week Democrats launch ads in college newspapers criticizing Republicans on the matter

(CNN) —

If at first you succeed, then by all means, try, try again.

President Barack Obama returned to a successful strategy from last year’s election campaign by calling Friday for college students and their families to mount pressure on congressional Republicans to prevent a jump in some student loan rates set to occur on July 1.

“Higher education cannot be a luxury for a privileged few,” he said at the White House with college students standing behind him. “It is an economic necessity that every family should be able to afford, every young person with dreams and ambitions should be able to access and now’s not the time for us to turn back on young people.”

The Rose Garden appearance angered GOP leaders, who contend they have proposed a reasonable solution.

“No one should be fooled by today’s campaign-style event at the White House,” said a statement by Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.

He added that Obama “appears more interested in needlessly stoking partisan divisions in Washington than helping young Americans avoid a higher interest rate on their student loans.”

The issue is both practical and political.

Student loan mess: What’s at stake?

If Congress doesn’t act in coming weeks, interest rates on government-subsidized Stafford loans for college students will double from the current 3.4% to 6.8% starting in July.

Only students taking out new subsidized loans after July 1 would be affected, as those getting unsubsidized loans already pay the 6.8% rate.

About 7 million students, a third of the total taking out loans, would be affected.

Obama said Friday the impact would mean those students needing subsidized loans would have to pay about $1,000 more a year.

When he asked how many in the crowd could afford that, several heads shook “no.” To qualify for subsidized Stafford loans, students must meet an income threshold.

The event allowed Obama to revert to a topic he benefited from in his successful re-election campaign last year, and to divert attention from controversies dogging his administration early in his second term such as IRS targeting of conservative groups and secret subpoenas of journalists’ phone records.

Republicans argue that Obama basically agrees with their approach, which would tie the student loan rate to economic factors instead of leaving it up to Congress. However, the two sides remain at odds over specifics including how fast and high the interest rates could rise.

A measure recently passed by House Republicans would mean that the rate for all new student loans would be about 5% for the first year, but would likely rise in the future because it would be linked to the rate on 10-year Treasury bonds, which currently are low.

Obama’s budget proposal for next fiscal year would hold down rates for subsidized loans to about 3% in the first year, with other students paying about 5%. Those rates also would be linked to the 10-year Treasury bond levels and therefore would likely increase in future years.

The president criticized the House GOP proposal as “not smart” and “not fair,” saying it would increase the burden on middle- and lower-income families to pay for a college education.

He reminded listeners that their pressure last year persuaded legislators to extend the current 3.4% rate on subsidized loans through June instead of letting it double in 2012.

“You’re going to have to call them up again or e-mail them again or tweet them again and ask them ‘what happened, what changed?’” Obama said.

Differences between the two sides involve when the rate on a loan gets locked in, with Obama calling for it to happen right away while the House measure would allow it to rise until a student graduates.

Another difference concerns maximum rates.

The House measure would cap interest rates at 8.5% for student loans while the Obama proposal would contain no such cap but would include a program to limit a former student’s annual expenditures on the loan to no more than 10% of discretionary income.

A House GOP aide noted that the Democratic-controlled Senate has yet to act on the issue, and echoed McConnell’s statement in saying that the House and Obama agree on the principle of tying the student loan rate to economic factors.

Later Friday, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, announced he planned for the chamber to vote next week on a Democratic measure to extend the current 3.4% rate for subsidized loans for two years, which would put off the matter until after the 2014 congressional elections.

The measure would eliminate some tax breaks, including one for oil companies, to pay the federal cost of extending the lower interest rate. Such tax components appear certain to ensure Republican opposition.

Meanwhile, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee announced Friday it was launching ads in six college newspapers that urge students to pressure Congress to keep loan rates low.

He laid out the Obama administration's case in an op-ed for The International New York Times that the failure to replace the across-the-board ""blunt spending cuts"" would hurt the U.S. economy.

""As independent economists and business leaders will tell you, these cuts have already slowed economic growth, just as the economy was getting traction,"" he wrote. ""The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated that by the third quarter of next year, sequestration will have reduced real gross domestic product by as much as 1.2 percent, which means as many as 1.6 million fewer American jobs.""

The blanket cuts are a product of the 2011 fiscal stalemate and subsequent failed attempts to produce an alternative. The sequester is widely disliked but took effect anyways, shaving spending from nearly every piece of the federal budget, except funds for mandatory programs like Social Security.

Even some Republicans who favor cutting government spending see the sequester cuts as too indiscriminate.

""The real problems are that we're continuing to spend money that we don't have on things that we don't need,"" Sen. Tom Coburn said Sunday on NBC.

""There's tremendous amounts of waste and fraud. We have to protect the promises made to American people. And we can do that, but we can do that spending a whole lot less money than we're doing today,"" he continued.

Related: What the heck is the sequester?

The next scheduled round of cuts will be even deeper.

The debt ceiling deal Congress reached this month funded the government at current levels and put off a decision on the sequester until January 15.

But their track record of resolving these issues isn't great.

Lew, however, said the U.S. remains a stable ""backbone of the global financial system.""

""The world now knows we are and will remain the safest, most reliable place to invest,"" he wrote, according to a copy of the text from the Treasury Department. ""Make no mistake: What took place was a political crisis, not an economic one."""

Buy a six-pack of beer in Tennessee and you'll pay 66 cents towards state beer taxes. Yet, right across the border in Missouri, the tax drops to mere pennies.

With a state excise tax of 6 cents per gallon of beer, or three cents per six pack, Missouri -- home to Anheuser-Busch (BUD) -- has one of the lowest beer taxes in the nation.

Tennessee, which happens to be the heart of whiskey country, claims the top spot, due to combined excise and wholesale taxes that push the tax burden for consumers to $1.17 per gallon, or 66 cents per six pack, according to the Tax Foundation's analysis of beer-specific statewide taxes. In contrast, the state's taxes on spirits -- including whiskey -- rank 30th in the nation.

Other states with the highest beer taxes include Alaska ($1.07 per gallon), Alabama ($1.05) and Georgia ($1.01), which charge more than 50 cents in taxes on a six-pack.

Meanwhile, the lowest taxes are in Wyoming, a generally tax-friendly state which levies only two cents in taxes on a gallon of beer or one cent per six pack. Other low beer-tax states include Wisconsin and Colorado, the respective birthplaces of Miller and Coors brews.

Sometimes dubbed ""sin taxes,"" excise taxes are selective taxes on specific goods and activities, such as cigarettes, gasoline and indoor tanning services. Beyond raising revenue, excise taxes are often aimed at decreasing consumption and paying for government services related to the product. For example, gasoline taxes help fund road and highway repairs.

Beer lovers not only indirectly pay a state beer tax, but they may also face a local excise tax as well as a federal excise tax of about 58 cents per gallon (for large brewers), or about 33 cents per six-pack. All of this is in addition to any state and local sales tax that is charged whether the beer is bought at a grocery store or a favorite pub. And some states tack on case or bottle fees and other special sales taxes specifically targeting alcoholic beverages.

Excise taxes are typically paid by brewers and distributors before the beer reaches store shelves so they won't show up on a receipt like a sales tax, but consumers still feel their effects.

""A higher tax on beer is going to make for a higher price on beer,"" said Scott Drenkard, an economist at the Tax Foundation.

The difference adds up. Buy a six-pack once a week for a year in Tennessee and your purchases will have included around $34 for state taxes. In Missouri, less than $2 in state beer taxes would be included in the same purchases.

While the way Tennessee's wholesale beer tax is charged is slated to change in July, the tax rate will remain among the country's highest.

Anti-drunk driving groups and other advocacy groups argue that other states should raise outdated beer tax rates to help reduce consumption and pay for prevention and healthcare programs.

Wyoming, for instance, hasn't raised its beer excise tax since 1935, two years after the end of Prohibition, while Pennsylvania's dates back to 1947, according to Alcohol Justice, a self-proclaimed industry watchdog that argues that all state beer taxes are too low.

The brewing industry counters that beer is already one of the country's most heavily-taxed goods. Including federal and state business taxes, taxes make up 40% of beer's retail price tag, according to The Beer Institute, an industry trade group. Similar to sales taxes, beer taxes are regressive, meaning that they hit lower and middle-class consumers the hardest, the institute argues.

""This is an invisible tax that consumers don't know they're paying,"" Beer Institute President Joe McClain said in a March 2013 audio interview posted on the group's website. ""The people who enjoy beer the most, those middle-class Americans, are feeling the bite of that tax more."""

http://news.yahoo.com/no-compromise-government-brink-shutdown-204618543--finance.html,,[],No compromise: Government on brink of a shutdown?,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Moving closer to the brink of a government shutdown, House Republicans vowed Thursday they won't simply accept the stopgap legislation that is likely to remain after Senate Democrats strip away a plan to dismantle President Barack Obama's health care law.

A sense of confusion settled over the House, both over how to avoid a shutdown and how to handle even more important legislation to increase the government's borrowing ability to avert a default on U.S. obligations. Short of votes, House leaders shelved a vote that had been expected this weekend on the debt limit measure and gave frustrated GOP lawmakers few clues about what they plan to do to avoid a shutdown.

The chaos sets the stage for weekend drama on Capitol Hill, with the Senate planning to send the fractious House a straightforward bill Friday to keep the government operating through Nov. 15 rather than partly closing down at midnight Monday.

Speaker John Boehner of Ohio and several rank-and-file Republicans said the House simply won't accept a ""clean"" spending measure, even though that's been the norm in Congress on dozens of occasions since the 1995-96 government closures that bruised Republicans and strengthened the hand of Democratic President Bill Clinton.

""I don't see that happening,"" Boehner said. Still, he declared that ""I have no interest in a government shutdown"" and he doesn't expect one to occur on Tuesday.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada said the Democratic-led chamber will not relent.

""The Senate will never pass a bill that guts the Affordable Care Act,"" Reid declared.

A partial government shutdown would keep hundreds of thousands of federal workers off the job, close national parks and generate damaging headlines for whichever side the public held responsible.

Washington faces two deadlines: The Oct. 1 start of the new budget year and a mid-October date — now estimated for the 17th — when the government can no longer borrow money to pay its bills on time and in full.

Story continues

The first deadline requires Congress to pass a spending bill to allow agencies to stay open. The mid-month deadline requires Congress to increase the government's $16.7 trillion borrowing cap to avoid a first-ever default on its payments, which include interest obligations, Social Security benefits, payments to thousands of contractors large and small, and salaries for the military.

The standoff just four days before the end of the fiscal year increased the possibility of a shutdown, with no signs of compromise.

The No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, Dick Durbin of Illinois, said that because of the time it takes the Senate to approve even non-controversial bills, if the House amends a Senate-passed spending bill and returns it to the Senate over the weekend, ""That is a concession on their part that we're going to shut down the government.""

Not far from the Capitol, at a community college in Largo, Md., Obama insisted he would not negotiate over his signature domestic achievement, either on a bill to keep the government operating or legislation to raise the nation's borrowing authority.

""The entire world looks to us to make sure that the world economy is stable. You don't mess with that,"" Obama said of the debt ceiling/default measure. ""And that's why I will not negotiate on anything when it comes to the full faith and credit of the United States of America.""

Responding to Obama's non-negotiable stand, Boehner said, ""Well, I'm sorry but it just doesn't work that way.""

Meeting behind closed doors, House Republican leaders encountered resistance from their rank and file over the debt limit measure even though they were attaching a list of other Republican favorites such as green-lighting the Keystone XL oil pipeline, blocking federal regulation of greenhouse gases and boosting offshore oil exploration.

Republicans who lost the presidential election and a shot at Senate control last year are trying to use must-pass measures to advance agenda items that the Democratic-led Senate and Obama have soundly rejected. The last-ditch effort on ""Obamacare"" comes just days before coast-to-coast enrollment in the plan's health care exchanges begins Oct. 1.

Despite the popular items, the leadership was struggling to win over its recalcitrant GOP members, especially tea party-backed lawmakers pressing for deeper, deficit-cutting spending measures. The spending cuts the Republicans would attach to the debt-limit legislation would be likely to represent a small fraction of the almost $1 trillion in new borrowing authority the bill would permit.

""Among conservatives, there's a lot of angst about that,"" said Rep. John Fleming, R-La.

Proposed changes include requiring federal workers to contribute more to their pensions, along with other items from a failed 2011 deficit-cutting effort.

Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, insisted that the House accept the Senate bill.

""Republicans have got to put an end to the tea party temper tantrums and pass our bill without any gimmicks and without any games,"" she said.

In the Senate, top Democrat Reid sought to schedule a series of votes Thursday night to speed the short-term spending bill to the House. Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Mike Lee, R-Utah, blocked the effort, however, saying they wanted the vote on Friday.

Cruz gave a 21 hour-plus speech earlier this week opposing the measure if it is changed to remove the anti-Obamacare provisions. Reid's request sparked a remarkable exchange between Cruz and Bob Corker, R-Tenn., who accused the tea party duo of being publicity hounds who want a Friday vote because that's what they've told outside activists to expect.

""My two colleagues, who I respect, have sent out emails around the world and turned this into a show,"" Corker said, his voice dripping with derision. ""And that is taking priority over getting legislation back to the House so they can take action before the country's government shuts down.""

Schumer of New York said on Sunday.

The news of the day is obviously President Barack Obama's second inauguration, but yesterday on Meet the Press, Sen. Charles Schumer (D-NY) made some news of his own:On Friday, House Republicans waved the white flag of surrender on the debt limit, saying they would raise the ceiling as long as the Senate agreed to make their salary contingent on producing a budget. Technically, that's still a ransom demand, but it's like going from demanding all the gold at Fort Knox to demanding a $5 gift certificate at Glenn Beck's favorite gold e-tailer. Budget documents aren't the same as spending bills—guidelines for spending levels intended to control the budget-making process. They can also include reconciliation instructions, and as we saw with the passage of Obamacare, reconciliation allows the Senate to move forward on legislation without the threat of filibuster.

According to Schumer, Senate Democrats will use reconciliation instructions to provide guidance on tax hikes, allowing the Senate to completely bypass the filibuster. Of course, being able to avoid the filibuster doesn't much matter if House Republicans won't go along with tax increases, but check out this nugget from The New York Times:



A senior Republican tax aide confirmed that Representative Dave Camp of Michigan, the Ways and Means chairman, planned to push forward this year with “revenue-neutral” tax reform, with the revenue target adjusted upward to the amount raised by the higher tax rates on the wealthy approved this month to resolve most of the so-called fiscal cliff. The Republican aide said if the Senate can approve tax changes that raise revenues, it is possible that difficult negotiations between the two chambers could produce a final deal that would produce more tax revenue – but not as much as the Senate wants.

Yes, that's just an anonymous aide, so take it with the appropriate level of skepticism, but I still think it's noteworthy that an anonymous GOP aide is dropping hints at accepting new tax revenues through tax reform. In light of the comments, if I had to guess how things will play out form here it'd be this: The sequester will get replaced by a deficit reduction package that includes some new revenue through tax reform, a matching amount of cuts to Social Security and Medicare (but not Medicaid) contingent on the success of tax reform, and a different set of domestic and defense discretionary cuts to replace the ones in the sequester (which won't be contingent on anything). When that package is done, it will effectively mean the ""Grand Bargain"" is achieved. Republicans will grumble, but won't push forward on government shutdown. The White House, meanwhile, will turn its focus from deficit reduction to other policy areas. Of course, that's just my prediction of what will happen. As always, I reserve the right to be wrong."

House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) has made it clear he cannot muster enough votes from his Republican majority to reopen government with a no-strings-attached funding bill, as President Obama wants, or to raise the nation’s debt ceiling to continue paying the nation’s bills beyond Oct. 17.

Rather than buck the tea party flank and reach across the aisle for Democratic votes to pass both measures, House Republicans have decided to change their focus to the debt limit deadline in hopes of reaching a compromise with Democrats on rolling back the size and scope of the federal government.

Democrats are skeptical that Boehner can make a big budget deal after past attempts at a “grand bargain” failed, and have publicly said they would not negotiate any substantive changes until after Republicans agree to reopen federal agencies and raise the government’s debt limit. That all but ensures there will be no quick resolution to the federal government shutdown, which has furloughed 800,000 workers and closed all nonessential government operations, including popular national parks and museums.

In the last major standoff over the debt ceiling, in 2011, the two sides agreed to paper over their inability to agree by creating a new committee to debate budget changes. Whether they can find a similar mechanism that would save face for both sides may determine whether the government can avoid an economically damaging default on its debt.

One point was clear, though, after Boehner gathered a lunchtime meeting Thursday of his kitchen cabinet: The Republicans have sidelined their demand to end the Affordable Care Act in favor of other long-standing GOP priorities, including cuts to Medicare and Social Security.

“The speaker’s trying to get to a broad budget deal,” said Rep. Charles Boustany Jr. (R-La.). “Obamacare’s just part of it. We’re going to try to get what we can, but we understand that’s the president’s legacy. The bigger problem facing the country, in my mind, is the debt, and the fact that we have entitlement programs that are still growing without end in sight. And we need tax reform.”

The debt deadline creates a pressure point that provides the type of governmental crisis that has produced bipartisan agreements in the past. But trust between the parties has deteriorated to such an extent that neither side has great optimism a major deal could be reached before the debt ceiling must be lifted.

Thursday, the Treasury Department warned that a default could trigger a worse financial crisis than in 2008.

“A default would be unprecedented and has the potential to be catastrophic: credit markets could freeze, the value of the dollar could plummet, U.S. interest rates could skyrocket, the negative spillovers could reverberate around the world, and there might be a financial crisis and recession that could echo the events of 2008 or worse,” it said in the six-page report on the potential effects on the economy of a debt ceiling impasse.

The report also noted that private economists have estimated a weeklong government shutdown could reduce economic output by about 0.25 of a percentage point, with a longer shutdown having a greater effect.

The federal government has never defaulted on its payments, so the closest historical comparison is the debt limit fight in 2011, the Treasury report said. That was resolved at the last minute but led to a sharp drop in the financial markets, as well as a loss in consumer and business confidence.

“As we saw two years ago, prolonged uncertainty over whether our nation will pay its bills in full and on time hurts our economy,” Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said.

Obama told congressional leaders at a 90-minute meeting Wednesday night that he would not negotiate over the shutdown or the debt limit, but would enter into broader budget negotiations after those threats were put to rest.

“Open the government, and we’ll negotiate with you on anything you want to negotiate,” Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said Thursday.

Earlier in the week, Boehner sought to calm some moderate-minded Republicans who appeared ready to end the shutdown by forcing a vote on a government-funding measure that did not repeal any elements of Obama’s healthcare law.

On Thursday, Democrats seized on news reports that the speaker had assured some of the moderates that he would not allow the government to default and would rely on Democratic votes if needed to raise the debt ceiling. Boehner’s spokesman, however, said that while the speaker had conceded he would need Democratic votes, he had not promised to do anything that a majority of his caucus would not support.

Top House Republicans are working on the demands the GOP will make in exchange for raising the debt limit and reopening government, according to those familiar with the internal strategy.

Still smarting from Boehner’s past failed efforts to negotiate a budget deal with the White House, Republicans have shied away from calling any new deal a “grand bargain.”

Rather, they see it as a “big down payment” toward trimming the nation’s deficits, preferring the language of Rep. Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), the GOP’s leader on budget issues and the former vice presidential nominee.

Following Ryan’s lead, Republicans are expected to revisit the components of past budget battles: cuts to Medicare, Social Security and other entitlement programs, as well as reforming the tax code, a long-standing interest. They may also seek to gain the Obama administration’s approval of the Keystone XL oil pipeline between Canada and the United States, as well as pursue smaller changes to the healthcare law, including repeal of the tax on medical-device makers and an end to the individual patient advisory board.

“To me this is much more about the debt ceiling and a larger budget agreement than it is about Obamacare -- that almost gets in the way of the debate,” said Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.).

Cole noted that some Republicans would vote to raise the debt limit, but at a price. “If you’re a Republican member, you can’t raise the debt ceiling and go home without having done something on the deficit,” he said. “I won’t do it just for nothing.”

But Obama has rejected past GOP efforts to cut spending on Medicare and other popular government programs unless Republicans offer new tax revenues as well -- a stalemate that remains unresolved.

They seem equally averse to suggesting the obvious plan, proposing Congress simply nix the ridiculously premised sequester and move on to smaller, more focused budget efforts like sensible people. In part that may be because they know the first side to suggest substantively weakening the sequester will then be the ""pro-deficit"" and ""big government"" side in the other party's pissy talking points for the next decade; in larger part, it seems to be because the administration itself is (yet again) so enamored with striking a Big Budget Deal that they are (yet again) pushing for the Big Budget Deal even when it's not necessary or wise. This was the same dynamic that led the White House into previous catastrophic ""negotiations"" with Congress as to whether or not the nation would shut down or default on its debts, negotiations which legitimized those same Republican threats in a rather stumbling attempt by the White House to reach some supposed ""larger"" agreement that would, in their minds, neutralize further budget fights for a while. The entire premise that any sufficiently ""large"" agreement would result in the other side not asking for more afterwards seems to be the height of political gullibility; nonetheless, that's what happened, and that's what kept happening in subsequent, related posturing, and all indications suggest that we're about to repeat the exact same thing.

So to the White House, accepting a bevy of damaging austerity-premised cuts is still considered a good bargain, if they can either (1) pry out tax concessions from the Republicans, which is at this point a goal unto itself, or (2) if the end result is ""big"" enough that the White House feels they won't have to do this crap again for a year or two. Not inspiring stuff, but again: There's no particular incentive on their parts to avoid the sequester outright. Sure, it'll hurt the economy, but Republicans will be blamed, a deal will be struck sooner or later or even later than that, then boom, victory.

As for House and Senate Democrats? They don't seem to even enter into things. They hold veto power over whatever the administration and Republicans decide to do, but as advocates for any other outcome, they're nonexistent. Again, because ""how about we not screw up the entire economy as political prank"" is right out, from a party messaging standpoint, leaving us only to debate how badly we'll be screwing it up and who will get what portion of the blame afterwards.

It's the precise dynamic of the debt ceiling fight, except this time, if possible, it's even worse because both sides have now fully embraced the rather strange notion that the economy isn't as important as enforcing a little austerity right now and damn the consequences. The fight is between the far right and the Simpson-Bowles right: all good, reasonable villagers agree that we need to screw retirees and others on the economic fringes, we're just haggling over who and how much. (Centrist ""victory"" in these matters will consist of getting Republicans to raise tax revenue after Republicans spent an entire eight-year administration lowering that same tax revenue to plainly unsustainable levels, which sounds like just asking those Republicans to exercise some common sense, and in fact is exactly that so good luck with it.)



So that's why we're at where we're at. The Republicans can't blink without looking like they're backing down on every one of their most cherished and loudly shouted supposed fiscal principles, principles that made their appearance in the debt ceiling fight and which caused this whole wreck of a thing in the first place. That's assuming, mind you, they have enough party unity left to even make a decision either way, which itself is far from a given. The White House thinks that no matter how bad things may be at this point or may get, they've at least finally got a good hand, and that they'll be able to bring Republicans back to the bargaining table after the very real bite of the sequester starts making for some very, very angry constituents back in Republican hometowns, thus finally leading the two sides to a lovely bipartisan agreement on some unknown (and, in all probability, disproportionately small) new amount of new tax revenues.

Sequester, here we come.

There's always the possibility that either side will blink. Even though the sequester is allegedly a Republican dream (Cutting the entire discretionary federal budget by an arbitrary percentage for no good reason? Be still my Norquistian heart!), the Republicans are unambiguously in the weaker position for the simple reasons that (1) the sequester is economically untenable for any period longer than a few days or weeks, and (2) the public is going to blame the jackasses who have been loudly cheering for government cuts when those cuts happen and start to hurt, because duh. Nonetheless, Republicans can't not shoot that hostage, because they said they would.

The White House might also cave for considerably less than their purported targets. Good money might even bet on that outcome, in fact, given the past (cough) history involved. And while I'm not a fan of the White House premise of using this same hostage to again attempt ""grand bargain"" revenue concessions, given that their role in avoiding the sequester is at this point merely advisory, there's not particularly any other path for them to take. True, they could beg House Republicans to simply call the whole thing off, but that argument is an obvious non-starter, so it won't happen. In any event, Grand Bargaining is in the air, God help us all.

So that's that. A very, very large number of Americans are about to be hurt for no particular reason other the Republican (and Officially Serious Villager, we must not forget) demand that we cut government and the deficit right the hell now, full stop, end of discussion. A very large number of Americans will be losing pay, they'll be losing needed services—they'll be losing things as basic as local airports that stay open. The desired outcome of this plan for both parties is to then establish a set of smaller or different cuts, possibly including the dramatic inclusion of slightly more tax revenue, and the prime long-term question is whether this entire process will merely stall the current, tenuous economic recovery or will, in some areas, kill it outright.

Make sense? Of course it doesn't. As an ideological belief, the current sudden-onset deficit fetishism was never meant to make sense in the first place. As with most things stubbornly ideological, however, merely knowing before the fact that it is a horrible, stupid, and clearly damaging idea is insufficient reason to not do it.

http://news.yahoo.com/government-shutdown-poll-134003896.html,,[],Poll: More Americans would blame GOP for shutdown than Obama,"As finger-pointing on Capitol Hill continues on the eve of a possible government shutdown, a new national survey shows that more Americans would blame Republicans than President Barack Obama.



According to the CNN/ORC poll conducted Friday through Sunday, 46 percent say they would blame congressional Republicans for a government shutdown, with 36 percent saying the president would be more responsible and 13 percent blaming both the GOP and President Obama.



The results are similar to last week's CBS News/New York Times survey that showed 44 percent of Americans would blame congressional Republicans for a government shutdown, while 35 percent would place the blame on the president.



When asked if Barack Obama ""has acted mostly like a responsible adult or mostly like a spoiled child"" during the recent budget battle, 49 percent said the president has acted like a responsible adult, while 47 percent described Obama as a spoiled child.



When the same question was asked about members of Congress, 69 percent said GOP lawmakers have been acting like spoiled children, while 58 percent said the same of congressional Democrats.



The release of the poll comes on the heels of the GOP-led House of Representatives vote approving a bill that would avoid a government shutdown but also delay the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama’s signature health care law known as Obamacare, for a year.



On Sunday, Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz tried to place the blame squarely on Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid for refusing to compromise on Obamacare.



""So far, [Reid] has essentially told the House of Representatives and the American people, 'Go jump in a lake,'"" Cruz said on ""Meet the Press"" on NBC. ""He said, 'I'm not willing to compromise, I'm not willing to even talk,' His position is 100 percent of Obamacare must be funded in all instances, and, other than that, he's going to shut the government down. I hope he doesn't do that. If Harry Reid forces a government shutdown, that will be a mistake. I hope he backs away from that ledge that he's pushing us towards, but that is his position.""



Cruz continued: ""Twice Harry Reid has said, 'We won't even have a conversation. I refuse to compromise. We want to fund it all. We want to stick it on the American people. And we won't budge.' That's not a reasonable position. And if we have a shutdown, it will be because Harry Reid holds that absolutist position and essentially holds the American people hostage."""

Our era is different from most of the past 4 generations in that those who have income above any reasonable definition of affluence continue to see themselves as solidly middle class. A successful framing device will drive what arguments must be weighed and compared, and will force internal contradictions into the open. What if we were to take the $113,700 and use it to draw a line in the sand. Above that limit of income you are no longer middle class. And if you argue that $250,000 ought to be the boundary for what is considered middle class, then why not increase the social security income cap to $250,000? And if that anchors the boundary back down at $113,700, then increased income tax rates on those wealthier than the middle class should be under consideration.

PS: I am aware of regional differences. I live in Southern California, and am fortunate enough so that I would personally pay more taxes if the cap on income for purposes of social security taxes were raised. But I still think that it is the right thing to do."

WASHINGTON -- The federal agency that enforces labor law said Monday it has decided to pursue charges against Walmart for threatening and punishing workers who planned to go on strike last year.

According to officials at the National Labor Relations Board, the agency's general counsel investigated and ""found merit"" in workers' claims that Walmart ""unlawfully threatened"" employees for taking part in walkouts surrounding last year's Black Friday shopping season. The agency said that Walmart intimidated, surveilled or punished workers in 14 different states, violating U.S. labor law.

The agency also said that Walmart illegally threatened workers in statements made in two news broadcasts. That charge appears to refer in part to an interview that Walmart spokesperson David Tovar gave to CBS Evening News last year, saying ""there could be consequences"" for workers who are expected to show up for work and don't.

Brooke Buchanan, a Walmart spokeswoman, said the company disagreed with the general counsel's position.

""This is just a procedural step and we will pursue our options to defend the company because we believe our actions were legal and justified,"" she said. “The fact is, we provide good jobs and unparalleled opportunities for our associates. This is our busiest time of the year and we're focused on serving our customers and helping them have a great holiday season.""

The labor board said it found no merit in some of the other charges that workers filed, with the backing of the United Food and Commercial Workers, a longtime Walmart foe. The NLRB dismissed one claim that Walmart violated employees' rights by pushing protesters off of store property, and another that Walmart illegally changed employees' work schedules in retaliation for striking.

The general counsel's charge amounts to an allegation by a prosecutor -- not a ruling by the board. Such cases are often resolved before the board actually moves to prosecute a company, usually through a settlement to which the parties agree. If Walmart and the workers' representatives can't come to terms, then the labor board will file its complaints.

In a call with reporters before the NLRB's announcement Monday, Joseph Hansen, president of UFCW, said the charges were evidence that ""workers who've joined together to improve conditions have been targeted.""

""Walmart is on their heels,"" Hansen said. ""Does Walmart treat its workers fairly? It is a debate that we welcome, and one that we plan on winning.""

An estimated 400 Walmart workers took part in Black Friday strikes last year, arguing that the company provides unlivable wages, scant benefits and erratic scheduling. The UFCW and its non-union Walmart affiliate, OUR Walmart, say they're planning more strikes this holiday shopping season, although they wouldn't estimate on Monday how many workers might take part.

This wouldn't be the first time that the NLRB pursued charges against a company for statements it made in the media. In one highly politicized charge made in 2011, the board's general counsel accused Boeing executives of illegally threatening workers in the press for having gone on strike in the past. That case was eventually settled.

This story has been updated with comment from Walmart."
http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/12/15/worst-drivers-states/4025109/,2013-12-15 00:00:00,[],Which state has the worst drivers?,"Larry Copeland

USA TODAY

Ranking by insurance website says Louisiana has nation%27s worst drivers.

Its rating is based on road fatality rate%2C failure to obey citations%2C DUIs and speeding tickets.

Drivers ask the question every time they see another motorist sending texts while barreling down the interstate at 75 mph, or changing lanes without signaling, or hanging a left on red:

Does (INSERT STATE HERE) have the worst bleeping drivers in the country?

Just about every year, one organization or another tries to provide an answer, based on factors as varied as how many people could pass their state's written driving test, how many citations are written for distracted driving and how likely people are to die in a motor-vehicle crash.

The latest such survey is from CarInsuranceComparison.com, a website for people to compare features of various automobile insurance companies. For its worst drivers rankings, the website compiles data on fatality rates per 100 million miles traveled, citations for failure to obey traffic signals and seat belt laws, DUI infractions, and tickets for speeding and careless driving. It collects data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the National Motorists Association and MADD.

And the winner is — drumroll, please — Louisiana.

According to CarInsuranceComparison.com, drivers in the Pelican State were propelled to No. 1 by finishing in the top five for failure to obey, speeding tickets and careless driving. Louisiana drivers also won this dubious distinction in last year's rankings.

Jeffrey Crews, vice president of CarInsuranceComparison.com, says the ranking generates lots of conversation and debate. ""There are several reasons for that,"" he says. ""One, it's the holiday season. People are traveling, and that comes into play. Plus, this is something that always comes up. Somebody is always saying, 'This is a horrible state to drive in.' And they can take this and say 'I told you so.'

""Plus, people use it as a little prod to kind of jab at each other,"" he says.

These kinds of rankings are seldom purely scientific, but they sure get people talking.

A 2011 ranking by GMAC Insurance (now National General Insurance) found that some of the nation's worst drivers weren't in a state at all but in Washington, D.C. The insurer based its rankings on how well — or how little — drivers understood rules of the road where they lived. It found that just 71% of drivers in the nation's capital were capable of passing a written driving test.

A 2010 ranking by The Daily Beast analyzed federal crash data and weighed fatal crashes in which driver error — such as DUI, running a stop sign or inattentive driving — was a factor. It found the worst drivers were in North Dakota, followed by Montana, Kentucky and Louisiana.

Another recent report, insurer Allstate's ninth annual ""America's Best Drivers Report"" in August, found that the USA's best drivers, based on Allstate crash claims data, are in Fort Collins, Colo.

The Best Drivers Report ""was created to boost the country's discussion on safe driving,"" according to Michael Roche, the company's senior vice president of claims. ""Best Drivers has generated a lot of attention, which we think is a very good thing.""

The CarInsuranceComparison.com report has neither New Jersey nor New York in the top 10, which is going to be shocking for people such as David Alston, a New Jersey school bus driver who has long argued that his state, along with New York, wins the title hands-down.

Alston, who has logged more than 230,000 miles in each of his last two personal vehicles, says he has seen it all: In 2004, a drunk motorcyclist killed himself when he slammed into Alston's car at 65 mph, just months after Alston's mother was hit by an unlicensed driver in Montclair; he saw a motorcyclist decapitated in a crash near Newark International Airport.

""I see people driving with no lights on in pitch black, in snow, rain, fog,"" he says. ""People tailgate me on my school bus. People blow through stop signs. It's unbelievable. New Jersey's got to be No. 1 or No. 2 for worst drivers.""

States with the worst drivers:

1. Louisiana

2. South Carolina

3. Mississippi

4. Texas

5. Alabama

6. Florida

7. Missouri (tie)

7. North Carolina (tie)

9. Montana

""You mean the groups that came out and opposed it before they ever saw it?"" he said in a response to a reporter's question.

Before the deal was even announced on Tuesday, Heritage Action and Americans For Prosperity stated their opposition to it. Following the announcement, Club For Growth said it would oppose the deal and include it on its congressional scorecard.

""They're using our members and they're using the American people for their own goals. This is ridiculous,"" Boehner said loudly. ""Listen, if you're for more deficit reduction, you're for this agreement.""

The deal reached by House Budget Chair Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Senate Budget Chair Patty Murray (D-Wash.) modestly raises spending levels from $967 billion to $1.014 trillion by 2015, counteracting approximately one-third of sequestration cuts. It also reduces the deficit by $20 to $23 billion by hiking airline fees and requiring federal workers and military personnel to kick in more for their pensions.

Boehner's tone toward the conservative groups was unusually aggressive, a further signal that he wants the deal to pass the House Republican caucus, where the groups hold sway among members.

Levi Russell, Director of Public Affairs for Americans For Prosperity, responded to Boehner's comments. ""AFP stood with House Republicans earlier this spring when they passed modest spending limits set by the sequester,"" Russell said. ""That bipartisan agreement was signed by President Obama and set spending levels at $967 billion. It’s disappointing to see leadership give up even those modest gains with nothing to show for it.""

“Americans are deeply concerned about the direction of the country. Over the next few days, lawmakers will have to explain to their constituents, many of whom are our members, what they’ve achieved by increasing spending, increasing taxes and offering up another round of promises waiting to be broken. That will be a really tough sell back home,"" said Dan Holler, communications director for Heritage Action.

Club For Growth released a statement as well. ""We stand with Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, Tom Coburn, Rand Paul, members of the Republican Study Committee and every other fiscal conservative who opposes the Ryan-Murray deal,” said the group's president, Chris Chocola. “After carefully reviewing the budget deal, on which we never commented until it was complete, we determined that it would increase the size of government. We support pro-growth proposals when they are considered by Congress. In our evaluation, this isn’t one of those.”"

You know the drill: it’s yet another “reboot” that will go nowhere; none of it will have any effect on policy, and so on. But before we talk about the speech’s possible political impact or lack thereof, shouldn’t we look at the substance? Was what the president said true? Was it new? If the answer to these questions is yes — and it is — then what he said deserves a serious hearing.

And once you realize that, you also realize that the speech may matter a lot more than the cynics imagine.

First, about those truths: Mr. Obama laid out a disturbing — and, unfortunately, all too accurate — vision of an America losing touch with its own ideals, an erstwhile land of opportunity becoming a class-ridden society. Not only do we have an ever-growing gap between a wealthy minority and the rest of the nation; we also, he declared, have declining mobility, as it becomes harder and harder for the poor and even the middle class to move up the economic ladder. And he linked rising inequality with falling mobility, asserting that Horatio Alger stories are becoming rare precisely because the rich and the rest are now so far apart.

This isn’t entirely new terrain for Mr. Obama. What struck me about this speech, however, was what he had to say about the sources of rising inequality. Much of our political and pundit class remains devoted to the notion that rising inequality, to the extent that it’s an issue at all, is all about workers lacking the right skills and education. But the president now seems to accept progressive arguments that education is at best one of a number of concerns, that America’s growing class inequality largely reflects political choices, like the failure to raise the minimum wage along with inflation and productivity."
http://news.yahoo.com/public-tours-white-house-resume-nov-5-195950760--politics.html,,[],Public tours of White House to resume Nov. 5,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Public tours of the White House, canceled earlier this year because of budget cuts, are resuming next month on a limited basis.

The self-guided tours of the ground floor, first floor and East Wing of the White House are to resume Nov. 5 and continue through Jan. 15. Tours will be allowed an average of three days a week, down from five, said the Secret Service, which is responsible for White House security.

Separately, the White House said its gardens and grounds will be open to the public on the weekend of Oct. 26-27.

The White House scrapped the tours after mandatory budget cuts took effect in March. The cuts, known as sequestration, affected many government departments and agencies, including the Secret Service, which then told the White House its options included cutting the tours or furloughing officers as a result.

Uniformed Secret Service officers are stationed in rooms along the tour to provide security and help tourists.

The Secret Service said Friday that the tours can resume at a reduced pace under a temporary funding bill President Barack Obama signed early Thursday for the budget year that began Oct. 1. The bill fully reopened the government after a 16-day partial shutdown brought on by a spending impasse between the Obama administration and Congress.

That funding runs out Jan. 15, same as the tours, which raises the possibility that the tours could be reduced or canceled again if Obama and lawmakers can't agree on spending for the remainder of the budget year.

""Last year's sequestration came midway through the fiscal year, and we were unable to adjust or reallocate remaining funding to continue tours while still ensuring enough funding remained to meet all operational needs and avoid furloughing our employees,"" said Secret Service spokesman George Ogilvie. In light of the new fiscal year, Ogilvie said the agency was confident that the tours can operate at a reduced level while still meeting operational requirements.

Story continues

Republicans, led by House Speaker John Boehner, had needled the White House over its decision to cancel the tours. Boehner said alternative spending cuts helped keep the Capitol open to the public and he wished the White House had figured out how to do the same.

House Republicans also produced a video of stops on the Capitol tour that ended with this line: ""This is your house. Tour it.""

Members of the public who want free tickets for public tours of the White House should contact their representatives in Congress. The green, red and blue rooms, the State Dining Room and the East Room are among the stops on that tour.

Free tickets for the White House garden tours at the end of October will be distributed on a first-come, first-serve basis each morning of the tour at the visitor pavilion on the Ellipse near the White House. Visitors will be able to visit the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden, the Rose Garden, the South Lawn and first lady Michelle Obama's vegetable garden.

In the first six months of the year, as German armies swept across northern Europe, President Franklin D. Roosevelt sent Congress a series of military spending requests, each bigger than the last. On May 16, the president asked for $1.2 billion; on May 30, he asked for another $1.3 billion.

Joe Thorndike is a contributing editor at Tax Analysts and a columnist for Tax Notes magazine.

Congress began debating a variety of ways to pay for the country's military buildup, and the individual income tax quickly emerged as the most likely source of new money. Support for exempting less income, and thus imposing higher taxes, cut across the political spectrum; even many liberals, led by FDR, embraced the idea.

The enormous funding needs of World War II would soon transform the income tax from a ""class tax"" to a ""mass tax."" Throughout the New Deal, tax burdens had been very light or even non-existent on lower- and middle-income Americans, and Roosevelt emphasized income taxes on the very rich. Now he would push to raise taxes on a much broader swath of workers.

Revenue was one reason. But as the war became a reality for Americans, the notion of shared sacrifice emerged as another main justification for higher taxes.

""A part of the sacrifice means the payment of more money in taxes,"" Roosevelt warned in 1941.

The income tax, enacted 100 years ago, was the nation's most famous tax, and one deeply rooted in notions of social justice. Its annual filing requirement made a connection between the taxpayer and his government -- a connection absent from most sales and consumption taxes.

Notions of fairness and sacrifice were also tied up with tax visibility. Tax experts had long contended that people should be aware of the taxes they paid. Such awareness encouraged scrutiny of public affairs and left taxpayers more attuned to the costs of democratic governance.

As America's involvement in World War II deepened, all taxpayers faced a heavier burden.

The average effective rate for the top 1% of taxpayers climbed from roughly 20% in 1940 to almost 60% in 1944. On the other end of the scale, the marginal tax rate in the bottom bracket in 1940 was 4.4% and it began after an $800 exemption for individuals. In 1944, the exemption was $500 and the rate was 23%.

The war years also brought the Victory Tax, a short-lived income tax that bolstered the regular income levy by taxing Americans near the bottom of the income scale.

The Victory Tax was most notable, however, for an innovation it brought to the federal tax system: withholding. The tax was deducted directly from both salaries and wages. That ensured that taxpayers would remain current with their obligations and gave the Treasury Department quick access to new revenue.

Until it became a ""mass tax,"" the income tax was administered without withholding.

Treasury officials used a massive public relations campaign to advise new taxpayers of their fiscal responsibilities. Posters, radio announcements, popular songs and even a Donald Duck cartoon drove home the new tax filing requirements. Officials stressed that millions of previously exempt Americans now had to file returns.

Withholding changed the income tax forever. It made the levy more responsive and flexible, both reflecting and facilitating its conversion into a powerful economic tool. Moreover, as one legal historian has pointed out, it helped create a taxpaying culture, getting Americans comfortable with regular deductions from their paychecks. No small feat in an era when such deductions were all but unknown.

In the end, the exemption cuts of World War II totaled just $500 for individuals, but they transformed the nature of the American state and society. Similarly, the rate changes, while often simply a matter of adjusting numbers in a table, were enormously important to the taxpayers who suddenly found themselves with marginal tax rates over 90%.

In many vital respects, the wartime tax regime broke with the history of New Deal revenue reform. Almost overnight, the income tax had ""changed its morning coat for overalls."" Millions of middle-class Americans unaccustomed to paying direct taxes to Washington joined the tax rolls for the first time.

Sunday marks the 100th anniversary of the ratification of the Constitution's 16th Amendment, which ushered in the modern federal income tax. This commentary by historian Joseph J. Thorndike is adapted from his new book, Their Fair Share: Taxing the Rich in the Age of FDR (Urban Institute Press)."

Boehner worked behind the scenes to win support from Senate Republicans.

And with a public showdown looming, undecided Republicans opted on Monday to get off the fence. Even some Republicans who had privately signaled opposition last week were coming around, convinced a deal that passed the House 332-94, with a strong majority of Republicans behind it, could not be derailed in the Senate.

“Much more work needs to be done to address the No. 1 drivers of our country’s debt — our entitlement programs. But my hope is that this budget agreement paves the way to greater stability, lasting deficit reduction, and the political will to tackle those challenges in the near future,” Mr. Hatch wrote in a statement.

Under the budget deal, spending on defense and nondefense programs would rise from the $967 billion slated for this fiscal year to $1.012 trillion, mitigating the impact of across-the-board spending cuts and allowing congressional lawmakers to draft detailed spending plans for the first time in several years. Spending in fiscal 2015, which begins Oct. 1, would rise from $995 billion to $1.014 trillion. Though total spending would rise $63 billion over 10 years, the measure would trim the deficit slightly.

Opponents had initially seized on the notion that immediate spending increases would be more than offset by savings spaced over 10 years, with much of those savings in 2021 and 2022. But some Senate Republicans have now pinned their opposition to $6 billion in cuts to military pensions — cuts that have incensed some veterans groups.

Senators Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Roger Wicker of Mississippi, all Republicans, will bring military families to the Senate on Tuesday to protest the cuts. Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, the ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, complained of “a real hit to military retirements,” and said the measure did not do enough to reduce the deficit.

But Mr. Ryan has defended the cuts as extremely modest. Under the plan, veterans of working age would see the cost-of-living increases to their pensions trimmed by 1 percent until age 62. At that point, their pensions would get a one-time boost so that payments during retirement would be the same as if there had been no cuts."

http://news.yahoo.com/survey-many-conflicted-govt-spending-cuts-201117576--politics.html,,[],Survey: Many conflicted on gov't spending cuts,"WASHINGTON (AP) — As President Barack Obama and lawmakers spar over huge federal deficits, they're confronted by a classic contradiction: Most Americans want government austerity, a survey shows, but they also want increased spending on a host of popular programs: education, crime fighting, health care, Social Security, the environment and more. Less for defense, space and foreign aid.

The newly released General Social Survey asked people whether they believe spending in specific categories is ""too much,"" ''too little"" or ""about right."" It covers the public's shifting priorities from 1973, when Richard Nixon was president, through 2012 with Obama in the White House.

""Despite a dislike of taxes, more people have always favored increases in spending than cuts,"" wrote the survey's director, Tom W. Smith, of the independent research organization NORC at the University of Chicago.

While people's priorities shift over the years, they've not changed on one category. Foreign aid has been stuck firmly in last place since the survey began. Last year, 65 percent of those surveyed thought there was ""too much,"" 25 percent checked ""about right"" and a slim 11 percent said ""too little."" The numbers are not much changed from 1973 — when 73 percent said too much on foreign aid, 22 percent just right and 5 percent too little.

Various polls have consistently shown the public believes foreign aid is a far bigger slice of the spending pie than it actually is.

Foreign aid amounts to loose change, hovering for years at 1 percent or less of the federal budget, compared with defense spending and ""entitlement"" programs like Social Security and Medicare. Those are among the biggest deficit drivers and a focal point in Washington's recent budget debates. The survey shows the public is largely opposed to cuts in entitlement programs but tilts toward cuts in the defense budget.

To reach all these conclusions, Smith devised an index that boils down his findings to a single number for each category. If everyone favored more spending for a given program area, the maximum score would be +100; and if everyone wanted less spending, the score would be a negative number, -100.

Story continues

On this scale, top-ranked ""improving education"" in 2012 scored +68.4 while bottom-rated foreign aid scored a -60.4.

Support for defense spending has swung back and forth between negative and positive over four decades. It posted a -28.4 in 1973 near the end of the politically divisive Vietnam War, turned positive in 1978 and peaked at +48.9 in 1980. It returned to negative territory from 1983 to 2000. But after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorism attacks and the start of the war in Afghanistan, support for more defense spending again went positive — through 2004. But it turned negative again as U.S. military involvement in Iraq increased and has been negative ever since.

Conversely, Social Security has always been in positive territory. Most people have favored increased spending on this program since the mid-80s, with the exception of 1993 and 1994.

On other issues: Most Americans in the poll favored increased spending for assistance to the poor (64 percent), improving the nation's health (61 percent) and Social Security (56 percent). Most also favored greater spending on domestic and social issues including education (76 percent), developing alternative energy sources (62 percent), reducing the crime rate (59 percent), improving the environment (57 percent) and dealing with drug addiction (56 percent).

Despite all this support for increasing spending, the survey found that 52 percent believed their own federal income taxes last year were too high, 46 percent said about right and just 3 percent said too low.

Taxes are a sore point in efforts to strike a deficit-reduction deal on Capitol Hill. The president insists any new package must contain a mix of spending cuts and new revenues from limiting tax deductions benefiting the wealthy. Republicans, especially those who control the House, adamantly oppose new taxes on the wealthy and corporations.

Of the 23 categories in the survey, only five received negative scores — foreign aid (-60.4), welfare (-28.5), assistance to big cities (-23.4), space exploration (-9.0) and defense spending (-6.3)

If the people participating in the survey were to make federal budget decisions, those five programs presumably would be the only ones to see their spending slashed. The other 18 would get more money.

Those surveyed last year also wanted more government spending on: nonwelfare assistance to the poor (+53.8), fighting crime (+51.9), Social Security (+47.6), health programs (+46.3), protecting the environment (+45.9), drug rehabilitation (+43.5), highways and bridges (+29.9), solving problems of big cities (+24.1) and improving the condition of blacks (+21).

""The net numbers have always been positive, meaning they want to spend more on things. And the vast majority of them are things that are pretty good: education, health, highways,"" Smith said in an interview. ""The average — when asked about specific programs — is pro-government spending and always has been. It's gone up and down as to how pro they are. The pro-spending edge is a little weaker now than it was at its peak.""

Some changes in national priorities are generationally driven and the aging of baby boomers is an important factor as more and more retire.

""The retirees generally think things are about right. Pre-retirees are the group most likely to say (spending on Social Security) is too low. And the youngest generation is the least concerned about putting money into Social Security,"" Smith said.

In other findings:

— Now in second place for more spending, assistance to the poor has rebounded from its 10th place finish in 1996.

— After a first-place rank in 2004, spending on health programs slipped to sixth place in 2012.

— Halting crime was a top favorite for increased government spending from 1974 to 1988 and regained first place in 1993 and 1994. But after 1994, it dropped from +71.4 to +50.6 in 2002 — still a strong positive but the lowest for the category ever posted in the survey. In 2012, crime-fighting finished in third place at +51.6.

The General Social Survey is conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago with principal funding from the National Science Foundation. Data were collected between March and early September 2012 in face-to-face interviews with 1,974 randomly selected U.S. adults. The margin of sampling error varies for questions within the survey, but for most, it is plus or minus 3 percentage points.

Now under the protection of her lawyers and the Fifth Amendment, Lois Lerner is facing a maelstrom of controversy.

Members of Congress are calling her evasive, and question why she didn't reveal the program sooner -- plus her history at the Federal Elections Commission is coming under scrutiny.

Lerner touched off the public controversy when, at an American Bar Association conference earlier this month, she apologized for the IRS' practice of targeting conservative organizations for additional scrutiny. It was the first time the agency acknowledged the practice.

""They used names like Tea Party or patriots ... and they selected cases simply because the application had those names in the title,"" she admitted.

She said she hadn't revealed the information sooner, because she was never asked. But just two days before the ABA conference, Lerner was specifically asked about the investigation.

Rep. Joseph Crowley, D-N.Y., asked her if she could ""comment briefly on the status on the IRS investigation into these political not-for-profits.""

She said: ""Well there's a questionnaire that began this discussion and there's also a questionnaire out there that is seeking info from 501 c3,4,5 organizations.""

Crowley later called her answer evasive.

""The bottom line is you cannot lie to Congress, and you cannot be evasive, you cannot try to mislead Congress,"" he said.

In the 1990's, Lerner also served as chief of enforcement at the Federal Elections Commission.

Under her direction, the FEC undertook the largest enforcement action in its history -- suing the Christian Coalition for violating campaign laws. The Christian Coalition won, but in one deposition, FEC lawyers asked a defendant if televangelist Pat Robertson prayed for him.

James Bopp, the Christian Coalition's lawyer, said he was ""shocked and appalled"" by that.

""Both political activity and religious activity are specifically protected by the First Amendment,"" he said.

When Bopp learned years later that Lerner had been promoted to an IRS position, he became concerned.

""She was in effect being promoted for what she had done at the Federal Election Commission and now was going to be expected ... to replicate that at the IRS and now we know that's exactly what happened,"" he said.

Lerner is represented by lawyer William W. Taylor, who is noted for winning a dismissal of all charges against former IMF director Dominique Strauss-Kahn in a high-profile sexual assault case.

Lerner said at Wednesday's hearing that she had done nothing wrong.

""I have not done anything wrong,"" she said. ""I have not broken any laws. I have not violated any IRS rules or regulations, and I have not provided false information to this or any other congressional committee."""

In a fundraising email to supporters, Tea Party Patriots referred to the Ohio Republican as a ""ruling class politician"" who only pretends to be a conservative while remaining a ""tax-and-spend liberal,"" The Hill reported Friday.

The group, which supported efforts to defund the Affordable Care Act, accused Boehner of passing a ""back-room budget deal which increases discretionary spending, does nothing to reform entitlements, and fully funds ObamaCare.""

The organization called the deal ""an out and out betrayal of the American people.""

All three top Republican leaders were among 169 members of the rank and file in voting for the measure, which cleared the House on Tuesday on an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 332-94.

In advance of the vote, Boehner unleashed a stinging attack on conservative groups campaigning for the bill's demise, saying they lacked credibility. He also blamed them for leading the party into the partial government shutdown this fall.

Boehner's remarks appeared aimed more broadly at Tea Partyers who say true conservatives never compromise, and at groups that try to oust established Republicans seeking re-election.

House actions under his speakership, Boehner said, ""have not violated any conservative principle, not once."" He then dismissed the activist groups, saying, ""I don't care what they do.""

Overall, the bipartisan budget plan erases a total of $63 billion in across-the-board cuts in the next two budget years, and specifies $85 billion in savings over a decade, including the one relating to military retirement. The result is a net $23 billion cut in deficits through 2023, although critics argue the spending increases will happen first, and many of the savings years later, if at all.

By raising spending levels, the bill is also designed to eliminate the threat of another budget shutdown like the one this fall.

Groups such as Heritage Action, the Club for Growth and Americans for Prosperity oppose the deal. The Washington, D.C.-based organizations have also aided insurgent Republican challengers who vow never to compromise with Democrats, even if it means shutting down the government or defaulting on the federal debt.

Heritage Action spokesman Dan Holler said his group won't back down. When Boehner writes off the dozens of House members who won't compromise on tax and spending issues, it means ""he's going to rely heavily on Democrats"" to pass legislation, Holler said. That's bad for conservative principles, he said, and bad for GOP cohesion in elections.

Boehner's allies say the alternative is worse. When Boehner tries to placate the staunchest conservatives in his caucus, they say, the results are a government shutdown, a major loss on the ""fiscal cliff"" deal a year ago and other Republican embarrassments.

Steve LaTourette, a Boehner friend and former GOP House member from Ohio, said he is heartened by the stepped-up actions by Boehner, the Chamber and others frustrated by tea party tactics. He warned, however, that mainstream Republicans won't tame the tea party faction without huge amounts of effort and money.

In the Senate, Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., announced a test vote for Tuesday on the measure, which appears likely to command the 60 votes necessary to clear the Senate, officials in both parties told the Associated Press on Friday.

The Veterans of Foreign Wars joined the ranks of the bill's opponents during the day, citing a provision to reduce cost of living increases for military retirees until they reach age 62. The result could mean ""a cumulative loss in retirement income of $80,000"" for a sergeant first class who retires at age 40, the group said.

""Although Iraq is over and the war in Afghanistan is winding down, we can't allow Congress to dismantle the programs they created over the past 12 years,"" said William A. Thien, the VFW's national commander.

A short while later, Republican Sens. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, Roger Wicker of Mississippi and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said they would oppose the measure unless the provision were changed. They said a 42-year-old sergeant first class retiring after 20 years would lose about $72,000 in income.

The federal government will face the sequester—massive automatic budget cuts—should Congress not vote on a package of alternate cuts by March 1. The original deadline was Jan. 1—but Biden had negotiated a deal with McConnell at the last minute that put it off for two months. (Both deadlines were a consequence of not reaching an agreement on a bipartisan deficit reduction deal in 2011.)

Republicans and Democrats have both proposed plans to replace the $2.1 trillion in across-the-board cuts with more reasonable measures, but McConnell said he doesn't foresee enough time to reach a compromise before the deadline.

""Read my lips: I'm not interested in an 11th-hour negotiation,"" McConnell told reporters Tuesday. ""It's pretty clear to me that the sequester is going to go into effect. I see no evidence that the House plans to act on this matter before the end of the month.""

President Barack Obama has called for a plan to avoid the automatic cuts with a bill that includes more tax increases, but Republicans immediately rejected it. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on Tuesday said that Senate Democrats were drafting a bill that achieves $2.1 trillion in savings through an equal amount of spending cuts and tax increases, but McConnell said he does not expect it to pass.

""The majority is going to offer a proposal. I anticipate that we will have an alternative proposal. That, however, doesn't lead to a solution, it just leads to a couple of votes,"" McConnell said.

Although the possibilities that McConnell and Biden will reach a deal together appear dim—McConnell said he had no plans to meet with the vice president—Reid indicated on Tuesday that he had a personal meeting scheduled with House Speaker John Boehner about the issue later this week.

The last time the two men were in the same room, however, Boehner began the meeting by urging Reid to attempt an anatomically impossible act, an encounter Reid said Tuesday he has not since forgotten."

(CNN) - It took no advice from the Imperial Senate to reach this conclusion: the U.S. government won't be building a Death Star.

A White House official responded Friday to an online petition on its website proposing the government turn what is “Star Wars” fiction into reality - you know, to boost the economy.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

""By focusing our defense resources into a space-superiority platform and weapon system such as a Death Star, the government can spur job creation in the fields of construction, engineering, space exploration, and more, and strengthen our national defense,"" the petition read.

The White House response to the out-of-this-world proposal was grounded.

""The administration shares your desire for job creation and a strong national defense, but a Death Star isn't on the horizon,"" wrote Paul Shawcross, chief of the Office of Management and Budget's Science and Space Branch.

And plus, he wrote, there is ""something already floating in the sky.""

""Yes, we already have a giant, football field-sized International Space Station in orbit around the Earth that's helping us learn how humans can live and thrive in space for long durations,"" he wrote. ""Even though the United States doesn't have anything that can do the Kessel Run in less than 12 parsecs, we've got two spacecraft leaving the Solar System and we're building a probe that will fly to the exterior layers of the Sun.""

The spherical Death Star space station was the domain of the Galactic Empire and featured a super laser with sufficient power to destroy planets.

The petition picked up over 34,400 signatures since it was posted on November 14. The White House says it responds to all petitions on its “We the People” website which reach at least 25,000 virtual signatures.

The Office of Management and Budget prepares the president's annual budget proposal and scores the costs and deficit impact of executive branch proposals. True to form, the Death Star reply included a score, or cost projection, of the project.

""The construction of the Death Star has been estimated to cost more than $850,000,000,000,000,000. We're working hard to reduce the deficit, not expand it,"" Shawcross wrote, citing a calculation performed by students at Lehigh University's College of Business and Economics.

Also, Shawcross noted, ""The administration does not support blowing up planets.""

Atlantic Club casino -- formerly the Hilton -- closes Jan. 13

%27Idea of casinos was to give the local people jobs%2C not take jobs away from them%27

ATLANTIC CITY — A Blue Christmas doesn't begin to describe what many workers at the doomed Atlantic Club Casino Hotel will have Wednesday.

Two days before Christmas, a bankruptcy court judge approved the sale of the casino -- formerly known as the Atlantic City Hilton -- to two competitors. They will strip it for parts and close it Jan. 13.

Some workers say they're cutting way back on Christmas presents for kids, looking to sell their homes and researching how to file for unemployment and food stamps.

Annette Flack, a food server at the casino, says she now has to worry about paying for health insurance and keeping the gas turned on.

""I bought my son a zip-up sweater he liked,"" she said outside the courtroom, her eyes still wet with tears. ""My daughter in college? I told her I got a couple small things, but your Christmas gift this year is going to college. It's disgusting how they did it and when they did it, the timing. It's not a Merry Christmas when they can team up to crush the weak ones.""

Under a deal reached Friday and approved by judge Gloria Burns on Monday, two rival casino companies with a presence in Atlantic City, Tropicana Entertainment and Caesars Entertainment, will buy the casino for $23.4 million and shut it down. Tropicana will take the slot machines and table games, while Caesars will get the 800-plus-room hotel.

Neither has any interest in operating the business in Atlantic City's now diminished market. Atlantic City will have 11 casinos after the shutdown.

The judge noted the timing of the shutdown.

""I feel badly that it didn't come out in a better way,"" she said. ""This is not palatable to the people who are going to be losing their jobs. It's not lost on me that lots of people are losing their jobs, especially at this time of year.""

Catherine Irizarry has worked 27 years as a cocktail server at the casino, which opened in 1980 as The Golden Nugget, and whose commercials featured then-owner Steve Wynn bringing fresh towels to Frank Sinatra.

In subsequent years, the casino was renamed Bally's Grand Hotel and Casino and then the Hilton before becoming the Atlantic Club in early 2012.

""I'm still in shock,"" Irizarry said. ""I never thought it would end this way. I'm not ready to retire yet. I'm 56 years old — where am I going?""

She said she planned to spend Christmas Day with co-workers, whom she called ""my second family,"" before they soon go their separate ways.

""You wake up and you feel like it's a dream that will go away,"" she said. ""And then it never does.""

Fran Critch also cried as she looked ahead to Christmas, and her uncertain future. She has worked as a food server at the Atlantic Club for 29 years.

""We're thinking of selling our house, like a lot of people here are,"" she said. ""A guy I know has already applied for food stamps.""

She and other soon-to-be jobless workers said none of the 11 other casinos are hiring, and said there are few other jobs in the region.

Atlantic City's main casino workers union succeeded in getting the Atlantic Club to make $1,500 severance payments to about 650 of the 1,600 casino workers who were union members. But the shutdown came too abruptly to organize a toy drive for the families of laid-off workers, as the union was able to do when Resorts laid off dozens of workers before Christmas three years ago. The union is planning a forum soon where it will help workers file for jobless benefits, food stamps and other aid to which they may be entitled.

But none of that makes up for having a job at Christmastime, said Mary Creedon, a cocktail server at the casino since the day it opened 33 years ago.

""We're losing our jobs, we're losing our medical insurance, and the future prospect for jobs is not bright,"" she said. ""Most of us are in our 50s or 60s.""

Janice Kavkeano, another employee from day one, remembered what the big selling point was in the 1976 campaign to legalize casino gambling in New Jersey.

""The idea of casinos was to give the local people jobs, not take jobs away from them,"" she said. ""I was there on the day this place opened and I'll be there on the day we close."""

While investors are entitled to answers about those conflicts, compensation and reforms, Attorney General Holder and President Obama, by singling out S&P, instead of other bond raters, appear to be engaging in political vengeance and put freedom of speech at risk.

In 2011, S&P, Moody’s and Fitch were accused by a Senate Committee of giving overly rosy ratings on mortgage backed securities in the years prior to the financial meltdown of 2008, and then contributing to the severity of the crisis by hastily downgrading hundreds of securities after the housing bubble burst.

Notably, S&P, alone, in August of 2011 downgraded U.S. government bonds—causing the president considerable embarrassment at a time when his reelection was far from certain. And, this downgrade will raise U.S. borrowing costs, and ultimately curtail federal spending and the president’s progressive agenda, when the Federal Reserve deems appropriate to end quantitative easing, which is artificially depressing all interest rates.

[pullquote]

Often, federal prosecutors, when several firms have engaged in unsuitable practices, will single out one to obtain damages and reforms, and then use that settlement to obtain concessions from the others; however, the selection of S&P certainly creates the appearance of sovereign and political abuse.

By any reasonable measure, U.S. debt and spending has reached an unsustainable level. Simply, the tax increases necessary to bring the federal deficit down to a level that would stabilize the national debt as a percentage of GDP, would certainly cause a deep recession, similar to conditions in Italy or Spain, and not yield the anticipated revenues. Hence, spending, in particular entitlement spending, must be cut; however, the president has neither admitted this situation nor shown any inclination toward real entitlement reform.

By not downgrading U.S. debt, Moody’s and Fitch, have demonstrated the same neglect to investors that all three bond rating agencies practiced during the mid-2000s—now, the Justice Department lets them pass by targeting S&P.

At the heart of the matter is the bond rating agencies business practice of charging fees to the firms, state and local governments who issue bonds, and financial houses that create derivatives. The resulting conflict of interest encourages overly rosy ratings that lag market assessments of company and government financial health.

The rating agencies have refused to return to change this business model—they find the present too lucrative to put their public responsibility above profits—and this requires a legislative solution.

The bond rating agencies have clung to a First Amendment defense, but that has terrible public policy foundations. No individual may rely on free speech to knowingly deceive another for the purpose of financial gain—that is the textbook definition of fraud—and no reasonable assessment of the public or investor interests can justify that defense.

Yet, by singling out S&P—the firm that downgraded U.S. government debt—the Attorney General and president has failed to acknowledge their own conflict of interest and create the appearance of retribution.

In other areas, for example broadcast news coverage, the administration has been quick to use its leverage to send messages to organizations it believes demonstrate a conservative bias, but has kept its hands off those demonstrating liberal bias.

By suing S&P, and not Moody’s and Fitch, the Attorney General and president have failed to exhibit the sovereign restraint necessary to sustain the open and fair criticism of the government to sustain American democracy, and place constitutional protections at grave danger."

In testimony before the Senate Finance Committee, Lew said the hit to the economy would go far beyond the disruption of financial markets that has gotten a lot of attention in recent days.

""Between October 17 and November 1, we have large payments to Medicare providers, Social Security beneficiaries and veterans, as well as salaries for active duty members of the military,"" he said in prepared remarks. ""A failure to raise the debt limit could put timely payment of all of these at risk.""

The statement was one of his most explicit warnings of the problems posed to the public if the debt ceiling isn't raised.

Related: CNN - GOP will propose short-term debt ceiling extension

There are 1.4 active duty members of the military and nearly 800,000 civilian support staff in the Defense Department who are working during the government shutdown.

Lew disputed the claims of some Republicans that there wouldn't be a major problem if the ceiling is not raised soon, and that the Treasury Department can pick and chose which bills to pay to avoid default on U.S. debt and limit the damage to the public.

""The United States should not be put in a position of making such perilous choices for our economy and our citizens,"" he said. ""How can the United States choose whether to send Social Security checks to seniors or pay benefits to our veterans? How can the United States choose whether to provide children with food assistance or meet our obligations to Medicare providers.""

Sen Orrin Hatch, the ranking Republican on the committee, repeated his party's criticisms of the administration's refusal to negotiate on the debt ceiling.

""If the Obama administration won't negotiate on entitlements in the context of the debt ceiling, when will it negotiate?"" he said in his opening remarks.

And other Republican lawmakers said the public is behind their demand that spending be cut before the debt ceiling is increased.

""I think this is 11th time I've been through this discussion about the sky is falling and the earth will erupt,"" said Mike Enzi, a Republican from Wyoming. ""Wyoming families aren't buying these arguments. They're saying you can't spend more than you take in.""

Lew repeated the administration's position that the ceiling has to be raised to cover the spending that Congress has previously approved.

""Those Wyoming families know that after they run up their credit cards, they don't get to ignore it,"" he said. ""They have to pay their bills. The debt limit is just paying our bill.""

Debt ceiling deadline: Stop fixating on Oct. 17

Lew reiterated that by Oct. 17 he will exhaust the special accounting measures he's been taking since May to keep under the debt cap. After that point, without the ability to borrow, the government will run out of the cash it needs to pay all its bills on time. But he cautioned that Oct. 17 is only the best possible estimate.

""It is impossible to predict with accuracy,"" he said. ""That's why Congress needs to act to raise the debt limit sooner rather than later.""

Sen Pat Toomey, a Republican from Pennsylvania who has pushed legislation to mandate that interest on Treasuries be paid before other bills, asked Lew to guarantee that the government does not default on debt.

Toomey said it was ""shocking"" that Lew couldn't give him that assurance.

Lew said any missed payments -- not just those on the debt -- would constitute default and rattle the economy and financial markets.

Story highlights NEW: Some websites down, others up; Antarctic research program iced Rangers are ticketing people who try to sneak into the Grand Canyon Crabbers can't fish without federal permits Homeowners on federal land have been kicked out

(CNN) —

You know about the obvious impacts of the government shutdown: federal workers idled, offices closed, funding disrupted for all sorts of activities.

But some of the impacts are less obvious, more outrageous, or a little bit of both.

Here’s a sampling of some of the spinoff effects of the shutdown showdown in Washington:

State Department defends $5 million for high-end glassware

Shuttered Websites

In the digital equivalent of throwing a sheet over unused furniture, many federal agencies have replaced their websites and all the information on them with static pages announcing the government shutdown.

Whether a website will be up or not, however, is something of a guessing game.

The National Parks Service site is down. It sends visitors to the Department of Interior’s website, which is up but not being updated.

The Department of Justice website is up, but the website for its subordinate agency, the Bureau of Justice Statistics, greets visitors with a stark white page reading, “Due to the lapse in federal funding, this Office of Justice Programs (OJP) website is unavailable.”

That you can still reach the websites mean the computers that serve the data are still up and running, and the government is either paying a private company to operate them or they’re using taxpayer-funded power to continue running.

But it doesn’t matter if running the sites with big “closed” sign draped across the front costs the same or even more than letting them run, the White House said in a September 17 memo to federal employees.

“The determination of which services continue during an appropriations lapse is not affected by whether the costs of shutdown exceed the costs of maintaining services,” according to the memo.

Icing Antarctic research

While NASA has the okay to keep supporting U.S. astronauts at the International Space Station, the same apparently isn’t true of scientists at what may be the United States’ next most desolate outpost: Antarctica.

The National Science Foundation said Wednesday that it would run out of money to keep the U.S. Antarctic Program going by October 14.

So it’s putting the program into “caretaker status,” leaving research stations and other facilities staffed with only the bare number of people necessary to “ensure human safety and preserve government property,” the agency said.

That means many of the scientists who would be heading to the program’s Antarctic research stations to work over the Southern Hemisphere’s summer, which begins in December and runs February, are in limbo.

The agency says it will try to restart the research program once funding resumes, but says that it could be tough once seasonal workers are let go and the seasonal window to do some of the work has passed.

Emptiest catch

The shutdown also could make its way to your seafood dinner plate.

Without federal employees to set rules and quotas for the fishing season, crab fleets in Alaska are in limbo – unsure whether they’ll be able to head out in pursuit of lucrative crab that bring in millions of dollars each season.

A delay of even a few days could be costly, Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Washington, said in a House speech last week. Her district includes the home port for some of the fleets that fish for Bering Sea crab.

What you need to know today

“A delay could mean they’ll miss out exporting to the all-important Asian holiday market when demand is at its highest and most lucrative,” she said.

That could cost the industry millions, dealing it what she called a “crippling blow.”

One fishing captain told CNN affiliate KIRO that the delay threatens what they call the “Super Bowl of crab fishing.”

“We think of a lot of other things besides the government affecting our fishing – weather, boats, crew,” said Capt. Moore Dye of the fishing vessel Western Mariner. “This has really caught us off guard.”

No shutdown for House gym rats

Move along, nothing to see

No, the Obama administration has not deployed helicopters to hover in front of Mount Rushmore National Monument with a giant, view-obscuring sheet, as the rumor-busting site snopes.com debunked last week.

But federal officials did – for a time at least – put traffic cones up at a pull-off where people stop to view the carving from a distance. Depending on whom you ask, the cones were either to block motorists from pulling off or to guide them into viewing areas.

“They won’t even let you pull off on the side of the road,” the Argus Leader newspaper in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, quoted state Tourism Department Secretary Jim Hagen as saying. “I just don’t know what they’re trying to accomplish.”

The newspaper said park officials told the state the cones were meant only to channel motorists into viewing sites. They went up October 1, the day the shutdown began.

Federal officials removed the cones for at least a while after a snowstorm hit and crews needed to plow the roads, the newspaper reported.

“Once the snow’s off the ground, we’re going to be keeping an eye on how the cones go up,” the newspaper quoted the governor’s chief of staff, Dusty Johnson, as saying.

Don’t go in there

The area around the Grand Canyon is a ghost town. It’s no different inside, and park rangers are working to keep it that way, according to The Republic newspaper in Arizona.

Park officials have written about two dozen citations for people trying to sneak into the park. Some have been caught at the canyon’s South Rim, others on trails or attempting hikes, the newspaper reported.

Shutdown leaves ranchers in the cold, blizzard kills their cattle

Don’t ‘recreate’

According to the Eagle-Tribune newspaper of North Andover, Massachusetts, tourist Pat Vaillancourt said National Park Service Guards held her tour group under armed guard in a Yellowstone National Park hotel and brusquely told tourists who had filed off their bus to take pictures of bison that they weren’t to “recreate.”

The tour guide argued to rangers that the tourists – some of them from overseas – weren’t “recreating,” just taking pictures.

“She responded and said, ‘Sir, you are recreating,’ and her tone became very aggressive,” the newspaper quoted Vaillancourt as saying.

Yellowstone spokesman Al Nash, who despite being furloughed was asked by park officials to respond to some media inquiries when available, said hotel guests were never held under armed guard.

He acknowledged that tourists were frustrated by limitations imposed by the shutdown – he said parks officials were, as well.

Ted Cruz: Democrats’ new bogeyman

And stay out!

A Nevada couple said they were kicked out of their home in the Lake Mead National Recreation Area, CNN affiliate KTNV reports.

Retirees Joyce and Ralph Spencer own a cabin on federal land, and were told last week they had 24 hours to clear out and stay out until the government reopens.

Park officials gave KTNV a statement saying overnight stays are not allowed in the park until funding is restored, but said owners can visit their properties to retrieve belongings.

While the decision has angered some commenters on KTNV’s story – some of whom suggested the decision to kick out property owners was made out of spite and encouraged the couple to sue – Joyce Spencer said they’re taking the situation in stride.

While they’d like to be allowed back in their home, the worst impact has been that she had to buy her husband new clothes they forgot while packing up to leave their cabin.

“We’re not hurt in any way except it might cost me if I have to go buy more pants,” she told KTNV.

World worries: Can it count on U.S.?"
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/15/us/politics/obama-to-press-house-gop-on-debt-limit.html,2013-01-15 00:00:00,"['Jackie Calmes', 'Jonathan Weisman']",Obama and G.O.P. Set Debt Limit Showdown,"With the president refusing to negotiate over the essential increase and Republicans saying he must, reporters pressed Mr. Obama about whether he is considering some executive action to sidestep Congress and raise the debt ceiling — as Democratic leaders have urged. But Mr. Obama declined to answer directly, and his administration has ruled out proposals to either invoke authority under the 14th Amendment or mint a platinum coin as a sort of collateral for more debt.

The debt issue dominated the news conference, and later the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, added to the pressure by writing to Congressional leaders that the department still expects to hit the limit between mid-February and early March.

“Treasury would be left to fund the government solely with the cash we have on hand on any given day,” he said, forcing it to choose among creditors, federal contractors, veterans, Social Security and Medicare beneficiaries and the many other claimants to federal dollars. Some Republicans support temporarily making choices among claimants, but the administration and some financial analysts say that approach would be unworkable and amount to the nation’s first default on its obligations.

Separately, Mr. Geithner and Gene Sperling, director of the White House National Economic Council, held a conference call with corporate executives, many of whom have expressed concern the threat of default could damage the economy. The administration is hoping that business leaders can persuade Republicans to avoid confrontation over the debt limit, but party leaders were undeterred.

The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, also called on Congress to increase the debt ceiling to cover bills that it has already incurred. “The right way to deal with this problem is for Congress to do what it is supposed to do and what it needs to do,” Mr. Bernanke, a Republican appointed by President George W. Bush and later reappointed by Mr. Obama, said in a speech at the University of Michigan."

An administration official said the plan is being distributed to agencies

Proposal calls for more security funding and status checks

Illegal immigrants would apply for %22Lawful Prospective Immigrant%22 visa

WASHINGTON — A draft of a White House immigration proposal obtained by USA TODAY would allow illegal immigrants to become legal permanent residents within eight years.

The plan also would provide for more security funding and require business owners to check the immigration status of new hires within four years. In addition, the nation's 11 million illegal immigrants could apply for a newly created ""Lawful Prospective Immigrant"" visa, under the draft bill being written by the White House.

If approved, they could then apply for the same provisional legal status for their spouse or children living outside the country, according to the draft.

The bill is being developed as members in both chambers of Congress are drafting their own immigration bills. In the House, a bipartisan group of representatives has been negotiating an immigration proposal for years and are writing their own bill. Last month, four Republican senators joined with four Democratic senators to announce their agreement on the general outlines of an immigration plan.

One of those senators, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said Obama's bill repeats the failures of past legislation and would be ""dead on arrival"" in Congress.

""It fails to follow through on previously broken promises to secure our borders, (and) creates a special pathway that puts those who broke our immigration laws at an advantage over those who chose to do things the right way and come here legally,"" Rubio said. ""It would actually make our immigration problems worse.""

The draft was obtained from an Obama administration official who said it was being distributed to various agencies. The official requested anonymity because he was not authorized to release the proposal publicly.

The bill mirrors many provisions of the bipartisan 2007 bill that was spearheaded by the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and ultimately failed.

In his first term, Obama often deferred to Congress on drafting and advancing major legislation, including the Affordable Care Act. He has openly supported the efforts in Congress to take the lead on immigration legislation, and just this week met with Democratic senators to discuss their proposals.

But two weeks ago in Las Vegas, while outlining his immigration plans, Obama made clear that he would not wait too long for Congress to get moving.

""If Congress is unable to move forward in a timely fashion, I will send up a bill based on my proposal and insist that they vote on it right away,"" he said.

White House spokesman Clark Stevens said Saturday that the administration continues to support the bipartisan efforts ongoing in Congress.

""The president has made clear the principles upon which he believes any common-sense immigration reform effort should be based,"" Stevens said. ""We continue to work in support of a bipartisan effort, and while the president has made clear he will move forward if Congress fails to act, progress continues to be made and the administration has not prepared a final bill to submit.""

According to the White House draft, people would need to pass a criminal background check, submit biometric information and pay fees to qualify for the new visa. If approved, they would be allowed to legally reside in the U.S. for four years, work and leave the country for short periods of time. After the four years, they could then reapply for an extension.

Illegal immigrants would be disqualified from the program if they were convicted of a crime that led to a prison term of at least one year, three or more different crimes that resulted in a total of 90 days in jail, or if they committed any offense abroad that ""if committed in the United States would render the alien inadmissible or removable from the United States.""

People currently in federal custody or facing deportation proceedings also could be allowed to apply for the Lawful Prospective Immigrant visa. Application forms and instructions would be provided in ""the most common languages spoken by persons in the United States,"" but the application and all supporting evidence submitted to the federal government would have to be in English.

They would also be given a new identification card to show as proof of their legal status in the country.

The immigrants could then apply for legal permanent residence, commonly known as a green card, within eight years if they learn English and ""the history and government of the United States"" and pay back taxes. That would then clear the path for them to apply for U.S. citizenship.

To combat fraud, the draft proposes a new Social Security card be developed that is ""fraud-resistant, tamper-resistant and wear-resistant."" The Social Security Administration would be required to issue the new cards within two years.

A major requirement for many Republicans is enhanced border security. The bill calls for an unspecified increase in the Border Patrol, allows the Department of Homeland Security to expand technological improvements along the border and adds 140 new immigration judges to process the heavy flow of people who violate immigration laws.

It also orders U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to study whether a land-border crossing fee should be implemented to help offset border security costs. The draft also proposes raising many inspection fees that border-crossers already pay.

The draft bill proposes a new plan to allow Homeland Security to ""accept donations"" from citizens, businesses and local and state governments to improve ports of entry and security features along the border. And it would require CBP to begin collecting statistics on deaths along the border and report them quarterly.

The draft also expands the E-Verify program that checks the immigration status of people seeking new jobs. Businesses with more than 1,000 employees must begin using the system within two years, businesses with more than 250 employees within three years and all businesses within four years.

Homeland Security, working with the U.S. departments of Labor and Agriculture, the attorney general and other agencies, would engage in a $40 million-a-year program to educate business owners and workers about the program.

Homeland Security also would be required to submit a report within 18 months showing how the worker verification system is working, and specifically explain how it is affecting the nation's agriculture industry, which relies heavily on illegal immigrant workers.

The draft obtained by USA TODAY does not include sections that would alter the nation's legal immigration system to adjust the future flow of legal immigrants, which is expected to be a critical component of any immigration overhaul."

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 7,000 to a seasonally adjusted 340,000, declining for a second straight week, the Labor Department said on Thursday.

The prior week's claims figure was revised to show 3,000 more applications received than previously reported.

Economists polled by Reuters had expected first-time applications to rise to 355,000.

The four-week moving average for new claims, a better measure of labor market trends, also fell 7,000 to 348,750 - the lowest level since March 2008 - pointing to some firming in underlying labor market conditions.

A Labor Department analyst said no states had been estimated and there were no special factors influencing the report.

The data has no bearing on February's employment report, due on Friday, as it falls outside the survey period.

According to a Reuters survey of economists, employers probably added 160,000 jobs to their payrolls last month, a small pick-up up from January's 157,000 count. That would just be enough to hold the jobless rate steady at 7.9 percent.

Economists say job gains of at least 250,000 per month over a sustained period are needed to significantly dent the ranks of the unemployed. Job growth averaged 200,000 in the last three months.

While layoffs have subsided, companies are not in a hurry to step up hiring as domestic demand remains lackluster.

Claims remain tucked in the low end of a 330,000 to 375,000 range for this year.

High unemployment prompted the Federal Reserve last year to launch an open-ended bond buying program. The U.S. central bank said it would keep up the program until there was a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market.

In testimony to Congress last week, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke signaled the central bank would press forward with plans to buy $85 billion in bonds per month.

The number of people still receiving benefits under regular state programs after an initial week of aid rose 3,000 to 3.1 million in the week ended February 23. The four-week moving average of so-called continuing claims was the lowest since July 2008.

Meanwhile, nonfarm productivity fell at its fastest pace in four years in the fourth quarter, but the decline was likely to be temporary as economic growth is expected to pick up after stalling in late 2012.

Productivity fell at a 1.9 percent annual rate, the weakest pace since the fourth quarter of 2008, the Labor Department said on Thursday. A month ago it estimated that productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, fell at a 2 percent pace.

It had increased at a 3.1 percent rate in the third quarter. Economists polled by Reuters had expected the decline productivity to be revised to a 1.6 percent rate.

The drop largely reflects a surge in hiring while output continued to expand at a slower pace. The economy added about 600,000 jobs the fourth quarter, but gross domestic product only grew at a 0.1 percent rate.

Growth is expected to accelerate in the first quarter, although the pace is not expected to be above 2 percent as the economy adjusts to tighter fiscal policy.

Unit labor costs - a gauge of the labor-related cost for any given unit of output - rose at a 4.6 percent rate in the fourth quarter rather than 4.5 percent, the report showed.

Labor costs were up only 2.1 percent from a year-ago, underscoring the lack of wage-related inflation pressures in the economy and helping to keep the door open to further monetary easing by the Federal Reserve to stimulate the economy.

Just two months after the brinksmanship of the “fiscal cliff,” on Friday Washington faced yet another deadline to avoid yet another fiscal calamity of its own making.

But this time, something is different.

As congressional leaders met in the White House on Friday for what was little more than a photo-op on the day forced budget cuts went into effect, this time there are no 11th-hour negotiations to save the day. There is no last-minute effort to call in Vice President Joe Biden on behalf of Democrats or Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell on behalf of Republicans to get things back on track.

Obama: ‘I am not a dictator, I’m the president’

Instead, for the past few weeks, all sides – the White House and Congress, Democrats and Republicans – have done nothing but squabble like a dysfunctional married couple about who is responsible for the bad policy that is the forced budget cuts, all while avoiding dealing with the real issues.

National leaders’ apparent lack of interest in working out an alternative to the cuts was symbolized by the meeting Friday morning at the White House. As if to check off the “we did everything we could” box, say couples counselors, President Obama and congressional leaders from both parties met to show that they met – even though earlier this week, Obama told Hill leaders they needed to be “ready to talk solutions.”

As expected, the meeting produced no breakthrough and Friday night President Obama formally began the process of implementing the forced budget cuts he and Congress have been criticizing for weeks.

If it feels like a child helplessly watching bickering parents repeat a dysfunctional cycle of disagreement, recrimination and contempt while not addressing the root cause of what’s wrong in their relationship, there’s good reason.

Spending cut politics: Déjà vu all over again

“They’ve lost sight of the big picture because they’re so determined to be right and to win the argument, and that’s what happens with couples,” said Sharon Rivkin, a California-based marriage counselor and author of “Breaking the Argument Cycle.”

The need to be right, shaming and blaming are the three major obstacles to a healthy relationship, Rivkin said. “And that’s exactly what they’re doing – the Democrats and the Republicans are doing with each other. They’re attacking and defending and really just want to be right. And are not looking at the impact that it’s going to have on children and the economy and the country.”

Spending cuts: When they’ll really bite

In addition to the contempt that seems to be building on both sides, Rivkin flagged misdirected disagreement as another sign that the relationship between Democrats and Republicans has become dysfunctional to the point of needing therapy.

“They’re arguing about the wrong things, and that’s what happens in couples: You’re not even arguing about what’s really going on. You’re just arguing to win,” Rivkin said.

“They should be talking about economic growth and how to reduce the budget deficit and how they can be fair,” the therapist observed. Instead, both sides are squabbling over who originally had the idea for the forced spending cuts. “You can’t win in an argument like that, because it’s he said, she said, and they’re not getting to the root of the issues.”

Teachers: How will you be affected?

Then there is Obama and House Speaker John Boehner, a couple that seems to have the most strained relationship in a dysfunctional Washington. Rivkin says that if the two men came to her for therapy, she’d first listen to their gripes about one another. “And then I’d try to make it more human” by getting away from their superficial disagreements and appealing to their shared concern for the well-being of the country.

“If I talked to them long enough, there’s got to be something that they agree on,” Rivkin said, adding that finding a point of agreement in a quarrelling couple is “very powerful.”

Obama signs order activating deep spending cuts

Rivkin also said that Boehner’s recent announcement that he will no longer negotiate directly with Obama is another sign that the relationship between the two men is in serious trouble.

“The healthiest relationships are the ones where you can negotiate,” the marriage counselor said, “where you feel safe to put everything out there.”

Laurie Puhn, a couples mediator and author of “Fight Less, Love More,” likens Friday’s meeting at the White House to a couple’s mediation session where both spouses come into the room but refuse to speak.

“OK,” Puhn said, “you got the image. You can check off your list (that) you did couples mediation, but clearly nothing could possibly be accomplished.”

Like a married couple desperately in need of outside help to understand and resolve their differences, Puhn noted, “each political party – the individuals within them – is all about what I want. Here’s what I want. Here’s what I need. Here’s what I won’t do. Here’s what I won’t give up. Everybody’s making demands, and they’re each just completely thinking about themselves.”

In mediation, Puhn tries to avoid the personal acrimony between a couple and instead focus on identifying a list of underlying issues or concerns in their relationship. Then she focuses on areas of agreement about those issues and sets those aside so the couple can focus on the areas of disagreement.

“You narrow it down … and what you’re left with are the sticking points,” Puhn said. Then the task becomes avoiding focusing on a single sticking point and, instead, finding some give-and-take amongst all the sticking points.

“Most of the time, people can’t identify their actual problems,” Puhn said of her work with distressed couples. “And I think that’s what we see between the president and the speaker.”

Obama and Boehner and both political parties seem to be suffering from another affliction Puhn sees in struggling couples. “If we’re going to fight, let’s have a good fight. … Let’s make our goal in a fight to reach a solution. The goal is not to win … not to persuade your mate.”

As a mediator, Puhn said, much of what she does is to control the environment where a couple is brainstorming tradeoffs between their sticking points on critical issues so that one spouse isn’t given the opportunity to see the other’s willingness to compromise as leverage or weakness. In so doing, Puhn often acts as a substitute for the trust between the couple that has broken down by the time they seek her help.

Puhn said Obama and Boehner and Democrats and Republicans in Washington “absolutely” need a mediator whom both sides trust who can get them refocused from their entrenched positions to their underlying interests and goals.

“As a politician, you should be able to understand and mediate through what your interests are,” Puhn said. “And if you really can’t move away from the words and the specific rules on the table and the (governmental) programs you’re discussing, what it means is that you’re truly just focused on what it’s going to look like – what the image is of whatever you agree to.”

House leaders responded on Thursday with one of the least serious negotiating proposals in modern Congressional history: a jaw-dropping list of ransom demands containing more than a dozen discredited Republican policy fantasies.

We’ll refrain from deliberately sabotaging the global economy, Speaker John Boehner and the other leaders said, if President Obama allows more oil drilling on federal lands. And drops regulations on greenhouse gases. And builds the Keystone XL oil pipeline. And stops paying for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. And makes it harder to sue for medical malpractice. And, of course, halts health care reform for a year.

The list would be laughable if the threat were not so serious. A failure to raise the debt ceiling would cause a default on government debt, shattering the world’s faith in Treasury bonds as an investment vehicle and almost certainly bringing on another economic downturn. Unlike a government shutdown, a default could leave the Treasury without enough money to pay Social Security benefits or the paychecks of troops.

The full effects remain unknown because no Congress has ever allowed the government to go over the brink before. The Government Accountability Office estimated that simply by threatening to default in 2011, Republicans cost taxpayers $1.3 billion in higher interest payments because of that uncertainty. The 10-year cost of those higher-interest bonds is $18.9 billion."

USA TODAY

Nation will hit debt limit in October%2C Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew says

Letter is first time a specific date has been given

Congress would need to authorize higher limit

WASHINGTON — The United States will run out of borrowed money ""no later than Oct. 17"" unless Congress raises the $16.7 trillion debt limit, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew said in a letter to Congress Wednesday.

Lew's letter marks the first time he has given a date certain for when the government would hit the debt ceiling and comes as Congress is at another impasse on how to keep the government running and pay its past bills.

It's not a coincidence that Oct. 17 is a Thursday, said Steve Bell, economic policy director for the Bipartisan Policy Center.

That's because the Treasury typically rolls over $100 billion in debt every Thursday, as old bonds mature and most investors simply use the proceeds to buy new bonds. Some bond holders may park their money elsewhere. Others may demand higher yields. ""But at what price? That;s the big imponderable,"" Bell said.

""I think people don't understand what this does to the market psychology. It's not within Congress's full control,"" said Bell, a former managing director of Salomon Brothers. He said bond rates are creeping up on the uncertainty.

Lew expressed the same worry in a speech to the Economic Club of Washington last week, saying a massive sell-off of bonds could create an immediate crisis. ""The point is, trying to time a debt limit increase to the last minute could be very dangerous,"" he said.

The nation has been at the debt limit since May 17. Since then, the Treasury Department has undertaken what it calls ""extraordinary measures,"" which include delaying pension fund payments and drawing down an emergency fund.

Once those measures are exhausted, the government would have only enough money to pay its bills as it has revenue on any given day. As of Oct. 17, the Treasury expects its cash-on-hand will be reduced to $30 billion. The government typically spends $60 billion every day.

It's unclear exactly how Treasury would juggle those payments. During the last debt-limit crisis in 2011, the Treasury Department ruled out many stopgap measures to maintain spending and pay its debts, such as selling off assets. The United States has more than $350 billion in gold reserves on its balance sheet, for example, but Treasury officials said a ""fire sale"" on gold would hurt the dollar and the economy, according to a 2012 report from the Treasury Office of the Inspector General. The Treasury has no practical way of reducing payments by an across-the-board percentage to stay under the debt limit.

""If we have insufficient cash on hand, it would be impossible for the United States of America to meet all of its obligations for the first time in our history,"" Lew said.

Even dancing so close to a debt-limit deadline can be costly. In 2011, the debt-limit showdown cost the government $1.3 billion in increased borrowing costs, according to a review last year by the Government Accountability Office. That study looked at the yield spread between government and corporate bonds to determine how the markets were reacting to the uncertainty caused by the debt-limit debate.

Lew's warning comes as Congress debates another measure that would authorize spending for the new fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. A resolution passed by the Republican House would keep government spending roughly at current levels and extend the debt ceiling — but only for paying the principal and interest on the debt.

The Obama administration opposes the pay-the-debt-first plan, which Lew called ""default by another name.""

""The debt ceiling must be raised,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said Wednesday. ""This cannot and should not be a matter of negotiation.""

Walmart, which pays its workers an average wage of $8.81 an hour, recently gathered a few headlines when it threatened to cancel construction on three stores in Washington D.C. after the city council wanted to force them to pay a living wage of $12.50 an hour.



What does McDonald's and Walmart have in common? They both push their workers onto public services and food stamps.

Walmart's wages and benefits are so low that many of its employees are forced to turn to the government for aid, costing taxpayers between $900,000 and $1.75 million per store, according to a report released last week by congressional Democrats.

Congress is currently busy arguing about cutting food stamps . The Paul Ryan budget would cut $33 Billion over 10 years. The theory is that programs like food stamps discourage work Hannity likes to ask the question of whether Americans are ""better off on food stamps"" or ""better off with a job"".The spin by the right-wing is that food stamps are just welfare for the lazy.

As McDonald's budget demonstrated, it isn't a question of having a job or not. 47% of SNAP participants are under the age of 18. Another 8% are over the age of 60. 36% were white (non-Hispanic), the largest group.

But the really big number is 58%. That's how many SNAP recipients lived in a household with earnings from a job. Increasingly the face of someone getting food stamps is a working poor family.

However, the lie behind food stamps being a benefit for the undeserving poor is more than just a slander of the working poor. It's also a distraction away from who primarily benefits from food stamps.

""Here's where the profits come in,"" Nestle says. ""A vast percentage of Food Stamps' money goes into the pockets of soda companies and snack food companies...and also the stores that sell these foods.""

Wal-Mart ""gets a large fraction of Food Stamp dollars,"" which contributes 25% to 40% of revenue at select stores, according to Nestle. ""These companies, therefore, have a vested interest in making sure Food Stamps are allowed for any purchase at all.""

Funding for Food Stamps comes from the Farm Bill, which is currently being debated in Congress. ""You can bet the food companies like it just the way it is and they are lobbying"" to prevent restrictions on how Food Stamp dollars are spent, Nestle says.

As the head of this division at JPMorgan, Christopher Paton, told Bloomberg, ""They act and feel very much like a debit card. A lot of stores increasingly take food stamps."" What convenience! And Paton points out that his bank is the largest processor of food stamps in the country. These are boom times for such services -- a new report from the US Department of Agriculture reports that 43.6 million Americans are now using food stamps, nearly 14% of the population, which is a record number. Paton notes this trend himself: ""Volumes have gone through the roof in the last couple of years,"" he says. ""This business is a very important business to JPMorgan in terms of its size and scale."" And the numbers bear him out. According to the company's most recent quarterly filing with the SEC, the Treasury & Securities Services segment, which is the division that includes the food stamp business, was up 2% in the last three months of last quarter and brought in $5.47 billion in net revenue for most of 2010.

You can't help but notice the irony of Walmart helping its employees get on food stamps, and then profiting from their food stamp dollars. In fact, if you take a step back and think about it, what that sounds like is not public welfare, butwelfare.And if you think that stops at McDonald's and Walmart, think again. The food stamps/corporate welfare model goes all the way to Wall Street JP Morgan helped gut the American economy, got saved by the American taxpayer, and is now profiting on the misery of the working poor at the expense of the American taxpayer again.Is this a great country or what?!?

The hidden fact is that food stamps are corporate welfare in more than just one way. It's not just that McDonald's, Nestle, JP Morgan and Walmart make money from managing and selling products for food stamp money. They also benefit in a much more important way: social stability.

All those millions of working poor that are just barely making it because of food stamps, will continue to put up with things and work for an increasingly slim chance of an opportunity to get ahead as long as they still have some food in their bellies.

All that ends when people can't feed themselves.

Any student of history or current events of the world knows that hungry people have nothing to lose.

Do you think Walmart and McDonald's can continue to pay starvation wages and not see their workers organizing into unions to demand higher pay if those same workers are hungry?

Programs like food stamps ensure the serfs of this country don't organize and rebel. Talk to any North African dictator and they will agree that if you take away that last bit of the social safety net things will get ugly real fast.

How has the profile of food stamp recipients changed in the last decade?

The number of SNAP households that have earnings while participating in SNAP has been rising for more than a decade, and has more than tripled — from about 2 million in 2000 to about 6.4 million in 2011.

USA TODAY

President Obama met Wednesday with the top four congressional leaders

House Republicans again attempted piecemeal funding bills to fund popular government services

The shutdown could clash with an impending vote to raise the debt ceiling

WASHINGTON — On the second day of the government shutdown, Congress and the White House drew no closer to resolving the impasse, although President Obama and key congressional leaders held their first meeting to discuss the budget crisis Wednesday afternoon.

Obama met with top four congressional leaders at the White House for a meeting, where leaders reiterated their positions after the meeting: Democrats continue to seek a stopgap funding bill and a debt ceiling increase with no conditions attached, while Republicans continue to mount an effort to seek concessions on the health care law.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Republicans ""keep moving the goal post"" for reaching a deal. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said Democrats ""will not negotiate.""

While they called the meeting cordial, earlier in the day Obama said he is ""exasperated"" by the shutdown and blamed Republicans for trying to ""extort"" a delay or defund of the health care law.

""Absolutely, I'm exasperated, because this is entirely unnecessary,"" Obama told CNBC in an interview.

The White House said in a statement Wednesday evening that Obama stressed his view that the House should vote on the clean spending bill passed by the Senate, and that he would not negotiate over re-opening the government or raising the debt limit.

After meeting earlier Wednesday with Obama, leaders of major Wall Street financial firms joined in calling for a deal to end the shutdown and the uncertainty over the increase in the debt ceiling, which needs a congressional vote of approval by Oct. 17.

""While the government shutdown is unfortunate, the impacts of a debt default would be magnitudes worse and should not even be considered a viable option,"" said Lloyd Blankfein, CEO and chairman of the investment firm Goldman Sachs, in a statement.

""The economic damage associated with default or near-default would be severe and have serious consequences for the recovery of the U.S. and global economy,"" said Blankfein, who is also chairman of the Financial Services Forum, a group of financial and investment firms.

The shutdown has also raised the stakes for national security, two of the nation's top intelligence officials told a Senate panel Wednesday.

""I've never seen anything like this,'' Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told the Senate Judiciary Committee. ""The damage will be insidious as this goes on.''

Clapper said 70% of the civilian workforce had been furloughed as part of the shutdown, which the director said has ""created a dreamland for foreign intelligence services to recruit'' U.S. personnel.

National Security Agency Director Keith Alexander said 4,000 computer scientists and 1,000 other scientists are among those furloughed.

Meeting request stirs war of words

Obama's request for a meeting, coupled with a letter by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to Boehner, opened a proxy fight between the various sides' spokesmen.

White House spokesman Jay Carney said the president is ""attaching no partisan strings"" to his request that Congress reopen the government. ""What the president is asking Republicans in the House to do is quite literally the least they could do. He's asking them to extend funding at the levels set in the previous fiscal year to keep the government open.""

Republicans want further negotiations said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for Boehner, an Ohio Republican. ""It's unclear why we'd be having this meeting if it's not meant to be a start to serious talks between the two parties,"" Buck said.

Reid, D-Nev., sent a letter to Boehner Wednesday asking him to approve the Senate stopgap funding measure in exchange for a commitment to appoint senators to a committee to resolve longer-term budget issues. ""This conference would be an appropriate place to have those discussions,"" Reid wrote.

The conference committee would attempt to resolve differences in the budget plans passed by the Senate, controlled by Democrats, and the Republican-led House. Senate Democrats have asked for such a committee since the spring, but were rebuffed by Republicans, who said their differences were too great for a conference. House Republicans offered to appoint members to a separate committee on the stopgap bill on Monday as the shutdown neared, which Senate Democrats rejected.

""The entire government is shut down right now because Washington Democrats refuse to even talk about fairness for all Americans under Obamacare,"" responded Michael Steel, a spokesman for Boehner, ""Offering to negotiate only after Democrats get everything they want is not much of an offer.""

Small spending bills

House Republicans moved forward again Wednesday with a legislative strategy to advance piecemeal funding bills to reopen popular parts of the federal government including parks and national memorials and the Department of Veterans Affairs until a broader budget agreement is reached. Measures to reopen the parks and the National Institutes of Health passed Wednesday evening, but face slim prospects of passing in the Senate.

Republicans continue to ask for a one-year delay in the requirement in the Affordable Care Act that uninsured Americans buy health insurance in exchange for passage of the funding bill.

The state- and federal-run websites where people can shop for and buy health insurance opened Tuesday. They have experienced more than 4.7 million visitors, which has also led the sites to crash or cause long waits.

Senate Democrats and Obama oppose the piecemeal approach and continue to call on Republicans to approve the Senate-passed stopgap funding bill through Nov. 15 that has no provisions affecting the health care law. Senate Majority Whip Richard Durbin, D-Ill., challenged Boehner to allow a vote on the bill, which appears to have the support to pass on the votes of Democrats and moderate Republicans.

""What is (Boehner) so afraid of?"" Durbin said on the Senate floor.

Some House Republicans wavering

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has said she can deliver most of the Democrats' 200 House votes, and more than a dozen House Republicans have publicly said they would support a ""clean"" stopgap bill without provisions affecting the ACA.

One of those Republicans, Rep. Michael Grimm, R-N.Y., said he is working with a coalition of members and leadership to find a compromise. ""I'm willing to do that and there are many members that are going to make that push,"" he told CNN's New Day.

Democrats on Wednesday tried to force shutdown-ending legislation to the floor, but it failed 227-197. All GOP members voted against it.

Republicans are looking for ways to pass the stopgap bill and negotiate with Senate Democrats on a vote to raise the debt ceiling, the nation's borrowing limit.

""There is a strong possibility, if (Democrats) were willing to at least sit down and listen to us, that we could put a package together to solve all of these problems at once so we can get the government funded, stop this shutdown and also deal with the debt ceiling so that we don't have another crisis a week or two away from now,"" Grimm said.

By 4 p.m., the list of Republicans who were either quoted in published reports or had released public statements online, particularly on Twitter, saying they would vote for a spending bill without limits on the Affordable Care Act, had risen to close to 20. But their influence is limited unless Boehner agrees to put the Senate bill up for a vote.

Obama and Reid have been equally insistent that they will not negotiate on the debt ceiling because of the economic risks posed by a default. However, the two budget deadlines overlap further with each day the government remains shut down.

Treasury Secretary Jack Lew advised Congress late Tuesday that he was exhausting the last measures before the debt ceiling is hit Oct. 17.

Senate GOP leaders said they'd like to resolve the two issues separately, but that it may not be possible. ""Well, they are getting close to each other, aren't they? And I'd still like to resolve the current issue before we move on to the debt ceiling, but it's not exactly clear yet when that will be resolved,"" said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.

The result was the 14th amendment, which, in addition to codifying the abolition of slavery, included in its Section 4 the guarantee to honor all U.S. debts.

The fact that the debt issue was stuck in the face of the southern states in the same constitutional amendment as slavery abolition civil rights guarantees should not go unnoticed for either its symbolic value or for its roots as a point of contention with the Tea Party, which draws upon white resentments in the south and elsewhere fueled by the rise of civil rights laws in the 1960s. The Tea Party draws on white supremacist sentiment that has been a part of U.S. history since its beginnings, augmenting it with pro-Nazi sentiments fueled by the so-called Fellowship Foundation of ""key men"" (and, sometimes, women) starting in the mid-20th century. Their purpose is completely clear; split the U.S. so that it can be destroyed, and replaced with a far right police state benefiting a few elites.

As with the rise of Hitler during Germany's Weimar Republic, the Tea Party uses economic and social chaos to fuel its rise. It undermines faith in democratic processes at every turn, so that people will favor ""strong man"" governments - governments that will benefit the ""key men"" first and foremost and further the redistribution of wealth from average people to the elites. The Nazis of Weimar Germany also used resentment against Europe and moderate Germans for the perceived unfairness of war reparation payments after World War I to fuel nationalism, much in the same way that the Tea Party fuels resentment against the fall of the ""Southern Cause"" with its encouragement of Confederate flag-waving and the use of the proxy Gadsden Flag from South Carolina's troops in the War of Independence.

What we are engaged in is not an economic fight, or even a political fight. What we're engaged in is in fact a fight for the last chance for a democracy in the United States for the foreseeable future. The billionaire lords of the Tea Party. like the industrialists backing Hitler, want to wage economic and military war on anyone who might interfere with their accretion of wealth, both in this nation and beyond. Their ""values"" issues, while certainly a part of their outlook, are largely tools for a much more agnostic and pagan goal: power and wealth for its own sake, with the state as the crowning mechanism for their goals.

Sadly, I don't think that the U.S. public really gets this - or really gets that they are in a battle where they are still the majority against this hardened and fantasy-based group of extremists. Hitler rose to power in part because everyday people became exhausted, beaten down by harsh economic realities, a beating aided and abetted by a flaccid and complacent media. So it is again today. Little has been learned in a century, unfortunately, it would seem.

We do have hope and we do have options, but people are tired, and they need to feel that they have hope. This is what's lacking in the political dialogue right now. Obama is doing his best to fuel that courage and that hope, but it will take a lot more grass roots activism to overcome the Tea Party. They can command endless hours of news coverage simply by having a few of their relatives and friends wave Confederate flags in front of the White House. They call for massive rallies that never materialize - except in the news media's perception that declaring these things to be so makes them so.

We have to create our own reality for the sake of U.S. democracy, and soon, otherwise there will be no union left to save. If that seems to be an exaggeration, look at how the German people allowed democracy to slip away from their own nation. The fact of the matter is that, one way or another, we are still engaged in a great Civil War for American democracy, testing whether this nation, or any nation, so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure, as Abraham Lincoln put it. The enemies of democracy laid down their arms only in part more than 150 years ago. The final battle of that war is upon us. It is up to us as a people to decide how to fight it, but the fight has been brought to us regardless. We have only to choose how to respond.

Let's hope for the best - and fight for it."

Put simply, the recession took middle-class jobs, and the recovery has replaced them with low-income ones, a trend that has exacerbated income inequality. According to Labor Department data, about 1.7 million workers earned the minimum wage or less in 2007. By 2012, the total had surged to 3.6 million, with millions of others earning just a few cents or dollars more.

In his State of the Union address in February, President Obama made raising the federal minimum wage his banner economic proposal. The White House argued that increasing the wage to $9 an hour from its current $7.25 and indexing it to inflation would lift hundreds of thousands of families above the poverty line.

Under the latest proposed terms of a four-year labor pact, a pay hike of up to 4% in October 2016 would be reduced to about 2%, City Administrative Officer Miguel Santana, a high-level budget analyst, wrote in a confidential memo to the City Council.

After discussing the proposal behind closed doors, Los Angeles City Council President Herb Wesson said Tuesday that Garcetti and the council are “really, really, really close” to reaching agreement on the contract.

“The council is optimistic that there will be a partnership with the mayor,” he said. “You can feel it on the hair on the back of your neck.”

Garcetti said last week that he would not sign an earlier version of the proposed agreement, even though it included three consecutive years of zero raises and reduced pension benefits for future DWP employees. Compensation at the city-owned utility became a major campaign issue in this year’s mayoral race when the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and its affiliates spent $2 million to defeat Garcetti.

On Monday, Garcetti sought to ramp up pressure for more concessions by launching an online petition asking Angelenos to support his efforts to secure new language allowing elected officials to seek changes to costly or inefficient work rules.

The newly revised labor agreement would reduce entry-level pay for 34 categories of DWP employees, or about 870 employees or 11% of the utility’s workers, according to Santana’s memo.

The proposal also would give the mayor and council more power to re-examine agreements affecting DWP bonuses, overtime and work rules, according to the memo. Garcetti has taken aim at those agreements, which can cost ratepayers millions annually, particularly one that requires DWP workers to be offered overtime pay when outside contractors are hired.

Wesson and Garcetti both sought the latest changes, which were supported in recent days by the chief negotiator for the DWP union, the memo said.

Garcetti spokesman Yusef Robb would not say if the mayor would support the revised deal, but noted that “important progress” had been made. Wesson said negotiations had seen “movement” in the last 48 hours and talks were continuing.

“Did the council want to take a vote? Yes,” he said. “But there’s still things that you need to iron out. And that’s what we’re doing now.”

Councilman Paul Koretz, who previously signaled his support for the salary proposal, said he expected Garcetti to find common ground with the council. “I thought even the original deal was incredibly positive for the city,” he said. “I’ve been pleasantly surprised that it’s been slightly improved as negotiations go along.”

Garcetti told a room full of neighborhood activists at City Hall on Monday that he was not satisfied that enough progress had been made on work rules, the size of the 2016 raise and employee contributions toward health insurance costs. On Tuesday, he sent out an email blast to supporters laying out his case for additional contract changes.

“You elected me mayor to reform DWP, and just six weeks after taking office, your vote is making a difference,” Garcetti said in the email. “Right now, there is a new DWP contract proposal on the table and I want to make sure it delivers real reform to save money for you.”

The latest salary reductions would save $15.4 million over four years, according to Santana’s memo. Overall, the proposal is projected to save $4 billion over 30 years, chiefly from reduced pension outlays, according to the council’s policy advisors.

“The fiscal situation is grave enough, the threat of sequestration is so serious in terms of its impact on our domestic priorities and on our security, that I believe that if we can get this in front of the Congress, because it will have huge public support, it will pass,” Mr. Levin said in an interview.

But even the architects of such efforts are pessimistic that they have time to win passage.

“I think sequester’s going to happen,” Mr. Coburn said. “I think people want it to happen.”

Yet the economic recovery remains weak, and unemployment high. This week, Washington got one of the first signs of how the sequester might play out in the economy, when government figures showed that the economy had contracted in the final three months of 2012, largely a result of a 22 percent drop in military spending.

Economists cautioned that they did not expect such a precipitous decline to continue in the coming quarters. Moreover, the drop came after a surge in military spending in the third quarter, as offices rushed to spend money obligated to the 2012 fiscal year."

“According to what has been publicly reported about the Gang of Eight’s forthcoming immigration bill, there appears to be a major flaw that could allow millions of illegal immigrants to access federal welfare benefits and poverty programs,” the GOP Budget Committee staff wrote in a statement to media.

“Specifically, there is nothing in the framework to apply federal public charge law to those in the country illegally before they are granted legal status. What this means is that the bill would create an end-run around federal law: individuals in the country illegally could receive legal status without having to demonstrate financial self-sufficiency.”

The statement adds that the Senators in the Gang of Eight “have suggested that cost will not be an issue because amnestied illegal immigrants will not be eligible for certain public aid and welfare programs during a temporary period of probationary legal status (although even this is in growing doubt given the outcome of the relevant vote during the recent consideration of the Senate budget).”

“But, crucially, once this status ends and they become eligible for green cards, those who illegally immigrated will have access to a wide array of public assistance programs,” they wrote.

“Green card holders are currently eligible for Medicaid, TANF, Supplemental Security Income, child care assistance, food stamps, and a variety of other welfare benefits and public aid programs. The Budget Committee Republican staff estimates that costs could be upwards of $40 billion in 2022 alone, just for Medicaid and Obamacare. The long-term unfunded liability for Obamacare would grow another $2 trillion.”

The statement notes that existing federal law is being overlooked in the rush to pass comprehensive immigration reform: “The net costs would be enormous and only increase once citizenship is granted (and would extend to our nation’s retirement programs as well). Additionally, during their probationary status, there are still a number of ways previously illegal immigrants could draw means-tested public aid for their households–which is the reason why federal law deems all immigrants likely to be a public charge inadmissible to the country regardless of whether they are applying for temporary, permanent, or any other form of legal status.”

Read the whole statement here.

Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio’s spokesman Alex Conant responded to that analysis by saying: “Since we don’t yet have a legislative proposal, it’s not possible to come up with anything resembling an accurate calculation about the potential fiscal impact of bipartisan immigration reform. Obviously we share concerns about the potential fiscal impact of changes to our immigration system, which is why we will ask for an in-depth CBO analysis to inform debate around the bipartisan proposal. Senator Rubio has been clear that he will only support legislation that prohibits undocumented immigrants from receiving any Federal benefits, and in our negotiations, the Democrats have gone along with that demand – even agreeing to a partial repeal of Obamacare to bar undocumented immigrants benefits. In the long-term, there’s no question that modernizing our broken legal immigration will be very good for our nation’s economy.”"

So, by heading down that path, Republicans would cost themselves most if not all Democratic votes. That would force Republicans to find the votes for an extension from their own caucus—but given the narrow and fractious nature of the GOP majority, it's hard to see how that's possible. Republicans need Democratic votes.

If they elect to move forward anyway, there's another problem with the ""No budget, no pay"" idea: It's not Constitutional. The 27th Amendment clearly bars Congress from changing its own pay. And a top Republican is ready to shoot it down:



The chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee said constitutional problems may doom a debt ceiling plan announced earlier Friday by House leaders, but the Republican lawmaker said he has a replacement in mind. “That’s unconstitutional,” Rep. Darrell Issa said of the plan to withhold members’ pay if their chamber does not pass a budget resolution. House Republicans have dubbed the proposal “no budget, no pay.”

Issa says he wants the legislation to tie the debt ceiling itself to passage of a budget. But that goes beyond mere ""gimmick"" and brings us right back to a hostage crisis situation—and that's what created this problem in the first place.

Bottom line, it seems like Republicans have three options: (1) they can pass a clean extension of the debt limit, as Cantor's initial statement seemed to be saying they would, (2) they can try to pass a debt limit extension that includes the unconstitutional ""no budget, no pay"" gimmick, or (3) they can go back to hostage crisis mode, right back where we started.

Only one of those three options—the first—is at all viable. And in a sign of the clown show that is today's GOP, it's still not clear what they are going to do, even though hours earlier they sent a message loud and clear that they were waving the white flag of surrender.

Issa, in a bit of ass covering, elaborates to TPM, saying he expects a final measure to have cleared up any constitutional issues. Let's be clear though, he still thinks (correctly) that it's unconstitutional to change the amount of money members of Congress get paid during a term. Pay could be withheld or delayed, but not eliminated. And he still favors explicit language holding the debt limit hostage to budgetary politics. In other words, Issa's preferred outcome is still one with a hostage crisis: he just wants a different ransom letter. And it's a nonstarter."

The Federal Reserve will begin circulating a redesigned %24100 bill this fall

It will have several new security features

The %24100 is the most-counterfeited bill

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve announced Wednesday that it will begin circulating a redesigned $100 bill this fall, more than two years after its initial target.

The Fed has set a target date of Oct. 8. The redesigned note incorporates added security features, such as a blue, 3-D security ribbon and a disappearing Liberty Bell in an inkwell. The features are designed to thwart counterfeiters.

The revamped bill had been expected to go into circulation in February 2011. But in December 2010, officials announced an indefinite delay. They said they needed more time to fix production issues that left unwanted creases in many of the notes.

""We made numerous process changes to address the creasing issue and we are back in full production,"" said Dawn Haley, a spokeswoman for the Bureau of Engraving and Printing.

Haley said those changes include modifying the paper feeder on printing presses to accommodate variations in the paper associated with the 3-D security ribbon. The blue security ribbon is composed of thousands of tiny lenses. Those lenses magnify the objects underneath them to make them appear to be moving in the opposite direction from the way the bill is being moved.

Benjamin Franklin's portrait will remain on the $100 bill, the highest value denomination in general circulation and the most frequent target of counterfeiters.

The $100 bill is the last note to undergo an extensive redesign aimed at thwarting counterfeiters who have access to ever-more sophisticated copying machines.

The redesigns began in 2003 when the government added splashes of color to the $20 bill. That makeover was followed by redesigns for the $50, $10 and $5 bills. The $1 bill isn't getting a makeover.

An extensive public education effort is planned for businesses and consumers around the world to raise awareness of the new design and provide information on how to use the new security features.More information about the redesigned $100 bill can be found at newmoney.gov."

We'll leave,"Wal-Mart is butting heads with Washington, D.C., over a city council vote that would require large box retailers to pay employees $12.50 an hour at minimum.

That’s more than the local minimum wage of $8.25 an hour, but no matter. A day after Wal-Mart pushed back, threatening to drop plans to build three stores in the nation's capital and reconsider its commitment to three more, D.C. lawmakers approved the bill. If signed by the mayor, the bill would require retailers with more than $1 billion in U.S. annual sales and stores 75,000 square feet or larger to pay a higher minimum wage than that of the city.

From the debate has emerged a question other U.S. cities may have: Will Wal-Mart be able to break into cities, traditionally union strongholds?



With rural and suburban America reaching saturation, Wal-Mart’s push into heavily Democratic cities has been met so far with resistance from community leaders and politicians demanding that the retailer pay its employees more.

""In terms of the major urban centers, their low wages and poor labor practices have been a large barrier,"" said Ken Jacobs, chair of the University of California Berkeley Center for Labor Research and Education.

Wal-Mart spokesman Steve Restivo said by email that the decision to pull out and suspend projects in the District will be a ""difficult decision.""

There’s also the concern that Wal-Mart wouldn’t abandon D.C. – but would shrink its new store blueprints to below the 75,000-square-foot threshold. (It would be tough to shrink profits: In the first quarter ending April 30, net sales were $113.4 billion company-wide, and income was $3.78 billion.)

""The fear I have is they might scale back,"" said Joslyn Williams, president of the Metropolitan Washington Council of the AFL-CIO.

Despite an improving economy, Reverend Graylan Hagler, leader of a social justice-focused think tank of clergy members, said residents in poor neighborhoods were being left on the sidelines.

""There’s a corporate responsibility here, not only of providing jobs but of providing meaningful and dignified jobs,” Hagler said.

Wal-Mart says its average hourly wage for full-time, non-managerial employees in the U.S. is $12.78, and $12.39 in Virginia. ""Our wages and benefits meet or exceed those offered by most of our competitors,"" Restivo said.

But Jacobs, the Berkeley labor professor, says those wages don’t represent workers overall.

""That $12.78 really masks the fact that you have a significant number of part-time workers, who are paid less,"" he said.

(Restivo said that ""most"" of Wal-Mart's workforce is full-time, but he declined to provide a percentage.)

In a 2011 paper, Jacobs said Wal-Mart could absorb the cost of a wage increase. He said even passing it along to customers would only have an incremental effect on prices.

This isn’t the first time local lawmakers have targeted Wal-Mart over wages. A similar big-box wage measure in Chicago failed in 2006 after Wal-Mart objected and then-mayor Richard Daley vetoed the legislation. Supporters fear a similar outcome in Washington, D.C., as Mayor Vincent Gray has “serious concerns” about the city council’s bill, his spokesman Pedro Ribeiro said.

Even if Wal-Mart wins this round, Jacobs said the company will have to address its low wages if it wants to break into American cities. ""At some point, Wal-Mart is going to have to deal with this issue,"" he said. ""Ultimately, I think if cities go forward with these initiatives, Wal-Mart is going to be forced to bend.""

He Has Previously Worked As A Reporter For Newspapers In Minnesota', 'Virginia']","California adds jobs, but unemployment rate rises to 8.9%","California’s employers created 29,100 net jobs in August, but the unemployment rate edged up for the second month in a row, climbing to 8.9% from 8.7% the month before, the state’s Employment Development Department reported Friday.

The jobless rate has climbed nearly half a percentage point since June even as employers have added nearly 57,000 jobs to their payrolls during that time.

Friday’s data painted a tepid picture of the Golden State’s economy, which has hit a soft patch during the summer months, economists said. The labor force has declined by 65,000 people since June.

“The labor market appears to be going sideways,” said Robert Kleinhenz, chief economist at Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp. “We see a month of improvement and maybe a month of retrenchment, and that’s a discouraging story to report.”

Earlier this year, California was outpacing the nation’s rate of job creation, with payroll growth hovering around 2%. But since August 2012, the state has added 223,900 jobs for a growth rate of 1.5%.

“Here we are in the middle of the year ... and the economy has shifted down to second gear,” Kleinhenz said.

Still, the payroll numbers show California has continued adding jobs. Those numbers are derived from a separate survey than the unemployment rate and are considered more reliable because the payroll survey takes in a larger sample of businesses and fluctuates less from month to month.

California’s net increase of 29,100 jobs in August was spread across nine of 11 sectors.

The most jobs were added in the construction industry, which expanded by 7,700 positions last month. The sector is still thousands of jobs below its pre-recession peak, when contractors were throwing up new homes at a breakneck pace.

The housing recovery has lent a huge assist as demand for multi-unit housing continues propelling economic growth. That has led to construction posting the fastest growth rate — 5% — of all sectors. It has added 29,100 jobs since August 2012.

The professional and business services sector, which includes occupations such as lawyers, accountants and engineers, added 6,300 jobs last month. Educational and health services added 4,300 jobs; leisure and hospitality grew by 3,000 jobs.

Reflecting muted expectations by retailers for the holiday shopping season, retail and wholesale trade declined by a combined 5,000 jobs in August.

In its latest monthly review, the National Retail Federation said consumer spending has grown only modestly through the recovery.

“It is impossible to generate stronger economic growth in a consumer-based economy if personal income gains remain weak,” according to the federation’s September report written by its chief economist, Jack Kleinhenz.

The sluggishness of the labor market has frustrated 42-year-old Melvina White, a former medical assistant who has been out of work since 2009.

In recent months, she has broadened her job search outside the medical field to include jobs in retail and fast food. But with such a large gap in her work history, employers haven’t given her applications more than a cursory glance, she said.

“At this point, I’m looking for anything,” White said.

These days, she’s living with an aunt in Los Angeles and relies on public transit to get around the city. Going back to school to beef up her skills is tough without a job to cover costs, she said.

“From my perspective, it’s getting worse,” White said. “At this point, I’m getting ready to leave California.”

Friday’s jobs report comes on the heels of the surprise decision this week by the Federal Reserve to keep its monetary policy in place. Despite an improvement in the U.S. unemployment rate, Fed policymakers said Wednesday that the economy is still not strong enough to handle a reduction in a key stimulus program.

The Fed also downgraded its forecast for economic growth. Policymakers now expect 2013 growth to be between 2% and 2.3% — down from the June forecast of 2.3% to 2.6%.

The U.S. economy faces the threat of a federal government shutdown as well: House Republicans approved a spending bill Friday that would defund President Obama’s healthcare law, setting up a showdown with the Democratic-controlled Senate. If the impasse isn’t resolved in the next few weeks, it risks causing the first government shutdown in two decades. That could throw a wrench into job growth later this year, economists said.

Barring a government shutdown and any unexpected calamity, California’s job growth is expected to pick up later this year as government tax revenue recovers and Europe’s economy improves. Those factors should offset the decline in government jobs and boost manufacturing and trade, said Esmael Adibi, director of Chapman University’s A. Gary Anderson Center for Economic Research.

Southern California counties all notched job gains last month, helping push down local unemployment rates in most counties.

Los Angeles County payrolls added 6,500 jobs, but the county’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose to 10.1% from 9.9% the month before, partly because its labor force grew by 12,000.

Orange County added 2,400 jobs last month, pushing down its unemployment rate to 6.2% from 6.5% the month before. San Diego County added nearly 3,000 jobs, and its unemployment rate declined to 7.4% last month from 7.8% in July.

The Inland Empire, which includes Riverside and San Bernardino counties, added 14,100 jobs. Its unemployment rate dropped to 10.4% last month from 11% in July.

“It’s going to happen,” said Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio and a leading conservative voice in the House. “It’s not the end of the world.”

For weeks, President Obama has barnstormed the country, warning of the dire consequences of the cuts to military readiness, educators, air travel and first responders even as the White House acknowledges that some of the disruptions will take weeks to emerge.

The reverse side has gone unmentioned: Some of the most liberal members of Congress see the cuts as a rare opportunity to whittle down Pentagon spending. The poor are already shielded from the worst of the cuts, and the process could take pressure off the Democratic Party, at least in the short run, to tamper with Social Security and Medicare."

http://news.yahoo.com/tax-bills-rich-families-approach-30-high-123724197.html,,[],Tax bills for rich families approach 30-year high,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The poor rich.

With Washington gridlocked again over whether to raise their taxes, it turns out wealthy families already are paying some of their biggest federal tax bills in decades even as the rest of the population continues to pay at historically low rates.

President Barack Obama and Democratic leaders in Congress say the wealthy must pay their fair share if the federal government is ever going to fix its finances and reduce the budget deficit to a manageable level.

A new analysis, however, shows that average tax bills for high-income families rarely have been higher since the Congressional Budget Office began tracking the data in 1979. Middle- and low-income families aren't paying as much as they used to.

For 2013, families with incomes in the top 20 percent of the nation will pay an average of 27.2 percent of their income in federal taxes, according to projections by the Tax Policy Center, a research organization based in Washington. The top 1 percent of households, those with incomes averaging $1.4 million, will pay an average of 35.5 percent.

Those tax rates, which include income, payroll, corporate and estate taxes, are among the highest since 1979.

The average family in the bottom 20 percent of households won't pay any federal taxes. Instead, many families in this group will get payments from the federal government by claiming more in credits than they owe in taxes, including payroll taxes. That will give them a negative tax rate.

""My sense is that high-income people feel abused by being targeted always for more taxes,"" Roberton Williams, a fellow at the Tax Policy Center, said. ""You can understand why they feel that way.""

Last week, Senate Democrats were unable to advance their proposal to raise taxes on some wealthy families for the second time this year as part of a package to avoid automatic spending cuts. The bill failed Thursday when Republicans blocked it. A competing Republican bill that included no tax increases also failed, and the automatic spending cuts began taking effect Friday.

Story continues

The issue, however, isn't going away.

Obama and Democratic leaders in Congress insist that any future deal to reduce government borrowing must include a mix of spending cuts and more tax revenue.

""I am prepared to do hard things and to push my Democratic friends to do hard things,"" Obama said Friday. ""But what I can't do is ask middle-class families, ask seniors, ask students to bear the entire burden of deficit reduction when we know we've got a bunch of tax loopholes that are benefiting the well-off and the well-connected, aren't contributing to growth, aren't contributing to our economy. It's not fair. It's not right.""

On Sunday, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said Republicans are committed to reducing the budget deficit without raising taxes again. In a separate broadcast interview, White House economic adviser Gene Sperling called that position unreasonable.

The Democrats' sequester bill included the ""Buffett Rule,"" named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett. It gradually would phase in a requirement that people making more than $1 million a year pay at least 30 percent of their income in federal taxes.

The rule targets millionaires who make most of their money from investments — capital gains and qualified dividends, which have a top tax rate of 20 percent.

""It's fairness,"" said Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo. ""We're not raising taxes with the Buffett rule as much as we are correcting an inequity in terms of, one guy can be working at one end of the hall and because he's working with hedge funds, he gets taxed at 20 percent. Another guy at the other end of the hall is on a salary at an insurance company and he has to pay (39.6 percent). That's just not fair.""

On average, households making more than $1 million this year will pay 37.2 percent of their income in federal taxes, according to the Tax Policy Center. But there are exceptions.

For example, the Internal Revenue Service tracks tax returns for the 400 highest-paid filers each year. Those taxpayers made an average of $202 million in 2009, the latest year available. Their average federal income tax rate: 19.9 percent.

That's still higher than the tax rate paid by most middle-income families, but not by much.

The middle 20 percent of U.S. households — those making an average of $46,600 — will pay an average of 13.8 percent of their income in federal taxes for this year, according to the Tax Policy Center. Over the past three decades, the average federal tax rate for this group has been about 16 percent.

The Associated Press analyzed two sets of data to compare tax burdens over time.

The CBO produces data from 1979 to 2009; the center has overlapping data from 2004 through 2013. Both get tax data from the IRS, but they use slightly different methodologies to calculate federal tax burdens.

Still, their numbers track closely enough to make some general observations. For example, it is clear that for 2013, average tax bills for the wealthy will be among the highest since 1979. It also is clear that federal taxes for middle- and low-income households will stay well below their averages for the same period.

Liberals and many Democrats say rich families can afford to pay higher taxes because their incomes have grown much more than incomes for middle- and low-income families.

Average after-tax incomes for the top 1 percent of households more than doubled from 1979 to 2009, increasing by 155 percent, according to the CBO. Average incomes for those in the middle increased by just 32 percent during the same period while those at the bottom saw their incomes go up by 45 percent.

""You've got to think about the context,"" said Chuck Marr, director of federal tax policy for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank. ""We just had three decades in the United States where we had a tremendous increase in inequality.""

The growing disparity in income is a big reason why tax bills for the rich are approaching 30-year highs, Williams said. As the rich get richer, a greater share of their income is taxed at the top rate, he said.

High-income families also have been targeted by tax increases this year, including a new tax law passed by Congress on Jan. 1 as well as tax increases in the president's health care law.

The new tax law made the federal income tax more progressive, increasing the top tax rate from 35 percent to 39.6 percent, on taxable income above $400,000 for individuals and $450,000 for married couples filing jointly. Lower tax rates on income below those amounts were made permanent. Also, tax breaks for low-income families first enacted as part of Obama's 2009 stimulus package were extended through 2017.

Conservatives say raising taxes again on the wealthy would reduce their incentive to save and invest, hurting long-term economic growth.

""Raising taxes hurts the economy, and raising taxes on upper-income individuals — whether those who work for salaries or those who save and earn capital income — always hurts the economy the most,"" said J.D. Foster, a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. ""Spite and envy are not sound bases for public policy.""

Besides, Republican leaders in Congress say, one tax increase a year is more than enough.

""Let's make it clear that the president got his tax hikes on Jan. 1,"" House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said Friday. ""This discussion about revenue, in my view, is over.""

The partial government shutdown is now in its eighth day. While some people aren't feeling the impact yet, effects are hitting communities across the country.

Here's what you need to know.

What's happening in Washington (or, what's not happening)



While Republicans and Democrats are expected to do a lot of talking Tuesday, little of it is with members of the opposite party to work on a way to break the stalemate.

House Speaker John Boehner indicated that he's willing to talk. He told reporters Tuesday he's ""not drawing any lines in the sand."" ""I want to have a conversation,"" he told reporters in Washington. ""It's time to ... resolve our differences.""

President Obama called Speaker Boehner Tuesday morning – just minutes after his statement. The president said he is willing to negotiate, but only “after the threat of government shutdown and default have been removed.” In other words, nothing’s changed.

Obama could move the discussion forward when he speaks to reporters Tuesday afternoon.

And Senate Democratic and Republican leaders will also talk to reporters - separately - after their weekly lunches.

Debt ceiling debate: Preaching to the choir

Setting up the next fiscal fight, Senate Democrats could up the ante by filing a bill today that would lift the country's debt limit and force Republicans to go on record as having voted against it. The Treasury runs out of ways to pay its debts sometime after next Thursday, which administration officials say would be catastrophic to the country's economy. But some on the right aren't so sure that would be a bad thing.

The bill would increase the debt ceiling until after the 2014 elections and does not include any of the demands issued by Republicans, such as reductions in government spending and changes to the health care law.

The Senate has not agreed to take up a bill, however, that would provide back pay to furloughed government workers. The House passed it Saturday. The second-ranking Senate Republican, Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, said, ""I think it's really premature to be dealing with that until we resolve the underlying problem.""

What history says

The White House vows it will not negotiate any policy concessions attached to an increase in the nation's debt ceiling, hoping to avoid a sideshow every time the limit needs to be raised. But there is precedent for Congress to link other issues to such a hike.

• In 1989, the House and Senate agreed to repeal a tax rule approved three years earlier barring discrimination in employer-paid health insurance plans.

• And in 2011, an increase in the debt ceiling was allowed after promised budget cuts outlined in the Budget Control Act.

• Even more, in the 1970s and 1980s, votes on the debt limit included requirements for a balanced budget vote, a cigarette tax and the push for an alternative minimum tax.

Your count seems a bit off

Boehner said he doesn't have the votes to pass a ""clean"" continuing resolution - a bill with no strings attached that would fund the government for the next month or two.

But CNN surveyed the House and found that 218 lawmakers would support a ""clean"" government funding bill. CNN has identified 200 Democrats and 18 Republicans who would support such a measure. That is one more than the 217 is the number of votes needed to pass a bill in the House.

Shutdown showdown: Where it's headed

Additionally, if Boehner brought a ""clean CR"" to the floor, there's a good chance a lot more Republicans would probably join in, one Republican said. But the 17 who said publicly they'd vote for a clean CR declined an opportunity in a procedural vote Monday night to break with their party on the funding issue.

There's your problem right there

John King, CNN chief national correspondent, says the problem with the current stalemate is a lack of trust.

""(W)hat you don't have is that basic trust and the people who matter most - the people who can deliver a deal to the finish line - sitting down together. In part because the president says he won't negotiate at all on the issue of a government shutdown, and he won't negotiate for the debt ceiling increase.

""So, the trust deficit at the moment is still in the way of any progress. We're on Day 8. That debt ceiling deadline (is) now within 10 days from now. The government would run out of money within a week or two of that.

""Forgive me, but you should have Bill Murray come in and do this for the next couple days because it seems like 'Groundhog Day.' ""



There's a lot of anger

Most Americans say the partial government shutdown is causing a crisis or major problems for the country, according to a new national poll.

And while the CNN/ORC International survey also indicates that slightly more people are angry at Republicans than Democrats or President Obama for the shutdown, it is clear that both sides are taking a hit.

Huge majorities of Democrats are angry at Republicans, and huge majorities of Republicans are angry at Obama and Democrats. Independents are equally angry at all sides, with 59% of independents very or somewhat angry at Democrats, six in 10 angry at the GOP, and 58% angry at Obama.

What's more, the poll indicates that 18% of the public says the shutdown is a crisis and an additional 49% say the shutdown has caused major problems.

Would a shot of caffeine help?

The Starbucks Corp. CEO is using his megaphone to express his discontent. Howard Schultz urged fellow business leaders to ratchet up the pressure on U.S. political leaders to end the stalemate.

""This weekend I heard from several business leaders who shared their concern about our relative silence and impact in urging the political leadership to act on behalf of the citizenry,"" he wrote in a letter posted on the company's website. ""It is our responsibility to address the crisis of confidence that is needlessly being set in motion.""

Government shutdown: What's closed, what's open

And a wealthy couple donated $10 million to reopen shuttered Head Start programs around the country. Laura and John Arnold's donation will allow 7,200 children to return to the early education program for low-income children.



Health concerns

While Washington politicians appear to be playing a game of chicken over who will cave first, a dangerous salmonella outbreak, probably caused from tainted chicken, has affected at least 278 people in 18 states and raises questions about food safety during the partial shutdown.

While the agency is working to contain the problem, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Thomas Frieden, tweeted his frustration with his agency's inability to do its job during the shutdown. ""Microbes/other threats didn't shut down. We are less safe,"" he said via Twitter last week.

CDC had to furlough 8,754 people. They protected you yesterday, can't tomorrow. Microbes/other threats didn't shut down. We are less safe. — Dr. Tom Frieden (@DrFriedenCDC) October 2, 2013

Comings and goings

The CDC's 8,754 furloughed workers are a small portion of the approximately 483,000 government employees told to stay at home during the partial shutdown.

After Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said most of the furloughed civilians at the Defense Department would be called back to work, just 14% of federal workers are now listed as furloughed.

Obama calls Boehner as stalemate continues over shutdown, default

And the Federal Aviation Administration is telling more than 800 employees to return to work, including 600 inspectors and safety staff.

Other agencies are just now beginning their furloughs. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission said Monday it expects to furlough about 3,900 employees at the close of business Thursday if the impasse isn't resolved.

The National Guard is attempting to weather the storm.

In Florida, nearly 1,000 Florida National Guard employees were called back to work Monday, but it could be short-lived.

""We have no money to do operations and maintenance,"" Major Gen. Emmett Titshaw said. ""We can't buy fuel, we can't buy parts, and so we are very limited in our training.""

The Guard is facing another shutdown mid-month if money issues and the federal government shutdown aren't resolved.

And in Idaho, half of the state's National Guard - 850 civilian workers - has been furloughed. If there is an emergency, such as a wildfire, the state will step in and provide funding.

No fear, though. Newly elected Republican Rep. Mark Sanford of South Carolina brought the total down a few by recalling all the furloughed workers in his office.



Shutdown meltdown: for the economy

If the weeklong government shutdown stretches to a month, it would cost the economy $50 billion.

That estimate is actually $5 billion lower than the initial estimate of Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody's Analytics. He lowered his forecast after the Defense Department recalled nearly half of 800,000 federal employees furloughed last week, and it appeared that Congress would quickly approve a measure to pay other furloughed workers retroactively.

That's only the direct impact. There are indirect costs, too.

... for consumers

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have relaxed rules that would have kept banks from approving mortgages during the government shutdown.

Typically, Fannie and Freddie require lenders to verify a borrower's income with the Internal Revenue Service before closing on a mortgage. But last week, some lenders reported that they could not approve the mortgages because the shutdown had severely curtailed IRS operations.

The government-backed mortgage giants have since said lenders could continue to issue new loans even without the IRS's confirmation.



... and around the world

China and Japan, which hold a combined $2.4 trillion in U.S. debt, have called for a quick resolution to the crisis and expressed worries about the economic consequences of a default.

In the first official response by China, Vice Finance Minister Zhu Guangyao said that a solution must be found quickly in order to ""ensure the safety of Chinese investments"" and provide stability for economies around the globe.

A senior Japanese official, speaking to the Financial Times, said that country's Ministry of Finance is ""very worried,"" and cited the market turmoil and ""chaos"" brought on by the failed House vote to authorize bank bailout funds in 2008.

Republicans accuse administration of inflicting added budget pain,"Is the Obama administration employing a make-it-hurt strategy to gain political leverage in the budget battle on Capitol Hill?

Republicans are making that charge as the stalemate drags on, and point to the Pentagon furlough of 400,000 civilian staffers -- even though Congress passed and the president signed a bill to supposedly keep them on the job.

The partial government suspension, which started Monday after lawmakers failed to strike a budget deal, is expected to result in the furlough of roughly 800,000 total government workers. Many federal agencies have significantly curtailed their operations; national parks and monuments are closed.

But Republicans are accusing the Obama administration of making the situation worse than it has to be. They complained overnight that the Pentagon furloughed 400,000 of its civilian staffers.

""This is no time to use national security or our national security workforce as a political pawn,"" Rep. Buck McKeon, R-Calif., wrote in a letter to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel.

More On This...

The dispute comes ahead of a planned White House meeting late Wednesday afternoon. House Speaker John Boehner and other congressional leaders have agreed to meet with Obama to discuss the stalemate. ""We're pleased the president finally recognizes that his refusal to negotiate is indefensible. It's unclear why we'd be having this meeting if it's not meant to be a start to serious talks between the two parties,"" Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck said in a statement.

The bill concerning military pay was the only piece of legislation that Congress passed -- and Obama signed -- in the run-up to the midnight deadline on Monday. According to the text, it would pay the Armed Forces, as well as civilian and contractor personnel deemed to be ""providing support"" to the Armed Forces.

Nevertheless, the Pentagon determined that 400,000 were ""not necessary"" to that mission and sent them home on Monday. According to a document circulated in the Pentagon, they will be considered ""non-pay, non-duty"" until the budget standoff is over.

Asked about McKeon's letter, a senior Defense official indicated there was no way to respond. ""Unfortunately, most of the staff who draft congressional correspondence are furloughed,"" the official told Fox News.

Pentagon officials have indicated a willingness to examine the law to see if there's any wiggle room to bring more civilians back to work.

Republicans argue that the intent of the law was to keep them on the job, and that the Obama administration ""narrowly interpreted"" it against congressional intent in order to furlough more employees.

It's one example of how, Republicans say, the administration is making the partial shutdown of government services worse than it needs to be. Many have complained about the National Park Service cordoning off even open-air monuments in Washington, D.C., such as the World War II Memorial.

House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Doc Hastings, R-Wash., accused the administration of selectively closing parks. His office noted that less-visited sites like the Constitutional Gardens remain open, while major draws like the National Mall are closed.

""It appears as though only the highly visible monuments and areas are being closed to the public -- further proof that the Obama Administration is only playing politics and purposely choosing to make this shut down as painful as possible,"" he said in a statement.

House Republicans are trying to push a series of mini-spending bills aimed at prying open certain portions of the government, including national parks and monuments.

After failing to get the bills passed on Tuesday, Republicans will try once again on Wednesday. In addition to bills funding the National Park Service and Veterans Affairs operations, and allowing the District of Columbia to spend money, Republicans are putting up more spending bills specific to the National Institutes of Health and the National Guard and Reserves.

But Democrats have made clear that they do not intend to accept any of them, pressuring Republicans to instead pass a ""clean"" budget bill -- or one that does not include any riders that would chip away at ObamaCare.

Republicans have insisted that the budget bill include measures that defund, delay or rein in parts of the health care law. Democrats refused, and both parties were at an impasse at midnight on Monday.

Democrats have telegraphed that they don't want to let Republicans pry open select parts of government in order to ease the pressure.

""It is time for Speaker Boehner to stop the games, think about the people he is hurting, and let the House pass the Senate's bill to re-open the government with Republican and Democratic votes,"" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Tuesday night.

The White House has also rejected the bills in advance.

""The president and the Senate have been clear that they won't accept this kind of game-playing, and if these bills were to come to the president's desk he would veto them,"" said White House spokeswoman Amy Brundage. ""These piecemeal efforts are not serious and they are no way to run a government.""

Mike Steel, spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, fired back, ""How does the White House justify signing the troop funding bill, but vetoing similar measures for veterans, National Parks, and District of Columbia? The President can't continue to complain about the impact of the government shutdown on veterans, visitors at National Parks, and DC while vetoing bills to help them. The White House position is unsustainably hypocritical."""

We'll leave,"Wal-Mart is butting heads with Washington, D.C., over a city council vote that would require large box retailers to pay employees $12.50 an hour at minimum.

That’s more than the local minimum wage of $8.25 an hour, but no matter. A day after Wal-Mart pushed back, threatening to drop plans to build three stores in the nation's capital and reconsider its commitment to three more, D.C. lawmakers approved the bill. If signed by the mayor, the bill would require retailers with more than $1 billion in U.S. annual sales and stores 75,000 square feet or larger to pay a higher minimum wage than that of the city.

From the debate has emerged a question other U.S. cities may have: Will Wal-Mart be able to break into cities, traditionally union strongholds?



With rural and suburban America reaching saturation, Wal-Mart’s push into heavily Democratic cities has been met so far with resistance from community leaders and politicians demanding that the retailer pay its employees more.

""In terms of the major urban centers, their low wages and poor labor practices have been a large barrier,"" said Ken Jacobs, chair of the University of California Berkeley Center for Labor Research and Education.

Wal-Mart spokesman Steve Restivo said by email that the decision to pull out and suspend projects in the District will be a ""difficult decision.""

There’s also the concern that Wal-Mart wouldn’t abandon D.C. – but would shrink its new store blueprints to below the 75,000-square-foot threshold. (It would be tough to shrink profits: In the first quarter ending April 30, net sales were $113.4 billion company-wide, and income was $3.78 billion.)

""The fear I have is they might scale back,"" said Joslyn Williams, president of the Metropolitan Washington Council of the AFL-CIO.

Despite an improving economy, Reverend Graylan Hagler, leader of a social justice-focused think tank of clergy members, said residents in poor neighborhoods were being left on the sidelines.

""There’s a corporate responsibility here, not only of providing jobs but of providing meaningful and dignified jobs,” Hagler said.

Wal-Mart says its average hourly wage for full-time, non-managerial employees in the U.S. is $12.78, and $12.39 in Virginia. ""Our wages and benefits meet or exceed those offered by most of our competitors,"" Restivo said.

But Jacobs, the Berkeley labor professor, says those wages don’t represent workers overall.

""That $12.78 really masks the fact that you have a significant number of part-time workers, who are paid less,"" he said.

(Restivo said that ""most"" of Wal-Mart's workforce is full-time, but he declined to provide a percentage.)

In a 2011 paper, Jacobs said Wal-Mart could absorb the cost of a wage increase. He said even passing it along to customers would only have an incremental effect on prices.

This isn’t the first time local lawmakers have targeted Wal-Mart over wages. A similar big-box wage measure in Chicago failed in 2006 after Wal-Mart objected and then-mayor Richard Daley vetoed the legislation. Supporters fear a similar outcome in Washington, D.C., as Mayor Vincent Gray has “serious concerns” about the city council’s bill, his spokesman Pedro Ribeiro said.

Even if Wal-Mart wins this round, Jacobs said the company will have to address its low wages if it wants to break into American cities. ""At some point, Wal-Mart is going to have to deal with this issue,"" he said. ""Ultimately, I think if cities go forward with these initiatives, Wal-Mart is going to be forced to bend.""

This does not bode well for cooperation in government in the near term. Leaders need to lead.

The people in the video snippet seem to be good people who love America. Listening to them show what receiving of a singular message can do to one’s psyche. They simply cannot see that Ted Cruz’s tactic is holding America hostage. By implication they are holding America hostage.

Polls show that Ted Cruz, the Tea Party, and Republicans are taking the brunt of the blame justifiably for the government shutdown. The financial cost of the shutdown was $24.1 Billion. 800,000 workers were furloughed. Not reported as much is the effect it had on the healthcare of children and on the hungry. Not reported as much is the incalculable damage it has done on scientific research.

In their discussion these issues never came up or were glossed over. In their reality the government shutdown was a good thing; fiscal responsibility by all means necessary, even if it means being fiscally irresponsible and inhumane. That by inference is holding America hostage.

This group which is very representative of the Tea Party believes a government’s budget can be treated like one’s personal budget. They believe the grassroots of America is with them. This delusion is similar to the delusion of the 2012 election when less than favorable polls were replaced by their belief in a newly created ‘un-skewed poll’.

The frustration the gentleman speaks about at the end is real to him. The frustration they all feel is real. The answer is to lay to light the real causes of their frustration. It is not Obamacare. It is not government spending. It is a sect of the body politic that has indoctrinated them to look away from the real problems of the country. In effect the frustration is of their own creation which prevents solving the problems they are rightfully frustrated about.

Take another trip down memory lane to re-experience Ryan trying to B.S. his way out of that:



NORAH O'DONNELL (CBS News): Congressman, these defense cuts are part of the Budget Control Act. You voted for the Budget Control Act. In fact I went and looked, you put on the a statement at the time it was passed and you called it a victory, and you called it a positive step forward. So, you voted for defense cuts. And now you're criticizing the president for those same defense cuts that you voted for and called a victory. RYAN: No, no, I have to correct you on this, Norah. I voted for a mechanism that says a sequester will occur if we don't cut $1.2 trillion spending in government.

No, Norah. You're wrong. I didn't vote for it. Instead, I voted for it. So don't say I didn't vote for it, because I did vote for it. Er, I mean, don't say I did vote for it. Because I don't support it now. But I did vote for it. And I reserve the right to say whatever the fuck I please at any point in the future. Okay?



O'DONNELL: Congressman, it's my understanding that as part of the Budget Control Act there was not just the sequestration, the defense sequestration, but there is also $1 trillion in immediate spending cuts, which included the defense cuts, almost $400 billion that were proposed by the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Mr. Dempsey, as well as Secretary Panetta. And you also voted for those. And now you're saying that you didn't vote for them? RYAN: We can get into this nomenclature. I voted for the Budget Control Act but the Obama administration proposed $470 billion in defense cuts. We don't agree with that. Our budget rejected that. And then on top of that is another $500 billion in defense cuts. O'DONNELL: Right, it's a trillion in defense spending. And you voted for it. RYAN: No, Norah, I voted for the Budget Control Act. O'DONNELL: That included defense spending. RYAN: Norah, you're mistaken.

Yeah, Norah. Get your facts straight. Congressman Paul Ryan only voted for whatever he voted for that serves his particular needs at this very moment. Don't go getting technical and stuff about what he did or didn't vote for and what it did or didn't do. That's irrelevant. What matters is Paul Ryan has killer dimples and tremendous abs. And he will get wonky with anybody. Literally, anybody. Anytime, anywhere. Wonk off on demand.

Meanwhile, speaking of wonking off, let's be fair to Paul Ryan. Because even though he spent the 2012 campaign demagoguing on defense spending, the one good thing about his 2011 budget proposal was that he didn't propose spending a single dime more on defense than President Obama.

Click to enlarge

That's from page S-4 of Ryan's 2011 budget plan. Notice all those zeroes? That's the difference between President Obama's budget proposal and Paul Ryan's proposal: nothing. So in more ways than one, by flip-flopping on his 2012 position on defense cuts, Ryan is going back to where he started in 2011.

Personally, I think this obsession with the deficit is misguided, but given the existence of the obsession, there are worse things Paul Ryan has done than embracing the sequester's spending cuts. But as long as that's what he's doing, he should have the courage to admit it, unless all this stuff about wonkiness is just a smokescreen to disguise the fact that he is, at core, just a typical political hack."

Follow Her On Twitter']",President Obama’s accelerating abandonment of principle,"How ironic is the recent news that President Obama engages in crony capitalism and that he doesn’t always play by the rules?

Our righteous president has often leveled such charges against America’s corporate leaders, suggesting they skirt the law of the land, and that the playing field is not level for ordinary people. How disappointing then to find a pattern of favoritism and hypocrisy emerging from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

The most recent revelation concerns health insurance exec Sara Horowitz, who recently won a tax-free $340 million federal loan to set up insurance co-ops in three states as part of the ObamaCare program. This, despite the fact that her company, Freelancers Insurance, has earned distinction as the “worst” insurer two years in a row in her home state of New York and that the firm has been pummeled with unusually high consumer complaints.

[pullquote]

Why would such a dismal performance find favor with the feds? Maybe because Ms. Horowitz and President Obama go way back – back to before the latter was a player on the national scene. Back to when she and Obama together launched liberal think tank Demos along with George Soros, jointly joined that outfit’s board, and before Obama’s caretakers managed to get the record of that alliance scrubbed from Demos’ website. Ms. Horowitz and Mr. Obama are long-time cronies.

This is perhaps small beans. But it is part of a “do what I say not what I do” tendency on the part of Mr. Obama that threatens his credibility.

Consider the emergence of Organizing for Action (OFA), a super PAC in all but name that will lobby for the president’s agenda using his former campaign staff and monies donated by rich supporters. Some $50 million is expected to be raised by the outfit, which will make it, according to the New York Times, one of the best funded lobbying groups in the country.

Nearly everything about this group, from its staffing by Obama apparatchiks to its tax-exempt status to its solicitation of funds from folks looking to become ambassadors, flies in the face of the president’s former condemnation of such secretive influence-peddlers.

Because the group is being set up as a tax-exempt “social welfare group” it is, as the Times points out, not bound by rules that govern federal campaign limits or that preclude Obama aides from raising money. The paper concludes that the new organization will “self-regulate.” Just like hedge funds.

What does this mean? It means that the White House can solicit large gifts from private individuals and from corporations to help advance Mr. Obama’s priorities, without having to play by campaign finance rules.

Organizing for Action has already spent $500,000 funding rallies in support of gun control efforts and will doubtless bus supporters to applaud future appearances by Mr. Obama when he speaks out in favor of immigration control or climate change. This kind of thing happens in North Korea and Venezuela, where despots hire cheering audiences; I’m not aware that it has happened in the U.S. before.

OFA claims on its website that it will not engage in partisan politics, yet one of its first moves was to launch a costly national ad campaign targeting GOP lawmakers in support of gun control legislation. It is sailing, shall we say, close to the wind. So is President Obama.

The president has been especially critical of corporate fund-raising. Who can forget his unprecedented attack on the Supreme Court for its decision allowing corporate campaign donations in the Citizens United case? Obama 2.0 has no such qualms. Not only were corporations ""invited” to fund the second inaugural party, they are also being solicited for OFA.

President Obama has switched ponies not only on financial matters. Contrary to his early criticism of Bush 43’s alleged power grabs in the name of anti-terrorism, Obama’s administration has invoked the so-called state secrets privilege to counter lawsuits over warrantless wiretapping – defenses political commentator and former cable news anchor Keith Olbermann called “radical doctrines of executive secrecy which Bush used.”

The president’s use of drones to kill American citizens, and refusal to turn over documents explaining the legal justification for such adventures, also echo Bush policies he once denounced.

While the president appears comfortable with his access to high-tech assassinations, he apparently doubts that successors will use those same powers for the best interests of the nation. It has emerged that in the months leading up to the election, the White House toiled over codifying presidential use of targeted drone killings, just in case he was not reelected.

Campaigner Obama accused President George Bush of exerting excessive authority to wage war; Obama’s refusal to get authorization from Congress to intervene in Libya is thought by many to have been unconstitutional.

In 2007 he also described Bush 43’s use of executive orders as “an unacceptable abuse of power at home.” This from the man who, because he is so inept at negotiating with Republicans and even Democrats in Congress, has spawned an increasing number of executive orders on issues ranging from cyber security to gun control to immigration policy. When Obama promised to “reach across the aisle,” no one expected his reach to extend across both aisles.

Presidents react with frustration to the limits of their power. They also change course once in office. But President Obama’s accelerating abandonment of principle is profound, and keenly disappointing."

At The Washington Post']",House approves resolution to keep government running; bill heads to Obama,"Congress approved a short-term funding bill Thursday that ends the possibility of a federal government shutdown next week. But a broader budget battle about taxes and spending for the year is just beginning.

The stop-gap spending resolution, approved on a broad bipartisan vote in the House, locks in the $85 billion across-the-board spending cuts known as the sequester through the Sept. 30 end of the fiscal year.

But the legislation includes provisions that will blunt the impact of the sequester. Within hours of the bill’s passage, the Defense Department announced that furlough notices scheduled to go out Friday to 800,000 civilian workers will be delayed until April 5.

That will give officials time to see whether the new budget will still require 22 unpaid days or could result in fewer lost days for workers.

Congress’s action also halted furloughs for thousands of meat inspectors by transferring $55 million from other agriculture programs to ensure meat and poultry plants stay open, agriculture officials said.

The meat lobby, as well as Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, pressed the issue with Congress and the Obama administration, saying the furloughs threatened a multibillion-dollar industry and would have forced an increase in retail meat prices.

The House vote, which provides funding for the government for the six months starting March 28, came a day after the Senate approved the bill. It now goes to President Obama for his signature, ending a relatively smooth and drama-free process for a Congress that has repeatedly found itself deadlocked on spending issues.

Still, the measure covers only the next six months.

Lawmakers are debating how much to tax and spend for the years to come. On Thursday, the House also approved a budget blueprint by Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) in a mostly partisan 221 to 207 vote. Ten Republicans joined House Democrats in opposing the Ryan budget measure.

Ryan’s plan calls for balancing the budget over the decade by slicing $5 trillion from future spending, including by block-granting programs for the poor and overhauling Medicare for people 54 and younger.

Conservatives had insisted that the Ryan plan lock in a balanced budget within the next 10 years. His spending proposals of the past two years took at least 30 years to bring spending into line with government revenue.

Democrats slammed Ryan’s plan as too austere — particularly its proposal to end Medicare as a guaranteed benefit for seniors. They said voters defeated that idea in the presidential election in November.

The Ryan proposal clashes dramatically with a budget proposal offered by Senate Democrats that will face a vote as soon Friday.

The first budget put forward by Senate Democrats in three years, the proposal by Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) would raise taxes by nearly $1 trillion over the next decade in an effort to stabilize deficits but would not balance the budget in that time.

Trying to reconcile those two visions will consume Washington in the coming months, as leaders warily look to the next fiscal showdown: the yet-to-be-determined deadline, somewhere in late summer, when the Treasury will be out of options to manage the federal debt and need congressional approval to increase its borrowing authority.

In blunt terms, House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) acknowledged Thursday that the path ahead is murky: Republicans are demanding reforms to reduce entitlement spending in exchange for increasing the debt ceiling — a position Democrats object to unless large tax revenue is included beyond the more than $600 billion in tax hikes approved New Year’s Day.

“At this point in time, I don’t know how we go forward,” Boehner told reporters.

As Congress prepared to leave for a two-week holiday recess, the attention was fixed on Congress’s success in solving an immediate problem: ensuring the government remains funded.

“This is a good bill. I’m proud of it. I’m proud of the fact that we’ve been able to do all this frankly as smoothly as it’s gone,” Appropriations Committee Chairman Harold Rogers (R-Ky.) told colleagues on the House floor, noting the continuing resolution would be passed more than a week before required.

The resolution will block the impact of the sequester by adding money to certain programs just before the across-the-board reduction hits.

But all additional money was offset with reductions elsewhere, reflecting the sequester’s cut. The government will be able spend $982 billion for the year.

Defense officials have been saying for weeks that the across-the-board spending cuts would force them to furlough civilian employees for up to 22 days between April and the end of the fiscal year. Unions representing federal defense employees have been negotiating with management over conditions of the furloughs, which would have begun one day a week in late April.

The overall size of the cuts will remain the same, but the Pentagon will add $10.4 billion to its operations and maintenance budget, where shortfalls have led to plans to curtail training, suspend some maintenance work and other steps that commanders feared would take a toll on force readiness. Also, the agency will be able to move forward with new investments and contracts that had been held up.

Defense spokesman George Little called the delay a “responsible step to take in order to assure our civilian employees that we do not take lightly the prospect of furloughs and the resulting decrease in employee pay.”

It was unclear Thursday whether a handful of other agencies that the bill gave some flexibility and that had also said their employees faced furloughs would be able to pare back unpaid days.

But a lobbyist for the meat industry praised the action to spare food inspectors.

“We became one of the big examples that was cited of a major impact of sequestration,” said Janet Riley of the American Meat Institute. “If you’re going to put all of our inspectors out, we won’t operate.”

The measure also eliminated the chance of a pay raise for federal workers this year, denying a 0.5 percent increase that Obama proposed and that otherwise would have taken effect in April. The extension of the pay freeze also applies to members of Congress and high-level political appointees. Federal salary rates have been stagnant since January 2010.

House will take up its version of the bill this month

Bill would cut food stamp program by about half a percent

Amendment cuts government%27s share of crop insurance premiums for some farmers

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate on Monday passed a five-year, half-trillion-dollar farm bill that expands government subsidies for crop insurance, rice and peanuts while making small cuts to food stamps.

The bill passed on a bipartisan 66-27 vote. The legislation, which costs almost $100 billion annually, also would eliminate subsidies that are paid to farmers whether they farm or not. All told, it would save about $2.4 billion a year on the farm and nutrition programs, including across-the-board cuts that took effect earlier this year.

Senate Agriculture Chairwoman Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., said the bill would support 16 million American jobs, save taxpayers billions and put into place ""the most significant reforms to agriculture programs in decades."" But it would still generously subsidize corn, soybeans, wheat, cotton, rice, sugar and other major crops grown by U.S. farmers.

The legislation would also set policy for programs to protect environmentally sensitive land, international food aid and other projects to help rural communities. The Senate passed a similar farm bill last year.

House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said Monday that his chamber will take up its version of the farm bill this month. Debate in the House is expected to be contentious and much more partisan than in the Senate, with disagreements among the GOP caucus over domestic food aid that makes up almost 80 percent of the bill's cost.

Last year, the House declined to take up the legislation during an election year amid conflict over how much should be cut from the food stamp program, which now serves one in seven Americans and cost almost $80 billion last year. That cost has more than doubled since 2008.

The bill approved by the House Agriculture Committee last month would make much larger cuts to food stamps than the Senate version, in a bid to gain support from those House conservatives who have opposed the measure. The Senate bill would cut the food stamp program, now known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, by about $400 million a year, or half a percent. The House bill would cut the program by $2 billion a year, or a little more than 3 percent, and make it more difficult for some people to qualify.

In his statement Monday, Boehner signaled support for the House bill's level of food stamp cuts, saying they are changes that ""both parties know are necessary."" Other Republicans are expected to offer amendments to expand the cuts, setting up a potentially even more difficult resolution with the Senate version.

On the Senate floor, senators rejected amendments on food stamp cuts, preserving the $400 million annual decrease. The bill's farm-state supporters also fended off efforts to cut sugar, tobacco and other farm supports.

Senators looking to pare back subsidies did win one victory in the Senate, an amendment to reduce the government's share of crop insurance premiums for farmers with adjusted gross incomes of more than $750,000. Sens. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., and Tom Coburn, R-Okla., said their amendment would affect about 20,000 farmers.

Stabenow argued the amendment would result in fewer people buying insurance and undercut a separate provision in the bill that would require farmers buying crop insurance to comply with certain environmental standards on their land.

Currently the government pays for an average 62 percent of crop insurance premiums and also subsidizes the companies that sell the insurance. The overall bill expands crop insurance for many crops and also creates a program to compensate farmers for smaller, or ""shallow,"" revenue losses before the paid insurance kicks in.

The crop insurance expansion is likely to benefit Midwestern corn and soybean farmers, who use crop insurance more than other farmers. The bill would also boost subsidies for Southern rice and peanut farmers, lowering the threshold for those farms to receive government help.

The help for rice and peanuts was not in last year's bill but was added this year after the agriculture panel gained a new top Republican, Mississippi Sen. Thad Cochran. Critics, including the former top Republican on the committee, Kansas Sen. Pat Roberts, said the new policy could guarantee that the rice and peanut farmers' profits are average or above average.

Critics said the bill would subsidize large corporate farms when farm country is in the middle of an economic boom. Scott Faber of the Environmental Working Group, an advocacy group that has long criticized farm subsidies, said the legislation would simply redirect subsidies and ""needlessly cut nutrition and conservation programs designed to help the hungry and the environment.""

Boehner criticized farm subsidies in the House bill, which are similar to those in the Senate bill, saying his ""concerns about our country's farm programs are well known."" Boehner, a former member of the agriculture panel, has voted against recent farm bills. But he acknowledged that the rest of the chamber might not agree with him.

""If you have ideas on how to make the bill better, bring them forward,"" Boehner said in a statement directed to his colleagues. ""Let's have the debate, and let's vote on them.""

The Senate bill also would:

- Overhaul dairy policy by creating a new insurance program for dairy producers, eliminating other dairy subsidies and price supports. The new policy includes a market stabilization program that could dictate production cuts when oversupply drives down prices. The program faced little opposition in the Senate but a similar overhaul in the House bill is expected to face resistance in that chamber, where Boehner last year called the new stabilization program ""Soviet-style."" He reiterated those concerns in his statement Monday, saying he will support an amendment on the floor to challenge the proposed policy.

- Make modest changes to the way international food aid is delivered, a much scaled-back version of an overhaul proposed by President Barack Obama earlier this year. Senators adopted an amendment that would slightly boost dollars to buy locally-grown food close to needy areas abroad. Currently, most food aid is grown in the United States and shipped to developing countries, an approach the Obama administration says is inefficient but that has support among farm-state members in Congress.

- Consolidate programs to protect environmentally-sensitive land and reduce spending on those programs.

- Expand Agriculture Department efforts to prevent illegal trafficking of food stamp benefits."

The White House had suggested GOP willingness to let sweeping defense cuts take effect was the culprit -- but an aide to House Speaker John Boehner quickly reminded Democrats that Republicans have tried to stop those cuts.

""These arbitrary, automatic cuts were a creation and demand of the White House in 2011,"" Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck said. ""Twice the House has passed legislation to replace them with common sense cuts and reforms. If there was any uncertainty late last year about the sequester, it was because the Democratic-controlled Senate, per usual, never lifted a finger to pass a plan to replace it.""

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi earlier alleged that GOP feet-dragging during talks over the fiscal crisis and willingness to accept automatic defense cuts contributed to the economic squeeze. The Commerce Department report showed the economy shrinking for the first time since 2009.

""Consumer confidence overall has been rising, and consumer spending has been rising, but there's more work to do, and our economy is facing a major headwind ... and that's Republicans in Congress,"" Carney said Wednesday.

The White House press secretary blamed ""talk about letting"" automatic spending cuts kick in, ""as though that were an acceptable thing.""

Carney, however, glossed over the fact that both Democrats and Republicans agreed to the 2011 debt-ceiling legislation that set in motion more than $500 billion in defense cuts. Lawmakers had a chance to nix those cuts by agreeing to a comprehensive deficit-reduction plan -- but they couldn't reach a deal. While a few Republicans had discussed letting the cuts kick in, most congressional leaders on both sides of the aisle still say they want to avert them.

Pelosi further charged Wednesday that ""today's disappointing GDP report is a direct result of the economic uncertainty created by House Republicans' strategy of obstruction and manufactured crises.""

But Rep. Sam Graves, R-Mo., chairman of the House Small Business Committee, said the economic numbers are a product of White House policies.

""Is this stunt in economic growth really a surprise? Anti-growth policies and an anti-business White House produce just that -- a lack of growth,"" Graves said.

The looming cuts to defense and other areas are thought to have played some role in the economic contraction in the last quarter, as many contractors have already started cutting back.

The economy was also hurt by fewer exports and sluggish growth in company stockpiles. The drop occurred despite stronger consumer spending and business investment.

The Commerce Department said Wednesday that the economy contracted at an annual rate of 0.1 percent in the fourth quarter. That was a sharp slowdown from the 3.1 percent growth rate in the July-September quarter.

Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, incoming chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, said the ""stunning contraction"" can't be blamed only on defense cuts and fiscal crisis talks -- though he did say accelerated defense spending in the third quarter ""artificially boosted"" growth at the time.

He added: ""The bottom line is that America's economy continues to struggle primarily due to President Obama's penchant for political brinkmanship and the pervasive uncertainty caused by his focus on higher taxes, regulation and ObamaCare.""

The White House said while GDP is the broadest measure of economic activity, other indicators of economic performance suggest that the economy continued to recover in the fourth quarter.

""Some of the fiscal issues that may have weighed on the economy in the fourth quarter of 2012 were resolved with the passage of the American Taxpayer Relief Act in early January, which provided more than 98 percent of Americans and 97 percent of small businesses with the certainty that their income taxes will not rise,"" the White House said in a statement Wednesday, before Carney spoke to reporters. ""Today's report is a reminder of the importance of the need for Congress to act to avoid self-inflicted wounds to the economy. ... The weakness was mainly the result of one-time factors.""

But the fact that the economy shrank at all, combined with much lower consumer confidence reported Tuesday, may raise fears about the economy's durability in 2013. That's because the automatic spending cuts - which were delayed in the latest fiscal crisis deal -- will cut into domestic and defense programs starting in March unless Congress reaches a deal to avert them.

And Americans are coming to grips with an increase in Social Security taxes that has begun to leave them with less take-home pay.

Still, the government spending cuts and slack inventory growth in the fourth quarter offset a 2.2 percent increase in consumer spending. And business spending on equipment and software rose after shrinking over the summer.

Consumer spending added 1.5 percentage points to GDP, and business investment added 1.1 points -- both stronger contributions than in the third quarter.

And for all of 2012, the economy expanded 2.2 percent, better than 2011's growth of 1.8 percent.

Exports fell by the most in nearly four years, a result of Europe's recession and slower growth in China and some other large developing countries.

Incomes, though, jumped last quarter as companies paid out special dividends and bonuses ahead of expected tax increases in 2013. Commerce estimated that businesses paid nearly $40 billion in early dividends. After-tax income, adjusted for inflation, rose 6.8 percent, the most in nearly four years.

Superstorm Sandy likely also dragged on growth by closing factories, disrupting shipping and shutting down retail stores. While the department did not specify its effects on GDP, it estimated that Sandy destroyed about $36 billion in buildings and other private property and $8.6 billion in government property.

Subpar growth has held back hiring. The economy has created about 150,000 jobs a month, on average, for the past two years. That's barely enough to reduce the unemployment rate, which has been 7.8 percent for the past two months.

The biggest question going forward is how consumers react to the expiration of a Social Security tax cut. Congress and the White House allowed the temporary tax cut to expire in January, but reached a deal to keep income taxes from rising on most Americans.

The tax increase will lower take-home pay this year by about 2 percent. That means a household earning $50,000 a year will have about $1,000 less to spend. A household with two high-paid workers will have up to $4,500 less.

The growth in the so-called entitlement programs, especially for health care, is a main driver behind projections of mounting federal debt as baby boomers age and medical costs rise.

Mr. Obama’s budget was due in February but administration officials said it was delayed by the year-end fiscal negotiations and resulting tax changes. It will arrive on Capitol Hill hours before the president dines on Wednesday evening with a dozen Senate Republicans — his second such parlay in recent weeks.

While the group is likely to also discuss gun-safety and immigration legislation, the timing of Mr. Obama’s budget release is all but certain to make it a prime topic.

Some Senate Republicans have been urging the president to speak out more to Americans about his ideas for reducing the growth of entitlement programs. While the White House posted the offer to Mr. Boehner on its Web site this year, aides previously said that Mr. Obama would not include its provisions in his official budget documents. To do so, some said, would expose him to Democrats’ criticism that he is too quick to compromise and allow Republicans to embrace the proposals for spending cuts, in particular the C.P.I., but ignore those for tax increases.

Neither the president nor senior aides privately hold much hope that Republican leaders — Mr. Boehner and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate Republican leader — will compromise. So Mr. Obama’s strategy of reaching out to other Senate Republicans reflects a calculation that enough of them might cut a budget deal with the Democratic Senate majority. If that happens, the reasoning goes, a Senate-passed compromise would put pressure on the House to go along.

According to administration officials, the president’s budget plan would reduce projected annual deficits by $1.8 trillion over 10 years, even with the select spending increases. To offset the initiatives’ cost and avoid adding to deficits, Mr. Obama will propose the tobacco tax increase, a limit of $3 million on how much people can accumulate in tax-preferred savings accounts and repeal of a loophole that allows people to collect both disability and unemployment benefits.

Together with the $2.5 trillion in deficit reductions that Mr. Obama and Congressional Republicans have agreed to since 2010, that would bring the total deficit reduction to more than $4.3 trillion over 10 years by the administration’s computations — just over the goal that both parties have set for stabilizing the growth of the national debt."

It’s as if the House GOP can’t stop itself from tilting at windmills.

Republican leaders announced Friday that their membership had agreed to support a three-month suspension of the debt limit, effectively shifting their fight for deeper spending cuts off the debt-limit bill to either (or both) of two looming spending bills: one to adjust more than $100 billion in across-the-board spending cuts due to take effect March 1, and another to provide funding for the federal government after its temporary appropriations run out March 27.

It was a savvy move. Because it doesn’t actually raise the debt limit, the GOP can continue to threaten to block future increases unless Democrats agree to deep spending cuts. More important, it shifts the fight from the debt limit to spending bills, which is where it belongs.

Yet Republicans couldn’t just make a tactical retreat. The temporary debt-limit waiver bill unveiled Monday includes a provision that would withhold the pay of lawmakers if their chamber fails to pass a budget resolution by April 15, as required by the 1974 Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act. This little dagger is aimed squarely at Senate Democrats in general and their leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, in particular. With Reid at the helm, the Senate hasn’t passed a budget resolution since 2009.

The bill would escrow lawmakers’ paychecks, rather than canceling them, until either their chamber passes a budget resolution or the 113th Congress ends two years from now. The escrow provision was designed to avoid violating the 27th Amendment, which states that Congress cannot pass a law “varying the compensation” of its members unless it takes effect in a subsequent Congress. But it’s hard to argue with a straight face that withholding lawmakers’ pay, potentially in non-interest-bearing accounts, doesn’t amount to varying their compensation.

Senate Democrats deserve scorn aplenty for not passing a budget resolution. Even though it’s not a constitutional requirement, it’s an important exercise in setting priorities. But it’s not necessarily a fruitful exercise. It’s hard to imagine House Republicans and Senate Democrats agreeing on a budget; the former want to close the budget gap entirely through cuts in domestic programs and entitlements, while the latter want to do it mainly through tax hikes and reductions in the defense budget.

More important, the budget resolution doesn’t have the force of law. And even if the two chambers find a way to agree on a resolution, it has limited power to bind Congress.

Republicans and Democrats already have plenty of opportunities each year to fight substantively over spending, most notably the annual appropriations bills that finance the day-to-day operations of government. Why, then, does the House GOP care so deeply about having a budget resolution? Do lawmakers really need more brinkmanship?

It’s worth remembering that the 2011 debt-ceiling deal set into law the spending limits for fiscal 2012 and 2013. That made the absence of annual budget resolutions moot. Granted, the Senate ignored the sweeping changes to federal benefit programs that House Republicans called for in the reports the House Budget Committee issued, but those reports don’t have the force of law either. If the House really wanted to start the ball rolling on turning Medicaid into block grants, changing Medicare into a premium subsidy program or shoring up Social Security for the long term, it could start the hard work of introducing bills, holding hearings on them, perfecting them with amendments and passing them. But it hasn’t.

Persuading the Senate to pass a budget resolution won’t bring the two sides any closer to enacting a plan to solve Washington’s long-term fiscal problems. And if the Senate produces a budget, chances are the House GOP will wonder why it was so eager to see it.

On NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday, a top Senate Democrat, Chuck Schumer of New York, said that his colleagues consider a budget resolution “a great opportunity for us” to push for tax reform that (wait for it) raises revenues. “We’re going to do a budget this year and it’s going to have revenues in it,” Schumer said, “and our Republican colleagues better get used to that fact.”

President Roosevelt signs Social Security Act on Aug. 14, 1935.

On August 14, 1935, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act, the foundation upon which the nation's social insurance guarantee to its citizens was built. A brilliant system, Social Security was designed so that everyone would contribute and everyone would receive. It was given a dedicated source of revenue, and has never contributed to the deficit. It's also saved millions from abject poverty. Like it's doing now

More than 60 million retired and disabled people are receiving Social Security. It provides more than half the monthly income for nearly 78 percent of those people. And it has kept a third of those people out of poverty.

Without Social Security, 21.4 million more Americans would be poor, according to the latest available Census data (for 2011). Although most of those whom Social Security keeps out of poverty are elderly, nearly a third are under age 65, including 1.1 million children. [...] Almost 90 percent of people aged 65 and older receive some of their family income from Social Security. Without Social Security benefits, 43.6 percent of elderly Americans would have incomes below the official poverty line, all else being equal; with Social Security benefits, only 8.7 percent do. These benefits lift some 14.5 million elderly Americans—including 8.7 million women—above the poverty line. [...] Social Security is important for children and their families as well as for the elderly. About 6 million children under age 18 (8 percent of all U.S. children) lived in families that received income from Social Security in 2011, according to Census data. This figure includes children who received their own benefits as dependents of retired, disabled, or deceased workers, as well as those who lived with parents or relatives who received Social Security benefits. In all, Social Security lifts 1.1 million children out of poverty.

In 2010, households whose income was in the middle fifth percentile of incomes had, on average, only $34,981 in individual retirement savings, while households in the top fifth of incomes averaged $308,674. Other than high-income households, who receive most of the federal subsidies for IRAs and 401(k)s, virtually no one has enough savings to generate substantial retirement income. Social Security wealth and retirement income, on the other hand, are broadly shared.

The Economic Policy Institute has more on the necessity of Social Security for the vast majority of Americans. Only the wealthy, EPI has found, can count on having enough income from private retirement accounts for financial security in old age.Social Security is essential. It has been for eight decades and will be even more so in the next few, as the nation lurches out of the Great Recession. It shouldn't be made a bargaining chip, it should be made a lure to try to make Republicans do the fiscally responsible thing.

It should be strengthened to last at least another 78 years.

Please join with Daily Kos and CREDO in telling the Senate to strengthen Social Security by INCREASING benefits."

A proposal to study whether the state should adopt its own currency is gaining traction in the state legislature from a number of lawmakers as well as conservative economists. The state House voted 65-32 earlier this week to approve the measure, and it will now go to the Senate.

While it’s unlikely that Virginia will be printing its own money any time soon, the move sheds light on the growing distrust surrounding the nation’s central bank. Four other states are considering similar proposals. In 2011, Utah passed a law that recognizes gold and silver coins issued by the federal government as tender and requires a study on adopting other forms of legal currency.

Virginia Republican Del. Robert Marshall told FoxNews.com Tuesday that his bill calls for creation of a 10-member commission that would determine the “need, means and schedule for establishing a metallic-based monetary unit.” Essentially, he wants to spend $20,000 on a study that could call for the state to return to a gold standard.

The gold standard is a system under which a country ties the value of its currency to gold, setting a fixed price at which gold can be bought or sold by the government.

“We’re not going to be printing money with Dave Matthews or Jeff Davis on the front of it,” Marshall said, referring to two famous Virginians.

Marshall said he wants to inject competition into the national economy and force the federal government to change its current policy – one he believes will lead to hyperinflation and instability. He also thinks Virginia should be armed with an alternative currency in case it comes under a cyber attack. Many of Marshall’s arguments are similar to ones made by the Tea Party.

In 1933, President Franklin Roosevelt suspended the gold standard to counter deflation brought on by the Great Depression. The country continued to exchange gold internationally until 1971 when President Richard Nixon ended the practice.

Marshall’s commission would examine the impact of the Federal Reserve’s intervention in the banking and credit markets that have resulted in near-zero returns on savings accounts and retirement accounts.

“We’re not immune from the consequences of human behavior,” Marshall said. “At some point there is going to be a dollar that breaks the camel’s back.”

“This is like planning for the Titanic,” he said.

Not everyone agrees.

“He’s descending into serious la la land,” House Democratic Caucus Chairman Mark Sickles told FoxNews.com.

Sickles said he doesn’t think Marshall’s plan will make it through the Senate. He said the state should not be shelling out thousands of dollars in taxpayer money for the study when there are other pressing problems like unemployment and cuts to higher education that need immediate attention. He argues that Virginia has held a triple-A bond rating with Moody's since 1938. While that's true, the state has been placed on the downgrade watch list three times.

Last year, 11 states had considered bills involving the gold standard. The raft of negative public sentiment against the central banking system even caused Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke to speak out against the idea during a series of lectures.

""Since the gold standard determines the money supply, there is not much scope for the central bank to use monetary policy to stabilize the economy,” Bernanke said during a speech at George Washington University last year. ""Under a gold standard, typically the money supply goes up and interest rates go down in a period of strong economic activity -- so that's the reverse of what a central bank would normally do today."""

The government shutdown and the game of chicken over the debt ceiling demonstrated just how dysfunctional the American political system has become. Congress cannot even pass a budget, let alone deal with climate change, Medicare reform, a jobless economy or the looming national debt.

And the situation will not improve because there are so many safe, one-party-dominant congressional districts where deluded voters keep electing the sort of Republicans who think political compromise is a far greater sin than hiring prostitutes or keeping an Argentine mistress. (Remember David Vitter and Mark Sanford?)

These safe-for-screwballs districts must be eliminated and, if accomplishing that through redistricting is impossible, then more creative means must be employed.

Since so many of the districts are in Southern states, we could tell, say, South Carolina, Mississippi and Alabama we changed our minds about the old secession thing and they are now free to leave. That could do the trick, but it would also undo all of Abraham Lincoln’s hard work. Who knows? They might bring back slavery.

A better idea is to take advantage of a historical anomaly. I’m talking about Texas, the state whose senator, Ted Cruz, ran the charge to close down the government and whose entire Republican congressional delegation voted against the bill to restart government functions and forestall a calamitous credit default.

Texas was once an independent country. It wouldn’t set such a bad precedent to let it be independent again (even if native Hawaiians start shouting, “Us too!”).

Cruz could get his wish to be president of a whole country (something that will never happen if Texas remains a state), the balance of power in Congress would shift and we might see a bill or two get passed for the first time in years.

Of course, it would be a shame to lose a star from the flag. The easiest remedy for that would be to finally make Puerto Rico a state. Economically speaking, though, Puerto Rico for Texas is not such a great swap. It would be far better to reach back pre-1776 and renew a historic connection: We once belonged to England; now they can belong to us.

I do mean England, not the entire United Kingdom. Scotland is already taking a highland fling toward independence. Northern Ireland can finally become part of the Irish Republic (what could possibly go wrong with that?). Wales ... well, maybe Wales can be a territory, like Puerto Rico.

England is the perfect replacement state. London is a financial powerhouse far beyond even the loudest boasts of Houston and Dallas. English and American cultures are more intertwined than ever. We listen to the same music, watch the same TV shows, and 80% of English actors already live in Los Angeles.

The best part is English conservatives. They are nothing like tea party Republicans. They’re all educated at Oxford and Cambridge, not Oral Roberts University. They all think universal healthcare is a sensible idea, not a pact with Lenin and Marx. And they hate being part of the European Union -- so much so that they’d be eager to tell the French and Germans to bugger off and then join the U.S. Besides, the English conservatives’ greatest hero, Winston Churchill, was half American.

Imagine trading Ted Cruz for David Cameron. There is no part of this deal that does not sound like a plus for our political system.

Texas liberals might not be quite so thrilled. Still, if they are patient, Latino voters will become the majority in Texas in just a few years. When that happens, they can throw out the crazy conservatives and, if they so choose, rejoin the union. Heck, just for fun, we’ll put stars on the flag for Wales and Puerto Rico too."

http://news.yahoo.com/senate-set-approve-huge-2013-spending-bill-160418908--finance.html,,[],Senate set to approve huge 2013 spending bill,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate moved toward a vote Wednesday on a huge, bipartisan spending bill aimed at keeping the government running through September and ruling out the chance of a shutdown later this month.

Chamber leaders announced that a logjam that had stalled the bill had been broken and that the measure would pass by late afternoon and return to the House, where a vote on Thursday would send it to President Barack Obama for his signature.

The Senate rejected an amendment by Tom Coburn, R-Okla., that was aimed at shifting money within the National Park Service to try to make sure the White House remained open to tours. But even if approved, the amendment would appear to fail to accomplish its goal since the reason for closing the White House tours was a budget cut for the Secret Service, not the Park Service.

Sens. Mark Pryor, D-Ark., and Roy Blunt, R-Mo., won voice vote approval of another amendment — eagerly sought by the meatpacking and poultry industries — that would offer them relief from food inspector furloughs that threaten to intermittently shutter plants.

The overall measure would fund the day-to-day operating budgets of every Cabinet agency through Sept. 30, provide an additional $87 billion to fund overseas military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, and maintain a pay freeze for federal workers.

The measure gives the Pentagon much-sought relief from a cash crunch in accounts for training and readiness, gives veteran health programs their scheduled increases and sets the detailed, line-by-line budgets for agencies such as Commerce, NASA, Agriculture and Justice.

The measure leaves in place automatic budget cuts of 5 percent to domestic agencies and 8 percent to the Pentagon. The cuts have largely been unnoticed by the public but are making lawmakers uncomfortable, especially as intermittent layoffs known as furloughs begin to take effects next month.

The fear of those furloughs compromising safety at 173 airports slated to lose their air traffic controllers led Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kan., to seek to restore funding to prevent the layoffs. He was denied an attempt to amend the measure, which led him to drag out debate. But Moran relented rather than to deny other senators from winning votes on amendments.

Story continues

Democrats have generally resisted efforts to fix the automatic cuts on an ad hoc basis, arguing that the so-called sequester needs to be replaced in its entirety as part of a broader budget deal.

The developments in the Senate come as the House resumed debate on the budget for next year and beyond. Republicans are pushing a plan that promises sharp cuts to federal health care programs and domestic agency operating budgets as the price for balancing the budget in a decade. That plan, by Budget Committee chairman and failed GOP vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, also contains a hotly contested provision calling for transformation of Medicare for beneficiaries born in 1959 and after into a program that subsidizes health insurance premiums instead of directly paying hospital and doctor bills.

The House was set to consider a set of alternative budgets from the left and right on Wednesday before voting on the GOP plan on Thursday. The Senate was expected to begin debate of the budget Wednesday in hopes of a vote on Friday."

Soneji']",Social Security: It’s Worse Than You Think - The New York Times,"We have made our methods, calculations and software available online at j.mp/SSecurity so that others can replicate or improve our forecasts. The implications of our findings go beyond social science. As the wave of retirement by the baby boomers continues, doing nothing to shore up Social Security’s solvency is irresponsible. If the amount of money coming in through payroll taxes does not increase and if the amount of money going out as benefits remains the same, the trust funds will become insolvent less than 20 years from now.

To save Social Security, which has lifted generations of elderly people out of poverty, tough choices have to be made. One option is to continue raising the retirement age, perhaps to as high as 69 or 70. While the full retirement age is gradually increasing to 67 (for people born in 1960 or later) from 65, this increase is not enough to counterbalance the gains in longevity.

A second option is to increase payroll taxes, for example by taxing wages over $113,700, the current earnings limit. A third is to limit the annual cost-of-living adjustments, possibly by changing how those adjustments are calculated. A fourth is to reduce benefits — for example, by lowering the initial benefits for workers whose lifetime wages are above the national average (currently $43,000 a year). Other choices, in numerous combinations, are possible, too.

One factor that might be considered is new research suggesting that retirement itself, although popular, may reduce life expectancy by breaking lifelong routines and disrupting deep social connections. One might question how much government policy should actively encourage retirement, as opposed to merely making it an option.

Americans need to discuss these difficult choices — and the Social Security Administration needs the ability to improve its forecasting technology by adding statisticians and social science methodologists to help its actuaries institute more formalized quantitative and statistical procedures.

In 1983, after the last time the trust funds ran a deficit, the National Commission on Social Security Reform, led by Alan Greenspan and with members appointed by President Ronald Reagan and Congressional leaders, produced a report that led to changes in payroll taxes. But in the quarter-century since, there have been only modest changes in the program.

We know much more now about mortality and demography, and so an open debate today about Social Security’s future could be even more productive than it was then. The high levels of partisan strife may not make the present seem like the best time to reach a bipartisan agreement. But few issues are more important to more Americans, of both parties, and the longer we ignore the problem, the more disruptive any change will need to be to keep Social Security alive."
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/12/us/politics/with-senate-set-to-vote-obama-makes-immigration-pitch.html,2013-06-12 00:00:00,"['Mark Landler', 'Ashley Parker']",Obama Endorses Immigration Bill as Debate Is Set,"WASHINGTON — As the Senate voted overwhelmingly Tuesday to begin debating an overhaul of the nation’s immigrations laws, President Obama offered a wholehearted endorsement of the bipartisan proposal, which presents him with a chance to reach the kind of landmark accord with Republicans that has eluded him on the budget and gun violence.

For Mr. Obama, who has picked his shots in the immigration debate to avoid stirring partisan anger on Capitol Hill, it was a moment of promise and peril. While he threw his weight behind the bill, he conceded that it would not satisfy all sides and said he anticipated a bruising fight over issues like border security and the path to citizenship.

The president, however, may have more leverage than in previous battles, not least because many Republicans believe rewriting the immigration laws is critical for the long-term viability of their party given the nation’s demographic shifts, even if doing so risks alienating parts of their base.

Republican willingness to weigh significant changes in immigration policy was evident in the 84-to-15 vote to begin what is expected to be a monthlong debate on the bill, a lopsided majority that comprised 52 Democrats, 2 independents and 30 Republicans. The opponents were all Republicans."

Obama’s news conference in two minutes: The president aggressively pushed his debt ceiling agenda on Monday during the final press conference of his first term. (JulieAnn McKellogg/The Washington Post)

President Obama effectively began the negotiations Monday that he had pledged to avoid, over whether Congress should raise the borrowing limit at the end of next month.

His opening bid: I won’t negotiate.

Obama used the final news conference of his first term to warn a divided Congress to raise the debt ceiling in the coming weeks or risk turning the United States into what he called “a deadbeat nation.”

Invoking his recent election victory as proof that the American people support his broader approach to taxes and spending, Obama said that, in return for raising the borrowing limit, House Republicans would receive precisely nothing.

“They will not collect a ransom for not crashing the American economy,” Obama said in his opening statement from the East Room of the White House.

President Obama held his final news conference of his first term on Monday to press Congress to raise the debt ceiling. (The Washington Post)

The president’s attempt to make raising the borrowing limit entirely a matter for an unpopular Congress to address marks a shift from the central role he played in 2011, when he was drawn into a summer-long debate over the issue that badly damaged his political standing on the eve of an election year.

Congress eventually raised the borrowing limit, but for the first time, a credit agency downgraded U.S. debt partly because of the political uncertainty those negotiations created.

This time Obama is trying to stay out of the discussion, even as he called a Monday news conference to highlight the dangers of failing to raise the debt ceiling and what he believes is Congress’s responsibility for avoiding them.

The balance Obama is trying to strike — involvement without seeming to be involved — shows how difficult it will be for the president to ignore an issue that could have such a potentially calamitous effect on the U.S. economy, which he said Monday is “poised for a good year.”

“As long as Washington politics don’t get in the way of America’s progress,” he added.

White House officials know privately that Obama will be asked to participate in the debt-ceiling talks, and they believe that the president’s victory in forcing House Republicans to raise some taxes in the fiscal cliff deal will help them exert behind-the-scenes influence over this round

Polls showed that Obama, who secured higher tax rates for the wealthy in those “fiscal cliff” negotiations, emerged in a better position from them than did House Republicans.

As one senior administration official, who requested anonymity to describe how the White House is thinking about the coming weeks, said, “We are stronger for the debt fight because we won the fiscal cliff fight.”

“That’s how we’re going to look at this,” the official said.

Obama indicated as much Monday with a strong defense of his spending priorities, a relatively liberal mix of safety-net protection and money for education, scientific research and other areas he believes will help modernize the American economy.

He said the ideological contest over his and the Republican Party’s visions of government’s role is at the heart of the debt-ceiling debate, rather than a good-faith discussion over ways to reduce the deficit. The larger debate, he has argued, should be separate from the borrowing limit talks.

Obama said House Republicans are “suspicious about government’s commitments, for example, to make sure that seniors have decent health care as they get older. They have suspicions about Social Security. They have suspicions about whether government should make sure that kids in poverty are getting enough to eat or whether we should be spending money on medical research.”

“So they’ve got a particular view of what government should do and should be,” he said. “And, you know, that view was rejected by the American people when it was debated during the presidential campaign.

Obama’s skills as a negotiator drew critics from both sides of the partisan divide throughout his first term. His opponents have called him recalcitrant, while his supporters say he too easily compromises to secure a deal.

But on Monday he framed the debt-ceiling issue as a matter of principle in executive and legislative branch relations, arguing that the country, if it is to recover economically and financially, must stop “lurching from crisis to crisis to crisis.”

“If we continue down this path,” Obama said, referring to regular, to-the-brink talks over raising the borrowing limit, “there’s really no stopping the principle.”

Obama has a busy legislative agenda to push and a small window of time to accomplish it before his reelection popularity turns into lame-duck irrelevance.

At the news conference, Obama was asked if he intended to change the perception in Washington that his administration is too insular and that, as a politician, he doesn’t cultivate enough political friends to help with his agenda.

Part of Obama’s appeal in 2008 was his pledge to rise above Washington’s partisan antagonism, limit the power of lobbyists and bring a new way of governing to the capital. But on Monday he attributed his perceived isolation in the White House to the enduring partisanship that he once hoped to change.

“I’m a pretty friendly guy, and I like a good party,” Obama said. “I think that really what’s gone on in terms of some of the paralysis here in Washington, or difficulties in negotiations, just have to do with some very stark differences in terms of policy.”

He joked that he’ll have more time to work on other relationships now that “my girls are getting older.

“They don’t want to spend that much time with me anyway, so I’ll be probably calling around, looking for somebody to play cards with me or something, because I’m getting kind of lonely in this big house.”

But, he said, the kinds of White House events where he and his wife, Michelle Obama, pose for friendly photos with members of Congress “doesn’t prevent them from going onto the floor of the House and blasting me for being a big-spending socialist.”

“I think there are a lot of Republicans at this point that feel that given how much energy has been devoted in some of the media that’s preferred by Republican constituencies to demonize me, that it doesn’t look real good socializing with me,” he said."

Some 30% of the federal workforce will be eligible to retire in the next three years, according to a Government Accountability Office report. That means the government could be hit by a wave of retirements at a time when it is already dealing with inadequate staffing, because large numbers of employees are on furlough and hiring freezes are in place to save money and dramatically shrink the federal budget deficit.

It could lead to disruptions in some key areas. Some 46% of air traffic controllers can retire in the next three years, creating a challenge for the government to replace them with similarly experienced workers. It's a worry, especially at a time when the public has fresh memories of long delays at the nation's airports when the sequester kept controllers at home on furlough.

Also, more than a third of all federal veterinarians are eligible to retire. An impending national veterinarian shortage is already fueling fears that the U.S. Department of Agriculture will not be able to easily tamp the spread of a severe disease outbreak in animals, according to several federal reports.

Congressional watchdogs have been warning for years about this ""tsunami"" of baby boomers hitting retirement age at federal agencies. So far, it hasn't happened because more workers hung on to their jobs far longer than expected, in part due to the recession.

That may be changing this year. In the first four months of 2013, some 60,000 employees filed for federal retirement benefits, a 43% increase from last year, according to the Office of Personnel Management. A major part of the spike comes from postal workers taking early retirement buyouts, OPM says.

But union groups and employee advocates say the uptick in retirements is being fueled by the $85 billion in spending cuts, along with its furloughs, pay freezes, slashed overtime and increased work load from the lack of new hires.

""We're seeing this massive brain drain as thousands of workers leave the federal workforce, and it's leading to a huge loss of knowledge and expertise,"" said William Dougan, president of the National Federation of Federal Employees. ""A lot of these jobs are not being filled once they're vacated.""

It's already leading to questionable outcomes. In the past two years, the beleaguered Internal Revenue Service has lost 10,000 employees to retirement and attrition. Some have suggested that the lack of senior level employees may have played a role in the current scandal plaguing that agency.

More than a third of IRS employees will soon be eligible to retire, which could also lead to longer waits for things like taxpayer refunds and audits.

Federal employees can retire at the age of 62 if they have worked five years, or even younger with 20 years of service. The average federal worker is 47 years old with about 14 years on the job, compared to the median age of 42 for all American workers, according to federal data.

Over at the USDA, the labor crunch poses a risk to the nation's food supply as early as this year, according to Michael Gilsdorf, executive vice president for the National Association of Federal Veterinarians.

At least three USDA agencies are struggling to fill positions left by outgoing vets since federal budget cuts took hold, Gilsdorf said. That has shrunk the number of ""deployable"" veterinarians, who can respond to an animal disease outbreak from 1,000 vets last year, to about 250 now.

A federal advisory panel has warned there aren't enough federal veterinarians to contain a massive multi-state outbreak of foot and mouth disease, a highly contagious animal disease which strikes cows, goats and pigs.

""Our capacity to respond to a disease outbreak has hit a critical stage,"" said Gilsdorf, who runs the panel tasked with helping craft the plan to recruit thousands of private and public sector veterinarians to fill in gaps if disease hits the nation's food supply.

The USDA responded by saying it has recruited 955 veterinarians and 3,100 animal health technicians to join a volunteer group of emergency responders called the ""National Animal Health Emergency Response Corps."" The agency's has a special program that trains vets, including those at nonprofits and in private practice on how to respond to a national emergency.

A USDA spokesperson said the agency prioritizes ""working with staff and accredited veterinarians to ensure that we can respond quickly and in a manner that is highly protective of our animal agriculture resources.""

For some, however, a shrinking federal workforce is not something to worry about. In fact, it is a good thing -- it's a key part of Republican budget chief Rep. Paul Ryan's plan to shrink deficits. This year, Ryan proposed cutting the 2.1 million workforce by 10% through a two-year hiring freeze.

An OPM official said it's prepared for the wave of retirements by ""constantly evaluating workforce preparedness programs.""

While sequester has been an ""added challenge,"" the official stressed ""the decision to retire is a very personal one, as each person looks at their individual situation and decides what is best for them."""

These new cuts are in addition to a previously announced reduction of 7,500 jobs. The total job cuts work out to an elimination of about 20% of the drug company's worldwide workforce of 81,000 employees.

None of the job cuts have happened yet, said Merck spokeswoman Kelley Dougherty.

She also said the job cuts are unrelated to Obamacare, the health care plan championed by President Obama but opposed by Republicans in Congress.

Merck (MRK) said the restructuring will result in a pre-tax costs of between $2.5 billion and $3 billion. But the company also said it hopes the cuts will help it save about $2.5 billion annually by 2015.

Frazier, who was the company's lead counsel during its problems with the painkiller Vioxx, said that job cuts will be concentrated on selling, general and administrative expenses, as well as some research and development. But he insisted that the company will continue to focus on R&D.

""Our company is still committed to innovative R&D and bringing forward transformative products that make a difference in human health,"" he said.

He said that Merck's ""streamlining"" is ""not about stopping any activity. It's about being more efficient.""

A company press release said that Merck will focus on vaccines and treatments for cancer and diabetes in ""prioritized markets, which account for the majority of revenue in the pharmaceutical and vaccines business."" It identified these markets as the U.S. as well as Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Japan, China, Korea, Brazil and Russia.

Shares of Merck, a member of the Dow Jones industrial average, were up 3%.

Drug companies are under constant pressure to discover promising new drugs to stock up their pipelines with potential blockbusters. The patent on one of Merck's more lucrative drugs, the asthma treatment Singulair, expired last year, eroding sales as the product is exposed to generic competition.

The company, based in Whitehouse Station, N.J., also announced on Tuesday that its headquarters will be moved to its existing facilities in nearby Kenilworth, which is closer to New York City."

""What I haven't been willing to negotiate, and will not negotiate, is on the debt ceiling,"" he said. With the crisis over Syria off the boil, Washington faces yet another fiscal showdown. Most government operations will cease on October 1 unless Congress passes a budget the president will accept and the United States risks a debt default as early as mid-October if lawmakers delay raising the borrowing cap. Obama and the Republican-led House of Representatives remain at loggerheads over both the budget and the debt limit. Republican lawmakers have sought to make defunding the president's signature healthcare law, the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, a condition for raising the cap. Obama's administration has delayed implementing such steps as signing final agreements with insurance plans to be sold on federal health insurance exchanges as it struggled to get the law's provisions in place before enrollment opens on October 1. ""This administration has already delayed or waived fully a third of this legislation and we believe it is only fair for the American people now to have that same delay and that's the proposal I believe will be coming forward this week,"" Republican Representative Tom Price of Georgia said on ""Fox News Sunday."" Democratic Representative Chris Van Hollen said on the same program that legislation mandating delays in putting the law in place would stand in the way of making health insurance affordable to many Americans and is ""not acceptable."" ""WAYS OF DOING THIS"" Lawmakers last week considered extending government funding at current $988 billion levels until mid-December, but Tea Party Republicans insisted that cuts to Obamacare remain part of the package. Obama will mark the five-year anniversary of the U.S. financial crisis on Monday in an effort to move back to his domestic agenda after weeks of dealing with Syria and how to respond to its use of chemical weapons. The financial crisis was accelerated on September 15, 2008, when the Lehman Brothers firm filed for bankruptcy protection. Obama is expected to focus on the positive, discussing progress made and highlighting his prescriptions for boosting job creation amid budget battles with Republicans. He said he would be willing to talk to House Speaker John Boehner about reversing deep across-the-board spending cuts that went into effect this year through the process known as sequestration, but said Boehner has been an unwilling partner. ""There are ways of doing this. It's just that they haven't been willing to negotiate in a serious way on that,"" Obama said. Obama and Boehner have clashed on repeated occasions over the budget. A standoff over raising the debt limit in 2011 resulted in the first-ever U.S. credit rating downgrade and dealt a setback to the nascent economic recovery. Obama also said he is willing to talk to Republicans about how to accelerate further reductions in the budget deficit. But he pointed out that the deficit has shrunk more quickly than expected, and said that efforts by ""a portion of Congress"" to push for sharper budget reductions would only worsen the wide gap between rich and poor in the United States. ""There's no serious economist out there that would suggest that if you took the Republican agenda of slashing education further, slashing Medicare further, slashing research and development further, slashing investments in infrastructure further, that would reverse some of these trends of inequality,"" he said. The Congressional Budget Office has said it expects the government's annual deficit to shrink to $642 billion in the fiscal year that ends this month, the first annual deficit below $1 trillion in five years.

They were joined by Lancaster, Texas, Walmart employee Colby Harris, a fellow activist with the labor group OUR Walmart. After delivering a letter to their store manager, and protesting with supporters outside the Laurel Walmart, the workers filed new charges with the National Labor Relations Board alleging illegal intimidation by the retail giant. [...] Workers allege that Walmart exploited that agreement to unleash a new round of intimidation against workers. They say that Walmart managers held mandatory meetings in which managers read from a memo telling workers that the strikes had been illegal, and that OUR Walmart was being dissolved. “They said that anybody who associates themselves with OUR Walmart, and the leaders, and the organization as a whole, could face disciplinary actions,” said Harris. He said he had not been pulled into such a meeting, but had heard about them from co-workers in states including Florida, Illinois, Kentucky and Maryland.

The United Food and Commercial Workers and OUR Walmart may have agreed not to picket Walmart for 60 days, but that doesn't mean workers are going to lie down and take it if Walmart mistreats them. Which, of course, Walmart is doing, both as a matter of routine and especially in the aftermath of the no-picket agreement. Josh Eidelson reports that:As long as the Maryland workers who walked out don't do anything resembling a picket line (no walking in circles in front of the store, for instance) and aren't looking for union recognition, they should be within the framework of the union agreement with the National Labor Relations Board. And they're definitely serving notice to Walmart that it's not open season."

(CNN) - Treasury officials were made aware in June 2012 that the IRS inspector general was reviewing the office that handles tax-exempt applications, but a letter from October shows that the inspector general did not highlight the audit as a top concern for the agency.

In a memo dated October 15, 2012, to then-Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner about IRS challenges for 2013, Inspector General J. Russell George noted other problem areas, but made no mention of the investigation taking place at the time of the agency's intense scrutiny of conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

Instead, the memo stated that ""while the Exempt Organizations function has greatly improved its timeliness with regard to acknowledging complaints against tax-exempt organizations, referrals were not always controlled or processed timely.""

A spokesperson for the inspector general told CNN this letter was intended to single out what George considered to be the most serious issues for the IRS among all the cases listed in the IG's annual audit, which had already been published.

A spokesperson for the Treasury Department said the current treasury secretary, Jack Lew, and his deputy first learned of the audit’s findings from press reports last week.

The inspector general made headlines Friday when he told the House Ways and Means Committee that he had notified Treasury officials, including Deputy Secretary Neal Wolin, as early as June 2012 that he was reviewing the office that handles tax-exempt applications.

CNN has confirmed that notification came in early June.

According to George, he told Treasury that he was conducting a review but did not disclose the nature of the findings. He said the review was prompted by a request from someone he described as a congressional staff member.

""It was not to inform them of the results of the audit, it was to inform them of the fact that we were conducting the audit,"" George later clarified.

A Treasury official, who discussed the matter on the condition of not being identified, told CNN that when Wolin learned of the review he did not discuss it with anyone outside the Treasury Department. The same official said Treasury strongly supports the ""the independent oversight of its three inspectors general, and it does not interfere in ongoing IG audits."" In other words, the political appointees who run Treasury do not take action until such audits are complete.

According to the Treasury official, it wasn't until mid-March of this year that anyone inside the department was informed of the targeting at the office of tax-exempt programs.

That’s when the inspector general discussed a draft audit with one or more staff-level Treasury officials. In April, George first gave Treasury staff a copy of the draft audit and that information was not shared with the treasury secretary or his deputy.

According to officials at both the inspector general and Treasury offices, Lew knew an audit was taking place because George mentioned it during an introductory meeting on March 15, 2013, but he had no window into the results.

Lew was confirmed as Treasury secretary in late February.

The inspector general for the IRS is one of three inspector generals who report to the Treasury and conducts approximately 120 audits per year."

USA TODAY

The partial federal government shutdown begins Day 14 amid even greater anxiety. The nation could face its first-ever default if the debt ceiling is not raised by Thursday. What you need to know on Monday, Oct. 14:

Shutdown, debt deal hangs on Senate leaders

It's come down to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., and his GOP counterpart, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. Many on Capitol Hill are looking at talks between the two Senate leaders as the last — and best — hope for a deal that would end the government shutdown and raise the debt limit of $16.7 trillion. The two leaders asserted control over negotiations to end the stalemate on Saturday, when it became clear that House Speaker John Boehner could not strike a deal with the White House on his own. Reid said he was ""optimistic,"" while Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., said Republicans are ""very unified"" behind McConnell.

Mount Rushmore will reopen today

In one of several deals between a state and the federal government, Mount Rushmore will welcome visitors again Monday. South Dakota Gov. Dennis Daugaard said it will cost $15,200 a day for the national memorial to four of the nation's presidents to stay open. At least a dozen businesses or organizations are partnering with the state to pay the operating costs. The Statute of Liberty and Grand Canyon have also reopened. With the National Park Service one of the hardest-hit federal agencies in the shutdown, the Obama administration announced last week it would allow states to pay to reopen any of the country's 401 properties managed by the NPS.

Visitors turned away from Normandy cemeteries

While there's good news for some visitors to historic sites in the United States, the same can't be said for visitors who want to pay their respects at the final resting place of U.S. troops who died during the invasion of Normandy, France, in World War II. The Wall Street Journal reports visitors are being turned away from the Normandy cemeteries because ""U.S. war memorials on foreign soil ... answer to the federal government in Washington.""

Merchant Marine Academy cancels classes for the week

President Obama was to be briefed Sunday on the status of the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy in Kings Point, N.Y. Rear Adm. James Helis posted a note on the academy's website Friday saying classes would resume ""no earlier than Oct. 21"" because of the government shutdown. The academy had already moved up its fall break because of the budget impasse in Washington. The shutdown's impact is ""most severe"" because the Merchant Marine Academy's faculty and staff are almost all civilians who have been furloughed — unlike the other service academies.

Social Security recipients await news of increase

Remember that Labor Department inflation report for September, the one that was supposed to come out Wednesday? It holds the key to just how small the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, will be for millions of Social Security recipients, disabled veterans and federal retirees. Preliminary figures suggest a benefit increase of 1.5% come January, according to an analysis by the Associated Press. The COLA is usually announced in October. Social Security benefits have continued in the shutdown.

Which has led some viewers to ask: Does this mean that broadcast TV will turn into a rat’s nest of foul language and naked bodies? Teacher is away, so there might be orgies on “Castle.” No oversight, so that means f-bombs on “The X-Factor.” CBS might turn into HBO.

Anarchy rules, bro!

Well, not so fast. Yes, it is true that the FCC has closed up shop, telling roughly 1,700 workers not to bother coming in. Bureaucrats being bureaucrats, the good folks there even published a memo -- an inaction plan, if you will -- detailing how they would shut down in “orderly” fashion. Read it here if you dare.

But thinking that an FCC closure means everyone on “Big Bang Theory” strips down is like thinking that the government shutdown means no more taxes (yes, exactly, say some conservatives -- but that’s another story).

Odds are good that the FCC is going to come back again someday. And when it does, it will begin fielding complaints again -- including those from viewers who took notes during the shutdown. A funding-related door-shuttering doesn’t overturn federal law or cancel the FCC’s mandate. It also doesn’t mean that the FCC can’t revoke the license of any broadcaster who flouts its rules, shutdown or no.

PHOTOS: Seven odd casualties of the government shutdown

In fact, there’s evidence that during a shutdown, the FCC commissioners work anyway. That’s the contention of former commissioner Susan Ness, who wrote that when Westinghouse was merging with CBS in 1995, the agency chiefs kept working on merger issues straight through that shutdown, when House Republicans were battling President Clinton.

So for anyone on network TV, the message might be, swear today, pay tomorrow.

Now get back to work.

This view ignores how much inequality has been made worse in the past few decades by government decisions. The emphasis on cutting taxes and spending that began in the Reagan years is a direct cause of economic insecurity now. It has led, for example, to education cuts that have harmed children in low-income school districts. Reversing those decisions can still have an enormous impact.

Mr. Obama did not reveal a sheaf of new ideas in his speech. But he did remind listeners of the many good ideas he has proposed about inequality over the years, most of which have been blocked by Republican opposition. A higher minimum wage would have an immediate effect on the buying power of millions of workers, stimulating growth and employment. Greater spending on high-quality preschool, a new emphasis on career and technical education and affordable higher education would all help to lower the barriers to economic mobility. Stronger collective-bargaining laws and nondiscrimination protections would help restore a balance in workplaces now tilted strongly toward employers.

And the Affordable Care Act, as Mr. Obama said forcefully, has enhanced security for millions of people who were previously uninsured or who lived in fear of losing their policies because of illness. “This law is going to work,” he said, “and for the sake of our economic security, it needs to work.” It will reduce personal bankruptcies, he said, cut sick time and keep children healthier and performing better in school.

What he should have added was the need to raise tax revenue, which is crucial to making the kinds of investments big enough to have a real effect on growth. The tax code must be overhauled to eliminate the absurdly generous breaks given to those at the very top — an idea that Mr. Obama has campaigned on but rarely brings up, given the implacable Republican opposition. But the president did issue a clear challenge to his opponents. Where are the Republican ideas for reducing the income gap? Most in the party don’t even recognize it as a problem. “You owe it to the American people to tell us what you are for,” he said, “not just what you’re against.” The silence from Republicans explains why economic inequality is rising."

USA TODAY

Brace yourselves, Washington, D.C., drivers. Angry truckers are coming to town Friday as part of a three-day protest to ""shut down America"" and ""restore our Constitutional Republic.""

Enraged by low wages, fuel prices, regulations, the government shutdown, the debt ceiling, President Obama and ""the corruption that is destroying America,"" the ""Truckers Ride for the Constitution"" aims to tie up three lanes of Interstate 495 circling the nation's capital, with big rigs traveling 55 mph, an organizer toldU.S. News & World Report.

Last week, one of the promoters said 3,000 truckers had said they planned to participate in the holiday-weekend rally. Two convoys reportedly will leave from the Doswell Truck Stop in Doswell, Va.

The ""general strike"" seeks to enlist sympathetic motorists — and will let them pass if they display the group's calling card: T2SDA, which stands for ""Truckers to Shut Down America,"" the original name.

The group behind the rally, ""Ride for the Constitution,"" said in a news release that the ""stage is now set for what we now consider the last peaceful defensive stand in a war that has been declared by Wall Street, Washington, and the Whitehouse upon the American people.""

But a Georgia trucker handling logistics, Earl Conlon, told U.S. News & World Report that he and other truckers would block the highway if police intervened and that they also would try to arrest members of Congress for disregarding the Constitution.

""We want these people arrested, and we're coming in with the grand jury to do it,"" he said. ""We are going to ask the law enforcement to uphold their constitutional oath and make these arrests. If they refuse to do it, by the power of the people of the United States and the people's grand jury, they don't want to do it, we will. ... We the people will find a way.""

In a statement posted to its Facebook page Monday evening, the Truckers Ride said Conlon did not speak for the group.

Folks, here's the entire scoop on US News & World Report attempting to get a sensational title from someone not authorized to speak on behalf of all peaceful protesters. As we approach the event, this is what we can expect from the MSM and potential saboteurs --- but NOTHING will stop us!

Monday, Twitter suspended the T2SDA account, but #T2SDA remained active."

Do the right thing, Harry.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) is giving Republican colleagues 36 hours to agree to a deal on filibuster reform or he will move forward with the nuclear option. “I hope in the next 24, 36 hours we can get something we agree on. If not, we’re going to move forward on what I think needs to be done,” Reid told reporters. Reid’s trump card in negotiations with Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) is the threat he will change Senate rules with a simple majority vote, a tactic known as the nuclear option. This maneuver would allow Reid to change the Senate rules with a simple majority vote, something that has never been done, according to parliamentary experts.

Sen. Harry Reid needs to wrap up Senate rules reform, and also wants to achieve some kind of bipartisan agreement. You'd think by now he'd recognize that those two goals are utterly incompatible when it comes to trying to accomplish something significant. Perhaps he does, so perhaps that's why he's issued an ultimatum : come to an agreement within 36 hours or Democrats will do it on their own., by the way, is wrong. The nuclear option was what Republicans were talking about doing during the Bush Administration to block Democrats' filibuster of judicial nominees. It would have entailed Vice President Cheney, acting as presiding officer, declaring the filibuster of nominees unconstitutional. That's pretty nuclear, particularly considering it would have happened mid-Congress. The constitutional option, on the other hand, is what we're talking about here: the establishment of rules at the beginning of a Congress. Itbeen used numerous times since the cloture rule was established in 1917. In fact, Sen. Robert Byrd used it four times as majority leader to enact filibuster reform.needs to find new parliamentary experts. Daily Kos recommends they talk to this guy

If Reid's going to threaten to do this with 51 votes, and follow through on it, then he needs to make it count. That's by including either a talking filibuster or a strong proposal to force the minority to produce 41 actual votes whenever they want to obstruct a bill or nomination.

We've got 36 hours to send him that message.

Please send an email to your Democratic senator/s urging them to pass real filibuster reform including the talking filibuster and/or flipping the burden.

If you don't have a Democratic senator, call Reid's office at 202-224-3542, and tell him to include the talking filibuster and/or flipping the burden of the filibuster.

Here's a critical piece of information:



[Reid] specified that he has the 51 votes he needs to proceed on a Democratic plan, indicating he's willing to pursue the ""constitutional option"" of changing the rules without the usual two-thirds vote.

He's got the votes to make this happen. The only way real reform happens is if he gives up on the fantasy of a gentlemen's agreement with McConnell, and uses the 51 votes to enact real reforms that can make the Senate function again."

(CNN) —

I blame Kris Kardashian.

Think about it. Doesn’t the most recent episode of “Keeping Up with the Debt Limit” feel more as though it were an E! production than one by C-SPAN? Hasn’t it been as predictable, brief and of itself, as inconsequential as a Kardashian marriage, as odious as Kanye and as certain to lead to unhappiness as Lamar’s reputed drug problem? Doesn’t the pinheaded disconnect from reality seem familiar?

The problem is that it is easier to deal with the Kardashians than their counterparts in the Capitol. We can just change the channel. The reality is, we all depend on the U.S. government in enough ways that letting it turn into a repetitive, meaningless form of basic cable melodrama would be a formula for national catastrophe.

David Rothkopf

We should therefore try to draw lessons from this round of Beltway follies: what we must fix if our country is not to go the way of Kris and Bruce’s marriage. Here are five critical problems we must address.

1. The political system is broken

Gerrymandering has caused House districts to be essentially “owned” by one party or the other. That makes general elections irrelevant. So it is primary voters who determine who runs, and they tend to be the more energized, activist voters of the left and right wings. The result? Extremes are rewarded and virtually ensured of re-election.

Add to that campaign finance rules that give disproportionate power to big money, and incumbents and Senate rules that give the minority and individual senators too much power, and you have system in which gridlock is virtually institutionalized. We need campaign finance reform, an end to gerrymandering and rules reform in both houses of Congress, and we need to make these initiatives a top political priority of America’s centrist majority.

2. Our national conversation has gotten off-track

Promote extremist politicians and reward them for their extremism, and you get tension, incivility and a reluctance to embrace the compromise that is essential to democracy. Bring in the language of religion and culture wars, and the debate becomes about what divides us rather than what we need to bring us together, about our problems and not about their practical solutions.

Wedge issues then play a greater role in campaigns than new ideas. Opponents become enemies rather than neighbors with alternative views.

We need to defuse the language, edit the loaded terminology, reinvest in the separation of church and state and call out dangerously divisive ideas, racism, sexism and sheer stupidity, like denying science, history or basic arithmetic.

3. Governance has become a lost art

The least-valued skill set in Washington is the ability to actually get things done. We mistakenly believe that articulating a problem is the same thing as solving it. We reward those who give good speeches and not those who have a proven track record of fixing things.

Politicians are too often elected because they advance an ideology, and when they serve, they inevitably focus on what they need to do to be re-elected. But their jobs were created to serve the public, to govern and to lead, even if that means making their positions of power more precarious. We need to start voting for people who have proved their skill at bridging partisan divides and focusing on the needs of the electorate.

4. We are ignoring the really big problems

We are trapped in a cycle of punting problems ahead a few months and chipping away at the margins of issues. When this shutdown/debt-limit crisis is finally resolved, we will have a few months until it recurs. If a deal is struck before another crisis happens, it will be incremental.

Yet America has much bigger issues: a too-slow recovery from a great economic setback, an inability to create good jobs at the rate of past recoveries and, perhaps above all, a failure to address the growing inequality that is dividing our society.

It is not just an economic quirk that 90% of the benefits of the current recovery are accruing to the top 10% of our society; it is a formula for social breakdown and national decline. It is also profoundly unjust. We need to start demanding that leaders address these bigger issues.

5. The American people have failed their government … and each other

You can’t blame the politicians. You elected them. You turned away from the system. You didn’t run for office. You didn’t write your views down and pass them along to people in power. You didn’t fund campaigns that supported people committed to big solutions.

You have become ill-informed, caught up in the name-calling and the partisanship and the climate that created the Washington we have today. You’ve got the government you deserve. Remember, according to the Constitution, the top job in the U.S. government goes to the voter. If these clowns in Washington can’t get it right and you don’t fire them, you deserve what you get.

This is not reality television, even though it feels as pointless. This is just reality. And reality, in this democracy, is what the voters make of it. You can’t blame Obama or Boehner. Scarily enough, the TV screen, whether it shows the Kardashians or C-SPAN or cable news, is just a mirror, a reflection of what America wants and is.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Republican Leader Mitch McConnell announced the ""important agreement"" on the floor.

""The eyes of the world have been on Washington all this week and that is a gross understatement,"" Reid said. ""The compromise we reached will provide our economy with the stability it desperately needs.""

McConnell lamented that the agreement would not seriously address ObamaCare, but vowed to keep fighting against the law.

""This is far less than many of us had hoped for, frankly, but it is far better than what some had sought,"" he said.

More On This...

The House would still have to act, presuming the Senate approves the bill.

McConnell said he is ""hoping to wrap it up today in the Senate."" Senate leaders seemed to have a relatively clear path to bring the bill to the floor, after Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas -- one of the chief proponents for using the budget bill to target ObamaCare -- said he would not filibuster even though he doesn't like the agreement.

Senators have been scrambling since Tuesday night to hammer out a proposal, following the collapse of a plan in the House of Representatives.

Talks were led by Reid and McConnell.

The framework on the Senate side would raise the debt ceiling through Feb. 7, and include a spending bill meant to last through Jan. 15. The plan would not include any provision relating to the ObamaCare medical device tax, as prior plans did; instead it would include a single provision meant to verify the income of those receiving ObamaCare subsidies. It would also instruct a bipartisan budget committee to report back on a broader plan by mid-December.

The House could be preparing to move the measure quickly, with a Thursday deadline to raise the debt ceiling looming.

On Tuesday, House Republicans failed to move on an alternate budget plan. House GOP leaders, after initially planning to vote on their plan sometime before midnight, shelved the proposal after leaders struggled to round up the votes. ""It is over,"" one GOP aide told Fox News late Tuesday.

With that decision, focus shifted back to the Senate.

Amid discontent on the House side, conservatives were also unhappy with the Senate version and raised concerns that Senate Republicans would go along with it.

But with House Speaker John Boehner losing support for the latest House plan, the odds increased that the chamber could be left taking up whatever the Senate might send over.

Some Democrats urged Republicans to throw in the towel. ""You have two options -- you can get bowled over by the Senate or you can get bowled over by the Senate,"" said one House Democratic aide.

Senate negotiators are racing against a Thursday deadline to raise the debt ceiling.

While the Senate had originally been crafting a bipartisan bill to address the budget impasse, House Republicans surprised Senate negotiators earlier Tuesday when they announced they were pursuing their own framework. Moving quickly, Boehner's office announced late Tuesday afternoon that the chamber would vote by the end of the night.

But a vital meeting of the House Rules Committee, which prepares bills for the floor, was then postponed -- a signal that House leaders were lacking the necessary votes.

Fox News is told that a decision by conservative group Heritage Action to come out against the emerging bill drove some Republicans to oppose the plan -- and helped sideline the proposal. Others said GOP leaders were losing votes on the plan even before the Heritage Action statement came out.

Heritage Action complained that the House plan would ""do nothing"" to stall ""massive new entitlements"" in ObamaCare.

The revised House plan was aimed at both ending the partial government shutdown and raising the debt ceiling, but also imposing one ObamaCare-related provision.

Though Republicans have considered over the last several weeks a range of provisions relating to ObamaCare, the one they settled on in this package would force Congress, the president, and many other administration officials and staff onto ObamaCare without additional subsidies. GOP lawmakers described the proposed mandate as a matter of ""fairness.""

""If the president and Senate Democrats are going to force the American people to live under ObamaCare, then they and all Washington leaders should not be shielded from the law,"" one GOP aide said.

The House plan also would have ended the partial government shutdown by funding the government through Dec. 15. And it would also raise the debt ceiling through Feb. 7 -- in turn averting the looming Thursday deadline to raise the debt cap.

Republicans earlier claimed the details of their plan were not so far off from a bipartisan approach being crafted in the Senate. Republicans urged Democrats to give it a chance, and questioned why they would preemptively reject it.

""To say, 'absolutely categorically not, we will not consider what the Republicans in the House of Representatives are doing,' in my view, is piling on,"" Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said on the Senate floor, as Democrats lined up against the House plan. ""Let's sit down and work this out.""

White House spokeswoman Amy Brundage called the House approach a ""partisan attempt to appease a small group of Tea Party Republicans who forced the government shutdown in the first place.""

The Postal Service also said the rise in online retail purchases and other e-commerce was contributing to its increase in that area and was why it would continue to deliver packages on Saturdays.

Since 1981, a Congressional mandate has required the Postal Service to deliver mail six days a week. But on Wednesday the agency argued that since the current stopgap budget measure for the entire government, known as a continuing resolution, did not contain language explicitly mandating six-day delivery, the agency could make the changes without Congressional approval.

But some members of Congress immediately questioned the Postal Service’s claim.

“The passage of the continuing resolution did not suspend that language, as they claim, but in fact extended it,” said Representative José E. Serrano, Democrat of New York and ranking member on the appropriations subcommittee on financial services and general government, which has jurisdiction over the post office. “Rather than use very dubious legal arguments to end Saturday delivery, the U.S.P.S. should work hand in hand with Congress to come up with a successful restructuring and reform package that allows them to become more efficient while maintaining vital services like Saturday delivery.”

Senator Thomas R. Carper, Democrat of Delaware, who led a bipartisan effort to pass a postal overhaul bill last year, called the post office decision disappointing. But he added, “Despite my disappointment, it’s hard to condemn the postmaster general for moving aggressively to do what he believes he can and must do to keep the lights on at the Postal Service, which may be only months away from insolvency.”

Last April, the Senate passed a bill that provided early retirement incentives to about 100,000 postal workers, or 18 percent of its employees, and allowed the Postal Service to recoup more than $11 billion it overpaid into an employee pension fund. The Senate bill did not stop Saturday deliveries immediately, but it would have allowed the agency to consider the issue in two years."

http://news.yahoo.com/obama-seeks-deal-proposes-cuts-160608265.html,,[],"Obama seeks deal, proposes cuts to Social Security","WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seeking an elusive middle ground, President Barack Obama is proposing a 2014 budget that embraces tax increases abhorred by Republicans as well as reductions, loathed by liberals, in the growth of Social Security and other benefit programs.

The plan, if ever enacted, could touch almost all Americans. The rich would see tax increases, the poor and the elderly would get smaller annual increases in their benefits, and middle income taxpayers would slip into higher tax brackets despite Obama's repeated vows not to add to the tax burden of the middle class. His proposed changes, once phased in, would mean a cut in Social Security benefits of nearly $1,000 a year for an average 85-year-old, smaller cuts for younger retirees.

Obama proposed much the same without success to House Speaker John Boehner in December. The response Friday was dismissive from Republicans and hostile from liberals, labor and advocates for the elderly.

But the proposal aims to tackle worrisome deficits that are adding to the national debt and placing a long-term burden on the nation, prompting praise from independent deficit hawks. Obama's budget also proposes new spending for public works projects, pre-school education and for job and benefit assistance for veterans.

""It's not the president's ideal approach to our budget challenges, but it is a serious compromise proposition that demonstrates that he wants to get things done,"" said White House press secretary Jay Carney.

The budget, which Obama will release Wednesday to cover the budget year beginning Oct. 1, proposes spending cuts and revenue increases that would result in $1.8 trillion in deficit reductions over 10 years. That figure would replace $1.2 trillion in automatic spending cuts that are poised to take effect over the next 10 years if Congress and the president don't come up with an alternative, thus delivering a net increase in deficit reduction of $600 billion.

Counting reductions and higher taxes that Congress and Obama have approved since 2011, the 2014 budget would contribute to $4.3 trillion in total deficit reduction by 2023.

Story continues

The budget wouldn't affect the $85 billion in cuts that kicked in last month for this budget year.

A key feature of Obama's plan is a revised inflation adjustment called ""chained CPI."" This new formula would effectively curb annual increases in a broad swath of government programs but would have its biggest impact on Social Security. By encompassing Obama's offer to Boehner, R-Ohio, the plan would also include reductions in Medicare spending, much of it by targeting payments to health care providers and drug companies. The Medicare proposal also would require wealthier recipients to pay higher premiums or co-pays.

Obama's budget proposal also calls for additional tax revenue, primarily by placing a 28 percent cap on deductions and other tax exclusions. That plan would affect wealthy taxpayers as would a new administration proposal to place limits on tax-preferred retirement accounts for millionaires and billionaires.

Obama made the same offer to Boehner in December when he and the speaker were negotiating ways of avoiding a steep, so-called fiscal cliff of combined across-the-board spending cuts and sweeping tax increases caused by the expiration of Bush-era tax rates. Boehner rejected that plan and ultimately Congress approved tax increases that were half of what Obama had sought.

""If you look at where the president's final offer and Boehner were ... they were extremely close to each other,"" said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. ""We do think that it's a very good sign that the president has included real entitlement reforms in the budget.""

Boehner, in a statement Friday, said House Republicans made clear to Obama last month that he should not make savings in entitlement programs that both sides agree on, contingent on more tax increases.

""If the president believes these modest entitlement savings are needed to help shore up these programs, there's no reason they should be held hostage for more tax hikes,"" Boehner said. ""That's no way to lead and move the country forward.""

The inflation adjustment would reduce federal spending on government programs over 10 years by about $130 billion, according to White House estimates. Because it also affects how tax brackets are adjusted, it would also generate about $100 billion in higher taxes and hit even middle income taxpayers.

Once the change is fully phased in, Social Security benefits for a typical middle-income 65-year-old would be about $136 less a year, according to an analysis of Social Security data. At age 75, annual benefits under the new index would be $560 less. At 85, the cut would be $984 a year.

The concept behind the chained CPI is that consumers substitute lower-priced alternatives for goods whose costs spike. So, for example, if the price of oranges goes too high for some consumers, they could buy alternatives like apples or strawberries if their prices were more affordable. This flexibility isn't considered in the current system of gauging inflation, a calculation that determines how much benefits grow each year. Taking it into account means such benefits won't grow by as much.

Advocates for the elderly say seniors pay a higher portion of their income for health care, where costs rise more quickly than inflation.

The White House has said the cost-of-living adjustments would include protections for ""vulnerable"" recipients.

""The president should drop these misguided cuts in benefits and focus instead on building support in Congress for investing in jobs,"" AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said in a statement.

AARP's legislative policy director said Obama's budget proposal, while not a surprise, was a disappointment.

""The message seems to be that the president wants a deal and is willing to even sacrifice such important benefits as Social Security as part of that deal,"" said David Certner. The seniors lobby argues that Social Security doesn't belong in the budget talks because it isn't contributing to the deficit and is separately financed with its own dedicated taxes.

Citing the effect on veterans, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, said he was ""terribly disappointed"" in the Obama plan and would ""do everything in my power to block"" it.

While Obama has proposed the slower cost of living adjustment plan during fiscal negotiations with Republican leaders, placing it in the budget would put the administration's official imprint on the plan and mark a full shift from Obama's stand in 2008, when he campaigned against Republican Party nominee John McCain.

In a Sept. 6, 2008, speech to AARP, Obama said: ""John McCain's campaign has suggested that the best answer for the growing pressures on Social Security might be to cut cost-of-living adjustments or raise the retirement age. Let me be clear: I will not do either.""

Obama also proposes $305 billion in cuts to Medicare over a decade, including $156 billion through lower Medicare payments to drug companies and higher premiums or co-pays from wealthy recipients. That's to the right of the conservative budget of House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wis., which barely touches Medicare in the coming 10 years, cutting just $129 billion from the program. The huge Medicare savings from Ryan's proposal, which transforms the system into a program in which the government subsidizes health insurance purchases on the private market, wouldn't accrue until the following decade.

Obama's budget comes after the Republican-controlled House and Democratic-run Senate passed separate and markedly different budget proposals. House Republicans achieved long-term deficit reductions by targeting safety net programs; Democrats instead protected those programs and called for $1 trillion in tax increases.

But Obama has been making a concerted effort to win Republican support, especially in the Senate. He has even scheduled a dinner with Republican lawmakers on the evening that his budget is released next week.

As described by the administration officials, the budget proposal would also end a loophole that permits people to obtain unemployment insurance and disability benefits at the same time.

Obama's proposal, however, includes calls for increased spending. It proposes $50 billion for public works projects. It also would make preschool available to more children by increasing the tax on tobacco.

Elizabeth Warren, the newest member of the Senate Banking Committee, waited patiently for her first chance to question top financial regulators at a recent hearing on Capitol Hill.

When her turn finally came after 90 minutes, Warren quickly showed she wouldn’t be following the custom that a freshman senator be seen and not heard.

After some pleasantries, the longtime consumer advocate and Wall Street critic lit into the heads of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and officials from four other agencies for their practice of allowing big banks to settle government allegations of wrongdoing out of court.

“I’m really concerned that too-big-to-fail has become too big for trial,” said Warren, 63, who chastised regulators for treating financial executives better than average Americans.

Her questions in February, and at subsequent hearings, have helped quickly establish the Massachusetts Democrat as a key player on issues affecting the financial industry despite her rock-bottom seniority: 97th out of 100 senators. She has drawn kudos from colleagues — even some Republicans — for her deep knowledge of the issues and her ability to fire succinct questions at witnesses.

The attention Warren is drawing — video clips of her first Banking Committee hearing went viral on YouTube — could catapult her even further. Some liberals have begun touting her as a potential 2016 presidential candidate.

“She has maximized the influence and attention that a freshman senator can get,” said Jaret Seiberg, a senior policy analyst with financial services firm Guggenheim Partners. “Now, when we look at issues of too-big-to-fail and of consumer protection, people want to know what Elizabeth Warren has to say.”

The fast start by Warren, one of the few politicians to embrace the Occupy Wall Street movement, has confirmed the fears of some in the financial industry that she wouldn’t hesitate to criticize them from her new, higher-profile position.

Warren’s sharp rhetoric is “certainly harmful to our industry,” said Ballard Cassady, president of the Kentucky Bankers Assn.

Her comments make it sound as if all bankers were responsible for the financial crisis, he said, adding that tougher regulation makes it more difficult for small bankers to serve their communities.

Given the industry’s experience with Warren, her push for tighter regulation has not been surprising, said James Ballentine, top lobbyist for the trade group American Bankers Assn. But her blunt and forceful questioning has opened some eyes, he said.

“Perhaps folks aren’t used to her style and have been a little shocked by that,” Ballentine said.

Warren’s tough interrogation of regulators has delighted liberals, who helped her defeat Republican incumbent Scott Brown last fall in the nation’s most expensive Senate race.

“She has hit the ground running and already made a name for herself as someone who will ask not only the hard questions but the really pertinent questions,” Liz Coyle, deputy director of Georgia Watch, a consumer advocacy group, said after attending a Warren speech at a Washington conference in March.

At subsequent Senate hearings, Warren stayed on the offensive with her plain-spoken, direct questions.

She grilled other regulators and Obama administration officials, even going head to head with Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke over whether large banks are able to borrow money at a reduced rate because the markets still believe the government would not let them fail.

“Ordinary folks pay for homeowners’ insurance. Ordinary folks pay for car insurance,” she lectured Bernanke. “And these big financial institutions are getting cheaper borrowing … simply because people believe that the government would step in and bail them out.”

Some critics in the financial industry have been quick to disparage privately what they consider to be grandstanding comments, but they haven’t been so eager to voice their views publicly about a sitting senator with influence on their issues.

Outside the industry, conservative activists have criticized Warren for her strong liberal views about Wall Street and other topics, such as her support of tougher gun controls and opposition to Social Security benefit cuts.

Warren, though, isn’t letting that deter her from developing a more well-rounded resume.

For instance, she joined in signing a letter with some Republicans that urged regulators to act more quickly in writing new rules aimed at preventing future bailouts, and she co-sponsored a bipartisan bill on reforming taxpayer-owned housing finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

“You can tell Sen. Warren spends a lot of time preparing for meetings and hearings, which is something I appreciate,” said Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), a banking committee colleague.

Warren’s positions and her eagerness to speak out about them are no surprise to people in the financial industry. They’ve been tangling with her since she headed the congressional oversight panel for the $700-billion bailout fund and then helped launch the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

“I don’t see Elizabeth Warren not raising an issue that she believes needs to be raised,” said Richard Hunt, president of the Consumer Bankers Assn. “I think she’ll be in the center of all banking legislation.”

There were expectations she might ease her way into the spotlight, following the playbook of Hillary Rodham Clinton, another big-name politician who reached the Senate in her first run for public office.

Like Warren — an Oklahoma native who began teaching at Harvard Law School in 1995 — Chicago-native Clinton was branded a carpetbagger when she ran for a Senate seat from New York in 2000. So Clinton focused narrowly on state issues and developing relationships with colleagues during her first months in office.

Warren also has stayed centered on state issues, such as the fishing industry and the Boston Marathon bombing. She has declined most interview requests from the national media, including one from The Times.

Warren and her staff “are very smart to spend most of their time and attention focusing on Massachusetts while picking and choosing their spots on issues on the national level,” said Jim Manley, a former top Senate Democratic aide.

So far, those spots have largely been on financial regulation.

“It’s hard enough to get legislation enacted if you’re a senior member, but as a freshman senator it’s almost impossible,” Seiberg said. “So the way you make your mark is by helping set the agenda. And she’s done that.”

Jones' good fortune comes courtesy of legislation he sponsored in 1989. Under that law, members of the General Assembly who worked long enough to hit their limit on pension benefits — a generous 85 percent of their final salary after just 20 years — would get an extra reward.

For every additional year they stayed on, 3 percent of their initial pension would be added to their retirement checks. For Jones, working an extra 16 years netted him a $41,000 pension boost in 2009; he drew $126,004 last year.

The 3 percent deal, available to no one in state government outside of the General Assembly Retirement System, or GARS, is another in a long line of pension provisions written by lawmakers for lawmakers, a Tribune investigation found. It also stands as a glaring example of how the legislature repeatedly passed benefit increases with little or no concern for the costs.

Jones was a direct sponsor of many of these questionable deals. In addition to helping long-serving state lawmakers, the former senator sponsored legislation that allowed Chicago aldermen to receive the most lucrative pensions in city government and gave labor leaders public pensions based on their private salaries.

Jones justified giving the 3 percent perk to himself and his colleagues by noting that they were still contributing money to their pensions after they had served long enough to receive the maximum benefit.

""(F)or those members of the General Assembly right now who ... have maxed out ... they are still contributing to that retirement system,"" Jones told his colleagues the day the bill passed. ""So all this does is give them a little 3 percent on their own money.""

Jones' quote implied that lawmakers' pensions were already fully funded. But that is not correct. Jones would have had to double his pension contributions to cover the high benefit he is receiving, records show, even after generous contributions from the state, healthy investment returns and the extra 16 years of payments he put in.

Even more important to the pension system's bottom line was another provision in the same 1989 legislation, one that dramatically increased the annual cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, for all retirees in the state and Chicago.

It was a subtle change: The COLA formula was switched from simple to compounding interest. At the time, it was expected to cost the state $3.2 billion over the next 40 years. But because consecutive governors and legislatures failed to make payments adequate to cover the increase, the price tag has grown much higher and now accounts for a large portion of the state's $83 billion in unfunded liabilities.

With Illinois' pension system racing toward insolvency, the General Assembly is working feverishly to find a way to shore up the foundering funds before the legislative session ends Thursday. But with elections looming over all General Assembly members, many are skittish about making sweeping changes before the campaign season.

Aside from the political price they stand to pay, legislators have more to lose than nearly any other group caught up in Illinois' pension mess. That's because, along with judges, their benefits are the most lucrative in state government, despite the fact that their positions are part time and many members hold jobs outside of the legislature.

More than a third of all retirees in the legislative pension fund make more money now than they did when they served in government. Ten percent of them receive more than $100,000 in pension payouts every year, benefits that come on top of the free or deeply discounted health insurance that retired lawmakers have long received.

The result is that at a time when the state has $8 billion in unpaid bills and is cutting funding for public schools, health care and other services, Illinois is sending out ever larger retirement checks to former lawmakers. Their pension fund is also the state's worst-funded plan, with just 21 percent of the assets needed to cover what the legislature has promised itself over the years.

House Speaker Michael Madigan and Senate President John Cullerton played roles in many of the pension perks now on the books but are quick to point out that most of the loopholes that allowed lawmakers to spike their pensions have been closed. The 3 percent perk ended in 2003.

But anyone who was in office before those changes took effect can still benefit. And as lawmakers consider reforms, many of them say it would be unconstitutional to eliminate even the most outrageous pension perks once they've been bestowed.

Take Madigan's case. If he retired this year after roughly 40 years in office, the 1989 law would boost his annual pension from about $81,000 to $131,000 according to current figures from GARS. That's 137 percent of his current salary. Cullerton's pension would go up by roughly $31,000 to $112,000 a year, or 117 percent of what he now earns. Both lawmakers helped advance, and eventually voted for, the legislation that created the perk for longtime lawmakers.

Jones, meanwhile, will be allowed to continue collecting his inflated pension, along with an annual 3 percent compounding COLA, for as long as he lives.

Reached by phone, Jones blamed the current pension crisis on Republican governors who failed to make adequate contributions to the pension funds.

""That's where the problem started, and that's why you have the pension system the way it is,"" Jones said. ""If you take away the COLA and take away the 3 percent (for lawmakers), that's not going to solve the problems.""

Madigan declined to be interviewed for this story. In a statement, Cullerton said: ""I've made it clear that meaningful and constitutional pension reform is needed to restore financial stability to the state. It is my hope that in the days ahead we will be able to address issues like the compounding COLA. And let me be clear in saying that all along I've believed that lawmakers have to sacrifice too in the changes to the pension system.""

http://money.cnn.com/2013/01/17/news/companies/boeing-washington-clout/index.html,2013-01-17 00:00:00,['Jennifer Liberto'],Probe to test Boeing's clout in Washington,"With Boeing's flagship Dreamliner airplane grounded, the nation's largest aircraft manufacturer could soon need to test its clout in Washington.

Boeing (BA) has deep ties with the federal government as a top supplier of aircraft to the U.S. Air Force.

It has also worked aggressively to draw high-profile attention to its Dreamliner jets. Last year, President Obama visited a Boeing factory that makes the 787 Dreamliners in Everett, Wash.

The visit was used to drum up support for a federal agency called the Export-Import Bank, which provides loans and guarantees to foreign countries so they can buy U.S. products. U.S. taxpayer guarantees, via the Ex-Im bank, have helped finance sales of Boeing's 787 Dreamliners to airlines of countries such as India, Poland and Ethiopia.

In fact, 65% of the $15.3 billion worth of loan guarantees that the Ex-Im bank issued in 2007 and 2008 went to help foreign countries buy Boeing aircraft, according to a 2009 report issued by the nonprofit Pew Charitable Trusts. Last year, Congress reauthorized the Export-Import Bank by four years, and raised its loan limits to $140 billion.

Experts say Boeing's influence in Washington helped settle a high-profile labor fight with the National Labor Relations Board. After Boeing's union reached an agreement, the federal agency dropped a complaint against Boeing for building a new non-union plant in South Carolina that helped make Dreamliner jets.

Boeing's influence also extends to the FAA, which last week announced a probe into the design, manufacture and assembly of the Dreamliner after problems first began to surface. On Wednesday, the FAA grounded the Dreamliner in the United States, a move that resulted in taking all 50 planes worldwide out of service.

Related: Boeing problems escalate with FAA grounding

The Dreamliner, Boeing's newest airplane, is made of lightweight materials and uses 20% less fuel while being 60% less noisy than similar planes. It also flies the longest distance for a midsized plane that holds up to 250 passengers.

The plane is widely seen as playing a key role in Boeing's future. It started commercial flights in October 2011. Boeing has orders for 800 more Dreamliners, but so far the only U.S.-based carrier to put them in service is United (UAL).

The FAA has worked very closely with Boeing to get the Dreamliner certified safe for air travel at a faster-than-usual pace, according to consultant and former airline executive Robert W. Mann. He said that the FAA was under pressure to fast-track approval of different design parts of the 787 Dreamliner because of the excitement surrounding the aircraft.

""When you start to stack up very innovative solutions, either as designs or as processes, any one of these is OK,"" Mann said. ""But when you start to build an aircraft entirely out of very innovative approaches to problems, you start to think, do you really want to allow the oversight agency to hurry along the certification process?""

Boeing's influence in Washington partly stems from its position as one of the nation's largest manufacturers, with a workforce topping 150,000. As a larger defense contractor, its fortunes trickle down to myriad other companies and industries that supply parts.

Boeing spent $11.8 million on lobbying last year and $3 million during the latest election, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Boeing competitor Lockheed Martin (LMT) came in second place, among big aerospace firms, spending $11.5 million on lobbying, according to the center.

Obama tapped Boeing CEO James McNerney to chair the President's Export Council in March 2010.

McNerney has sought to calm fears about the Dreamliner. On Wednesday, McNerney said in a statement that he is ""confident the 787 is safe and we stand behind its overall integrity.""

Calls and e-mails made to Boeing seeking comment for this story were not returned. The FAA had no immediate comment on the story."

In fact, he was counting on it. He wanted to show that he was willing to antagonize his supporters to get a budget compromise, putting Republicans on the spot to do the same.

Naturally, Republicans refused. Curbing the rise of Social Security benefits and raising Medicare premiums for higher-income people were two of the highest priorities for Republican leaders just a few months ago. Senator Mitch McConnell, the minority leader, said last fall that if Mr. Obama proposed them, he would consider allowing tax revenue to go up.

But, on Wednesday, when the president actually did so, Mr. McConnell dismissed the budget as unserious. Not a single Congressional Republican could be found to consider a budget that combines twice as much in spending cuts as it raises in tax revenues.

The Social Security proposal remains a bad idea, and, as this page has explained, it could hurt vulnerable retirees and stymie better ideas to improve the system, like raising the wage cap subject to the payroll tax. But it seems unlikely to happen if Mr. Obama holds to his demand for more revenues in exchange, given the Republican intransigence. For now, it has served its purpose — no one will be able to accuse Mr. Obama of refusing to touch entitlements, and no one can credit Republicans for being at all serious about a deficit-reduction compromise."

Economic Professor Richard Wolff: You know he gets away with saying things which no undergraduate in the United States with a responsible economic professor could ever get away with. If you want to refer to things as nanny states, then the place you go to in Europe is not the southern tier, Portugal, Spain, and Italy. The places you go are Germany and Scandinavia, because they provide more social services to their people than anybody else. And guess what, not only are they not in trouble economically, they are the winners of the current situation. The unemployment rate in Germany is now below five percent. Ours is pushing between seven and eight percent. So, ah, please get your facts right Mr. O’Reilly. The nanny state you call it; the program of countries like Germany and Scandinavia who tax their people heavily by all means, but who provide them with social services that would be the envy of the United States, a national health program that takes care of you whether you are employed or not and gives you proper healthcare. In France for example the law says when you go to work you get five weeks paid vacation. That’s not an option, that’s the law. You get support when you are a new parent, childcare and so forth. They provide services and they are successful in Germany and Scandinavia, much more than we are in the United States; and much more than those countries in the south. So they are not broke in the south because they are nanny states, since the nanny states par excellence are doing better than everyone. The actual truth of Mr. O’Reilly is the opposite of what he says. The more you do nanny state, the better off you are during a crisis, and to minimize the cost of the crisis. That’s what the European economic situation actually teaches. He is just making it up as he goes along to conform to an ideological position that is harder and harder for folks like him to sustain so he has to reach further and further into fantasy.

Fox News can afford to have economists to give its opinion masters factual information. It is obvious they have no interest in that. O’Reilly could not possibly believe what he is saying. Not only is there evidence from Europe as was stated by Professor Wolff, but it was true here in America.

When we raised taxes to balance our budget the economy was much more robust. Other than empirical evidence is the tenet in Economics 101 known as the marginal propensity to consume. It can be paraphrased to state that giving 1000 middle class persons $100 creates a more robust economy than given a millionaire $100,000 because those 1000 middle class persons will spend most of it while the millionaire will probably save it (hoard it). Saved money that is not immediately reinvested into an economy by buying more goods is not stimulative.

The reality is to get the economy rolling the wealthy must pay a much higher percentage in taxes since it is evident they have no desire to invest in America inasmuch as it is the middle class that purchased their goods and services to make them wealthy. It is also the middle class that fight the wars and die to keep the sea lanes open for the commerce that generates their wealth.

What O’Reilly sees as a nanny state is a humane state. While many Americans, the teacher, the engineer, the lawyer, the doctor, and many others do real work, Bill O’Reilly gets millions to simple blow hot air.

Set to begin March 1 at 11:59 p.m., the sequester is a set of automatic spending cuts put into law by the Budget Control Act. Signed by President Barack Obama in August 2011, that legislation raised the debt ceiling and sought to apply pressure on Congress to come up with a longer term plan for deficit reduction.

The $1.2 trillion in budget cuts would be spread over nine years and are equally divided between domestic and defense-related spending. During the remainder of the 2013 fiscal year, $85 billion worth of cuts are set to go into effect. The budget cuts would end in 2021.

Why is the sequester happening?

When the debt limit was raised in 2011, Republicans demanded that budget cuts be included in the legislation. The Congress Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction -- or the ""super committee"" put in charge of figuring out how to implement the cuts called for in the Budget Control Act -- ultimately proved unable to reach a bipartisan agreement on cutting $1.2 trillion from the deficit. With the threat of automatic sequestration still looming, Congress was tasked with finding those cuts. No luck so far. So, while sequestration was never intended to actually go into effect, it now most likely will.

What funding will the sequester affect?

The sequester will affect government spending across the board. The military will see $550 billion in cuts, drawing funds away from national security and military operations. On the domestic side, cuts will affect health care, education, law enforcement, disaster relief, unemployment benefits, non-profit organization funds, scientific research and more.

Will any funding not be affected?

The sequester stipulates certain areas of government spending that will see no cuts. No money will be drawn from spending on wars and military personnel. Funding allocated for Medicaid, Social Security, Pell grants, veterans' benefits and some low-income programs will not be affected, either.

Have lawmakers tried to stop the sequester?

Both Democrats and Republicans are trying to figure out how to stop the sequester from going into effect, but the two parties can't agree on a plan. Senate Democrats introduced a plan titled the American Family Economic Protection Act, which identified $120 billion in savings that would replace sequester cuts until the end of December 2013. Republicans weren't in agreement on their own solution, but eventually came forward with a counterproposal that would have kept the sequester in place, but given Obama control in implementing the cuts. Both plans were ultimately voted down.

In a speech Tuesday in Phoenix, Obama will call for transitioning the business model of Fannie and Freddie into a system where ""private capital must be wiped out before the government pays on any form of catastrophic guarantee,"" a senior administration official said.

Obama will also renew his calls for sweeping mortgage refinancing legislation when he travels to Phoenix Tuesday. Arizona's desert capital was the epicenter of the housing crisis that began in 2008, but the market there has rebounded strongly, with home prices up and foreclosures down.

The president's visit to Phoenix marks the latest stop on his summertime economic tour aimed at refocusing his agenda on middle class Americans still struggling to fully recover following the recession. The collapse of the housing market in particular had a dramatic impact on people's lives and the economic viability of communities across the country.

""So many Americans across the country view their own economic and financial circumstances through their homes and whether they own a home, whether their home is underwater, whether they feel like they have equity in their homes,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said Monday.

Senior administration officials said Obama would focus in Phoenix on shifting more of the burden for supporting the nation's massive mortgage market to the private sector. A centerpiece of that effort is his support for winding down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

The White House has already lauded efforts to achieve that goal spearheaded by Republican Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee and Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia. While Obama will outline his own proposals on Tuesday, his plans are largely in line with the bipartisan Senate overhaul.

Officials said Obama will insist that the government only step in to pay out mortgage guarantees after private capital has been exhausted and that private capital bear the substantial majority of any losses. He will also call for Fannie and Freddie's investment portfolios to be wound down by at least 15 percent per year.

Obama advisers did not outline a specific timeframe for winding down Fannie and Freddie. The Corker-Warner legislation would shutter the operations within five years.

Fannie and Freddie were nationalized during the 2008 financial collapse and bailed out with $187 billion in taxpayer-funded loans. The two enterprises don't directly make loans, but buy mortgages from lenders, package them as bonds, guarantee them against default and sell them to investors.

Fannie and Freddie currently own or guarantee half of all U.S. mortgages and back nearly 90 percent of new ones.

Jared Bernstein, a former member of Obama’s economic team, told The Wall Street Journal the president is putting a marker down ""that says there's a need for a government backstop for the secondary mortgage market, one whose magnitude is still to be determined.""

Against the backdrop of Phoenix's reinvigorated housing market, Obama will also tout refinancing proposals that gained little traction on Capitol Hill when he first unveiled them last year. Among his proposals is a call for expanding refinancing eligibility for homeowners who do not have government-backed mortgages.

The president will also look to link his housing proposals to immigration reform, his top second term legislative priority. Officials said he will argue that legal immigration can stimulate the housing market, noting that immigrants accounted for 40 percent of new homeowners nationwide between 2000 and 2010, according to the Obama administration.

The officials insisted on anonymity in order to preview the president's remarks ahead of his trip.

The nationwide housing recovery has been providing critical support to the economy at a time when manufacturing and business investment have stagnated. Steady job growth and low mortgage rates in the past year have also fueled more home sales. The increased demand, along with a tight supply of homes for sale, has pushed home prices higher. That's encouraged builders to start more homes and create more construction jobs.

The recovery in Phoenix is emblematic of the larger improvements happening in many parts of the country.

Just two years ago, the region was in the throes of the worst housing collapse in the country, with prices down nearly 60 percent from their June 2006 peak and banks foreclosing on 70,000 homeowners a year. While the current median home price remains below peak, the levels have risen 66 percent from September 2011. Buyers are plentiful and homes for sale scarce, leading to bidding wars for resale homes.

Ryan, the former Republican vice presidential candidate, has been a tea party favorite and a bridge between House conservatives and the party leadership ever since he took the lead in crafting a plan to scale back Medicare and other social programs to reduce federal spending.

But on Wednesday, when Ryan (R-Wis.) stepped forward to try to bring Republican factions together behind a strategy to end the government’s latest budget stalemate, some of the same conservatives who once trusted him went cold.

The complaint: His plan, which centered on trimming back spending on government entitlement programs, failed to mention the demise of Obamacare as a top Republican objective. Conservatives accused him of abandoning their cause and caving in to Democrats.

“So we are going to ditch the fight over Obamacare, which is extremely unpopular, to fight for Medicare reform? Really, Paul Ryan? And they think we are politically stupid?” wrote Daniel Horowitz on RedState.com, an influential conservative website.

“This is the road to cave city,” he said.

The heated reaction showed how deeply divided Republicans remain in the second week of the government shutdown — with a week to go before the nation could run out of money to pay its bills.

House GOP leaders have been trying to shift the focus of their standoff with the White House and Senate Democrats away from Sen. Ted Cruz’s drive to stop the president’s health law to a broader plan to cut the budget. But partly as a result, the majority led by House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) can no longer explain what, exactly, it is fighting for.

“There are a lot of ideas right now on the table,” said Rep. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.). But he said Republicans hadn’t yet coalesced around one approach.

Advertisement

One way out would be a short-term agreement to raise the $16.7-trillion debt ceiling for a few weeks while both sides work on a broader budget agreement. Republicans are increasingly floating this proposal, but Democrats are wary that the GOP will demand concessions.

Senate Democrats are expected to vote this weekend on a proposal to suspend the debt limit through 2014.

Republican divisions over what they want from the White House have weakened their hand and made the stalemate harder to resolve. The party’s struggles could be seen in a new Gallup poll that put the GOP’s favorable rating at 28%, the lowest measure for either political party since Gallup started asking the question in 1992 — lower even than the GOP’s standing during the last government shutdowns in 1995 and 1996.

Ryan defended his approach on conservative commentator Bill Bennett’s radio show. “I don’t know that within the next two weeks we have a viable strategy for actually repealing Obamacare, every piece of it,” he said.

Advertisement

The conservative Heritage Action, which helped launch the strategy taken by tea party favorite Cruz (R-Texas), said any action short of a fight over the Affordable Care Act would be “detrimental.”

“Fundamentally, we are not supportive of anything that’s going to take the focus away from the current fight over Obamacare,” said Heritage’s Dan Holler. “That’s where we think the fight needs to be — that’s where the fight is.”

Advertisement

At the same time, top conservatives, especially those tired of the Cruz-led campaign, heaped praise on Ryan as the party’s expert on fiscal issues. “Excellent piece by @RepPaulRyan on a path forward,” tweeted Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), once a leader among House conservatives.

But two-term Rep. Mo Brooks, a Republican from Alabama, called Ryan’s brief presentation before the House GOP’s conservative caucus Wednesday “very generic” and walked away undecided on whether he would sign on.

“The devil’s in the details,” Brooks said. “Delaying socialized medicine — that is one way to delay one’s insolvency.”

As Boehner struggled to find a cohesive strategy, the White House sought to amplify Obama’s willingness to negotiate with Congress once it passes bills to end the shutdown and avert a default. The president invited every Republican in the House to meet with him Thursday at the White House. He held a similar session with Democrats on Wednesday.

Advertisement

Boehner, however, decided to limit the White House session to a few top House Republicans. One GOP leadership aide said that a broader meeting would be little more than a “photo op.”

The decision “disappointed” Obama, the White House spokesman said. “The president thought it was important to talk directly with the members who forced this economic crisis on the country about how the shutdown and a failure to pay the country’s bills could devastate the economy,” said White House Press Secretary Jay Carney.

Advertisement

Obama has refused to engage in serious talks until Republicans agree to reopen the government and raise the debt limit. “The president will talk to anyone any time and looks forward to their visit to the White House, but will not pay the Republicans ransom for doing their job,” Carney said.

Splinters among Democrats, who have publicly maintained an unusually united front, also emerged Wednesday, as liberals warned against budget talks that could result in steep cuts to cherished government programs.

Advertisement

Rep. Raul M. Grijalva (D-Ariz.), co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, has called those fears “grand bargain paranoia.” Democrats worry, based on past talks aimed at a so-called grand bargain, that the president might be willing to reduce Social Security benefits or increase the amount of money higher-income seniors pay toward Medicare.

But Democrats appeared unified Wednesday as senators rallied on the Capitol steps and House Democrats met with Obama. “The debt ceiling needs to be lifted. They’re not getting anything for that,” said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) as she left the White House with her leadership team.

Advertisement

The reemergence of Ryan, whose role had faded since the January day when he led rebellious House Republicans back from the brink of an earlier fiscal standoff, still holds the potential to shift the debate.

Ryan’s prescriptions, spelled out in an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal, reflect Boehner’s interest in a deal that could provide what the budget chairman has called a “big down payment” on the nation’s debt.

Advertisement

Ryan said Wednesday that he was “totally committed to dismantling” the healthcare law. “Obamacare is an entitlement just like any other entitlement. So that, as far as we’re concerned, is in this conversation,” he said on Bennett’s radio show. “Ultimately, we have to rethink all of our nation’s healthcare laws.”

Those who vote for the bill will be on Team Boehner and those who oppose it will be on Team Cantor. Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is backing the bill, and conservative groups like FreedomWorks are opposing it.

House Speaker John Boehner is, according to some media accounts and several Republican members, prepared to vote in favor of the the Senate “fiscal cliff” deal that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Vice President Joe Biden cut late on New Year’s Eve, which passed by an 89-8 margin. Boehner aides haven’t answered requests for confirmation of these rumors and reports. The National Review‘s Robert Costa reports that Boehner won’t personally vote unless his vote is needed to pass the plan through the House.

House Majority Leader Eric Cantor will be taking a different path. He’ll be voting against the bill, and according to some offices, he’s been the organizing power behind House GOP opposition to the deal.

That means the number one and number two House Republicans will be heading in completely different directions when the “fiscal cliff” vote happens.

Some conservatives, like Rep. Raul Labrador of Idaho, who plan to vote against the bill expect it to pass anyway. And that may end up happening. But the internal House GOP fight is far from over with this vote.

Boehner suffered politically after his failure to pass his fiscal cliff “Plan B” before Christmas, and now that he’ll likely need Democratic votes to push this plan through he’s even weaker.

That means Cantor, who’s wanted the speakership for a long time, could strike now and challenge Boehner in the election for House officeholders on Thursday–or he’ll likely have to wait at least another two years.

Cantor’s spokespersons Doug Heye and Rory Cooper both publicly tweeted denials. “Majority Leader Cantor stands with @SpeakerBoehner,” Heye wrote. “Speculation otherwise is silly, non-productive and untrue.”

“Folks out there w/ crazy theories about what’s going on in House,” Cooper wrote. “All ridiculous. Just figuring out best path forward. Stay calm, carry on.”

Cooper’s and Heye’s comments don’t negate the fact that Boehner and Cantor are deliberately taking drastically different stances heading into this vote.

Conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer even thinks Cantor may be going to make a move at Boehner. “It’s possible (Eric Cantor’s opposition to fiscal cliff bill) is the prelude to a challenge Thursday,” Krauthammer said on Fox News Channel’s Special Report on Tuesday evening.

“It would be naked to do it at this late hour as a result of the split over this vote. Look, there are a lot of conservatives in the Republican caucus in the House who hate the bill and for good reason. This is a complete surrender on everything. The ratio of tax hikes to spending cuts is 40 to 1, rather than 1 to 1 or 1 to 2 or 1 to 3. So, I mean it’s a complete rout by the Democrats.”"

This ridiculous exercise is not just unwise and unproductive but ungrammatical as well.

I hate the way the sequester diverts attention from issues that actually matter, such as unemployment, gun violence, climate change, failing schools and the need to spur economic growth. I hate the way it heightens our insularity at a time when we really ought to be paying attention to the rest of the world. Remember Syria? Dictator Bashar al-Assad is still slaughtering civilians left and right. Wasn’t he supposed to be gone by now?

I hate the sequester’s artificiality. With all the nation’s problems, our leaders created a new one for political reasons — and then, for those same political reasons, they didn’t even try to solve it.

I hate the sequester’s essential ambiguity, its Janus-faced dual nature. It is punishing, cruel and counterproductive, as the White House insists; and it is also no big deal, as Republicans contend.

President Obama is correct when he says that the sequester’s blunt-instrument cuts will cause needless hardship, even if the administration has been alarmist and flat-out wrong with some of its warnings.

The president’s claim that janitors at the Capitol would receive a pay cut and Education Secretary Arne Duncan’s report that some teachers have already gotten pink slips both were awarded four Pinocchios by The Post’s “Fact Checker” columnist, Glenn Kessler. This roughly translates as “not even remotely true.”

But the administration’s dire warnings of airport congestion and flight delays are plausible, Kessler found, and perhaps inevitable. And while there have been no immediate furloughs or layoffs — in schools, government agencies or firms dependent on government contracts — the math suggests there will be.

However, Republicans are correct when they say: Come on, get real, we’re talking about an across-the-board cut of $85 billion, just 2 percent of the budget. While they’re wrong to claim that a cut of this magnitude will be painless, they’re right to point out that the republic will not crumble into dust.

Medicare will see no more than a 2 percent cut, while Medicaid and Social Security will be untouched. Since these programs are so big and costly, other parts of the budget will have to face much deeper cuts to make up the total $85 billion savings. Defense spending is slated to be hit hardest, with an annualized budget reduction of nearly 10 percent.

Republicans would be right to note that the Pentagon will still eat up about half of all “discretionary” federal spending — and that the United States’ position as the world’s leading military power would remain unchallenged. But they don’t want to point this out because the GOP is supposed to be the strong-on-defense party that never met a gazillion-dollar weapons system it didn’t like.

Which brings me to another thing I hate about the sequester: the political incompetence and miscalculation that produced it. To quote baseball legend Casey Stengel: Can’t anybody here play this game?

Obama figured that Republicans would be so horrified at the prospect of deep defense cuts that they would make a deal on his terms, even after being forced to accept a humiliating defeat — and a modest tax increase for the wealthy — in the “fiscal cliff” negotiations two months ago.

Ann Telnaes animation: Congress takes a recess. (Ann Telnaes/The Washington Post)

The president apparently didn’t foresee that the Republican Party’s activist base would approach the sequester deadline full of outrage, not resignation. And neither he nor the GOP leadership seems to have fully grasped how opinion within the party has shifted on defense spending. On shrinking the Pentagon, many tea party Republicans are closer to the progressive wing of the Democratic Party than to their own party’s establishment.

To review: Entitlement spending is largely untouched, and defense spending isn’t the sacred cow it once was. Thus neither party has an incentive to make concessions, at least until the true impact of the cuts is felt. Which will take time.

What I really hate about the sequester is the way it confirms the conventional wisdom that “both sides are wrong.” This is usually the kind of lazy pseudoanalysis that drives me up the wall. But it took both Obama and the Republicans to get us into this mess — and nobody has a clue how to get us out of it.

Local universities report waiting lists for federal résumé workshops. And government job gurus are as busy as ever.

The 16-day government shutdown may have been demoralizing for the country’s more than 2 million federal workers, but it did little to deter the hundreds of thousands of people who scour government job listings daily and bombard agencies with résumés, all for the chance to join their ranks.

“Some say, ‘Why would I do this to myself?’ But they still want these jobs,” said Lisa Andrews, head of career services at University of Maryland University College. The school, which serves mostly working adults, offers a federal résumé writing webinar that consistently draws about 100 people at a time, more than any other, she said.

The popularity of federal jobs reflects the continued weakness of the job market, four years out from the end of the Great Recession, federal hiring experts said. As much as the public sector has been buffeted by turmoil in recent months, it is still seen as a haven from something even more uncertain: the private sector.

“The government is still aggressively hiring,” said Lily Whiteman, author of “How to Land a Top-Paying Federal Job.” “You look no matter what is going on because that’s where the jobs are.”

As of Wednesday, there were nearly 8,000 job postings and an average of 43 applicants for each job whose application deadline was that day, said Office of Personnel Management spokesman John Marble.

The federal government, which hired about 90,000 people last fiscal year, is in the midst of a retirement wave. And that, in turn, is triggering a hiring boom. In the last fiscal year, nearly twice as many executive branch employees retired than did in 2009, according to government figures. And the number of federal workers 60 or older has nearly doubled since 2000 to about 262,000. Low morale is a factor, and the partial shutdown did little to improve it.

For many aspiring federal employees, just the idea of retiring, vs. getting laid off, is enticing. Others have done prior stints at federal agencies and want back in. They tell similar stories of leaving for higher pay in the private sector, then coming back to the government for the security and the benefits.

Genise White, 49, of Fairfax County left her job at the Social Security Administration several years ago for a higher-paying private-sector job and wound up getting laid off. She’d rather work for Uncle Sam now.

“Even though you might not be making as much, it’s very hard to get fired. It’s very hard to get laid off, and you get a pretty good retirement package,” she said. “Who doesn’t want that?”

At a federal job seminar in Annandale on Wednesday, in the midst of the final congressional wrangling over a deal to reopen the government, a 60-year-old former civil servant was looking for work. The woman, who would give only her first name, Jeanette, said she worked for the federal government in the early 1990s, then left to work as a project manager for better-

paying government contractors. She has been laid off twice since, most recently in September.

“I’m seven years out from retirement,” she said. “And I want those medical benefits.”

The contrast between the stability of the public vs. private sector was in evidence at a Friday job fair for veterans, service members and their spouses at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center. As the war in Afghanistan winds down, fewer private employers are recruiting at the fair, said retired Vice Adm. Norbert R. Ryan Jr. of the Military Officers Association of America, which organized the event.

“It’s stark, the changes between 2007 and now,” he said, “because of the challenges of the economy.”

The shutdown kept some agencies away, too: No one was in the office earlier in the week to send over recruiting materials. But they were still hiring.

The lines of job seekers to talk to big-name contractors such as Lockheed Martin and Booz Allen Hamilton were 20 and 30 people deep. But so was the one for the National Security Agency, which receives more than 85,000 applications a year, said spokeswoman Vanee Vines.

Working for taxpayers holds its own allure, said Sharon Gibson, who recruits veterans for the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, which hired 721 out of 28,000 applicants last year. “It’s about service and giving back.”

“People who want to work for the federal government want to make a difference, and there is no better place,” agreed Elaine Kaplan, acting director of OPM.

Colondra Etheredge, 40, a military spouse, and Kim Williams, 39, an Air Force officer about to retire next month, said given their backgrounds, government work seemed like more of a natural fit than working at a for-profit enterprise. “It’s what I know,” Williams said.

The unflagging interest in federal jobs is even more remarkable given how arcane and difficult the process of landing one can be. Despite efforts to slash essay writing requirements, it remains daunting.

Corliss Jackson spent 18 years in federal government human resources, including at the Office of Personnel Management. After she left to spend more time raising her three children, friends began asking her for help getting federal jobs. She has been working as a job coach nonstop ever since.

During the shutdown, she had a full week of seminars for job seekers. She learned that lawmakers had finally cut a deal to reopen the government just as she was setting up for her second talk of the day at a Fairfax County employment office. The news barely registered with the two women who came to see her. Both had worked as government contractors, and both wanted to be full-fledged federal government workers or, as Jackson put it, “achieve permanency.”

For the past four years, Dawn McClure, 46, has gotten up each morning, gone to her computer and searched for a federal job. A military spouse who followed her husband, an Air Force colonel, to San Antonio from the District in June, McClure has a master’s in human resources and has applied for more than 100 jobs across a host of federal agencies. But she has had no luck getting an interview.

“I’m a professional job applicant,” she said.

The political forces that led to the shutdown worry Ed Jalinske, 34, a D.C. health-care policy analyst who had his own consulting business but now craves the stability of a government paycheck. He is looking for jobs at the Education Department, at the Department of Health and Human Services, and on the Hill.

Watching the government close up shop “definitely gives me some pause because they are setting a precedent for what could end up being the norm during this administration,” he said. “But I’m not going to let it deter me.”"

“I do believe we’re going to see a resolution this week,” said Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), one of the leaders of a bipartisan Senate group that has tried to negotiate a solution to the shutdown of government agencies and the need to lift the debt limit.

“We’re going to keep working and offer our ideas to the leadership,” she said on CNN’s “State of the Union”

A plan by Collins would have raised the federal debt limit through Jan. 31, funded federal agencies through March and made minor changes to President Obama’s healthcare law. Senate Democratic leaders have not accepted Collins’ proposal although Senate aides say some elements of it could figure in a final deal.

FULL COVERAGE: The U.S. government shutdown

Sen. Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the Senate’s No. 2 Democrat, said talks that began Saturday between Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada and the Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, constituted a “breakthrough.”

Durbin, appearing on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” said he thought the discussions have “the promise of finding a solution.”

As the senators’ comments made clear, the central issues in the talks have shifted in recent days.

Republicans have backed off their efforts to try to change the healthcare law, while Democrats, feeling they have the upper hand, have pushed a demand of their own: higher spending on domestic programs than allowed under the “sequester,” the across-the-board cuts that took effect earlier this year and are scheduled to deepen on Jan. 15.

Reid wants an agreement to fund federal agencies into January and a longer extension of the government’s ability to borrow money to pay its bills. He also is seeking to soften the next round of sequester cuts.

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), appearing on ABC’s “This Week” conceded that significant changes to the Affordable Care Act, as the healthcare law is formally known, were “off the table.”

But he warned against efforts to roll back the sequester. “If you break the spending cuts, you’re not going to get any Republicans in the Senate” to vote for the resulting deal, he said.

Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, an influential voice in the GOP’s right wing, also insisted that Republicans would not go along with any plan to end the sequester cuts.

“I can’t imagine you’re going to get Senate Republicans to vote for something that exceeds the sequester caps,” he said on CNN, saying that the size of the debt was the country’s No. 1 problem.

How to handle the sequester is “one of the sticking points” in the current negotiations, said Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.).

Schumer, who participated with Reid in Saturday’s negotiations, said on CBS’ “Face the Nation” that he was “cautiously hopeful, optimistic that we can come to an agreement.”

“Neither Democrats or Republicans like the sequester,” he said. “The dispute has been how to undo” it.

But Graham said he worried about a deal being reached in the Senate that could not pass muster with most House Republicans and that would further undermine House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio).

“Here’s what I’m worried about: a deal coming out of the Senate that a majority of Republicans can’t vote for in the House, that really does compromise Speaker Boehner’s leadership,” Graham said.

“And after all this mess is over, do we really want to compromise John Boehner as leader of the House? I don’t think so. So I’m not going to vote for any plan that I don’t think can get a majority of Republicans in the House, understanding that defunding Obamacare and delaying it for a year is not a realistic possibility now.”

Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) also speaking on “Face the Nation,” warned that Democrats should not overplay their hand.

“If they try to humiliate Republicans, things change in American politics,” he said. If Democrats do so, “it won’t be forgotten,” he said.

“Now’s the time to be magnanimous and sit down and get this thing done.”

President Obama%2C congressional leaders fail to reach sequester deal

The sequester%2C %2485 billion in automatic budget cuts%2C begins late Friday

Obama%2C Republicans argue over taxes in new debt cut deal

WASHINGTON -- Leaping into the fiscal unknown, President Obama and congressional Republicans did not strike a deal Friday to avert $85 billion in automatic, across-the-board budget cuts set to begin at midnight.

""These cuts will hurt our economy; they will cost us jobs,"" Obama told reporters after meeting 52 minutes with congressional leaders on the impact of the massive cuts known as the sequester.

The White House, working with its Office of Management and Budget, began the process Friday night of formally notifying Congress and others of specific items to be cut over the next seven months. Letters are also going to out to governors, grantees and others who receive federal money.



At a brief news conference after the morning meeting, Obama attributed the ""dumb, arbitrary cuts"" to a Republican refusal to agree to a new debt reduction plan that includes higher taxes on wealthy Americans through the closing of loopholes and deductions.

""They're saying that it's more important to preserve these tax loopholes than it is to prevent these arbitrary cuts,"" Obama said of the GOP.

House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said after the meeting that Obama got tax hikes in the January agreement to end the last budget impasse, the so-called fiscal cliff.

""The discussion about revenue in my view is over,"" Boehner said. ""It's about cutting the spending in Washington.""

The parties did appear to make progress on avoiding another potential budget standoff down the road -- the March 27 expiration of the continuing resolution that is funding the government; failing to renew it would lead to a budget shutdown.

In a post-meeting statement, Boehner said Congress is planning to extend the continuing resolution ""to prevent a government shutdown while we continue to work on a solution to replace the president's sequester.""

The president also sounded upbeat about avoiding a shutdown, saying he would sign an extension provided Congress sticks to budget targets it has used in the past.

As for the sequester, Obama said debt reduction should include both spending cuts and higher taxes in the wealthy, calling it a ""balanced plan"" that can end the cuts that will slow the economy, cost people jobs and possibly undermine national defense.

While the sequester will hurt the economy, Obama predicted that the American people will come through it and sustain economic recovery, even though ""Washington sure isn't making it easy."" The president also urged affected Americans to pressure Republicans into reaching an agreement to end a sequester, asking them to appeal to ""a caucus of common sense"" in Congress.

""This is not going to be an apocalypse, I think, as some people have said,"" Obama said at one point. "" It's just dumb. And it's going to hurt.""

Some Republicans said Obama and the White House are exaggerating the impact of the cuts for political effect. Sen.Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., said, ""D oes any lawmaker, reporter or citizen believe that the only way to save taxpayer dollars is to hurt children, that every government program is effective and helpful and not one penny is wasted?""

The Senate's top Republican, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, described the White House meeting Friday morning as ""an opportunity to restate our commitment to the American people that we would significantly reduce Washington spending.""

While pledging to try and avoid a government shutdown at the end of March, McConnell said Republicans would work on ""solutions for making spending reductions more intelligently than the president's across-the-board cuts.""

He added: ""I will not be part of any back-room deal and I will absolutely not agree to increase taxes.""

Both McConnell and Boehner attended the Oval Office meeting with Obama and Vice President Biden. So did the top congressional Democrats, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.

The talks reflected little if any progress on the issue that has divided them in this and previous budget disputes -- the best way to cut a federal debt that now tops $16.5 trillion.

Obama has long called for debt reduction that includes both budget cuts and increased tax revenue by eliminating loopholes and deductions that benefit the wealthy.

Boehner said Obama and Senate Democrats ""are demanding more tax hikes to fuel more stimulus spending.""

The White House meeting took place a day after Senate Republicans and Democrats blocked each other's competing sequester plans.

The sequester originated as part of a 2011 agreement to break yet another Obama-Republican budget impasse, raising the debt ceiling.

The idea: Require a series of automatic cuts, split between defense and domestic programs, so onerous that the parties would be forced to come up with a plan to cut more than $1 trillion off the debt in 10 years. They failed to do that.

How the sequester might play out after Friday, both economically and politically, remains uncertain.

Obama said many Americans may not feel the effects for months, but others face problems ranging from job furloughs to a loss of Head Start services for their children.

Predicting ""a slow grind that will intensify with each passing day,"" Obama said the effects will be felt throughout the government, including the Pentagon, Border Patrol, FBI and social service agencies.

""I don't anticipate a huge financial crisis,"" Obama said, ""but people are going to be hurt.""

So will Washington's reputation, he added.

""You know, this is not a win for anybody,"" Obama said. ""This is a loss for the American people."""

Congress allows tax breaks to lapse almost every year and eventually retroactively renews them

Trade groups and tax experts say this makes it hard for businesses and individuals to plan for the future

While some of these tax breaks are big ones%2C others are more obscure

WASHINGTON (AP) — In an almost annual ritual, Congress is letting a package of 55 popular tax breaks expire at the end of the year, creating uncertainty — once again — for millions of individuals and businesses.

Lawmakers let these tax breaks lapse almost every year, even though they save businesses and individuals billions of dollars. And almost every year, Congress eventually renews them, retroactively, so taxpayers can claim them by the time they file their tax returns.

No harm, no foul, right? After all, taxpayers filing returns in the spring won't be hurt because the tax breaks were in effect for 2013. Taxpayers won't be hit until 2015, when they file tax returns for next year.

Not so far. Trade groups and tax experts complain that Congress is making it impossible for businesses and individuals to plan for the future. What if lawmakers don't renew the tax break you depend on? Or what if they change it and you're no longer eligible?

""It's a totally ridiculous way to run our tax system,"" said Rachelle Bernstein, vice president and tax counsel for the National Retail Federation. ""It's impossible to plan when every year this happens, but yet business has gotten used to that.""

Some of the tax breaks are big, including billions in credits for companies that invest in research and development, generous exemptions for financial institutions doing business overseas, and several breaks that let businesses write off capital investments faster.

Others are more obscure, the benefits targeted to film producers, race track owners, makers of electric motorcycles and teachers who buy classroom supplies with their own money.

There are tax rebates to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands from a tax on rum imported into the United States, and a credit for expenses related to railroad track maintenance.

A deduction for state and local sales taxes benefits people who live in the nine states without state income taxes. Smaller tax breaks benefit college students and commuters who use public transportation.

A series of tax breaks promote renewable energy, including a credit for power companies that produce electricity with windmills.

The annual practice of letting these tax breaks expire is a symptom a divided, dysfunctional Congress that struggles to pass routine legislation, said Rep. John Lewis of Georgia, a senior Democrat on the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee.

""It's not fair, it's very hard, it's very difficult for a business person, a company, to plan, not just for the short term but to do long-term planning,"" Lewis said. ""It's shameful.""

With Congress on vacation until January, there is no chance the tax breaks will be renewed before they expire. And there is plenty of precedent for Congress to let them expire for months without addressing them. Most recently, they expired at the end of 2011, and Congress didn't renew them for the entire year, waiting until New Year's Day 2013 — just in time for taxpayers to claim them on their 2012 returns.

But Congress only renewed the package though the end of 2013.

Why such a short extension? Washington accounting is partly to blame. The two-year extension Congress passed in January cost $76 billion in reduced revenue for the government, according to the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation. Making those tax breaks permanent could add $400 billion or more to the deficit over the next decade.

With budget deficits already high, many in Congress are reluctant to vote for a bill that would add so much red ink. So, they do it slowly, one or two years at time.

""More cynically, some people say, if you just put it in for a year or two, then that keeps the lobbyists having to come back and wine-and-dine the congressmen to get it extended again, and maybe make some campaign contributions,"" said Mark Luscombe, principal tax analyst for CCH, a consulting firm based in Riverwoods, Ill.

This year, the package of tax breaks has been caught up in a debate about overhauling the entire tax code. The two top tax writers in Congress — House Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp, R-Mich., and Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus, D-Mont. — have been pushing to simplify the tax code by reducing tax breaks and using the additional revenue to lower overall tax rates.

But their efforts have yet to bear fruit, leaving both tax reform and the package of temporary breaks in limbo. When asked how businesses should prepare, given the uncertainty, Camp said, ""They need to get on board with tax reform, that's what they need to do.""

Further complicating the issue, President Barack Obama has nominated Baucus to become U.S. ambassador to China, meaning he will soon leave the Senate, if he is confirmed by his colleagues.

As the Senate wound down its 2013 session, Democratic leaders made a late push to extend many of the tax breaks by asking Republican colleagues to pass a package on the floor of the Senate without debate or amendments. Republicans objected, saying it wasn't a serious offer, and the effort failed.

So should taxpayers count on these breaks as they plan their budgets for 2014?

""The best thing I would say is, budget accordingly,"" said Jackie Perlman, principle tax research analyst at The Tax Institute at H&R Block. ""As the saying goes, hope for the best but plan for the worst. Then if you get it, great, that's a nice perk. But don't count on it."""

It%27s not so clear that unequal incomes are the biggest problem America faces.

More serious is the divide between people with jobs and those who live off of government benefits.

This problem of %22work inequality%22 isn%27t addressed by Obama%2C and%2C in fact%2C is exacerbated by his programs.

Last week, President Obama gave a much-touted speech on ""income inequality."" But while inequality is a valid concern, it's not so clear that unequal incomes are the biggest problem America faces.

More troubling -- as figures as distinct as Slate's Matthew Yglesias and National Review's Mark Steyn both noted -- is the growing divide between an America where people have jobs, and an America where people live off of government benefits.

As Yglesias observed:

The Washington, D.C., metropolitan area has become an island of prosperity in an ailing country. But D.C. itself has an 8.9% unemployment rate even as it sits at the center of a metro-area unemployment rate of just 5.4%. For people who haven't gone to college — the kind of people who live in the neighborhood where Obama was speaking — the unemployment rate is 20%. That's a disaster. And while Obama talked about plenty of things that could help those unemployed families — subsidized health care, better schools for their kids — he didn't really talk about anything that would get them jobs. The biggest applause line of the speech was about raising the minimum wage, which is great, but also doesn't help you very much if your current wage is $0.

And Steyn weighs in on a similar note:

'Work' and 'purpose' are intimately connected: Researchers at the University of Michigan, for example, found that welfare payments make one unhappier than a modest income honestly earned and used to provide for one's family. 'It drains too much of the life from life,' said Charles Murray in a speech in 2009. 'And that statement applies as much to the lives of janitors — even more to the lives of janitors — as it does to the lives of CEOs.' Self-reliance — 'work' — is intimately connected to human dignity — 'purpose.' So what does every initiative of the Obama era have in common? Obamacare, Obamaphones, Social Security disability expansion, 50 million people on food stamps. ... The assumption is that mass, multigenerational dependency is now a permanent feature of life. A coastal elite will devise ever smarter and slicker trinkets, and pretty much everyone else will be a member of either the dependency class or the vast bureaucracy that ministers to them.

Even if incomes are equal, in other words, they're not really equal if one is earned, and the other is merely bestowed. (This is often true even when the incomes in question are large ones, as trust-fund types are notoriously prone to being aimless and dissolute.)

This problem of ""work inequality"" isn't addressed by President Obama, and, in fact, is exacerbated by his programs. Increased dependency on the government may have its political advantages -- as The Rainmakers sang in their 1980s hit, Government Cheese, ""They'll turn us all into beggars 'cause they're easier to please"" -- but it's incompatible with the notion of social equality that underlies American democracy. Beggars, even if they're doing pretty well, are dependents, and a dependent class can never really be equal members of the polity.

In science fiction writer Jerry Pournelle's future history from the 1970s, 21st century America became divided into two classes: ""Citizens,"" dependent on government, mostly residing in ""welfare islands"" where drugs and sex provided a substitute for purpose, and ""Taxpayers,"" who actually had jobs and enjoyed certain additional legal privileges. That future seemed farfetched, then. It seems less so now, as President Obama talks about ""Promise Zones"" for the poor.

So why is President Obama less interested in the shortage of jobs and more focused on mere ""income inequality?"" I think there are two reasons. First, while expanding the dependency class might be bad for America (and for the dependents), it's good for the political party that passes out the pork. And second -- and this is more troubling -- I think that Obama has no idea how to address the underlying jobs problem. Let's hope our next president has some better ideas.

Elizabeth Warren, the newest member of the Senate Banking Committee, waited patiently for her first chance to question top financial regulators at a recent hearing on Capitol Hill.

When her turn finally came after 90 minutes, Warren quickly showed she wouldn’t be following the custom that a freshman senator be seen and not heard.

After some pleasantries, the longtime consumer advocate and Wall Street critic lit into the heads of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and officials from four other agencies for their practice of allowing big banks to settle government allegations of wrongdoing out of court.

“I’m really concerned that too-big-to-fail has become too big for trial,” said Warren, 63, who chastised regulators for treating financial executives better than average Americans.

Her questions in February, and at subsequent hearings, have helped quickly establish the Massachusetts Democrat as a key player on issues affecting the financial industry despite her rock-bottom seniority: 97th out of 100 senators. She has drawn kudos from colleagues — even some Republicans — for her deep knowledge of the issues and her ability to fire succinct questions at witnesses.

The attention Warren is drawing — video clips of her first Banking Committee hearing went viral on YouTube — could catapult her even further. Some liberals have begun touting her as a potential 2016 presidential candidate.

“She has maximized the influence and attention that a freshman senator can get,” said Jaret Seiberg, a senior policy analyst with financial services firm Guggenheim Partners. “Now, when we look at issues of too-big-to-fail and of consumer protection, people want to know what Elizabeth Warren has to say.”

The fast start by Warren, one of the few politicians to embrace the Occupy Wall Street movement, has confirmed the fears of some in the financial industry that she wouldn’t hesitate to criticize them from her new, higher-profile position.

Warren’s sharp rhetoric is “certainly harmful to our industry,” said Ballard Cassady, president of the Kentucky Bankers Assn.

Her comments make it sound as if all bankers were responsible for the financial crisis, he said, adding that tougher regulation makes it more difficult for small bankers to serve their communities.

Advertisement

Given the industry’s experience with Warren, her push for tighter regulation has not been surprising, said James Ballentine, top lobbyist for the trade group American Bankers Assn. But her blunt and forceful questioning has opened some eyes, he said.

“Perhaps folks aren’t used to her style and have been a little shocked by that,” Ballentine said.

Warren’s tough interrogation of regulators has delighted liberals, who helped her defeat Republican incumbent Scott Brown last fall in the nation’s most expensive Senate race.

“She has hit the ground running and already made a name for herself as someone who will ask not only the hard questions but the really pertinent questions,” Liz Coyle, deputy director of Georgia Watch, a consumer advocacy group, said after attending a Warren speech at a Washington conference in March.

Advertisement

At subsequent Senate hearings, Warren stayed on the offensive with her plain-spoken, direct questions.

She grilled other regulators and Obama administration officials, even going head to head with Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke over whether large banks are able to borrow money at a reduced rate because the markets still believe the government would not let them fail.

Advertisement

“Ordinary folks pay for homeowners’ insurance. Ordinary folks pay for car insurance,” she lectured Bernanke. “And these big financial institutions are getting cheaper borrowing … simply because people believe that the government would step in and bail them out.”

Some critics in the financial industry have been quick to disparage privately what they consider to be grandstanding comments, but they haven’t been so eager to voice their views publicly about a sitting senator with influence on their issues.

Advertisement

Outside the industry, conservative activists have criticized Warren for her strong liberal views about Wall Street and other topics, such as her support of tougher gun controls and opposition to Social Security benefit cuts.

Warren, though, isn’t letting that deter her from developing a more well-rounded resume.

For instance, she joined in signing a letter with some Republicans that urged regulators to act more quickly in writing new rules aimed at preventing future bailouts, and she co-sponsored a bipartisan bill on reforming taxpayer-owned housing finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

“You can tell Sen. Warren spends a lot of time preparing for meetings and hearings, which is something I appreciate,” said Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), a banking committee colleague.

Advertisement

Warren’s positions and her eagerness to speak out about them are no surprise to people in the financial industry. They’ve been tangling with her since she headed the congressional oversight panel for the $700-billion bailout fund and then helped launch the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

“I don’t see Elizabeth Warren not raising an issue that she believes needs to be raised,” said Richard Hunt, president of the Consumer Bankers Assn. “I think she’ll be in the center of all banking legislation.”

Advertisement

There were expectations she might ease her way into the spotlight, following the playbook of Hillary Rodham Clinton, another big-name politician who reached the Senate in her first run for public office.

Like Warren — an Oklahoma native who began teaching at Harvard Law School in 1995 — Chicago-native Clinton was branded a carpetbagger when she ran for a Senate seat from New York in 2000. So Clinton focused narrowly on state issues and developing relationships with colleagues during her first months in office.

Advertisement

Warren also has stayed centered on state issues, such as the fishing industry and the Boston Marathon bombing. She has declined most interview requests from the national media, including one from The Times.

Warren and her staff “are very smart to spend most of their time and attention focusing on Massachusetts while picking and choosing their spots on issues on the national level,” said Jim Manley, a former top Senate Democratic aide.

Advertisement

So far, those spots have largely been on financial regulation.

“It’s hard enough to get legislation enacted if you’re a senior member, but as a freshman senator it’s almost impossible,” Seiberg said. “So the way you make your mark is by helping set the agenda. And she’s done that.”

USA TODAY

WASHINGTON — It's Day 3 of the federal government shutdown, with no end in sight. President Obama says he's ""exasperated,"" which probably sums up the feelings of lawmakers in Congress and the rest of the nation. What you need to know for Thursday, Oct. 3:

Obama meets with lawmakers, but shutdown continues

Congress and the White House aren't any closer to ending the budget impasse that sparked the shutdown, but President Obama and top Senate and House leaders met for the first time Wednesday to discuss the situation. The issues are still the same: Obama and Democrats won't accept any stopgap spending bill to fund the government that has restrictions. Republicans aren't budging from trying to affect the health care law signed by Obama. Every day of the shutdown also brings the nation closer to reaching another fiscal crisis on Oct. 17, when the government will reach the debt ceiling.

Children caught in the middle of budget fight

Children are the collateral damage in the shutdown, and its duration could have a devastating impact on some. Pre-kindergarten classes under the Head Start program have been forced to close. Patients with incurable diseases have been turned away from the National Institute of Health's Clinical Center. About 8.8 million women and children are at risk of not getting vouchers through the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, known as WIC.

Freebies to furloughed workers ease the pain

With 800,000 federal employees furloughed from their jobs, companies inside and outside of Washington are trying to lure customers and media attention by offering everything from free cups of coffee to freebie sandwiches and free oil changes. One example: Federal workers who own a Hyundai can stop making car payments for as long as the shutdown keeps them off the job. All the bad political karma is getting reshaped into positive PR by dozens of companies desperately trying to make public relations lemonade out of the government shutdown lemon.

Shutdown clogs pipeline of government data for business

The river of data that federal agencies release daily on everything from job growth to divorce rates is drying up in the shutdown. At the top of the list is the closely watched Labor Department report on U.S. employment in September. Reports on factory orders, retail sales and wholesale prices will likely be postponed if the shutdown goes into next week. Economists and industry officials say the data vacuum will likely affect stock markets and even business hiring and investment if the government is closed for more than a week or two.

Pentagon OKs service academy football games

The Defense Department gave the go-ahead late Wednesday for the military service academies to play their scheduled football games this weekend, including the sold-out Navy vs. Air Force matchup in Annapolis, Md. The games were in jeopardy because the Pentagon suspended all intercollegiate athletics at the shutdown's start. Army is scheduled to play Boston College, but neither athletic department had officially announced the game was happening.

House Republicans are advancing a novel plan to suspend enforcement of the federal debt limit through May 18, a move that would lift the threat of a government default and relieve the air of crisis that has surrounded their budget battle with President Obama.

The measure — set for a vote Wednesday in the House — would not resolve the dispute over how to control the national debt. But after the traumatic “fiscal cliff” episode at the end of last year, it would buy policymakers a little breathing room to continue the argument without another economy-rattling deadline just around the corner.

The White House tacitly endorsed the proposal Tuesday, issuing a statement that said Obama “would not oppose” the temporary respite. The president has called for a long-term extension of the Treasury Department’s borrowing authority, which he argues would “increase certainty and economic stability.”

But, White House press secretary Jay Carney said, “clearly, we support extension of the debt ceiling without drama or delay.”

Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) also welcomed the proposal. “I’m glad,” he told reporters, “we’re not facing crisis here in the matter of a few days.”

President Obama said on Jan. 14 in a White House press conference that he won’t negotiate with Republicans on the federal debt ceiling. Post economic policy reporter Zachary Goldfarb explains which bills the government will and will not pay if the debt ceiling isn’t raised. (The Fold/The Washington Post)

Under the proposal, the legal limit on government borrowing — now set at $16.4 trillion — would remain intact, but its enforcement would be suspended until May 18. In the meantime, the Treasury could continue borrowing to cover the cost of Social Security checks, the military payroll, interest payments to the nation’s creditors, and other obligations.

The approach — unprecedented since World War II — would let Republicans avoid a debt-ceiling fight, which could be politically and economically damaging, without endorsing a higher limit.

On May 19, the debt limit would automatically be reset at a higher level that reflected the additional borrowing. Treasury officials could then begin taking what they call “extraordinary measures” to continue paying the nation’s bills, probably pushing the new default deadline into late July or early August, independent analysts said.

Without congressional action, the Treasury predicts that it would run out of money to pay the nation’s bills by early March. That would lead to the U.S. government’s first default, which, economists say, would invite a new recession, damage American credibility abroad and potentially destabilize world financial markets.

If Congress approves the GOP measure, lawmakers would still face other painful deadlines, including the imposition of sharp automatic cuts in government spending on March 1 and a potential government shutdown on March 27.

Missing either of those deadlines would hurt U.S. economic growth, but neither would have the calamitous effects of a government default, said Joel Prakken, chairman of the independent forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers.

“The world’s a little safer with that debt ceiling pushed off for six months or so,” he said.

The government came perilously close to default in the summer of 2011, when Republicans gained control of the House and used the debt limit to force Obama to approve more than $2 trillion in spending cuts over the next decade. Burned by the president’s successful campaign to raise taxes on the wealthy during the recent fiscal-cliff negotiations, some Republicans were threatening to once again use the debt limit to extract new concessions on spending.

But last week, under pressure from business leaders and some prominent Republicans, House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) announced that he was developing a plan to postpone a new debt-limit clash. In exchange, he demanded that Senate Democrats revive the traditional budget process, which they have neglected for nearly four years.

The GOP proposal calls for the Democratic-controlled Senate to adopt a budget by April 15 or have senators’ paychecks held in escrow until this session of Congress ends in early 2015.

Late Tuesday, House leaders sought to build support for the measure in a closed-door meeting with their rank and file, repeatedly offering the rallying cry, “No budget, no pay.”

Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.), the conference chairman, played a series of television news clips about GOP pressure on the Senate, telling the often fractious caucus that the new strategy already shifted attention to the Senate’s inability to perform one of its most fundamental duties.

Boehner told reporters after the meeting: “We’ve done our budgets, but it’s been nearly four years since the Senate has done a budget. Most Americans believe you don’t do your job, you shouldn’t get paid.”

Meanwhile, he assured wary conservative Republicans that he would hold firm against any attempt to undo the automatic spending cuts without “cuts and reforms to replace it,” according to a source in the room.

And he vowed that House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (Wis.), the party’s 2012 vice presidential nominee, would draft a new budget blueprint that would wipe out deficits “within a decade.” The austere budgets Ryan offered in years past took nearly 30 years to balance.

“It’s time for us to come to a plan that will in fact balance the budget over the next 10 years,” Boehner told reporters afterward. “It’s our commitment to the American people.”

After the meeting, lawmakers offered broad enthusiasm for the new strategy. A smattering expressed opposition, suggesting that the measure’s passage may not be assured.

But even Rep. Raul R. Labrador (R-Idaho), a hard-line conservative who often bucks House leaders, said the promise of a balanced budget allayed his concerns about agreeing to extend the debt limit for a few months.

Now, Republican leaders “actually have an agenda,” Labrador said. “The agenda is to get to balance in 10 years, to have a balanced budget.”

Balancing the budget over the next decade, however, is likely to require extraordinarily deep cuts in spending that go even further than reductions in previous House budgets. In the past, Ryan has targeted spending on health care for the poor and other social safety net programs, such as food stamps and aid for college tuition.

On Monday, Obama vowed in his Inauguration Day speech to defend those programs.

Instead, senior Democrats say they want to revive the budget process to clear a path for raising additional tax revenue from corporations and the wealthy. Although Congress agreed earlier this month to raise tax rates on income over $450,000 a year, that measure will generate only about $600 billion over the next decade, just over a third of Obama’s $1.6 trillion target for new tax revenue.

Even as they moved toward an agreement to temporarily resolve the problem of the debt limit, lawmakers have offered no new ideas for bridging the vast ideological chasm on taxes and spending.

By Doug Palmer

WASHINGTON, June 19 (Reuters) - The Senate on Wednesday voted overwhelmingly to approve White House international economic affairs adviser Michael Froman to be the next U.S. trade representative, sending him into the fray of huge trade negotiations in Asia and Europe.

Froman, a longtime friend of President Barack Obama, already has played a major role in shaping U.S. trade policy in the past four years from his post in the White House.

Now he is moving from that behind-the-scenes work to a prominent role in Obama's Cabinet, where other big jobs will include managing difficult trade relationships with China and India and breathing life into moribund world trade talks.

""Mike is smart. He knows the issues. Very importantly, he has the trust of the president,"" former U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick, a Republican, said on Wednesday in a speech at the Wilson Center, a foreign policy think tank.

Froman was approved in a 93-4 vote. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, was among the few senators to vote against him, citing what she called a lack of transparency in U.S. trade negotiations, a complaint many civil society groups have made in the past.

""Many people are deeply interested in tracking the trajectory of trade negotiations, but if they do not have reasonable access to see the terms of the agreements under negotiation, then they can't have real input,"" Warren said.

Froman got strong words of support from Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat, and Senator Orrin Hatch, the panel's top Republican.

""I have every confidence this man is going to be an excellent leader ... He is highly qualified,"" Hatch said.

The Senate action came just days after Obama and leaders of the European Union opened talks on what would be the world's biggest free-trade agreement, the proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership pact.

Froman now will be able to preside over the first round of those negotiations, set for the week of July 8 in Washington.

The United States also is negotiating a free-trade agreement with Japan and 10 other countries in the Asia-Pacific region known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership pact that it hopes to finish by the end of this year.

Froman's legacy will rest on whether he can bring those two big negotiations to agreements and win their approval in Congress.

To secure the Asia-Pacific pact and win new export opportunities for U.S. business and farmers, Froman may have to make politically difficult decisions that would open the U.S. market to more auto, dairy, sugar and textile imports.

The United States and the EU want to finish their trade talks by the end of 2014, requiring compromise on tough issues like Europe's restrictions on imports of genetically modified crops and other food safety barriers that Washington says are not based on scientific evidence.

Froman also faces an early test in Congress to win approval of trade promotion authority, a piece of legislation that many of Obama's fellow Democrats have opposed in the past.

That legislation, which expired in 2007, allows the White House to submit trade deals to Congress for straight up-or-down votes without any amendments.

Approval of the bill would signal strong congressional backing for the Asia-Pacific and the EU agreements, helping to bring them to a close.

Concern in Congress about the massive U.S. trade deficit with China, which hit a record $315 billion in 2012, also puts pressure on Froman to make progress on that front.

In addition, many lawmakers are increasingly frustrated with Indian policies that block U.S. imports and invalidate patent protections for valuable U.S. pharmaceuticals.

In December, Froman will head to Bali for the ninth ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organization amid gloom over that body's continuing viability as a negotiating forum.

With the 12-year-old Doha round of world trade talks at an impasse, WTO members are striving to reach agreement on a small package of trade deals to show they can produce results. (Editing by Doina Chiacu and Bill Trott)"

In A Three-Decade Career At The Washington Post', 'Robinson Has Been City Hall Reporter', 'City Editor', 'Foreign Correspondent In Buenos Aires', 'London']",Eugene Robinson: Paul Ryan’s make-believe budget,"If Rep. Paul Ryan wants people to take his budget manifestos seriously, he should be honest about his ambition: not so much to make the federal government fiscally sustainable as to make it smaller.

You will recall that the Ryan Budget was a big Republican selling point in last year’s election. Most famously, Ryan proposed turning Medicare into a voucher program. He offered the usual GOP recipe of tax cuts — to be offset by closing certain loopholes, which he would not specify — along with drastic reductions in non-defense “discretionary” spending.

If the plan Ryan offered had been enacted, the federal budget would not come into balance until 2040. For some reason, Republicans forgot to mention this detail in their stump speeches and campaign ads.

Voters were supposed to believe that Ryan was an apostle of fiscal rectitude. But his real aim wasn’t to balance the budget. It was to starve the federal government of revenue. Big government, in his worldview, is inherently bad — never mind that we live in an awfully big country.

Ryan and Mitt Romney offered their vision, President Obama offered his, and Americans made their choice. Rather emphatically.

Now Ryan, as chairman of the House Budget Committee, is coming back with an ostensibly new and improved version of the framework that voters rejected in November. Judging by the preview he offered Sunday, the new plan is even less grounded in reality than was the old one.

Voters might not have focused on the fact that Ryan’s original plan wouldn’t have produced a balanced budget until today’s high school students reached middle age, but the true deficit hawks in the House Republican caucus certainly noticed. They demanded a budget that reached balance much sooner. Hence Ryan’s revised plan, which claims to accomplish this feat of equilibrium within a decade.

It will, in fact, do nothing of the sort, because it appears to depend on at least one ridiculous assumption and two glaring contradictions. That’s for starters; I’m confident we’ll see more absurdities when the full proposal is released soon.

Appearing on “Fox News Sunday,” Ryan said his plan assumes that the far-reaching reforms known as Obamacare will be repealed. Host Chris Wallace reacted with open disbelief: “That’s not going to happen.”

Indeed, to take Ryan seriously is to believe that legislation repealing the landmark Affordable Care Act would be approved by the Senate, with its Democratic majority, and signed by Obama. What are the odds? That’s a clown question, bro.

As he did in the campaign, Ryan attacked Obama’s health reforms for cutting about $700 billion from Medicare over a decade, not by slashing benefits but by reducing payments to providers. Ryan neglected to mention that his own budget — the one he convinced the party to run on in 2012 — would cut Medicare by the same amount. Actually, by a little more.

This was hypocrisy raised to high art. How could anyone who claimed to be so very worried about the crushing federal debt blithely renounce $700 billion in savings? Ryan suggested Sunday that once Obamacare is repealed, this money can be plowed back into Medicare. Which, as you recall, will never happen.

While Ryan’s new budget assumes that Obamacare goes away, it also assumes that the tax increase on high earners approved in the “fiscal cliff” deal remains in place. “That’s current law,” he said, as if Obamacare were not.

Ryan’s sudden respect for a tax increase that had to be — metaphorically — crammed down Republicans’ throats is easily explained. He needs the $600 billion in revenue it produces to make his new fantasyland budget appear to reach balance.

Ryan is likely to reprise — and even augment — the hundreds of billions of dollars in cuts he proposed last year for social programs. He indicated that he still believes Medicare should be voucherized, although he objects to the word and insists that what he advocates is “premium support.” And he asserted that Obamacare’s expansion of Medicaid, the health-care program for the poor, is “reckless” — even as tea party-approved Republican governors such as Rick Scott of Florida announce their states’ participation.

From the evidence, Ryan cares less about deficits or tax rates than about finding some way to dramatically reduce the size of the federal government. He has every right to hold that view. But it’s hard to take him seriously as long as he refuses to come clean about his intentions.

Obama's 2014 budget proposal calls for a strategic review of the TVA, the nation's largest public utility with 9 million customers in seven states from Virginia to Mississippi.

Selling the U.S-owned power company could reduce the federal deficit by at least $25 billion and ""help put the nation on a sustainable fiscal path,"" Obama says in a budget document.

Not so fast, say GOP lawmakers in the region.

""It's one more bad idea in a budget full of bad ideas,"" said Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., a longtime TVA champion.

""There is no assurance that selling TVA to a profit-making entity would reduce electric bills in the Tennessee Valley, and it could lead to higher electricity rates"" for customers in Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia, Alexander said.

Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., vowed to ""carefully study any proposals to restructure TVA"" to ensure it continues to deliver affordable electricity throughout the region.

Privatizing TVA has been proposed before ""and been determined to be a very bad idea,"" added Rep. John Duncan, R-Tenn.

Administration officials emphasized that privatization was just one option being considered. Sale of the agency has been discussed by prior administrations, but nothing has happened.

Indeed, proposals to sell TVA date back to soon after the agency was created in 1933 to reduce the risk of flooding in the region and bring electricity to rural communities in poor areas of Appalachia. It was a key part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal program, which used government spending to help the nation recover from the Great Depression.

President Dwight Eisenhower called TVA ""creeping socialism,"" while President Ronald Reagan criticized it as an example of big government. Republicans from Barry Goldwater to Newt Gingrich have pointed to the TVA as an example of where the private sector could provide services more cheaply and effectively than bureaucrats.

Republican antipathy for the TVA led many in the Southeast to assume that any proposal to sell TVA would come from the GOP -- not a Democratic president fresh off winning a second term.

The privatization proposal ""is making our heads spin here in Tennessee,"" said Stephen Smith, executive director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, a nonprofit group that promotes alternative energy throughout the region.

""For the first time that I'm aware of, you've got a Democratic administration proposing the sale of TVA and simultaneously you've got significant, conservative federal representatives in the House and Senate defending their local socialist project,"" Smith said. ""There's a lot irony in it and little bit of humor actually.""

A White House spokesman referred questions to the budget office. A spokeswoman said the plan was part of an effort to modernize and reform the federal government, and to address the financing of energy infrastructure.

""TVA has significant capital financing constraints which are difficult to address in the current fiscal environment,"" she said.

Rep. Jim Cooper, D-Tenn., called sale of the TVA an ""extremely remote possibility"" and said the authority's large debts make it unattractive to potential buyers. The TVA also provides a range of services besides power generation, including flood control and recreation, that would shift to other agencies or be dropped if the TVA is sold.

TVA, which owns 29 hydropower plants, 11 coal plants and three nuclear plants, has been plagued by cost overruns in recent years, particularly for its nuclear fleet. The agency plans $25 billion in capital expenditures over the next 10 years, much of it to expand its nuclear capacity and modernize older, coal-fired plants, but faces a statutory debt cap of $30 billion.

John Thomas, the TVA's chief financial officer, said the agency receives no money from the federal government and its bonds are not a federal obligation. Even so, TVA debts are considered part of the federal deficit.

One possible solution is federal legislation to change how the TVA's debt is calculated for federal purposes, Thomas and others said.

The authority will cooperate with the strategic review, but will operate as usual in the meantime, Thomas said."
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/14/sequestration-fixes_n_3276197.html,2013-05-14 00:00:00,['Senior Politics Editor'],"Sequestration Fixes Counterproductive, Congressional Democrats Say","WASHINGTON -- Piecemeal efforts to ease the impact of federal sequestration budget cuts are counterproductive and may end up costing taxpayers more, according to a report from congressional Democrats.

The report, put together by Democrats on the House Appropriations Committee and their ranking member, Rep. Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.), is the third installment in a series outlining the impact of sequester-related cuts. The report, provided to The Huffington Post in advance of its Wednesday release, is blunt, arguing that Congress has made the impact of sequestration worse by adjusting individual parts, rather than pursuing a larger fix.

""A few departments and agencies have found ways to mitigate some very specific impacts of sequestration,"" the authors wrote. ""However, these strategies merely replace one set of cuts with cuts to other parts of the same agency. All will have an impact, and nearly all will have to be made up with future appropriations.""

""Piecemeal efforts to manage sequestration are counterproductive,"" the report concluded. ""They often require underfunding long-term needs to mitigate short-term pain. In many instances, the annual savings mask increased longer-term costs.""

To illustrate this point, the Democrats on the House Appropriations Committee looked at the efforts made by Congress to end the furloughing of air traffic controllers shortly after complaints surfaced over flight delays. While the Federal Aviation Administration was granted flexibility to end those furloughs, it came ""at the expense of another priority,"" the report said. In this case, the FAA can no longer fund construction projects with discretionary funds. Officials estimated the costs of congestion and delays at airports will exceed $34 billion by 2020.

Food safety inspectors were also spared the hit of sequestration. But here too, congressional Democrats pointed out that the cost was only moved elsewhere, with funding taking the hit for U.S. Department of Agriculture building maintenance and for a program to upgrade school kitchen equipment.

""Again, sequestration forced a difficult sacrifice of long-term necessities to avoid short-term pain,"" the report concluded.

Much of the 26-page report is devoted not to the fixes made to sequestration, but to the impacts to come. Under the sequester, $85 billion will be cut this fiscal year, and an estimated $1 trillion will be cut over the next decade.

The report predicted that taxpayers may end up paying more because of the indiscriminate and shortsighted nature of the cuts.

Take, for instance, the $50 million reduced from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s geostationary weather satellite program. ""The cut will cause a 3-6 month satellite launch delay,"" the report said. ""The delay, as with any construction delay, ends up raising the cost to taxpayers over the next few years, in this case by up to $200 million.""

Then there is the case of federal public defenders, facing steep reductions in funding.

""Reductions in the Federal Defender Services account actually cost the taxpayer money in the form of private attorneys,"" the report said. ""If the Federal Defender cannot accept a case due to sequestration (as many are currently experiencing), representation is provided by private panel attorneys, who are paid at a higher cost than Federal Defenders.""

Those dreaded flight delays, the authors noted, may still end up a reality. Sequestration cuts to the Transportation Security Administration ""may not currently impact wait times for travelers moving through our nation’s airports, but TSA anticipates an increase in the number of delays during the peak summer travel months,"" the report said.

Other highlights in the report:

Research projects will feel the budget cuts, with the National Institutes of Health estimating that it will support 1,357 fewer grants in fiscal 2013 than in fiscal 2012.

The Department of Energy will face challenges ""remediating the contamination from the nation’s nuclear weapons development effort"" because of a $430 million cut.

Rural rental assistance for those in need will be hit, with an estimated 15,000 aid recipients expected to get less while an estimated 70,000 children ""will lose access to Head Start and Early Head Start.""

The Forest Service will enter the 2013 firefighting season with 500 fewer firefighters.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will place fewer vaccines, drugs and supplies into the national stockpile used for ""countermeasures needed to respond to bioterrorist attacks.""

Sequestration, the report ominously concluded, may hamper the Department of Defense in confronting pressing national security issues.

""In total,"" the report said, ""DoD estimates the shortfall caused by sequestration in the operation and maintenance accounts is $22 billion for the remainder of FY 2013. The significance of degraded readiness is that units, other than those deploying to Afghanistan (e.g., units that may respond to crises in Syria, Iran or the Korean Peninsula), will not have completed the training necessary to conduct the full range of assigned tasks.""

President Obama fills out his economic team with a pair of nominations

Obama picks Chicago business executive Penny Pritzker to be Commerce secretary

While House aide Michael Froman nominated for U.S. trade representative

WASHINGTON -- President Obama filled out his economic team on Thursday, nominating a long-time supporter and a top aide for the jobs of Commerce secretary and U.S. trade representative.

Obama picked Chicago business executive and political fundraiser Penny Pritzker for Commerce secretary and economic adviser Mike Froman for trade representative.

Describing both nominees as friends, Obama said Pritzker and Froman would work on what he called his top priorities: ""To grow the economy, create good middle-class jobs (and) make sure that the next generation prospers.""

Obama played up Pritzker's ties to the business community -- a group that has been critical of his administration -- but her nomination could face trouble over criticism from unions and her family's ties to a failed bank.

The Senate must confirm both Pritzker and Froman, neither of whom spoke during a brief ceremony in the White House Rose Garden.

Obama announced both nominations before departing on a three-day business trip to Mexico and Costa Rica, where trade and economic development are major agenda items.

Pritzker, who raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for Obama's two presidential campaigns, is on the board of Hyatt Hotels Corp. Her personal fortune is estimated at $1.85 billion, and she is listed among the 300 wealthiest Americans by Forbes magazine.

""Penny is one of our country's most distinguished business leaders,"" Obama said in unveiling his nominee. ""She's got more than 25 years of management experience in industries, including real estate, finance and hospitality. She's built companies from the ground up.""

Pritzker's nomination, long-rumored, could draw fire from Obama's union supporters. Hyatt and the hospitality workers union have been involved in a long contract battle, and workers have protested the company's treatment of them. The AFL-CIO and other organizations have called for a global boycott of Hyatt properties.

Senators may also grill Pritzker over the 2001 collapse of family-owned Superior Bank, which specialized in sub-prime lending, and federal lawsuits against her family over Caribbean tax shelters.

Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said of the nomination: ""Every nominee's offshore tax avoidance activities should be examined as part of the nomination process.""

Obama considered Pritzker for Commerce secretary after his election in 2008, but she withdrew from consideration.

Noting that Pritzker turned 54 years old on Thursday, Obama joked: ""So for your birthday present, you get to go through confirmation -- it's going to be great.""

The Commerce Department has been led by Acting Secretary Rebecca Blank since John Bryson resigned last summer amid health concerns. Blank is leaving the administration to become chancellor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

Pritzker worked as Obama's national fundraising chairwoman for the 2008 presidential campaign, using her extensive business connections to help catapult him into the White House.

In 2012, Pritzker had a lower profile. While she was listed among the more than 750 Obama bundlers who collected money from family, friends and associates for his re-election, she was not among the supporters who contributed to Priorities USA Action, a super PAC raising unlimited amounts to aid the Obama campaign.

Pritzker's relative absence was noted by Democratic insiders, particularly as Priorities USA Action struggled to raise money to compete with deep-pocketed Republican super PACs.

As for the trade post, Froman is a long-time friend of Obama -- they worked together on the Harvard Law Review -- and has served as the president's deputy national security adviser for international economic affairs. Obama said Froman has been the ""point person"" and the ""driving force"" behind more than a dozen international economic summits.

Citing their years together at Harvard Law School, Obama joked: ""He was much smarter than me then -- he continues to be smarter than me now.""

Froman also raised money Obama's first presidential campaign in 2008.

If confirmed by the Senate, Froman would replace Ron Kirk, who left the U.S. trade representative position earlier this year.

Obama noted that Froman worked with Kirk on new free trade agreements with South Korea, Colombia and Panama.

Critics of Obama's trade policies noted that, over the years, Froman has also backed such ""corporate"" deals as the North American Free Trade Agreement, and that many of these agreements have led to the transfer of manufacturing jobs to other countries.

""Folks on Main Street have cause for concern, unlike Froman's former Wall Street colleagues,"" said Lori Wallach, director of Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch.

Obama touted Froman's trade record, saying, ""Mike believes -- just as I believe and just as Penny believes -- that our workers are the most competitive in the world, so they deserve a level playing field.""

Put another way, Ronald Reagan ran the federal government at 22 percent of GDP when the country’s population was much younger, and health care consumed about 11 percent of GDP.

Did I mention that Ronald Reagan ran the federal government at 22 percent of GDP when the country’s population was much younger, and health care consumed about 11 percent of GDP?

Now Paul Ryan says we can run the federal government at 19 percent of GDP as the massive baby-boom generation retires and when health costs (largely for seniors) have already soared to 18 percent of GDP.

Sorry, but Ryan is either deeply confused or doing his best to snooker us.

In the sandstorm of commentary on what’s wrong with the Wisconsin Republican’s budget, its easy to lose sight of the few central facts that should make people of all political stripes scratch their heads. The most important is that Ryan wants to shrink government precisely when we have an unavoidably costly demographic tsunami bearing down on us and when per capita health costs have spiraled. (These costs must be challenged, but the medical industrial complex’s current level of loot has to be the starting point for the debate.)

In 1989, when President Reagan left office, there were 34 million people on Medicare and 39 million on Social Security. In 2025, according to these programs’ trustees, there will be 73 million on Medicare and 78 million on Social Security.

This is not happening because we’re stringing up the “hammock of dependency” that Ryan often invokes. It’s happening because our famously big postwar birth cohort is getting older.

Ryan obviously knows these facts. This means he’s disingenuously trying to use the aging of America to force a severe cutback in the non-elderly, non-defense portion of government, which is already headed toward historic lows as a share of GDP.

“I ... think that the historic size [of government as a share of GDP] is about right, or smaller,” Ryan told me in an interview 18 months ago.

“But how can that be if we’re doubling the number of seniors?” I asked.

“Because we can’t keep doing everything for everybody in this country,” he replied.

Huh? The Reagan comparison plainly irked him.

“If Reagan was at 22 [percent of GDP], how can we be at 20 when we double the number of retirees?” I asked (Ryan was talking of running government at 20 percent of GDP at the time).

“That’s sort of a non sequitur argument, the whole Reagan thing,” he said.

“Why?”

“Because that was then, this is now. That was a defense with a discretionary…

“We were a much younger population.”

“I think you’re turning to Ronald Reagan because we all adore Ronald Reagan,” Ryan said.

“No, I’m just saying it was a much younger population and he was a conservative icon. No one was screaming then, ‘Oh my God, you know, he’s running the government at…’”

“He was spending money on something that people liked him to spend money on, the conservatives did… to win the Cold War. So I think that’s what your point is.”

“But it was a much younger population.”

You see the impasse. Truth is, it’s Ryan who peddles non sequiturs. All through his new plan he insists that the existence of a budget gap means that government is too big. “An unbalanced budget is a sign of overreach,” he writes.

But it is no such thing. “Overreach” is a judgment. An unbalanced budget is math. It means that spending is greater than revenue. We could balance the budget at 19 percent of GDP, or at 15 percent, or at 25 percent. It’s refreshing that after years of make-believe, Ryan has finally decided to take a stab at becoming a fiscal conservative (though even his plan’s magic asterisks have magic asterisks — quite a feat). But the level of spending and taxes at which we fiscal conservatives seek to balance the budget depends on what we want government in an aging America to do.

At 19 percent, Ryan’s vision is an America with 50 million uninsured ... forever. Of infrastructure and R&D investment that trails other advanced nations ... in perpetuity. Of a nation that assigns its least effective teachers to poor children . . . permanently. (Amazingly, Senate Democrats have fallen prey to Ryan’s gravitational pull, with the budget they put out Wednesday coming in at 21.7 percent of GDP in the years ahead, a tad below Reagan-era spending.)

Ryan thinks we’re too dumb to see what he’s up to. Is $41 trillion really not enough for the federal government to spend over the next decade, he asks as he sells his new plan, exploding indignantly on the “t,” as if the Lira-like power of big-sounding numbers should scare us into submission.

It speaks volumes about today’s political culture that this thin gruel vaulted Ryan from obscurity to the “intellectual leadership” of his party and a national ticket. If all that was possible, imagine what a sensible plan championed by an intellectually honest Republican – Jon Huntsman, perhaps? – could do.

Story highlights John Bare says nonprofits in Detroit saw an opportunity to spark the economy He says that by bringing together key stakeholders, jobs were created, projects launched Organizations saw that together, their massive size would provide opportunities, he says

Editor’s Note: John Bare is vice president of the Arthur M. Blank Family Foundation and executive-in-residence at Georgia Tech’s Institute for Leadership and Entrepreneurship.

(CNN) —

When others dismissed Detroit as a falling knife unworthy of investment, David Egner saw something else.

Egner imagined Detroit regenerating from within, with damaged civic tissue repairing itself to foster new life and commerce. As president of a foundation named for a patriarch who emigrated to Michigan 130 years ago and immediately launched a business, he was in a position to test his idea.

The secret, Egner figured, is harnessing the collective power of what he calls “anchor institutions”: in this case, Wayne State University, Henry Ford Health System and Detroit Medical Center.

Through what emerged as the Midtown Project, Egner’s Hudson-Webber Foundation, alongside other funders, is finding ways to hitch the fortunes of these institutions to the fortunes of the surrounding neighborhoods.

Hudson-Webber’s research partner, Omar Blaik from U3 Ventures, compiled the data that confirmed the hunch: The anchor institutions carry breathtaking heft.

At a moment when the City of Detroit has been declared insolvent and foundations are looking for innovation, the approach carries two critical lessons for community development.

First, investors must build from assets, not deficits.

Many foundations like to use quality-of-life indicators to guide their philanthropy. I have been involved in a number of these efforts over the years, and too often, foundations find it irresistible to direct their charitable giving to whatever problem tops the charts. It feels like the right approach; if dropout rates emerge as the worst problem in a neighborhood, why not tackle it?

Problem is, whether the needle moves on this indicator or not, the approach is unlikely to contribute to broader neighborhood transformation.

Hudson-Webber’s method reveals the potential of another kind of analysis, one that is based on the untapped power of existing assets.

It turns out Wayne State, Henry Ford and Detroit Medical employ about 30,000 people, hire 3,300 associates every year, enroll 32,000 students, control about half of Midtown’s real estate and – perhaps most important – spend about $1.7 billion every year on goods and services.

Blaik found that about 4.5% of the $1.7 million in spending on goods and services was going to Detroit vendors; the rest is what Blaik calls leakage. If Detroit businesses could step up to provide quality goods and services at the right price – this is a business play, not charity – then even small upward ticks would represent enormous amounts of investment and, in turn, jobs.

Midtown Detroit Inc. organized vendor fairs to introduce local businesses to the big institutions and made sure local businesses got to see all the requests for proposals coming from the anchors.

As a result, a local bakery, a local print shop and a local construction firm were among the firms winning $20 million in business from the anchor institutions. The contracts created jobs for area residents and enabled the small businesses to ratchet up their capacity.

The successes point to the second critical lesson for foundations: Instead of limiting themselves to traditional charitable gifts – building a playground, offering scholarships to deserving high school students – the approach strengthens the connections between neighborhood residents and the marketplace.

By aligning work force training with the needs of the anchors, the Midtown Project has placed 50 local residents in entry-level jobs. Once up to full speed, Susan Mosey of Midtown Detroit believes, the arrangement can place 200 residents a year into jobs.

Midtown Detroit Inc. is also rebuilding a strong neighborhood residential core. Incentives to lure renters and buyers have drawn more than 1,000 residents to the neighborhood.

While the experiments are ongoing, the results are promising. Post-Great Recession, cities had to find new approaches to revive neighborhoods. It’s not enough to build low-cost housing, says Bruce Katz, founder of the Brookings Institution’s Metropolitan Policy Program, and there is no massive investment coming from the federal government.

“The cavalry is not coming,” said Katz, who describes local innovations from across the country in a new book, “The Metropolitan Revolution: How Cities and Metros Are Fixing Our Broken Politics and Fragile Economy.”

Cities cannot wait for old programs to return, Katz says. They are not coming back.

Instead, cities should build from whatever assets they have at hand and make a new kind of business case for investment, from within and without.

U3 Ventures’ Blaik believes that focusing on anchor institutions forces a discipline that prevents wishful thinking. Foundations, with their government and private-sector partners, can base expectations on the realities of supply and demand for hiring, business activity and residential growth.

In the end, anchor institutions may present the best hope for neighborhood transformation simply because of their scale. When it comes to sources of employment, investment and connectivity, the scale and power of the Midtown Detroit anchors dwarfs anything a foundation could sustain.

Even better: Instead of assuming residents need a handout, the approach gives residents an opening to participate in capitalism.

""It felt almost as good as stealing cars from grandma."" — Rep. Darrell Issa, probably

On Monday, we learned that the IRS didn't single out tea party groups after all. Instead, they were looking for political groups, including not just tea party groups, but progressive groups as well. They may have used a flawed method for flagging the groups, but the IRS's intent was clear: to identify political groups that were not legally entitled to receive the tax-exempt benefit they sought to receive.

That pretty much brought the IRS ""scandal"" to a screeching halt. In the hours following the revelation, Darrell Issa's Twitter feed suddenly started spamming tweets about Benghazi. ""Change the subject, quickly!"" he seemed to be saying.

But there's still a question to be answered. If the IRS was targeting political groups from across the ideological spectrum, where did the original narrative about tea party targeting come from? The answer makes Darrell Issa and his fellow House Republicans look even worse than they did on Monday:



The Treasury inspector general (IG) whose report helped drive the IRS targeting controversy says it limited its examination to conservative groups because of a request from House Republicans. A spokesman for Russell George, Treasury’s inspector general for tax administration, said they were asked by House Oversight Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) “to narrowly focus on Tea Party organizations.”

Obviously, if Issa wanted a comprehensive investigation, he should have asked for a review of all politically oriented scrutiny. Instead, he asked for exclusive focus on tea party and conservative groups. Under the most charitable interpretation of this, it never occurred to Darrell Issa that anyone other than the tea party groups could have been targeted. If that's true, it suggests he just doesn't care about whether the IRS ""targets"" anyone other than his political allies.

But I think the most likely explanation here is that Issa was simply trying to cook up a scandal, even though it did nothing to address the genuine problems with the way campaign finance and tax laws are written. He probably figured that in the best case scenario, he'd be able to get away with his fraud. And in the worst case scenario, he'd get a slap on the wrist from a few reporters, but endless approval from his political supporters. It's exactly the kind of thing you'd expect from Mr. Grand Theft Auto."
http://news.yahoo.com/senator-irs-pay-70m-employee-bonuses-081255026.html,,[],Senator: IRS to pay $70M in employee bonuses,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Internal Revenue Service is about to pay $70 million in employee bonuses despite an Obama administration directive to cancel discretionary bonuses because of automatic spending cuts enacted this year, according to a GOP senator.

Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa says his office has learned that the IRS is executing an agreement with the employees' union on Wednesday to pay the bonuses. Grassley says the bonuses should be canceled under an April directive from the White House budget office.

The directive was written by Danny Werfel, a former budget official who has since been appointed acting IRS commissioner.

""The IRS always claims to be short on resources,"" Grassley said. ""But it appears to have $70 million for union bonuses. And it appears to be making an extra effort to give the bonuses despite opportunities to renegotiate with the union and federal instruction to cease discretionary bonuses during sequestration.""

The IRS said it is negotiating with the union over the matter but did not dispute Grassley's claim that the bonuses are imminent.

Office of Management and Budget ""guidance directs that agencies should not pay discretionary monetary awards at this time, unless legally required,"" IRS spokeswoman Michelle Eldridge said in a statement. ""IRS is under a legal obligation to comply with its collective bargaining agreement, which specifies the terms by which awards are paid to bargaining-unit employees.""

Eldridge, however, would not say whether the IRS believes it is contractually obligated to pay the bonuses.

""In accordance with OMB guidance, the IRS is actively engaged with NTEU on these matters in recognition of our current budgetary constraints,"" Eldridge said.

The National Treasury Employees Union did not respond to requests for comment.

The IRS has been under fire since last month, when IRS officials acknowledged that agents had improperly targeted conservative groups for additional scrutiny when they applied for tax-exempt status during the 2010 and 2012 elections. A few weeks later, the agency's inspector general issued a report documenting lavish employee conferences during the same time period.

Story continues

Three congressional committees and the Justice Department are investigating the targeting of conservative groups. And key Republicans in Congress are promising more scrutiny of the agency's budget, especially as it ramps up to play a major role in implementing the new health care law.

Much of the agency's top leadership has been replaced since the scandals broke. President Barack Obama forced the acting commissioner to resign and replaced him with Werfel, who used to work in the White House budget office.

In a letter to Werfel on Tuesday, Grassley said the IRS notified the employee union March 25 that it intended to reclaim about $75 million that had been set aside for discretionary employee bonuses. However, Grassley said, his office has learned that the IRS never followed up on the notice. Instead, Grassley said, the IRS negotiated a new agreement with the bargaining unit to pay about $70 million in employee bonuses.

Grassley's office said the information came from a ""person with knowledge of IRS budgetary procedures.""

""While the IRS may claim that these bonuses are legally required under the original bargaining unit agreement, that claim would allegedly be inaccurate,"" Grassley wrote. ""In fact, the original agreement allows for the re-appropriation of such award funding in the event of budgetary shortfall.""

Werfel wrote the directive on discretionary employee bonuses while he was still working in the White House budget office. The directive was part of the Obama administration's efforts to impose across-the-board spending cuts enacted by Congress.

The spending cuts, known as ""sequestration,"" are resulting in at least five unpaid furlough days this year for the IRS' 90,000 employees. On these days, the agency is closed and taxpayers cannot access many of the agency's assistance programs.

Werfel's April 4 memorandum ""directs that discretionary monetary awards should not be issued while sequestration is in place, unless issuance of such awards is legally required. Discretionary monetary awards include annual performance awards, group awards, and special act cash awards, which comprise a sizeable majority of awards and incentives provided by the federal government to employees.""

""Until further notice, agencies should not issue such monetary awards from sequestered accounts unless agency counsel determines the awards are legally required. Legal requirements include compliance with provisions in collective bargaining agreements governing awards.""

Cuts would run through end of the fiscal year

Active military personnel and anti-poverty programs protected

Democratic and GOP alternatives failed to pass U.S. Senate

The White House made public an order at about 8:30 p.m. ET signed by President Obama making the budget cuts known as sequestration official and giving the federal government the authority to begin implementing $85 billion in across-the-board decreases.

The order released by the White House demands that ""budgetary resources in each non-exempt budget account be reduced by the amount calculated by the Office of Management and Budget.""

The cuts would run through Sept. 30, the end of the federal fiscal year.

According to a letter dated today from Jeffrey Zients, deputy director for management of the Office of Management and Budget, to House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, the sequestration calls for a 7.8% cut in non-exempt defense discretionary funds and 5% cut in non-exempt non-defense discretionary funding. It also calls for 2% cuts to Medicare, 5.1% to other non-exempt non-defense mandatory programs and 7.9% to non-exempt defense mandatory programs.

The federal government has said the cuts will soon translate into furlough notices to government workers, and that there will be cuts to government spending on defense contracts and domestic government programs. The plan protects active military personnel and anti-poverty programs.

The letter to Boehner, which introduced a detailed OMB report on the cuts, noted that federal lawmakers voted for sequestration ""as a mechanism to compel the Congress to act on deficit reduction."" The letter continued, ""As a result of Congress's failure to act, the law requires the President to issue a sequestration order today canceling $85 billion in budgetary resources across the Federal Government for FY 2013.""

An identical letter was sent to the president of the Senate, Vice President Biden.

The order comes after both Republican and Democratic alternatives to imposing across-the-board spending cuts failed to pass in the U.S. Senate.

The Democratic plan would have imposed a tax of 30% or more on millionaires, and cuts to defense and farm programs. The Republican plan would have forced responsibility on the president to determine how to implement the cuts as opposed to imposing an across-the-board decrease.

They are the national leaders of No Labels.

Much ink has been spilled over what’s wrong with Washington.

The rise of partisan media, too much money in politics and congressional gerrymandering that rewards ideologues with safe seats have all been offered as diagnoses for government dysfunction.

These explanations are accurate — but almost totally irrelevant to the urgent challenges at hand.

The American people can’t just hope for the creation of a better “system.” Reducing money in politics and building a better election system are worthy and important endeavors — but they are tough, multi-year, state-by state slogs.

We need to attempt those things and to seek solutions now from the system and the leaders we already have. Businesses are not hiring, and investors are not investing as a direct result of the uncertainty created by Washington. Too many would-be workers are not working. The coming generations are being doomed to a worse standard of living than previous generations.

Knowing that should light a fire under everybody in Washington. But it hasn’t. The gridlock continues, most recently with the “fiscal cliff” fiasco, and the fight over the debt ceiling looms.

From our perspective, there is only one way for leaders in Washington to step up: They need an attitude adjustment. Everyone needs to be willing to sit down with anyone — conservative, liberal or anyone in between — to work together to achieve success for our nation. Everyone needs to recognize that principled and deeply held political beliefs don’t require an all-or-nothing approach to governance and that the letter behind a person’s name does not automatically make them stupid or treasonous.

To be clear, we are not naïve about the challenge of fostering cooperation across the aisle. There are philosophical differences between Democrats and Republicans that can’t be papered over with nice words about civility.

But adopting an attitude focused on problem solving is a deeply pragmatic response to Washington’s dysfunction. With Democrats controlling the Senate and Republicans controlling the House, no one can get everything they want. We will either work across the aisle to fix problems or we will achieve nothing.

Luckily, we are not the only ones who recognize this. On Monday morning, the group No Labels — a collection of Democrats, Republicans and independents dedicated to promoting a new politics of problem solving — will unveil two dozen “Problem Solvers”: a group of House and Senate members evenly split between Republicans and Democrats who have agreed to hold monthly meetings in 2013 to build trust across the aisle.

These forward-looking Americans include: Sens. Mark Begich (D-Alaska) and Dean Heller (R-Nev.) and Reps. John Barrow (D-Ga.), Sanford Bishop (D-Ga.), David Cicilline (D-R.I.), Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.), Charlie Dent (R-Pa.), Scott DesJarlais (R-Tenn.), Mike Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.), Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.), Janice Hahn (D-Calif.), Richard Hanna (R-N.Y.), Jim Himes (D-Conn.), Lynn Jenkins (R-Kan.), Jack Kingston (R-Ga.), Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.), Dan Lipinski (D-Ill.), Dave Loebsack (D-Iowa), Jim Moran (D-Va.), Reid Ribble (R-Wis.), Scott Rigell (R-Va.), Kurt Schrader (D-Ore.) and Peter Welch (D-Vt.).

This is a big deal. While in past years members of Congress used to interact regularly with members of the opposite party, today members of Congress interact very little with people from the other party — or even members of their own party in the opposite body. Members’ daily lives are dominated by party caucus, policy and fundraising meetings that are focused on winning elections or destroying the opposing party. There isn’t much time left over to actually govern.

But the Problem Solvers can and will seek to change this. In the next year, No Labels’ grass-roots supporters will strive to expand the number of problem solvers, with a goal of recruiting 75 members by year’s end. This could transform how Washington works. And it won’t be long before members start hearing demands from their constituents to join the group. Millions of Americans who have tired of the hyper-partisanship have realized that there is an organized group that can finally give them a voice in our political system. They have gone to NoLabels.org and are telling their friends and neighbors to as well.

Despite the gloomy outlook in Washington, the United States has great potential and promise. The American people need their leaders in Washington to start supporting our economy and stop subtracting from it. We can begin tapping our potential the moment we stop taking score and begin taking steps to start solving problems. That’s the only realistic way forward for America."

A study released earlier this month from the public policy group Demos states that through various forms of government funding in the private sector, nearly two million people are making $12 an hour or less. The number of workers at Wal-Mart and McDonald's together at $12 an hour or less is currently around 1.5 million, according to the report.

""The sheer number of those workers making so little is surprising,"" said Amy Traub, a senior policy analyst at Demos and co-author of the study.

""We assume people working on behalf of America would be making more, but that's not the case,"" Traub said. ""And many of these people are making less than $12 an hour.""

The report says that when tax dollars underwrite bad jobs, the economy as a whole is weakened.

""People at these levels of income have to go on food stamps or other forms of government assistance and this just compounds the problem,"" Traub argued. ""They're not making a living wage and the economy suffers.""

Federal contracting to the private sector has grown over the years, doubling between 1990 and 2009, though it has decreased slightly since 2010, according to the Demos survey.

But the amount is still huge. American businesses got $446.5 billion from taxpayers last year in the form of grants, loans, and subsidies. Industries receiving funds include manufacturing, construction, food service, health care, retail and manufacturing. The number of workers under that funding totals 2.2 million.

The report says that most of the low-wage workers are clustered in sectors like apparel, construction, education and retail. But even industries seen as higher paying, such as scientific research, are among those with workers making $12 or less an hour.

The biggest offenders came from those companies receiving direct federal contracts. Some 560,000 workers in those firms make $12 an hour or less, says the report.

Breaking down the sectors in all government funding shows retail— with 59,977 people making $12 an hour or less—the largest group with low wages.

""This is another example of our low-wage economy,"" said Jason Bent, a professor of employment law at Stetson University. ""Private companies with government contracts are doing the same thing as those that don't have contracts. They're paying low wages to cut costs.""

Companies receiving some sort of government funding are mandated by law to uphold high employment practices including prevailing wages within a particular area of work.

But the Demos report states that most firms are not holding up their end of the bargain and are actually creating a wage gap.

Traub says the study highlights the disparity between those at the top of firms with government funding and those at the bottom. It singled out CEOs at Lockheed and Northrop Grumman—whose firms are headquartered in the Washington, D.C., area—for making millions in compensation while about 15 percent of federal contract workers in the same region are low-wage.

Low-wage jobs are becoming standard in the economy, say experts. A National Employment Law Project report in 2012 found that three out of five jobs added after the recession have been low-wage jobs, even though just one in five jobs lost during the recession was low-wage.

About a third of all workers in the U.S. make $12 an hour or less. A $12 an hour job is equivalent to a full-time worker with an annual income of $24,000 a year. For 2013, the Federal poverty guideline is an annual income of $23,550 for a family of four.

Traub said Congress will be having hearings on the issue raised in her report later this month. She hopes some action will be taken to brighten the prospects of workers.

""We'd love to have something done, especially since the president called for raising the minimum wage,"" Traub said. ""This doesn't seem right to have people working for America getting pushed to the economic bottom."""
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/08/us/politics/in-congress-gridlock-and-harsh-consequences.html,2013-07-08 00:00:00,['Jonathan Weisman'],"In Congress, Gridlock and Harsh Consequences","WASHINGTON — Despite finger-pointing news conferences and radio addresses by both parties on Capitol Hill, Congress let interest rates double last week on federally subsidized student loans. Eleven days earlier, a coalition of Democrats and conservative Republicans in the House scuttled the latest attempt at a farm bill, dooming for now disaster assistance for livestock producers still affected by last year’s drought.

Congress returns on Monday with a major overhaul of immigration pending in the House, the farm bill lying in a heap and new fiscal deadlines looming when the government runs out of spending authority on Sept. 30 and reaches its borrowing limit shortly thereafter. The Postal Service, meanwhile, continues to lose millions of dollars every day as a measure to rescue the agency founders in the House.

There is no guarantee that any of these issues will be dealt with.

Even in some of the worst years of partisan gridlock, a deadline has meant something to Congress — until 2013. Drop-dead dates have come and gone this year, causing real-world consequences. On Jan. 1, tax rates went up not only for affluent families, but also for virtually all workers when lawmakers looked the other way and let a payroll tax cut expire. On March 1, after leaders from both parties declared that automatic, across-the-board spending cuts would never happen, they happened anyway because of inaction.

“One hundred percent of Congress opposed it, and we’re doing it,” said Representative Peter Welch, Democrat of Vermont. “That’s a sign of a dysfunctional institution.”"

Though the president's newly released plan claims to include $580 billion in new revenue over the next decade, when all taxes and fees are counted the real number is slightly higher than $1 trillion.

Republicans already have said they will not countenance new tax increases, after they already agreed to raise rates on top earners as part of the fiscal crisis deal. But both sides are sure to engage in an exhaustive debate in the weeks and months ahead, particularly as a looming debt-ceiling deadline forces Congress to try to reach a deal.

Here are a few of the notable tax increases in Obama's 2014 budget blueprint that are likely to prove controversial in that debate:

The biggest item by far is a plan to reduce the value of itemized deductions for top earners, so that they can only reduce their tax liability to 28 percent of income. This would affect deductions for charity, mortgage interest and other expenses -- as well as other select preferences for the top 3 percent of families. The change is projected to bring in $529.3 billion over 10 years.

The plan would implement the so-called ""Buffett Rule,"" the tax change named after Warren Buffett that Obama has long sought. The change would require that ""wealthy millionaires"" pay at least 30 percent of their income -- after charity -- in taxes. The White House estimates this would bring in $53.4 billion.

Though the president's proposal to curb the growth of Social Security was touted as a budget ""cut,"" the change would also bring in more revenue. The proposal would change the inflation formula, which would in turn curb the growth of benefits. In doing so, that same formula would adjust tax brackets and raise about $100 billion over 10 years.

Buried deep in the budget is a proposal to raise the federal cigarette tax by 94 cents a pack. The hike is projected to raise $78 billion, to pay for an early childhood education program. The federal tax per pack would go from $1.01 to $1.95. ""In addition to financing important investments in early learning, the proposed tobacco tax increase would have substantial public health benefits, particularly for young Americans. Researchers have found that raising taxes on cigarettes significantly,"" the budget document said.

The budget includes a slew of other tax changes and fees too numerous to mention, but they include: a ""financial crisis responsibility fee"" on financial firms that is projected to raise $59.3 billion; an increase in the aviation passenger security fee projected to raise $18 billion; and a limit on the total accrual of certain retirement benefits projected to raise $9.3 billion.

Though Obama is pushing Republicans further than they want to go on taxes, he claimed Wednesday that he's meeting them ""more than halfway"" -- considering separate spending cuts and changes to entitlements.

""If you're serious about deficit reduction, then there's no excuse to keep these loopholes open,"" he said.

But Republicans argued Wednesday that Obama should not hold those entitlement changes ""hostage"" to calls for tax increases.

House Republican Leader Eric Cantor urged Obama to drop the call for tax increases and work together with Republicans on entitlements.

Republicans also complained that, despite $1.8 trillion in claimed deficit reduction, the budget would still not balance under the president's plan."

At a cost of $35,000 per flying hour, the Global Hawk Block 30 aircraft had “priced itself out of the niche, in terms of taking pictures in the air,” Deputy Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter said at the time.

The Air Force planned to stop buying the Global Hawk and mothball 18 of those it already owned to save about $2.5 billion over five years. The high-tech drones, the military said, were not as capable as the battle-tested U-2 spy planes.

Northrop responded sharply, saying the U-2 “places pilots in danger, has limited flight duration and provides limited sensor capacity.”

In the end, the Air Force didn’t win that skirmish. House Armed Services Committee Chairman Howard “Buck” McKeon (R-Santa Clarita), whose congressional district includes Palmdale, jumped in to rescue the project. Congress restored the funding, and last month Northrop received a $114-million contract to build three more drones, saving thousands of jobs.

The Pentagon faces budget cuts of $487 billion over the next 10 years — and the threat of $500 billion more under sequestration. But paring down the budget by killing weapons programs is no easy task on Capitol Hill, where politicians, backed by the defense industry lobby, fight to protect jobs in their home districts.

For instance, Congress has spent about $400 million in the last two years to churn out improved versions of the M1 Abrams tank that the Army doesn’t want. The Navy cruiser Anzio out of Norfolk, Va., was supposed to be retired this year but lawmakers kept it afloat. Just last month, 33 lawmakers wrote Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel to express “deep concern” about the Air Force’s consideration of cutting the A-10 attack jet fleet.

In the case of the Global Hawk, McKeon said he worked to keep the program alive because the drone is a valuable tool for spying, and he wanted to protect the billions of dollars the government has already spent on the technology.

“I think these planes have proven their capabilities,” McKeon said, “and will continue to show their worth over time.”

Critics say the allocation of funding for the Global Hawk reflects cozy ties between Congress and defense companies. Northrop has been one of McKeon’s largest campaign donors and spent more than $17.5 million on total lobbying last year, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics, a watchdog group. The defense firm has spent $13.2 million this year.

“The mantra in the defense industry is: Give early and give often,” said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. “Clearly, McKeon is in a good position to protect this investment, and it has the added benefit of providing jobs to his constituents back home.”

Northrop has more than 3,480 employees — 2,500 of them in Southern California — working on the Global Hawk program in 22 states. It has contracts with 303 suppliers in 36 states.

The Air Force has been flying the Global Hawk since 2001, including missions in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya. The drone can fly for 30 hours without refueling.

Even from more than 11 miles overhead, the drone is able to capture images of enemy hide-outs that are so clear that U.S. intelligence officials can determine the make, model and license plates of pickup trucks parked nearby — and tell how long they’ve been there.

Military planners had wanted Global Hawks to replace the fleet of 33 U-2 spy planes, which have been in service since the 1950s. But repeated problems with the drones’ equipment and flight reliability, and their high price tag, caused the Air Force to put the program on hold last year.

The drone costs $222.7 million each, according to the Government Accountability Office.

In addition, mission personnel costs for the Global Hawk “are substantially higher than those of the manned U-2, despite the fact that the number of flight hours for the Global Hawk and the number of aircraft are substantially below those of the U-2,” the Air Force said.

The U-2 costs $4,000 less per flight hour and has more capability, the Air Force said.

Critics of the Pentagon’s plan have said that the Air Force harbors a bias against the Global Hawk because it doesn’t have a pilot in the cockpit. Air Force brass has strongly refuted that criticism.

The Air Force wanted to put all 18 of the third version of Global Hawk, called Block 30, in storage at the bone yard at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona. This would leave the Air Force with 14 Global Hawks in operation.

Not long after the Pentagon’s announcement last year that it was going to shut down the Global Hawk program, McKeon made a rousing speech at Northrop’s manufacturing plant in Palmdale. He asked the crowd to call members of Congress to stop the cuts.

“I implore you, no, I beg you, to stop this from happening,” he said at the time. His committee later passed an amendment that would prevent the Air Force from retiring the planes.

In May, McKeon and Rep. James P. Moran (D-Va.), whose district includes where Northrop’s headquarters is based, wrote a letter to Hagel that the Air Force was trying to “ignore clear congressional intent.”

Last month, Northrop announced it had received a $114-million contract for the first phase of a contract to build the last three Block 30 Global Hawks.

“The budget situation is a nightmare,” said Todd Harrison, a defense analyst for the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments in Washington. “It’s well-known that there isn’t enough money. Programs need to be cut, but Congress continues to micromanage the military budget.”

http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/01/opinion/krugman-a-war-on-the-poor.html,2013-11-01 00:00:00,['Paul Krugman'],A War on the Poor - The New York Times,"John Kasich, the Republican governor of Ohio, has done some surprising things lately. First, he did an end run around his state’s Legislature — controlled by his own party — to proceed with the federally funded expansion of Medicaid that is an important piece of Obamacare. Then, defending his action, he let loose on his political allies, declaring, “I’m concerned about the fact there seems to be a war on the poor. That, if you’re poor, somehow you’re shiftless and lazy.”

Obviously Mr. Kasich isn’t the first to make this observation. But the fact that it’s coming from a Republican in good standing (although maybe not anymore), indeed someone who used to be known as a conservative firebrand, is telling. Republican hostility toward the poor and unfortunate has now reached such a fever pitch that the party doesn’t really stand for anything else — and only willfully blind observers can fail to see that reality.

The big question is why. But, first, let’s talk a bit more about what’s eating the right.

I still sometimes see pundits claiming that the Tea Party movement is basically driven by concerns about budget deficits. That’s delusional. Read the founding rant by Rick Santelli of CNBC: There’s nary a mention of deficits. Instead, it’s a tirade against the possibility that the government might help “losers” avoid foreclosure. Or read transcripts from Rush Limbaugh or other right-wing talk radio hosts. There’s not much about fiscal responsibility, but there’s a lot about how the government is rewarding the lazy and undeserving.

Republicans in leadership positions try to modulate their language a bit, but it’s a matter more of tone than substance. They’re still clearly passionate about making sure that the poor and unlucky get as little help as possible, that — as Representative Paul Ryan, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, put it — the safety net is becoming “a hammock that lulls able-bodied people to lives of dependency and complacency.” And Mr. Ryan’s budget proposals involve savage cuts in safety-net programs such as food stamps and Medicaid."

http://news.yahoo.com/gop-seeks-smooth-roughest-cuts-081523452.html,,[],"GOP seeks to smooth roughest cuts, avert shutdown","WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans controlling the House are moving to take the roughest edges off across-the-board spending cuts that are just starting to take effect.

Even as the military would bear a $43 billion cut over just seven months, the new GOP measure released Monday would give the Pentagon much-needed funding for readiness. It would also ease the pain felt by critical agencies like the FBI and the Border Patrol.

The effort is part of a huge spending measure released Monday that would fund day-to-day federal operations through September — and head off a potential government shutdown later this month.

""Our goal is to cut spending, not to shut the government down,"" said House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio.

The measure would leave in place automatic cuts of 5 percent to domestic agencies and 7.8 percent to the Pentagon ordered Friday by President Barack Obama after months of battling with Republicans over the budget. But the House Republicans' legislation would award the Defense Department its detailed 2013 budget while other agencies would be frozen in place at 2012 levels.

The unprecedented across-the-board cuts would then be applied to the day-to-day budgets of every federal agency except Veterans Affairs, which is exempt from them.

The GOP funding measure is set to advance through the House on Thursday in hopes of preventing a government shutdown when a six-month spending bill passed last September runs out March 27. The latest measure blends updated 2013 budget measures for the Defense and Veterans Affairs departments — giving much-sought increases for military operations and maintenance efforts and veterans' health programs — but puts most the rest of the government on autopilot.

Senate Democrats want to add more detailed budgets for domestic Cabinet agencies but it will take GOP help to do so. The House measure also denies money sought by Obama and his Democratic allies to implement the signature 2010 laws overhauling the health care system and financial regulation.

Story continues

After accounting for the across-the-board cuts, domestic agencies would face cuts exceeding 5 percent when compared with last year. But Republicans carved out a host of exemptions seeking to protect especially important functions, such as federal prisons and firefighting efforts in the West, as well as new funding for embassy security and modernizing the U.S. nuclear arsenal. The FBI and the Border Patrol would be able to maintain current staffing levels and would not have to furlough employees.

The legislation would provide about $2 billion more than the current level to beef up security at U.S. embassies and diplomatic missions worldwide. Last September, a terrorist attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, killed Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans.

A project to repair the iconic Capitol Dome could stay on track and NASA would be protected from the harshest effects of the automatic cuts, known in Washington-speak as a sequester.

The across-the-board cuts would carve $85 billion in spending from the government's $3.6 trillion budget for this year, concentrating the cuts in the approximately $1 trillion allocated to the day-to-day agency operating budgets set by Congress each year. Those so-called discretionary accounts received big boosts in the first two years of Obama's presidency, when Democrats controlled Congress, but have borne the brunt of the cuts approved as Obama and Republicans have grappled over the budget.

Both Democrats and Republicans for months have warned the cuts are draconian and would slow the growth of the economy, costing hundreds of thousands of jobs. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, for instance, says they would slow the economy by 0.6 percent and cost about 750,000 jobs."

A Nevada Native', 'He Joined The Times In After Graduating The University Of Nevada', 'Reno. He Has Previously Worked As A Reporter For Newspapers In Minnesota', 'Virginia']",California agency ordered to issue delayed unemployment checks,"The state’s top labor official ordered the Employment Development Department to immediately issue payments to 124,000 Californians whose benefit checks have been delayed by a computer glitch.

Marty Morgenstern, secretary of labor and workforce development, said the backlog of claims building up at the EDD were “unacceptable.” He directed the agency to forgo verifying the claimants’ eligibility and push payments through — the equivalent of pay now, ask questions later.

The EDD has been contending with a huge backlog of unemployment claims after an upgrade of its 30-year-old computer system malfunctioned over Labor Day weekend. Since then, the agency has been hand-processing claims, which has delayed some payments by weeks.

Hundreds of state employees have been working overtime to reduce the backlog, which has snared about 15% of ongoing claims since the new system went live.

Morgenstern said despite these efforts, “it is unlikely that the claims backlog will be reduced quickly enough to respond to the very real financial hardship now being experienced by too many of our residents relying on timely payment of their UI benefits.”

Unemployment insurance recipients said they’ve fallen behind on rent, car payments and other bills because of the late payments. Some reported they’re already facing eviction.

Keion Morgan, 35, is among those struggling without his unemployment benefits.

The North Hollywood resident, laid off from a job in late May as a program coordinator for a university, said he had no idea there was a problem until he read media reports. He is owed about $1,100.

“It’s been very frustrating from the communication aspect,” Morgan said.

Morgan could see some of his claims paid as early as Thursday, EDD spokeswoman Loree Levy said. She said the agency would later go back and review the claims to determine eligibility, and seek reimbursement in case of overpayment.

The computer snafu is the latest problem to hit the EDD, which has been forced to reduce services in recent months because of federal budget cuts. The agency no longer answers its unemployment benefits hotline in the afternoons, and its regional jobs centers have lost some funding.

Levy told The Times on Monday that officials expected some hiccups with the system upgrade “but we didn’t know it’d be to this magnitude.”

The agency on Tuesday also confirmed that the contractor behind the upgrade, New York consultant Deloitte, is the same firm that upgraded Massachusetts’ unemployment benefits system. That state has also faced similar delays in benefit payments.

Massachusetts and California labor officials have repeatedly stressed that their systems are working since the upgrade, and that problems affect only a small portion of claimants.

A spokesman for Deloitte defended the computer upgrades in both states and said in a statement that the company is working to help resolve issues as quickly as possible.

“Although there have been some challenges with a small percentage of claimant accounts — which is not unusual for new systems this large and complex — there have been far more successes,” the statement said.

Legislators around California, who are on recess, said their offices have been fielding calls and emails from residents who are not getting unemployment payments.

Assemblyman Richard Hershel Bloom (D-Santa Monica) said the order by Morgenstern was a bold and appropriate move “because it deals with an emergency and gets money into people’s hands so they can deal with their immediate financial need.”

Bloom said he expects there will be oversight hearings to determine what exactly happened and how to avoid similar problems in the future. He took issue with how the EDD communicated the problem not just to the public but to state lawmakers.

“There were some issues with notification, even to the Legislature,” he said. “The flow of information was not what it should be.”

Jason Maloni, a crisis communications expert at Levick, a Washington, D.C.-based public relations firm, said the problem is a classic example of not anticipating potential problems ahead of a big computer upgrade.

He said that when the agency first discovered the problem, it should have communicated the issue more broadly and focused on finding a solution.

“Today’s society demands instant answers when a problem occurs,” he said. “It certainly doesn’t reflect well on government authorities.”

http://news.yahoo.com/irs-replaces-official-tea-party-controversy-223044834.html,,[],IRS replaces official in tea party controversy,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Moving quickly to stem a raging controversy, the new acting head of the Internal Revenue Service started cleaning house Thursday by replacing the supervisor who oversaw agents involved in targeting tea party groups.

A day after she refused to answer questions at a congressional hearing, Lois Lerner was placed on administrative leave, according to congressional sources.

Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, a senior Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, said Lerner was asked to resign but refused, so she was placed on leave. An IRS spokeswoman said the agency could not comment on Lerner's status because it was a private personnel matter.

Danny Werfel, the agency's new acting commissioner, told IRS employees in an email that he had selected a new acting head of the division, staying within the IRS to find new leadership.

Ken Corbin, a 27-year IRS veteran, will be the new acting director of the agency's exempt organizations division. Corbin currently is a deputy director in the wage and investment division, where he oversees 17,000 workers responsible for processing 172 million individual and business tax returns, Werfel said.

Werfel's email Thursday made no mention of Lerner. But congressional aides who were briefed on the matter confirmed that Lerner was placed on paid administrative leave. The aides spoke on condition of anonymity because a personnel matter was involved.

""From all accounts so far, the IRS acting commissioner was on solid ground to ask for her resignation,"" Grassley said in a statement. ""The IRS owes it to taxpayers to resolve her situation quickly. The agency needs to move on to fix the conditions that led to the targeting debacle. She shouldn't be in limbo indefinitely on the taxpayers' dime.""

Lerner's lawyer, William W. Taylor III, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Lerner is the IRS official who first publicly disclosed on May 10 that IRS agents had been targeting tea party and other conservative groups for additional scrutiny when they applied for tax-exempt status. At the time she apologized on behalf of the IRS, but it wasn't enough to stop a firestorm of criticism from the White House and Congress.

Story continues

If Lerner, a career civil servant, is dismissed she would become the third IRS official to lose their job in the scandal. Last week, President Barack Obama forced acting IRS Commissioner Steven Miller to resign, replacing him with Werfel, a former White House budget official who started at the IRS on Wednesday.

Also last week, Joseph Grant, one of Miller's top deputies, announced plans to retire June 3, according to an internal IRS memo. Grant had just been named commissioner of the agency's tax exempt and government entities division, which includes the agents that targeted tea party groups. Grant had been the acting head of the division since 2010.

Lerner provided one of the most electric moments since the controversy erupted when she unwaveringly — but briefly — defended herself before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on Wednesday.

""I have not done anything wrong,"" she told the committee, reading from a written statement. ""I have not broken any laws, I have not violated any IRS rules or regulations, and I have not provided false information to this or any other congressional committee.""

Then, she refused to answer lawmakers' questions, invoking her constitutional right against self-incrimination. A few minutes later, she was excused. As she boarded an elevator, several of the men who escorted her briefly jostled with TV camera operators who were trying to film her.

Lerner learned in June 2011 that agents were singling out groups with ""Tea Party"" and ""Patriots"" in their applications for tax-exempt status, according to a report by the agency's inspector general. Lerner ordered agents to scrap the criteria immediately, but later they evolved to include groups that promoted the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.

It finally stopped in May 2012, when top agency officials say they found out and ordered agents to adopt appropriate criteria for determining whether tax-exempt groups were overly political.

Former IRS Commissioner Douglas Shulman told two congressional committees this week that he first learned in the spring of 2012 that conservative groups had been improperly singled out for additional scrutiny. However, after learning that the practice had stopped and that the inspector general was investigating, Shulman said he didn't tell anyone in the Treasury Department or the White House about it. The IRS is part of the Treasury Department.

Shulman, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, left office in November, when his five-year term expired.

On Thursday, the two leaders of the Senate Investigations subcommittee accused Lerner of misleading committee staff just a few days before it she made the controversy public.

Subcommittee Chairman Carl Levin, D-Mich., and the top Republican member, Arizona Sen. John McCain, called on the IRS to immediately suspend Lois Lerner from her job as director of the IRS division that handles applications for tax-exempt status.

On April 30, committee staff interviewed Lerner and seven of her colleagues for six hours, the senators said in a letter to Werfel.

""That interview covered, among other topics, how the IRS determines which groups to review, what actions are taken in connection with the IRS reviews, and how the laws and regulations are used to examine those groups,"" the senators wrote. ""Ms. Lerner failed to disclose the internal controversy.""

Lerner, 62, is an attorney who joined the IRS in 2001. In her brief appearance Wednesday, she expressed pride in her 34-year career in federal government, which has included work at the Justice Department and Federal Election Commission. AT the IRS, she oversaw 900 workers and a budget approaching $100 million.

Corbin, the new acting director of exempt organizations, began his IRS career in Atlanta in 1986, Werfel said.

""Ken is a proven leader during challenging times. He has strong management experience inside the IRS handling a wide range of processing issues and compliance topics as well as taxpayer service areas,"" Werfel said. ""Combined with his track record of leading large work groups, these skills make him an ideal choice to help lead the Exempt Organizations area through this difficult period.""

Rep. Sander Levin of Michigan, the top Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, praised the selection of Corbin.

""In naming Ken Corbin as acting director to replace Lois Lerner, the administration has taken a strong step to address serious mistakes made by the IRS Exempt Organization Division,"" Levin said. ""This and further corrective action are vital in restoring the confidence of the American people.""

The automatic cuts, known as sequester, kick in March 1 because the parties have failed to agree on a less-drastic plan to cut the federal budget and deficit.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi told “Fox News Sunday” that Democrats remain steadfast about tax increases being part of the deal but remain open to spending cuts.

“What we do need is more revenue and new cuts,” the California congresswoman said.

Pelosi said Democrats were “not talking about raising taxes,” but want to close tax loopholes, including those for U.S. oil companies.

More On This...

She also argued Democrats have made $1.6 trillion in cuts over the past two years and suggested the bigger solution to the country’s economic problems is job growth.

Her argument is similar to the one President Obama -- who also has suggested stopping sequester with a mix of tax hikes and spending cuts -- is expected to restate Tuesday during his State of the Union address.

“We need a big, balanced, bold proposal,” said Pelosi, arguing more jobs result in more revenue. The interview was taped last week.

However, Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole said fellow House Republicans will “absolutely not” accept tax increases as part of a deal, which would trigger the cuts to federal defense and discretionary spending.

Cole told ABC News’ “This Week” that the president refused to agree to spending cuts during the recent, so-called “fiscal cliff” negotiations so Democrats are not getting revenue increases now.

“I think (sequester) is inevitable, quite frankly,” he said.

Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain also said Sunday that Republicans don’t want tax increases, considering they just agreed to end more than $1 trillion in income tax breaks, but suggested he might be open to closing some tax loopholes.

He also urged both parties to work together to avoid sequester, which will result in big cuts to the defense budget and roughly $1.2 trillion in total cuts over the next decade.

“I’ll take responsibility as a Republican, but we’ve got to avoid it,” said McCain, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee. “The world is a very dangerous place.”"

He Died On June']",Charles Krauthammer: Call Obama’s sequester bluff,"For the first time since Election Day, President Obama is on the defensive. That’s because on March 1, automatic spending cuts (“sequestration”) go into effect — $1.2 trillion over 10 years, half from domestic (discretionary) programs, half from defense.

The idea had been proposed and promoted by the White House during the July 2011 debt-ceiling negotiations. The political calculation was that such draconian defense cuts would drive the GOP to offer concessions.

It backfired. The Republicans have offered no concessions. Obama’s bluff is being called and he’s the desperate party. He abhors the domestic cuts. And as commander in chief he must worry about indiscriminate Pentagon cuts that his own defense secretary calls catastrophic.

So Tuesday, Obama urgently called on Congress to head off the sequester with a short-term fix. But instead of offering an alternative $1.2 trillion in cuts, Obama demanded a “balanced approach,” coupling any cuts with new tax increases.

What should the Republicans do? Nothing.

Republicans should explain — message No. 1 — that in the fiscal-cliff deal the president already got major tax hikes with no corresponding spending cuts. Now it is time for a nation $16 trillion in debt to cut spending. That’s balance.

The Republicans finally have leverage. They should use it. Obama capitalized on the automaticity of the expiring Bush tax cuts to get what he wanted at the fiscal cliff — higher tax rates. Republicans now have automaticity on their side.

If they do nothing, the $1.2 trillion in cuts go into effect. This is the one time Republicans can get cuts under an administration that has no intent of cutting anything. Get them while you can.

Of course, the sequester is terrible policy. The domestic cuts will be crude and the Pentagon cuts damaging. This is why the Republican House has twice passed bills offering more rationally allocated cuts. (They curb, for example, entitlement spending as well.)

Naturally, the Democratic Senate, which hasn’t passed a budget since before the iPad, has done nothing. Nor has the president — until his Tuesday plea.

The GOP should reject it out of hand and plainly explain (message No. 2): We are quite prepared to cut elsewhere. But we already raised taxes last month. If the president wants to avoid the sequester — as we do — he must offer a substitute set of cuts.

Otherwise, Mr. President, there is nothing to discuss. Your sequester — Republicans need to reiterate that the sequester was the president’s idea in the first place — will go ahead.

GOP Chairman Reince Priebus rebuilds party with smiles. (Ann Telnaes/The Washington Post)

Obama is trying to sell his “balanced” approach with a linguistic sleight of hand. He insists on calling his proposed tax hikes — through eliminating deductions and exemptions — “tax reform.”

It’s not. Tax reform, as defined even by the White House’s own Web page on the subject, begins with lowering tax rates. It then makes up the lost revenue by closing loopholes.

Real tax reform is revenue neutral. It’s a way to clean the tax code by eliminating unfair, inefficient and market-distorting loopholes on the one hand while lowering rates to stimulate economic growth on the other.

Obama has zero interest in lowering tax rates. He just got through raising them at the fiscal cliff and has made perfectly clear ever since that he fully intends to keep raising taxes. His only interest in eliminating loopholes is to raise more cash for the Treasury — not to use them to lower rates.

That’s not tax reform. That’s a naked, old-fashioned tax increase.

Hence Republican message No. 3: The sequester is one thing, real tax reform quite another. The sequester is for cutting. The only question is whether it will be done automatically and indiscriminately — or whether the president will offer an alternative set of cuts.

Then we can take up real tax reform. Reprise the landmark Reagan-Tip O’Neill-Bill Bradley tax reform of 1986, a revenue-neutral spur to economic growth and efficiency, and a blow for fairness for those not powerful enough to manipulate the tax code.

The country needs tax reform. But first it needs to rein in out-of-control spending. To succeed in doing that, Republicans must remain united under one demand: cuts with no taxes — or we will let the sequester go into effect.

The morning after, they should sit down with Obama for negotiations on real tax reform as recommended by the president’s own Simpson-Bowles commission: broaden the base, lower the rates.

It's not just Republicans/right-wingers/Tea Party people; there's a lot of Democrats/progressives/other left-leaning folks who apparently don't ""grok"" the concept either.

With that in mind--and at the risk of sounding patronizing--here's a very basic demonstration of the problem and the reality:

Here's a modified version of the current Federal Income Tax Brackets (I've rounded off the numbers to make it easier to follow):

Taxable Income / Tax Rate

$0 - $10,000 / 10%

$10,000 - $30,000 / 15%

$30,000 - $80,000 / 25%

$80,000 - $200,000 / 28%

$200,000 - $400,000 / 33%

More than $400,000 / 35%

So, let's suppose that someone made $80,000 (taxable) last year, but makes $80,001 (taxable) this year.

(Note: I'm not even getting into deductions and all the other stuff; I'm just talking about the end-of-the-line taxable income for simplicity's sake)

The folks I'm talking about THINK that they paid 25% in taxes last year ($20,000), and they THINK that this year, because they made $1 more (pushing them into the 28% tax bracket) that they're going to owe 28% on everything ($22,400).

That is, they think that they owe an extra $2,400 in taxes even though they only made $1 more in income, and therefore are going to lose $2,399.

However, they're wrong about both what they owed last year AND what they'll owe this year.

Last year, they owed:

10% on the first $10,000 = $1,000

15% on the next $20,000 = $3,000

25% on the next $50,000 = $12,500

= a grand total of $16,500

...as opposed to the $20,000 that they thought they owed.

This year, they'll owe:

10% on the first $10,000 = $1,000

15% on the next $20,000 = $3,000

25% on the next $50,000 = $12,500

28% on the next $1 = $0.28

= a grand total of $16,500.28

...or just $0.28 more than last year, not $2,400 more, and certainly not the $22,400 they thought they owed.

The same holds true at every level: You're only paying the higher rate on any income ABOVE the threshold in question, not on EVERYTHING.

Hope this helps some folks when talking to others, and hope I didn't come off as a dick in doing so...

Schwartz'],Lowest Jobless Rate in 5 Years Raises Odds of a Fed Move,"After years of frustrating fits and starts in the wake of the financial crisis and the Great Recession, the United States economy finally appears to be generating jobs at a healthier, more sustainable pace that many analysts now think will continue into 2014. The official unemployment rate fell in November to its lowest level since 2008.

Employers have hired at least 200,000 workers in three of the last four months, including 203,000 in November. By contrast, as recently as July, when the economy seemed stuck in yet another summer swoon, only 89,000 new jobs were created.

The better-than-expected data from the Labor Department on Friday follows other hopeful economic indicators this week, including an upward revision for economic growth in the third quarter on Thursday and an uptick in manufacturing reported on Monday.

The 7 percent unemployment rate last month — down from its most recent peak of 10 percent in October 2009 — is the best reading since President Obama took office, providing one bright spot for a White House beleaguered on many other fronts. The unemployment rate was 7.3 percent in December 2008, the month before Mr. Obama was inaugurated."

The think tank, which closely tracks the debt limit issue, updated an earlier estimate that the date for a potential default would be between Oct. 18 and Nov. 5.

Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew has warned Congress that the $16.7-trillion debt limit must be raised by Oct. 17 or the federal government would face default because it would be out of its so-called extraordinary measures for juggling the nation’s finances.

At that point, Lew said, the Treasury would have to depend on cash on hand of about $30 billion and incoming revenue to pay bills on any given day.

QUIZ: Test your knowledge about the debt limit

The new estimate from the Bipartisan Policy Center could give Congress more time to overcome a political stalemate and raise the debt limit before the government defaults.

The center’s analysis was based on major federal government payments scheduled at the end of October and early November. But the report warned that it was difficult to set an exact date when a default might occur because the flow of incoming revenue can be random and vary by several billions of dollars.

“No one can predict with absolute certainty the date and time when Treasury will have exhausted all its extraordinary measures and run out of cash on hand,” the report said. “Therefore, policymakers should not assume that they have until Oct. 22 to make decisions concerning the federal debt ceiling.”

Financial markets are likely to start reacting before the date is reached by demanding higher interest rates on U.S. debt, the analysis said. Already, the cost of insurance on U.S. goverment debt has started rising, the center said.

The federal government faces payments of $12 billion for Social Security benefits on Oct. 23, $3 billion for federal employee salaries on Oct. 28, $2 billion to Medicaid providers on Oct. 30 and $6 billion in interest on public debt on Oct. 31.

But bigger payments loom on Nov. 1. The Treasury must pay at least $58 billion on that date -- $25 billion to Social Security recipients, $18 billion to Medicare providers, $12 billion in military and veterans pay and benefits, and $3 billion to recipients of Supplemental Security Income benefits to disabled people.

The large Nov. 1 payments are the reason Halloween is the real debt limit deadline, said Chris Krueger, a senior policy analyst at financial services firm Guggenheim Partners.

Even if the Treasury managed to continue paying all the federal government’s bills after Oct. 17, it would be “highly unlikely” that could continue into November, he said.

Krueger predicted there was a 40% chance the debt limit would not be raised by Lew’s Oct. 17 deadline.

In doing so, he proclaimed that he wanted to push forward with other legislative priorities, including a budget, immigration reform, and the long-stalled pork-laden farm bill.

“[I]n the coming days and weeks, we should sit down and pursue a balanced approach to a responsible budget, a budget that grows our economy faster and shrinks our long-term deficits further,” Obama stated. Historically, “balanced” has been code for tax increases.

Obama then pushed on to immigration reform: “Number two. We should finish the job of fixing our broken immigration system.” Naturally, he blamed the Republican House for stalling his preferred immigration bill.

Finally, Obama called for the farm bill to be passed: “Number three. We should pass a farm bill, one that American farmers and ranchers can depend on, one that protects vulnerable children and adults in times of need, one that gives rural communities opportunities to grow and the long-term certainty that they deserve.” And, disingenuously, he called for negotiations.

On Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) echoed Obama, saying, “I look forward to the next venture, which is making sure we do immigration reform.” On Thursday, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said that Obama wanted immigration reform “more than anything else” during his second term. Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-CA) said that he trusted that Speaker of the House John Boehner (R-OH) would cave on immigration: “Once again, the speaker for the majority party is going to be placed in a position of deciding whether he’s going to put country before party and get something done. We just need a few courageous Republicans to stand up and say they’re ready.”

Republicans, however, pushed back. “It’s not going to happen this year,” said Rep. Raul Labrador (R-ID). “After the way the president acted over the last two or three weeks where he would refuse to talk to the speaker of the House…they’re not going to get immigration reform. That’s done.”

Corporate America worked hard to build massive loopholes into the tax code for itself, and by golly it is working just as hard to keep them.

U.S. companies, along with their lobbyists and trade groups, are treating Washington, D.C., like a big, swampy strip club, showering it with cash in an effort to fight tax reform laws that might put hundreds of billions of dollars back into government coffers. The seamy details of this lobbying effort are found in a new study by the reform advocacy group Public Citizen. It is arguably one of the least-surprising studies in the history of studies, right up there with research confirming that popes tend to wear large hats. But it makes for depressing, eye-opening reading nonetheless.

For one thing, there is the chart that leads off the study, showing how corporate profits have soared to all-time highs as a percentage of U.S. gross domestic product, while corporate taxes are near record lows. (Story continues after Chart Of Anger, courtesy of Public Citizen.)

This state of affairs exists largely because the biggest U.S. corporations have for years lobbied Congress for loopholes that allow them to keep much of their profits out of the clutches of the IRS, including an estimated $1.7 trillion in cash held offshore.

Apple Inc. has been public face of this issue lately, with its CEO Tim Cook hauled before a Senate panel to explain why his company is keeping more than $100 billion offshore. Apple spent $2 million on lobbying last year and could double that this year, Reuters reported recently. The company has managed to avoid paying taxes, in perfectly legal ways, on $74 billion in profits since 2009, according to a recent Senate investigation.

As you may have heard, the U.S. government has found itself in a bit of a fiscal pickle recently and could use some of this cash. That has led some lawmakers to try to find ways to close some of these loopholes. Two bills, the Cut Unjustified Tax Loopholes Act and the Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act, have aimed to do just that. A third bill, the Wall Street Trading and Speculators Tax Act, would slap taxes on some financial transactions -- not a loophole-closing bill, exactly, but one that would help address the fact that the U.S. financial sector currently makes up 30 percent of total corporate profits, but only coughs up 18 percent of total corporate tax revenues to the government.

Some reform-minded groups are lobbying in favor of these bills, notes Public Citizen. But they are being drowned out by the lobbying in the other direction.

Of the 383 lobbyists working over lawmakers on these bills, 331 were from companies or corporate trade groups opposed to them, by Public Citizen's count.

Meanwhile, the companies and groups lobbying on these bills are represented by 46 different political action committees that donated money to lawmakers in the 2012 election cycle, according to Public Citizen. Of that group, 40 PACs represented corporate America and spent $20 million on their favorite candidates. The top three money-donating PACs in this group were the National Association of Realtors, the Credit Union National Association and the American Bankers Association. Individual corporate PACs included AT&T, General Electric, Pfizer and Microsoft.

It's a free country, of course, and companies, like people, have the right to free speech in the form of campaign donations. But all that free speech is expensive, and these companies have a lot more money to make their case than the rest of us taxpayers -- who will almost certainly keep ending up paying the cost."

Consider Fisker Automotive. In August 2009, this wannabe plug-in electric hybrid car company was hard up for cash to pay suppliers and faced potential layoffs.

A green-energy loan was the only hope, Fisker executive Bernhard Koehler explained in an e-mail to the Department of Energy — because it would help bring in private money. “We are oversubscribed in this equity round with the DOE support — and nowhere without it,” Koehler pleaded.

A month later, in September 2009, the Energy Department approved a $529 million low-interest loan. Vice President Biden stood before the proposed site of a Fisker plant in Delaware and described the department’s program as “seed money that will return back to the American consumer in billions and billions and billions of dollars of good new jobs.”

Sure enough, private money started flowing in to Fisker by the tens of millions. Apparently, investors liked the idea of a firm that enjoyed access to cheap government funding.

1 of 50 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Tom Toles goes green View Photos A collection of cartoons about the environment and global warming. Caption A collection of cartoons on the environment and climate change. Wait 1 second to continue.

All told, Fisker attracted $1.1 billion in private investment, the vast majority of which took place after it got the DOE loan.

Alas, government loans could not overcome Fisker’s fundamental problem: no experience mass-producing automobiles, let alone the complex battery-powered luxury cars that it proposed to sell for more than $100,000. Today, the company is nearly bankrupt; taxpayers are on the hook for $171 million, and private investors are probably nearly wiped out. (The story is well told, with documents, at PrivCo.com.)

In other words, that’s more than a billion dollars in capital that can’t create jobs elsewhere in the economy — but might have, if the government had not propped up and promoted Fisker.

A committee of the Republican-majority House is searching for proof that Fisker got its loan because of its political connections. It’s certainly true that the Silicon Valley venture capital (VC) firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers was Fisker’s biggest backer, and that KPCB’s lineup includes such Democratic heavies as John Doerr and Al Gore.

I doubt the committee will find a smoking gun, though. This is a story of self-serving groupthink, not a blatant quid pro quo. Fisker’s fool’s gold took in members of the U.S. elite, from Leonardo DiCaprio to KPCB “strategic limited partner” Colin Powell. For the private investors, Fisker was about getting rich while feeling virtuous. For the Obama administration, it was about doing something for green jobs. The former will be held accountable financially; the latter, politically.

That doesn’t make the Fisker debacle a victimless episode or a disaster only in the sense of opportunity cost. State university endowments and charitable foundations had exposure through KPCB investment funds. The College Illinois fund, a state-run prepaid tuition plan used by 30,000 families, sank $10 million into Fisker. It did so at the urging of Advanced Equities Inc. (AEI), a Chicago-based firm that Fisker paid to raise private capital after the Energy Department loan.

AEI did not enjoy a sterling reputation. A 2008 Forbes article portrayed it as an oft-sued operation, notorious for foisting dubious VC deals on its clientele. An anonymous ex-employee called it “a bucket shop.”

AEI eventually raised more than half of Fisker’s private capital. “They are good at what they do,” Fisker board member (and KPCB partner) Ray Lane, no relation, told the Wall Street Journal. (Through a spokeswoman, Lane declined a request for an interview.)

San Diego businessman Daniel Wray typifies the investors AEI pulled in. He spent $210,000 on preferred shares prior to January 2012 — when AEI told him that his stake would be downgraded to common stock unless he ponied up $84,000 more within a week.

Wray is suing, claiming that AEI took him by surprise — though it must be said that such “pay to play” gambits are not unprecedented in the VC biz, especially in “late-stage” start-ups desperate for cash, as Fisker was in early 2012.

Last September, Advanced Equities paid the Securities and Exchange Commission $1 million to settle fraud charges related to its fundraising for another KPCB-backed green start-up, Bloom Energy. Allegedly, one of AEI’s top officials told would-be investors that the CIA had ordered $2 billion of its fuel cells, which it hadn’t. Advanced Equities shut down last year.

Government can efficiently affect energy usage through fuel taxes and basic research. When it intervenes on behalf of specific technologies and specific companies, however, bad things happen — resource misallocation, windfall-seeking, even, sometimes, corruption. The Fisker debacle proves once again that, in the immortal words of former White House economist Larry Summers, “government is a crappy VC.”

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/04/10/obama-budget-proposes-more-than-1t-in-taxes-fees/,2013-04-10 00:00:00,[],"Obama budget proposes more than $1 trillion in taxes, fees","President Obama's budget proposal includes new tax increases that hit everything from deductions for top earners to packs of cigarettes.

Though the president's newly released plan claims to include $580 billion in new revenue over the next decade, when all taxes and fees are counted the real number is slightly higher than $1 trillion.

Republicans already have said they will not countenance new tax increases, after they already agreed to raise rates on top earners as part of the fiscal crisis deal. But both sides are sure to engage in an exhaustive debate in the weeks and months ahead, particularly as a looming debt-ceiling deadline forces Congress to try to reach a deal.

Here are a few of the notable tax increases in Obama's 2014 budget blueprint that are likely to prove controversial in that debate:

The biggest item by far is a plan to reduce the value of itemized deductions for top earners, so that they can only reduce their tax liability to 28 percent of income. This would affect deductions for charity, mortgage interest and other expenses -- as well as other select preferences for the top 3 percent of families. The change is projected to bring in $529.3 billion over 10 years.

The plan would implement the so-called ""Buffett Rule,"" the tax change named after Warren Buffett that Obama has long sought. The change would require that ""wealthy millionaires"" pay at least 30 percent of their income -- after charity -- in taxes. The White House estimates this would bring in $53.4 billion.

Though the president's proposal to curb the growth of Social Security was touted as a budget ""cut,"" the change would also bring in more revenue. The proposal would change the inflation formula, which would in turn curb the growth of benefits. In doing so, that same formula would adjust tax brackets and raise about $100 billion over 10 years.

Buried deep in the budget is a proposal to raise the federal cigarette tax by 94 cents a pack. The hike is projected to raise $78 billion, to pay for an early childhood education program. The federal tax per pack would go from $1.01 to $1.95. ""In addition to financing important investments in early learning, the proposed tobacco tax increase would have substantial public health benefits, particularly for young Americans. Researchers have found that raising taxes on cigarettes significantly,"" the budget document said.

The budget includes a slew of other tax changes and fees too numerous to mention, but they include: a ""financial crisis responsibility fee"" on financial firms that is projected to raise $59.3 billion; an increase in the aviation passenger security fee projected to raise $18 billion; and a limit on the total accrual of certain retirement benefits projected to raise $9.3 billion.

Though Obama is pushing Republicans further than they want to go on taxes, he claimed Wednesday that he's meeting them ""more than halfway"" -- considering separate spending cuts and changes to entitlements.

""If you're serious about deficit reduction, then there's no excuse to keep these loopholes open,"" he said.

But Republicans argued Wednesday that Obama should not hold those entitlement changes ""hostage"" to calls for tax increases.

House Republican Leader Eric Cantor urged Obama to drop the call for tax increases and work together with Republicans on entitlements.

Republicans also complained that, despite $1.8 trillion in claimed deficit reduction, the budget would still not balance under the president's plan."

So what do our representatives in Congress plan to do about it? Take a two-week break. Are they trying to see whether their abysmal 13% approval rating can sink any lower?

I get it. Spring break shouldn’t just be for students. Adults work hard too. But usually, a “break” follows a period of “work.” And not much can be said of the 113th Congress’ accomplishments so far.

Indeed, it has been more than two years since the president’s bipartisan fiscal commission declared a so-called moment of truth: “We cannot play games or put off hard choices any longer.” Yet that is exactly what Washington has done and continues to do.

It kicked the can down the road after the fiscal commission made its recommendations in 2010. Then, in 2011, when the nation came to the brink of defaulting on its obligations over battles about raising the debt ceiling, President Obama and Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) struck a narrow deal on spending cuts but punted the tough budget choices to a congressional committee.

After just a few months, this committee announced it couldn’t reach an agreement and set the clock ticking on the across-the-board cuts known as the sequester. Most recently, when confronting the “fiscal cliff” of scheduled tax increases and spending reductions, Washington once again did the bare minimum, raising tax rates on the wealthy and letting the sequester take effect.

We recently pushed back another debt ceiling deadline without addressing the underlying problem of unsustainable deficits remains unsolved. Yet Congress is scheduled to be out of session for nine weeks over the next five months. And even when it’s supposed to be in session during that period, the House isn’t scheduled to meet for a full five-day workweek.

Although Washington has managed to enact several trillion dollars in deficit reduction as the country lurched from one unnecessary crisis to the next, the job is far from finished and the most important issues remain untouched. To set a sustainable financial course for the country, Congress and the president must replace the sequester with a larger and more generationally balanced deficit reduction agreement of at least $2.4 trillion that couples meaningful changes in entitlements with pro-growth tax reform.

Wisconsin Republican Paul Ryan of the House Budget Committee and Washington Democrat Patty Murray of the Senate Budget Committee, to their credit, each released proposed budgets that recognize the need for reducing the deficit. But neither proposal has a chance of winning support from the other party, and they each tackle only half the problem. Ryan’s budget, for example, doesn’t ask for a dime in revenue increases, while Murray’s budget doesn’t go nearly far enough in achieving savings from entitlements.

Instead of going their separate ways home, lawmakers should stay together in Washington, find common ground and get a real deal done. John Hilley, who helped strike a balanced budget with a Republican Congress as President Clinton’s legislative affairs director in 1997, nailed it when he wrote: “Bipartisanship is not the absence of partisanship; it is partisans coming together to reconcile their competing political and policy objectives.” What we need is some true bipartisanship.

Both parties have bridged the gap before, and it’s time to do it again. That will require, as did the 1997 deal, a number of elements: commitment to a common goal, open communication between all stakeholders, an understanding of what each side needs out of an agreement and, perhaps most important, leaders who can put the country’s interests ahead of their own.

For any of that to happen, though, legislators will have to be in the same place.

Until a deal is reached that addresses the nation’s mounting debt, lawmakers should stay in Washington, hunker down and figure it out. No more trips, breaks, vacations, recesses, “constituent work weeks” or whatever you want to call them. They should just do what we elected them to do: legislate.

The 16-day government shutdown took a $24 billion chunk out of the U.S. economy, according to an initial analysis from Standard & Poor's.

As a result, the rating agency projects that the U.S. economy will grow 2.4% in the fourth quarter -- as opposed to the roughly 3% growth rate predicted prior to the shutdown.

""Because it's happening all at once, so quick, so fast, unplanned; it's going to hurt,"" said Beth Ann Bovino, U.S. chief economist at S&P. ""We can absorb it, but it still hurts.""

Hundreds of thousands of federal workers were furloughed during the shutdown, but that was just one of the widespread effects of the first shutdown in nearly two decades.

Federal contractors also furloughed thousands of employees.

Small businesses reeled from frozen government contracts and stalled business loans.

Closed national parks hit the tourism industry.

Military families saw childcare and other services shuttered.

Consumers, also scared by the debate over raising the debt ceiling, started to cut back.

While federal workers will ultimately receive back pay under the deal, contractors will likely not get their lost wages, Bovino said. And with the deal only guaranteeing government funding through Jan. 15, many federal workers and contractors may continue to hold back on spending into the holiday shopping season.

""That's going to keep people a little more cautious, particularly government workers and certainly contractors,"" she said ""It certainly suggests a ho-hum holiday.""

The debt fix is also only temporary, which could continue to fuel economic uncertainty, hurting consumer confidence and slowing hiring, said Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody's Analytics.

Dionne: Boehner’s House implodes over flawed farm bill,"The roof fell in on John Boehner’s House of Representatives last week. The Republican leadership’s humiliating defeat on a deeply flawed and inhumane farm bill was as clear a lesson as we’ll get about the real causes of dysfunction in the nation’s capital.

Our ability to govern ourselves is being brought low by a witches’ brew of right-wing ideology, a shockingly cruel attitude toward the poor on the part of the Republican majority, and the speaker’s incoherence when it comes to his need for Democratic votes to pass bills.

Boehner is unwilling to put together broad bipartisan coalitions to pass middle-ground legislation except when he is pressed to the wall. Yet he and his lieutenants tried to blame last Thursday’s farm legislation fiasco — the product of a massive repudiation by GOP conservatives of their high command — on the Democrats’ failure to hand over enough votes.

He seemed to think he could freely pander to the desire of right-wing members of his caucus to throw millions of low-income Americans off the food stamp program . When that didn’t produce enough votes, he then expected Democrats to support a measure that most of them rightly regarded as immoral. In the end, the bill went down 234to 195, with 62 Republicans voting no and 24 Democrats voting yes — more help, by the way, than Nancy Pelosi usually got from Republicans when she was speaker.

Boehner can’t have it both ways, and he should be called out if he lets his party’s disarray throw the nation into an entirely unnecessary debt-ceiling crisis this fall. The country shouldn’t be held hostage because of Republican chaos.

Start with the food stamp cuts, and let’s remember that this program is a monument to bipartisanship. The current form of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is, in large part, the product of an unlikely alliance between former Sens. Bob Dole and George McGovern in the 1970s. They were far apart ideologically, but both were horrified that too many Americans were going without nourishment. Food stamps have been an enormous success in curbing hunger in our rich nation, while also serving as a powerful stimulus to economic recovery during hard times.

The bill the House voted down would have cut food stamps by $20.5 billion, eliminating food assistance to nearly 2 million low-income people, most of them senior citizens or working families with children.

This alone should have been bad enough to sink the bill. But then Republicans pushed through an amendment by Rep. Steve Southerland (R-Fla.) to toughen work requirements in the program. Work requirements sound reasonable until you look at what Southerland’s amendment was actually designed to do.

As Robert Greenstein, the president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, explained, Southerland’s proposal violated “the most basic standards of human decency” because it made no effort, as other work requirements have in the past, to create employment openings for those who “want to work and would accept any job or work slot they could get, but cannot find jobs in a weak economy.”

In fact, noted Greenstein, a longtime advocate of nutrition assistance, the amendment barred states “from spending more on SNAP employment and training than they do now.” And it created incentives for states to throw people off food stamps by letting their governments keep half the SNAP savings to use for anything they wished (including, for example, tax cuts for the wealthy).

In a more rational political world, progressives and small-government conservatives might join forces to slash subsidies for agribusiness and wealthy farmers while containing market distortions bred by price supports. But when Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) proposed an amendment to restore some of the food stamp funding by reducing spending on crop insurance, it was defeated.

And Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) exposed hypocrisy on the matter of government handouts by excoriating Republican House members who had benefited from farm subsidies but voted to cut food stamps.

The collapse of the farm bill will generally be played as a political story about Boehner’s failure to rally his own right wing. That’s true as far as it goes and should remind everyone of the current House leadership’s inability to govern. But this is above all a story about morality: There is something profoundly wrong when a legislative majority is so eager to risk leaving so many Americans hungry. That’s what the bill would have done, and why defeating it was a moral imperative.

John McCain.

The dam project, which was approved in 1988, has drastically soared over its original budget of $775 million, and the new bill will raise its funding to nearly $3 billion.

Supporters of the project, called the Olmsted Locks and Dam, say it is necessary to reduce bottlenecking at the crossing of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. Despite being approved over 20 years ago, the project is still described as “under construction between Illinois and Kentucky” on the Army Corps of Engineers’ website.

McCain told Fox News’ Greta Van Susteren Wednesday he had “never even heard of” the project and questioned why it had been included in the bipartisan plan to end the budget crisis.

“They stuck in some stuff which, of course, they couldn’t have gotten through a regular legislative process,” McCain said. “That is disgraceful.”

More On This...

The Senate approved the legislation late Wednesday by an 81-18 vote. The House subsequently followed suit with a 285-144 vote, with 87 Republicans in favor and 144 against. President Obama signed the bill into law early Thursday.

But Sen. Dianne Feinstein, chairwoman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, tells Fox News she put the dam funding in the budget deal because ""there is no money” to fund the project otherwise. The House previously approved $1.7 billion for the project.

Feinstein, D-Calif., says if the dam was not funded, all barge traffic, a significant source of commerce on the Ohio River, would be suspended. She says the funding was included in the budget bill because it is the only spending bill moving.

“It's a series of locks on a dam. If it isn't funded, it shuts down,” Feinstein said. “It's in the public good.”

Still, the inclusion of the funding could inflame tensions on the Hill over spending, and signal that Washington's habits of slipping in local favors in must-pass bills die hard.

McCain said that the dam project and other measures were indeed added in without warning.

“We didn’t find about these small anomalies until about two hours ago,” he said on Fox News.

Steve Ellis, of Taxpayers for Common Sense, criticized the appropriation as ""parochial pork,"" noting that the amount approved is well above the House-approved level of $1.7 billion.

“While this could be considered business as usual, it is shocking that with the country teetering on the edge of default a lawmaker would try to pull a fast one on the American people,"" he said in an email statement.

http://news.yahoo.com/tea-party-targeting-southern-co-power-monopoly-144330621.html,,[],Tea party targeting Southern Co. power monopoly,"ATLANTA (AP) — The Southern Co. makes billion-dollar decisions that affect millions of people in Georgia, yet it has attracted little political scrutiny — until now.

Leaders of the Atlanta Tea Party are challenging Southern Co. subsidiary Georgia Power over the monopoly's reluctance to increase its use of solar power, the ballooning costs of building a new nuclear power plant and even its legal right to monopoly status.

The group's action in Georgia seems relatively rare among the loosely linked tea party organizations nationally.

Other tea party groups have condemned the adoption of ""smart"" utility meters — which transmit information about customer usage — due to concerns that they would intrude on customers' privacy, or have broadly backed less reliance on foreign energy. But relatively few have endorsed so specific an energy platform in their own backyards, much less promised to campaign on it.

""It certainly isn't anything personal, but one of our core values is promoting the free-market system,"" said Julianne Thompson, a co-founder of the Atlanta Tea Party.

The electricity market in Georgia is not a free market. State law gives electric utilities, including Georgia Power, exclusive rights to serve customers in designated areas of the state. Most customers cannot choose their provider.

While monopolies have more power to charge higher prices than firms in competitive markets, there are times when it makes sense to allow them if their prices are regulated.

It would be more expensive to build more than one system of electric wires or natural gas pipelines to deliver power and fuel to every home in a state. Customers are better off if just one system is built and maintained, as long as the company that runs the system is prohibited by regulators from using its monopoly power to drive up prices.

In many states, including Texas and most of the Northeast, power delivery is regulated, but customers can choose who provides their electricity. Customers in those states can choose from companies that provide such options as renewable power or a slate of pricing options, including fixed rates, rates that vary with market fluctuations, or rates that vary based on when during the day power is used.

Story continues

Georgia Power makes a natural political foil for the tea party. A 2011 poll conducted by Yale University and George Mason University found that tea party members were far more likely than Democrats, Republicans or independents to distrust central authority and strongly opposed energy policies that raise costs, even if there are other benefits.

Yale University researcher Anthony Leiserowitz, who worked on the poll, said he was not surprised local tea party supporters might challenge a monopoly.

""That totally taps into that same sense that there are these big, institutional forces against which you're a little guy and you need to rebel,"" he said.

Utility officials say they welcome the involvement of tea party groups.

""We listen carefully to the concerns and ideas of the Tea Party, as well as all other organizations that represent the diverse opinions of Georgians,"" company spokesman Jacob Hawkins said in a statement.

The tea party locally has proved successful at getting its supporters to pressure Georgia's leaders into action. Thompson's group was part of a coalition that leaned on reluctant Republicans to pass limits on Statehouse lobbying, and they are working on a voter identification and education project ahead of the 2014 elections to increase their clout and boost turnout.

Earlier this month, Debbie Dooley, another co-founder of the Atlanta Tea Party, urged the state's elected utility regulators on the Public Service Commission, all Republicans, to force Georgia Power to use more solar energy. The commission is currently debating whether to approve Georgia Power's latest plan for meeting the state's long-term energy needs.

Dooley actually wants to go much further. She says if her organization viewed it as politically possible, it would support repealing a law granting monopoly rights to utilities.

""They can protect their business and say, 'We don't want the competition.' They have veto power,"" Dooley said. ""It would be like Wal-Mart saying, 'Hey we don't want Kmart here. We don't want them to build.'""

Dooley personally endorsed a Libertarian challenger against Commissioner Stan Wise, a Republican who she said had gotten too close to Georgia Power.

But Wise said he questions how many people Dooley actually represents, and he doubts the solar projects she champions are economical.

""I just almost have to think it's a kneejerk reaction that says if it's solar, it has to be good,"" Wise said. ""And they haven't done their homework on this extraordinary level of subsidy that this program brings to the table.""

The tea party groups are also targeting Georgia Power over the rising cost to build two new nuclear reactors at Plant Vogtle. The utility's share of the project was supposed to cost $6.1 billion, but Georgia Power is seeking permission to raise its budget to $6.85 billion — and cautioned that costs may still increase.

Dooley's group is particularly peeved that Georgia lawmakers are allowing the utility to charge its customers for the project's finance costs before it produces power. This year, tea party members supported legislation from Rep. Jeff Chapman, R-Brunswick, that would trim the utility's profits if it goes over budget building the plant. Chapman's bill did not pass, though it could be considered next year.

Georgia Power argues the plant makes economic sense in the long run. The utility says the nuclear plant will be immune to swings in natural gas prices and will not be affected by limits on carbon emissions if they are enacted in the years to come.

Dooley said she supports nuclear power but wants more accountability. Under state law, Georgia Power's customers must pay for the nuclear plant unless regulators find its costs were unreasonable.

""They are guaranteed to make a profit on the cost overruns,"" Dooley said. ""What incentive is there to come in on budget, on time?""

Can we have 50 more like her, please?","Elizabeth Warren, who by Senate tradition ought to be a meek, eyes-down freshman, turned in another stellar performance Wednesday at a Banking Committee hearing with Treasury Secretary Jack Lew in the hot seat.

Warren began by asking whether Treasury had changed its views on banks that were judged ""too big to fail"" back in 2008 since four of these institutions have grown 30 percent since then. “When we see the largest financial institutions getting bigger and bigger… it tells us that we are clearly not on the path to resolving too big to fail,” she said. She asked Lew:



“How big do the biggest banks have to get before we consider breaking them up? Do they have to double in size? Triple in size? Quadruple in size?”

Lew said it would not be a good idea to enact any new measures until Dodd-Frank, the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, is fully implemented. That law will have its third birthday in July. You can see the exchange below and a somewhat longer version here

The four banks Warren was speaking of are JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo. They're nearly $2 trillion larger now than they were when the financial crisis struck. With assets of $7.8 trillion, their combined assets are half the size of the entire U.S. economy and the banks hold more than half of America's $7 trillion in deposits.

In April, Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Republican Sen. David Vitter introduced a too-big-to-fail bill that would impose capital restrictions on banks as a proportion of the assets. For community and mid-sized banks, that would be eight percent. For the giants of $500 billion or more in assets, 15 percent. Subsidiaries and affiliates of banks would have to be separately capitalized.

In addition, the bill would limit the government's safety net to traditional banking operations not the risky investment practices that led to federal bailouts. At the same time, the bill would reduce regulations on community banks.

The Independent Community Bankers of America support the Brown-Vitter bill as do some current U.S. regulators. Not surprisingly, the bill is under attack by the usual suspects."

Dionne: In budget debate, Republicans are stalling Obama","The deficit that should concern us most right now has to do with time, not money. Money can be recouped. Time just disappears.

And time is what Washington is wasting on an utterly artificial crisis, driven not by economics but by ideology, partisan interest and an obsession over a word — “sequester” — that means nothing to most Americans.

Here is the most important thing about the battle raging in the capital over $85 billion in automatic spending cuts: Republicans are losing the argument but winning the time war.

The more time we spend on pointless disputes about budget cuts no one is expected to make soon, the less we spend trying to solve the problems that confront us today — and, God forbid, thinking about the future.

The 2012 election gave President Obama new authority and new energy. Republicans want to place as much distance between themselves and that election as they possibly can. From their perspective, the more months we fritter away on these dumb, fake emergencies, the better. As Obama’s clout slowly diminishes, so will his opportunities to press his priorities.

If Washington can be kept in a state of partisan paralysis, Republicans stand to gain more. The voters hoped that by settling certain questions in 2012, they could push the politicians toward problem-solving. Some Republicans, in their heart of hearts, even want this to happen. But if gridlock retains its icy grip on government, the president will ultimately suffer because it is members of his constituency who will be most demoralized by the failure of their votes to change anything.

The confrontation over the sequester should be seen for what it is: a hangover from a different period, when a different political majority was temporarily ascendant. In 2011, Obama was fighting for his political life. Republicans had just seized the House and cut into the Democrats’ majority in the Senate.

The debt-ceiling clash was the product of that midterm election and of a victorious tea party that made slashing federal spending the one and only priority. The sequester was a temporary way out of the impasse that political moment created. Both sides agreed to a package of cuts in domestic and military spending assumed to be so unpalatable that eventually the contending parties would come to their senses and make a deal.

As a short-term measure, it was brilliant, particularly for the president. He got the debt-ceiling issue behind him and was free to wage a campaign in which he took on the tea party’s view frontally and defeated it. His party also gained Senate seats, and Republicans held the House (we should always remember this) only by virtue of skewed congressional districts and the concentration of Democratic votes in large metropolitan areas.

But now, the sequester is allowing the tea party’s ghost to haunt Washington. It is as if the election never happened. We are back to exactly the same deficit conversations we were having in 2010 and 2011. We are not pondering ways of helping the economy to grow faster, or how we might reduce joblessness, or how we can usefully invest in the future. We are not discussing what to do about deepening economic inequality.

No, the earlier story line is extended as if 2012 never happened. The return of Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles to Washington’s public stage this week was a reminder that we are trapped in the same old play with the same characters and the same themes.

On the merits, Obama has public opinion in his corner. His proposal to avoid the economic drag of the sequester with a reasonable amount of deficit reduction built on a mix of spending cuts and revenue increases through tax reform occupies the debate’s broad middle ground. If the GOP wanted, based on its past positions, it could take a deal of this sort and declare victory, given all the cuts that have already passed.

But that is not the victory the Republicans seek. The sequester game is a contest in which their side wins simply by running out the clock, no matter what the score is. Thus, Obama can’t just score points. He needs to figure out how to end this game so he can play the one he promised us when he said his reelection could “break the fever” in Washington. Alas, it has not broken yet.

USA TODAY

President Obama to meet with Democratic and Republican caucuses in coming days

The first session is Wednesday with House Democrats

WASHINGTON — President Obama plans to meet with House Republicans on Thursday, but the two sides are already clashing over the guest list.

An aide to House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said he is sending only an 18-member delegation to the White House because a smaller meeting has a better chance of resolving disputes over the government shutdown and debt ceiling.

White House spokesman Jay Carney said Obama is ""disappointed"" that Boehner is ""preventing"" all 233 House Republicans from attending.

""The president thought it was important to talk directly with the members who forced this economic crisis on the country about how the shutdown and a failure to pay the country's bills could devastate the economy,"" Carney said.

Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck said that ""nine days into a government shutdown and a week away from breaching the debt ceiling, a meeting is only worthwhile if it is focused on finding a solution -- that's why the House Republican Conference will instead be represented by a smaller group of negotiators, including the elected leadership and certain committee chairmen.""

Many House Republicans are insisting that a new spending plan, or an increase in the debt ceiling, include a delay of the Obama health care law, a provision the president opposes.

Obama also met late Wednesday with members of the House Democratic caucus about the ongoing government shutdown and the prospect of a debt ceiling default.

House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said Obama emphasized he is open to any discussion about the budget -- once the government is re-opened.

""We can talk when the government is open,"" Hoyer said. ""The government doesn't need to be shut.""

The president will also meet with Senate Democrats on Thursday, and Senate Republicans later in the week.

""This is about the president meeting with as many members of Congress as he can to talk about these very important issues and the need to make sure that we don't inflict severe damage on our economy and on our middle class unnecessarily,"" Carney said.

In recent days, Obama has refused House Republican requests to negotiate a new spending plan that would end the government shutdown and include a delay of the health care plan.

Obama is also refusing to negotiate on the need to raise the $16.7 trillion debt, which the Treasury Department expects to breach on Oct. 17, a week from Thursday.

The debt ceiling gives the government authority to borrow money to pay the nation's debts. Without an increase, the government faces a default that Obama says will create an ""economic shutdown."""

He Has Been With The Los Angeles Times Since', 'Covering Technology News Before Joining The Opinion Section.']",Harry Reid’s deficit plan: It’s still about higher taxes,"Who says congressional Democrats aren’t trying to cut spending? Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) seems determined to chop discretionary budgets by more than $100 billion this year, regardless of what economists (and the unemployment rate) may suggest about the fragility of the recovery.

Granted, it’s not that Reid is calling for the cuts to go into effect on March 1, as currently scheduled. In fact, he says the opposite. But the alternatives that Reid and House Democrats are floating are such political nonstarters, it’s hard to imagine anything else happening.

As part of the 2011 debt-ceiling deal, Congress agreed to reduce projected deficits by more than $2 trillion over the subsequent 10 years. About half of that was implemented right away through lower spending caps; a special committee was created to come up with a plan for saving an additional $1.2 trillion. If the committee failed -- which it did, predictably -- the savings were to be achieved through annual across-the-board spending cuts, starting Jan. 1, 2013.

Congress agreed in early January to postpone the cuts until March, and few people on Capitol Hill like the idea of an across-the-board haircut in defense and discretionary programs. Nevertheless, there’s a gulf between the GOP’s proposed changes and the Democrats’ desires. The former want to spare the Defense Department but keep the total amount of cuts and the timetable for making them the same. The latter don’t seem to mind the idea of a smaller Defense Department, but they don’t think now’s the right time to be pulling federal dollars out of the economy.

On ABC’s “This Week” broadcast Sunday, Reid said: “We need to keep our eye on the prize and continue doing something about spending, but I think that what we need to do is do some of the things that Mitt Romney talked about. He said there’s some low-hanging fruit; there are a lot of tax loopholes that should be closed. I agree with him. We haven’t done that.”

That may be the nicest thing Reid has ever said publicly about Romney. He went on to point to the usual Democratic litany of loopholes that need closing: subsidies for the oil and gas industries, tax breaks for companies that move jobs overseas, deductions for corporate jets. That’s all small beer, and as host George Stephanopoulos pointed out, Republicans just agreed to let almost $700 billion worth of tax cuts expire. They’re not willing to go back to the revenue well.

To which Reid replied: “George, the American people are on our side. The American people don’t believe in these austere things. We believe that the rich should contribute. We believe we should fill those tax loopholes, get rid of them, I should say. And that’s where we need to go.” He added that defense cuts have to be included in any deal regarding the March 1 “sequester” because the Pentagon has largely been spared in prior reductions.

Just to be clear, Stephanopoulos asked, was Reid saying that higher taxes would have to be included in a deal to settle “any one” of the three big fiscal battles to come (the sequester, funding the government for the second half of the fiscal year and raising the debt limit again)? “Yes, the answer is definitely yes,” Reid said, adding, “And I’ve got a pretty good fan base for that: the American people, Republicans, Democrats and independents.”

Advertisement

That just settles it, huh? It’s a negotiating tactic, to be sure, but Reid’s stance suggests the talks with Republicans will go nowhere.

Then, on Monday, House Democrats put forward an actual legislative proposal to replace the March 1 spending cuts with ... higher taxes on oil and gas companies, a minimum tax on millionaires and billionaires, and lower farm subsidies.

Democrats sound like the party of One Note Johnny, whose solution to every fiscal problem is higher taxes on big corporations, agribusinesses and wealthy Americans. To maintain a shred of credibility, the party needs to take a cue from the Senate’s “Gang of Six” or the Democrats who supported the deficit-reduction plan laid out by Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson. As much as they talk about a balanced approach to shoring up Washington’s finances, they never seem to offer anything that meets the description.

This is not to say they’re wrong about the timing of the cuts to come. But it’s long past time for lawmakers to agree to a plan to bring the deficit under control.

Advertisement

And House Republicans deserve no plaudits either. They’re pushing a bill called the Require a PLAN Act -- PLAN standing for the Require Presidential Leadership and No Deficit Act. Yes, that spells PLAND, not PLAN, and the proposal is every bit as brain dead as whoever botched the acronym.

The measure would require President Obama to do something House Republicans have never done themselves, which is to propose a budget that would eliminate the deficit within 10 years. If Obama’s first submission didn’t do it, he’d have until April 1 to submit a revised one that did, including an explanation of the policy changes that would lead to balance.

Advertisement

Of course, Congress routinely disregards the policy proposals in presidential budgets. More important, Congress, not the White House, controls the government’s purse strings. Congress approves the spending bills, tax laws and benefit programs that determine how big a deficit Washington will have each year, if any. The president can veto any of these measures, which gives him a lot of influence. But Congress’ control over the annual appropriations needed to run the government gives it enormous leverage in any negotiations. Obama can’t spend a dime that Congress doesn’t give him.

What Republicans really seem to want here is for Obama to give them some political cover for when they start carving into entitlements. That’s a pipe dream, however. Obama may not have done much to improve the federal government’s finances, but with one exception, he’s expertly avoided getting out in front of the GOP when it comes to entitlement savings.

The exception is the $700 billion-plus that the 2010 healthcare reform law shaved from projected Medicare spending. Republicans have blasted Obama repeatedly for that -- which the public should keep in mind this week when the GOP complains that the president hasn’t done anything to rein in out-of-control entitlements.

(CNN) —

When others dismissed Detroit as a falling knife unworthy of investment, David Egner saw something else.

Egner imagined Detroit regenerating from within, with damaged civic tissue repairing itself to foster new life and commerce. As president of a foundation named for a patriarch who emigrated to Michigan 130 years ago and immediately launched a business, he was in a position to test his idea.

The secret, Egner figured, is harnessing the collective power of what he calls “anchor institutions”: in this case, Wayne State University, Henry Ford Health System and Detroit Medical Center.

Through what emerged as the Midtown Project, Egner’s Hudson-Webber Foundation, alongside other funders, is finding ways to hitch the fortunes of these institutions to the fortunes of the surrounding neighborhoods.

Hudson-Webber’s research partner, Omar Blaik from U3 Ventures, compiled the data that confirmed the hunch: The anchor institutions carry breathtaking heft.

At a moment when the City of Detroit has been declared insolvent and foundations are looking for innovation, the approach carries two critical lessons for community development.

First, investors must build from assets, not deficits.

Many foundations like to use quality-of-life indicators to guide their philanthropy. I have been involved in a number of these efforts over the years, and too often, foundations find it irresistible to direct their charitable giving to whatever problem tops the charts. It feels like the right approach; if dropout rates emerge as the worst problem in a neighborhood, why not tackle it?

Problem is, whether the needle moves on this indicator or not, the approach is unlikely to contribute to broader neighborhood transformation.

Hudson-Webber’s method reveals the potential of another kind of analysis, one that is based on the untapped power of existing assets.

It turns out Wayne State, Henry Ford and Detroit Medical employ about 30,000 people, hire 3,300 associates every year, enroll 32,000 students, control about half of Midtown’s real estate and – perhaps most important – spend about $1.7 billion every year on goods and services.

Blaik found that about 4.5% of the $1.7 million in spending on goods and services was going to Detroit vendors; the rest is what Blaik calls leakage. If Detroit businesses could step up to provide quality goods and services at the right price – this is a business play, not charity – then even small upward ticks would represent enormous amounts of investment and, in turn, jobs.

Midtown Detroit Inc. organized vendor fairs to introduce local businesses to the big institutions and made sure local businesses got to see all the requests for proposals coming from the anchors.

As a result, a local bakery, a local print shop and a local construction firm were among the firms winning $20 million in business from the anchor institutions. The contracts created jobs for area residents and enabled the small businesses to ratchet up their capacity.

The successes point to the second critical lesson for foundations: Instead of limiting themselves to traditional charitable gifts – building a playground, offering scholarships to deserving high school students – the approach strengthens the connections between neighborhood residents and the marketplace.

By aligning work force training with the needs of the anchors, the Midtown Project has placed 50 local residents in entry-level jobs. Once up to full speed, Susan Mosey of Midtown Detroit believes, the arrangement can place 200 residents a year into jobs.

Midtown Detroit Inc. is also rebuilding a strong neighborhood residential core. Incentives to lure renters and buyers have drawn more than 1,000 residents to the neighborhood.

While the experiments are ongoing, the results are promising. Post-Great Recession, cities had to find new approaches to revive neighborhoods. It’s not enough to build low-cost housing, says Bruce Katz, founder of the Brookings Institution’s Metropolitan Policy Program, and there is no massive investment coming from the federal government.

“The cavalry is not coming,” said Katz, who describes local innovations from across the country in a new book, “The Metropolitan Revolution: How Cities and Metros Are Fixing Our Broken Politics and Fragile Economy.”

Cities cannot wait for old programs to return, Katz says. They are not coming back.

Instead, cities should build from whatever assets they have at hand and make a new kind of business case for investment, from within and without.

U3 Ventures’ Blaik believes that focusing on anchor institutions forces a discipline that prevents wishful thinking. Foundations, with their government and private-sector partners, can base expectations on the realities of supply and demand for hiring, business activity and residential growth.

In the end, anchor institutions may present the best hope for neighborhood transformation simply because of their scale. When it comes to sources of employment, investment and connectivity, the scale and power of the Midtown Detroit anchors dwarfs anything a foundation could sustain.

Even better: Instead of assuming residents need a handout, the approach gives residents an opening to participate in capitalism.

Show me one Republican who got elected on that platform. Spare America the Orwellian word games. If the government is taking money out of your pocket to fund its growing Big Brother operations, it’s a tax. Whether money is taken from you via your phone bill, your airline ticket, or your income, it’s a tax. If politicians can’t be honest about this, it’s time to go home.

The TEA Party’s very acronym stands for “Taxed Enough Already.” We sent these politicians to Congress in an historic landslide election in 2010 with a mandate to stop the runaway spending train bankrupting our nation, not to wave to it from the station or – heaven forbid – increase its speed. And yet, here we are still pretending that there are no real world consequences to running up near trillion dollar deficits year after year with no end in sight.

So, where does this leave us? We can sit back and accept the increased spending “Compromised Plan” with increases in taxes and spending, or we can charge ahead to at least preserve the very modest Sequester cuts American workers already fought for. If we go with the first option, we simply kick the can down the road yet again and wait for the inevitable real world consequences of bankruptcy (see Detroit for an example of what’s in store). Or we can go with the second option and probably get clobbered by the media (so what’s new?!).

The Political Establishment will no doubt tell us that a budget battle will distract us from the fight against Obamacare. But that excuse is just the latest variation in the Establishment’s old canard that they’re keeping their powder dry for the next big battle which never seems to materialize because they’re always too busy waving the white flag and following the path of least resistance until election day.

Enough is enough!

Here’s the deal, folks. The media will clobber us no matter what. We do not want more taxes. We want Congress to rein in spending and live within its means. (What’s so radical about that?!) Americans have gotten quite an education recently in wasteful government spending as we’ve all seen how the federal government can blow a billion dollars on a website that doesn’t work.

Do these members of Congress really think they can justify every tax dollar they spend and still demand more from hard working Americans by increasing our taxes?

2014 is just around the corner. If any member of Congress thinks raising taxes and increasing wasteful spending is a winning strategy to run on, then by all means they should vote for the Ryan budget. We’ll be watching."

Before Joining The Post', 'She Was A Political Columnist', 'Food Writer At The Baltimore Sun', 'She Has Also Worked For The Associated Press', 'The Fort Worth Star-Telegram', 'The Hartford Courant.']",McDonnell proposes eliminating Virginia’s gas tax,"Gov. Robert F. McDonnell proposed Tuesday an ambitious overhaul of how Virginia pays for roads, rail and transit, including eliminating the gas tax and replacing it with an increase in the sales tax.

The overall plan, which would raise an estimated $3.1 billion over five years, also would increase vehicle-registration fees and add an annual $100 charge for drivers of alternative-fuel cars. McDonnell’s proposal calls for a increase in the state’s sales tax from 5 percent to 5.8 percent and projects using $1 billion in Internet sales tax revenue from legislation pending in Congress.

As he enters his last year in office, McDonnell is aiming to solve a problem that has stumped his recent predecessors: getting a tax-averse state to pay for one of the nation’s largest and most congested transportation systems — one that will run out of money by 2017.

The term-limited Republican ran for office promising not to raise taxes, but he said Tuesday that new revenue must be part of the solution. His plan also calls for devoting a greater share of existing state money to transportation.

An increase in the sales tax could be a hard sell, especially in the GOP-dominated House of Delegates, whose members are all up for reelection this year. And Democrats oppose any shifting of existing money that would affect services such as education.

“We simply cannot continue to do what we have always done and expect this problem to go away,” McDonnell said. “If we stick to the old means of funding transportation, we will find ourselves having the same debates and facing the same revenue shortfalls over and over again.”

With more cars getting better mileage or using alternative fuels, he said, the flat, per-gallon gas tax no longer brings in enough money to bankroll “a safe, efficient and sustainable transportation network.”

The General Assembly is expected to take up the plan during this year’s legislative session, which begins Wednesday. If it passes, Virginia would become the first state in the country to get rid of its gas tax.

Roads are particularly congested in Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads, and planning and transportation experts have said those transportation woes threaten to stall the commonwealth’s economy.

In making his pitch, McDonnell linked his transportation plan to the state’s growth. He said that the gas tax is outdated and that although it is the largest source of maintenance funding, it does not generate enough revenue to cover the costs.

Sen. Timothy M. Kaine (D), McDonnell’s immediate predecessor, tried to solve the problem by creating regional transportation authorities to impose taxes and fees. That fix fell apart after the Virginia Supreme Court ruled in 2008 that the authorities would be unconstitutional. Before that, under then-Gov. Mark R. Warner (D), voters rejected a transportation referendum that would have levied an additional 0.5-cent sales tax on eastern and Northern Virginia to fund $5 billion in regional projects over 20 years.

McDonnell’s plan, based largely on a bill proposed by Del. Timothy D. Hugo (R-Fairfax), would maintain the 17.5-cent gas tax on diesel fuel; motorists would still have to pay the federal 18.4-cent-per-gallon levy on gas. Hugo will co-sponsor the governor’s bill in the House along with Speaker William J. Howell (R-Stafford).

Long viewed among states as a reliable source of revenue, the gas tax has brought in less money in recent years because of improved fuel efficiency and the advent of alternative-fuel vehicles. Virginia has not adjusted its gas tax for inflation in decades, leading to flat revenue, but the sales tax has continued to generate more money for state coffers. (The gas tax in Maryland and the District is 23.5 cents per gallon for regular fuel.)

Virginia is one of 27 states to tax alternative-fuel vehicles as a source of revenue for transportation improvements, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Several states also charge a flat fee, rather than a sales tax, to operate a vehicle powered by alternative fuels.

Some anti-tax advocates are balking at McDonnell’s measure. Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, said the plan “fails in its goal to prioritize transportation spending while avoiding tax increases.”

Norquist weighed in on Virginia’s transportation problem last month, warning legislators that “indexing” the gas tax to inflation — an idea McDonnell floated — would violate the anti-tax pledge they signed. On Tuesday, Norquist called for McDonnell to lower the sales tax increase, include diesel fuel in the elimination of the gas tax, nix his proposed $15 increase in vehicle-registration fees and direct more general-fund revenue toward infrastructure.

As legislators learned the details of the plan before the legislative session, which will be followed by a busy campaign season, it was unclear how politically viable the plan might be. Del. Benjamin L. Cline (R-Rockbridge), who co-chairs the legislature’s conservative caucus, said in a statement that he is ready to work with the governor but wants a “revenue-neutral” approach.

Howell was skeptical just weeks ago that lawmakers could tackle transportation this session but is now pushing the bill.

“The discussion opened up on transportation not that long ago,” he said Tuesday. “I was dubious about being able to put it together. But there’s been a lot of meetings, a lot of people meeting together, thrashing things out, and I think we’ve got a good package.” He added: “The gasoline tax, I’ve always felt was a dinosaur tax. It’s a tax that’s losing its value every year.”

But Del. Vivian E. Watts (D-Fairfax), a former state transportation secretary who attended the governor’s announcement, said the plan does not include enough money, particularly for construction. She said the state needs to pump about $1 billion a year into transportation.

“This package significantly shifts the burden of paying for our transportation needs to the backs of just Virginia residents and lets the interstate driver off the hook,” Watts said, noting that the state wouldn’t receive revenue from drivers who just fill up in the commonwealth.

McDonnell’s plan assumes $1 billion in Internet sales tax revenue over five years, contingent on federal legislation being approved. Legislation that would give states the authority to make online retailers collect sales taxes has not progressed, despite bipartisan coalitions of support on Capitol Hill and among governors. One measure, the Marketplace Fairness Act, is also backed by Amazon, Best Buy and several other major Web merchants.

“We are hopeful it’s going to go further this time,” said David French, senior vice president of government relations at the National Retail Federation, which backs the effort. One possibility, he said, is that an online sales tax measure could move this year as part of a broader tax reform effort.

Despite the criticism, Robert Puentes of the Brookings Institution called McDonnell’s plan “bold.” “The proposal to get rid of the state gasoline tax is unprecedented, that’s for sure,” he said. “It seems like it would take much longer [to get done] than the time he has left. There’s a lot to chew on.”

Now, the Pentagon is being forced to live with less in a new era of fiscal austerity.

With the Iraq war over and troops coming home from Afghanistan, the military budget must be reduced. The question is whether we can be smart about it. The across-the-board approach dictated by the budget reductions known as the sequester — rapid, steep, indiscriminate cuts to both bloated programs and essential ones — is the wrong way to go, causing chaos and turmoil in defense planning. Commanders say the sequester has already affected military readiness.

The Pentagon’s base budget was cut $37.2 billion in April as a result of the sequester. Barring a compromise deal between Republicans and Democrats, the Pentagon will face an additional $52 billion cut in January, bringing the total budget for 2014 down to about $475 billion. Through 2023, the cumulative defense cuts could amount to more than $1 trillion, including the reductions already made.

Reality is sinking in. It was startling, for instance, to see that the Air Force told The Wall Street Journal that it is now determined to build a new long-range bomber, a replacement for the storied B-52s and B-1s, on a “budget.” The Journal reported that an Air Force manager for the $55 billion project killed a $300,000 kitchenette for the plane because the feature was too expensive. Meanwhile, the Navy has pledged to cut the costs of building the next aircraft carrier, the John F. Kennedy, by $1.2 billion."

There has been a slight uptick in population. But a crushing problem lurks beneath the signs of economic recovery in Chicago: one of the most poorly funded pension systems among the nation’s major cities. Its plight threatens to upend the finances of President Obama’s hometown, now run by his former chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel.

The pension fund for retired Chicago teachers stands at risk of collapse. The city’s four funds for other retired city workers are short by $19.5 billion. At least one of the funds is in peril of running out of money in less than a decade. And starting in 2015, the city will be required by the state to make far larger contributions to the funds, which could leave it hundreds of millions of dollars in the red — as much as it would cost to pay 4,300 police officers to patrol the streets for a year.

“This is kind of the dark cloud that’s coming ever closer,” Mr. Emanuel said in a recent interview, adding that he had no intention of raising his city’s property taxes by as much as 150 percent — the price tag, he says, that it might take to pay such bills. “That’s unacceptable.”

Illinois lawmakers, who make key financing and benefit choices for Chicago’s pension system, have wrestled for months without agreement on the politically troublesome matter of cutting the benefits of public sector retirees to save money. And last month, Moody’s Investors Service downgraded Chicago’s rating by an unexpected three notches as part of a broad reassessment of how pensions are affecting the financial strength of cities. That “super downgrade,” in the parlance of the bond market, left Chicago, the nation’s third-largest city, with a lower rating than 90 percent of Moody’s public finance ratings."

Now, under pressure from falling poll numbers and angry business supporters, they are seeking a compromise on the debt ceiling. Yet for now, they are still refusing to finance and reopen the government without some concessions.

Mr. Boehner and his colleagues left the White House without speaking to waiting reporters, and quickly gathered in his Capitol suite for further discussion. Their debt limit proposal could come to a vote as soon as Friday.

Before the White House meeting, administration and Congressional Democrats said they were skeptical that House Republican leaders could pass the proposal. A large faction of Tea Party conservatives campaigned on promises never to vote to increase the nation’s debt limit. And Congressional Democrats vowed to oppose any proposal that did not also fully finance a government now shuttered since the fiscal year began Oct. 1.

“We’ll see what they’re able to pass,” said Mr. Obama’s press secretary, Jay Carney.

Senate Democrats had their own White House meeting with Mr. Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. three hours before the House Republicans arrived, and the majority leader, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, declined to embrace the Republicans’ debt limit proposal until he saw it. He told reporters that Democrats would not negotiate on further deficit reductions until House Republicans agreed to the measure passed by the Senate to finance and open the government through mid-November.

“Not going to happen,” Mr. Reid said. “Open the government,” he added. “There is so much pain and suffering out there. It is really tear-jerking, to say the least.”

Separately, members of the Senate’s Republican minority, who are to meet with Mr. Obama on Friday, worked on a proposal for full-year government funding — at levels reflecting the across-the-board spending cuts known as sequestration, but giving agencies flexibility to shift money around. They are considering adding it to any short-term debt limit increase that the House might pass and send to the Senate."

On top of that, the economy is absorbing costs from delays and disruptions to government services, and from a sharp blow to consumer and business confidence. The report runs through a long list of the disruptions: a backlog in veterans’ disability claims, children left out of Head Start, patients left out of cancer studies, halted consumer-safety work, delays in certain tax refunds.

The report said that the government had not calculated the costs of actually shutting the government down and reopening it. But it described them as significant.

“Disruptions at nuclear cleanup sites associated with the shutdown will cost two to three weeks of productivity,” it said. The shutdown “may cause the Department of Energy to miss cleanup milestones agreed to with the states where cleanup is underway.”

Ultimately, disruptions like the shutdown may discourage workers from taking government jobs, analysts have said.

“The furloughs came on top of an unprecedented three-year pay freeze, increases to retirement contributions and the loss of six days’ wages due to the sequestration-related furloughs this summer,” the American Federation of Government Employees, a union representing about 650,000 government workers, said in a statement.

“Employees are frustrated at being made the sacrificial lamb of deficit reduction, and as a result the federal government is becoming a less attractive employer.”"

So much for empathy. So much for genuine compassion. So much for this: What shall it profit a man if he gains the whole world but loses his soul?

What you see here is a hardening of that understanding.”

Other companies that are incorporating a carbon price into their strategic planning include Microsoft, General Electric, Walt Disney, ConAgra Foods, Wells Fargo, DuPont, Duke Energy, Google and Delta Air Lines.

During the 2012 election, every Republican presidential candidate but one, Jon Huntsman, questioned or denied the science of climate change and rejected policies to deal with global warming. Opponents of carbon-pricing policies consider them an energy tax that will hurt business and consumers.

Mainstream economists have long agreed that putting a price on carbon pollution is the most effective way to fight global warming. The idea is fairly simple: if industry must pay to spew the carbon pollution that scientists say is the chief cause of global warming, the costs will be passed on to consumers in higher prices for gasoline and electricity. Those high prices are expected to drive the market away from fossil fuels like oil and coal, and toward low-carbon renewable sources of energy.

Past efforts to enact a carbon price in Washington have failed largely because powerful fossil-fuel groups financed campaigns against lawmakers who supported a carbon tax.

In 1994, dozens of Democratic lawmakers lost their jobs after Al Gore, who was vice president at the time, urged them to vote for a climate change bill that would have effectively taxed carbon pollution. In 2009, President Obama urged House Democrats to vote for a cap-and-trade bill that would have required companies whose carbon-dioxide emissions exceeded set levels to buy emissions rights from those who emitted less. The next year, Tea Party groups spent millions to successfully unseat members who voted for the bill.

But Exxon Mobil, which last year was ranked by the Fortune 500 as the nation’s most profitable company, is representative of Big Oil’s slow evolution on climate change policy. A decade ago, the company was known for contributing to research organizations that questioned the science of climate change. In 2010, Exxon Mobil purchased a company that produces natural gas, which creates less carbon pollution than oil or coal."

As with any State of the Union address, President Barack Obama this year had several audiences and there were multiple aims for the White House: To show that he understands the economy is still struggling and that he will do more to help the unemployed find jobs, and to portray a different side of himself than what was seen on Inauguration Day – one willing to reach out to the other party.

While the president did offer some new proposals – including increasing the minimum wage and guaranteeing preschool – many of the ideas he pushed were repeating what he had previously offered but went nowhere in divided Washington. And we saw a president trying to expand the use of executive power to help push his agenda.

State of the Union brings out more of the ‘same old, same old’

Here are five things we learned Tuesday night:

1. It’s still the economy, stupid

It very well could have been a campaign speech given last year – the president talking about the need for a balanced approach to deficit reduction, at least four references to protecting the middle class, the need to reignite “the true engine of America’s economic growth.”

With the recovery still weak, unemployment at 7.9% and the nation’s growth rate shrinking the last three months of 2012, the president and his team know much of his legacy may be dependent on helping reignite the economy. The president pushed for 15 manufacturing hubs to help spur high tech job growth.

With $85 billion in automatic across-the-board spending cuts set to take effect on March 1, Obama pushed for a replacement of them because some economists warn they could lead to a recession. However, he did not give any ground on what he would accept as an alternative – setting up the next major fiscal fight with Republicans.

53% of those watching speech give Obama thumbs up

2. Mr. Bipartisan?

Facing hundreds of members of the opposing party, Obama took a decidedly different approach than he did in his aggressive inaugural address.

“They do expect us to put the nation’s interests before party. They do expect us to forge reasonable compromise where we can. For they know that America moves forward only when we do so together and that the responsibility of improving this union remains the task of us all,” the president said early on in the address.

He even praised some Republicans – he pointed to how Sen. John McCain, his 2008 opponent, worked with then-Sen. Joe Lieberman, a Democrat turned Independent, on climate change. He mentioned his 2012 opponent, Mitt Romney, and said we should try his idea of tying the minimum wage to the cost of living.

While he talked about how chances are good for bipartisan approaches on tax and immigration reform, Republicans can be expected to say they haven’t seen a different approach so far from the president on many key issues: He wants more tax revenues and more government spending on his priorities, which are non-starters among Republicans.

Fifty-three percent of those surveyed in a CNN/ORC instant poll of speech-watchers said they did not believe the address would lead to bipartisan cooperation while 39% said they thought it would.

Proposals he floated would make high-quality preschool available to every child, provide tax credits for businesses to hire and invest, promote more scientific research and development, further shift cars and trucks away from gasoline, and invest in infrastructure. “Nothing I’m proposing tonight should increase our deficit by a single dime.” he said. “It’s not a bigger government we need, but a smarter government that sets priorities and invests in broad-based growth.”

But White House officials refuse to put a price tag on the programs – or to reveal how, in fact, they would be paid for. They promised more details when the White House’s budget proposal is released in a few weeks.

4. If they won’t, I will

The president demonstrated clearly how he plans to aggressively use executive actions to push policy if Congress thwarts him and he announced action on climate change and cybersecurity.

“If Congress won’t act soon to protect future generations, I will,” he said. “I will direct my Cabinet to come up with executive actions we can take, now and in the future, to reduce pollution, prepare our communities for the consequences of climate change, and speed the transition to more sustainable sources of energy.”

After efforts dealing with cybersecurity failed to pass Congress, the president signed an executive order to increase information-sharing and to help the private sector develop standards. These moves came after the president last month approved 23 executive actions dealing with gun control.

Obama also used the speech to make his base happy by emphasizing such liberal priorities as climate change and equal treatment and benefits for gay Americans as well as announcing a bipartisan commission to improve the voting system and pushing for a hike in the minimum wage.

5. Even presidents can’t control the news

While the White House tried to build up suspense around what the president would say, as soon as news broke Tuesday afternoon that accused cop-killer Christopher Dorner was believed to be holed up in a cabin in the California mountains, much of the media immediately switched gears.

What would have been hours of coverage of what was expected from the speech, what Obama’s message might be and discussion of his agenda did not happen.

Would this be another split-screen State of the Union similar to when networks flashed news of the verdict in O.J. Simpson’s civil trial during Bill Clinton’s 1997 address?

That did not happen this time but as soon as Obama wrapped up most news organizations quickly updated viewers on the Dorner story.

But the president might have gotten an unintended benefit from the other story of the day – interest in Dorner might have helped boost the audience for the address.

On the October 2 edition of AM 560's The Big John & Amy Show, co-hosts John Howell and Amy Jacobson interviewed Fox Business' Stuart Varney and asked him about the government shutdown and its effect on workers and the economy. Varney stated, incorrectly, that the shutdown was not having an impact on financial markets or the greater economy before launching into a tirade against federal employees.

HOWELL: Do you think that federal workers, when this ends, are deserving of their back pay or not? VARNEY: That is a loaded question isn't it? You want my opinion? This is President Obama's shutdown. He is responsible for shutting this thing down; he's taken an entirely political decision here. No, I don't think they should get their back pay, frankly, I really don't. I'm sick and tired of a massive, bloated federal bureaucracy living on our backs, and taking money out of us, a lot more money than most of us earn in the private sector, then getting a furlough, and then getting their money back at the end of it. Sorry, I'm not for that. I want to punish these people. Sorry to say that, but that's what I want to do. JACOBSON: But it's not their fault. It's not the federal employees' fault. I mean, that's what I'm sick of, I hate and it makes me anxious, to see people who are victimized because of a political fight. VARNEY: I take your point Amy, it is not directly their fault, but I'm looking at the big picture here. I'm getting screwed. Here I am, a private citizen, paying an inordinate amount of money in tax. I've got a slow economy because it's all government, all the time. And these people are living on our backs, regulating us, telling us what to do, taxing us, taking our money, and living large. This is my chance to say ""hey, I'm fed up with this and I don't miss you when you're on furlough."" Sorry if that's a harsh tone, but that's the way I feel.

I am frankly at a loss for words. Not since Rick Santelli launched his famous diatribe at the government bailout program on CNBC has a right-wing nutjob been so publicly and completely clueless, insensitive and ignorant as Mr. Varney.

Born in England in 1949, he came to the US in 1974. He has worked for Fox, CNN and CNBC and lives in Franklin Lakes, NJ which, according to Wikipedia, has the 18th highest income of the state's 566 municipalities and 146th in Forbes listing of ""America's Most Expensive ZIP Codes"", with a median home price of $1,306,546

I am sure we can all understand the incredible pain and suffering Mr. Varney has had to endure living in these kinds of conditions and how much better off he would be if all federal and state workers simply quit their jobs to make his life happier.

There must be a special place in the Callousness Hall of Fame for Mr. Varney. Perhaps Kossacks can suggest some fitting consequences for his brutal and totally uninformed diatribe."

D. Palmer, the director of external affairs for the California Department of Finance. “We don’t believe it is prudent to budget on the capital gains. It wasn’t that long ago when we had the same experience during the dot-com boom. We don’t want to see that movie again.”

In one particularly revealing moment, the office of the independent legislative analyst — which has a history of scolding governors for unrealistically optimistic budget projections — dismissed Mr. Brown’s figure as pessimistic, saying extra revenue was closer to $4.4 billion. The report undercut Mr. Brown just as he and lawmakers moved into the final stages of budget negotiations, and it empowered Democrats and social service advocates eager to reverse budget cuts.

“I support the governor’s call to pay down more debt aggressively, I support the notion of a rainy-day fund,” said Darrell Steinberg, the president pro tem of the Senate. “But I also believe that we have an obligation to make some limited but important investments in restoring some of what has been lost over the last four or five years.”

Vanessa Aramayo, the director of California Partnership, a group of organizations pushing for social service spending, said Mr. Brown was deliberately understating the state’s financial health.

“The governor is attempting to leave a legacy of solving our state budget crisis,” she said. “But he’s doing so on the backs of poor people in the state.”

Other Democrats said the Legislature should proceed with caution, given the history of financial gyrations in California and, no less important, concern that any perception that Democrats were on a spending spree could prove politically damaging to the party.

John A. Pérez, the speaker of the Assembly, said that he supported putting revenues into a contingency fund, but that some of the money should go to increase spending on programs like college scholarships for middle-class students."

Mitch McConnell on a crash course to crisis.

What we're talking about here is a shrinking Senate minority pursuing a nullification strategy -- they want to nullify federal law by abusing procedural tactics in a way that's literally never been done in the United States. If Senate Republicans want changes to the CFPB, there's already a mechanism in place that allows them to pursue reforms: it's called the existing legislative process. Senators can write a bill, send it to committee, try to persuade their colleagues of the proposal's merit, debate it on the floor, vote for it, etc. But that takes time and effort, and it might not work, especially since the changes the GOP wants are absurd. So, instead, Republicans intend to block existing federal law from taking effect unless Democrats accept changes demanded by financial industry lobbyists.

Republicans in the Senate have vowed to destroy the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau by continuing to block confirmation of the agency's director, any director. It's not opposition to the individual, Richard Cordray, that is driving them. It's fealty to Wall Street and utter disregard for constitutional, governmental norms. Steve Benen talks about just how radical what the Senate Republicans are doing is.As Benen says, it's nullification through extortion. They're demanding that federal law be ignored, unenforced, unless the changes to the CFPB they and their puppet-masters want are made. They are not doing this through the normal, regular,legislative process, but through an unprecedented filibuster. Just days after ostensibly agreeing with their votes for reform that the filibuster was being abused and, boy, they sure weren't going to do that anymore.

By systematically refusing to confirm President Obama's nominees, eschewing their constitutional advise and consent mandate, and by trying to force changes to existing law through extortion and exploiting Senate procedure, what the Senate Republicans are doing could indeed prompt a constitutional crisis. One alternative, and one that gets more attractive by the moment, is that Harry Reid goes ""nuclear,"" changing filibuster rules with a simple majority vote mid-session. In the face of such extreme Republican behavior, it might be the only rational response.

Please sign our petition urging Harry Reid to re-open the process of filibuster reform in the Senate."

So since, with the brand's reappearance on convenience store shelves, we're going to be hearing a lot of these management-view thumbnail sketches of how Hostess went under, let's recap some of what you won't hear as much:

Unionized Hostess workers made major concessions, taking pay and benefits cuts. That money was supposed to be reinvested into the company. It wasn't.

As the company was struggling, its CEO pay skyrocketed, and as it was going into bankruptcy, Hostess pushed to give $1.75 million in bonuses to top executives.

Hostess claimed it had to close plants because workers went on strike, but in fact, the company was already planning to close nine bakeries and wasn't telling which ones.

Hostess stole its workers' pension money to fund itself and still went bankrupt.

went bankrupt. And, as Media Matters points out, ""while the AP story claims that ""workers"" are blaming the company's woes on mismanagement and a failure to adapt to evolving consumer tastes, this has actually been the opinion of informed and objective third parties.""

This is the real story of Hostess: high pay and mismanagement at the top, concessions at the bottom, blame to the workers despite those concessions. Don't forget that as you're sinking your teeth into a creamy retro treat."

Liberals’ love of recycling extends to their ideas, one of which illustrates the miniaturization of Barack Obama’s presidency. He fervently favors a minor measure that would have mostly small, mostly injurious effects on a small number of people. Nevertheless, raising the minimum hourly wage for the 23rd time since 1938, from today’s $7.25 to $10.10, is a nifty idea, if:

If government is good at setting prices. Government — subsidizer of Solyndra, operator of the ethanol program, creator of HealthCare.gov — uses minimum-wage laws to set the price for the labor of workers who are apt to add only small value to the economy.

If you think government should prevent two consenting parties — an employer and a worker — from agreeing to an hourly wage that government disapproves.

If you think today’s 7 percent unemployment rate is too low. (It would be 10.9 percent if the workforce participation rate were as high as it was when Obama was first inaugurated; since then, millions of discouraged workers have stopped searching for jobs.) Because less than 3 percent of the workforce earns the minimum wage, increasing that wage will not greatly increase unemployment. Still, raising the price of low-productivity workers will somewhat reduce demand for them.

If you reject that last sentence. If you do, name other goods or services for which you think demand is inelastic when their prices increase.

If you think teenage (16-19) unemployment (20.8 percent), and especially African American teenage unemployment (35.8 percent), is too low. Approximately 24 percent of minimum-wage workers are teenagers.

If you think government policy should encourage automation of the ordering and preparation of food to replace workers in the restaurant industry, which employs 43.8 percent of minimum-wage workers.

If you think it is irrelevant that most minimum-wage earners are not poor. Most minimum-wage workers are not heads of households. More than half are students or other young people, usually part-time workers in families whose average income is $53,000 a year, which is $2,000 more than the average household income.

If you do not care that there are more poor people whose poverty derives from being unemployed than from low wages. True, some of the working poor earn so little they are eligible for welfare. But an increase in the minimum wage will cause some of these people to become unemployed and rely on welfare.

If you do not mind a minimum-wage increase having a regressive cost-benefit distribution. It would jeopardize marginal workers to benefit organized labor, which supports a higher minimum in the hope that this will raise the general wage floor, thereby strengthening unions’ negotiating positions.

If you think it is irrelevant that nearly two-thirds of minimum-wage workers get a raise in their first year.

If you think a higher minimum wage, rather than a strengthened Earned Income Tax Credit, is the most efficient way to give money to the working poor.

If you think tweaking the minimum wage is a serious promotion of equality by an administration during which 95 percent of real income growth has accrued to the top 1 percent.

If you think forcing employers to spend X dollars more than necessary to employ labor for entry-level jobs will stimulate the economy. If you believe this, you must think the workers receiving the extra dollars will put the money to more stimulative uses than their employers would have. If so, why not a minimum wage of $50.50 rather than the $10.10? Because this might discourage hiring? What makes you sure you know the threshold where job destruction begins?

If you think the high school dropout rate is too low. In 1994, Congress decreed that by 2000 the graduation rate would be “at least” 90 percent. In 2010 it was 78.2 percent. Increasing the minimum wage would increase the incentive to leave school early. One scholarly study concluded that, in states where students may leave school before 18, increases in the minimum wage caused teenage school enrollment to decline.

Jon Cowan and Jim Kessler, the authors, promptly got called out by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., a champion of expanding Social Security who was one of the main targets of their piece. “It’s just flatly wrong,” she said of their description of Social Security, which they claim is in an “undebatable solvency crisis.”

Warren is demonstrably correct. Let’s take a look.

Cowan and Kessler start by asserting, “A growing cascade of baby boomers will be retiring in the coming years, and the Social Security formula increases their initial benefits faster than inflation.”

They’re wrong about the formula. Initial Social Security benefits are indexed to wage inflation. This is a measure that tracks the standard of living prevailing at the time people retire, which generally improves over the course of their working lives. Wage inflation generally, though not invariably, rises at about 1% a year faster than the consumer price index used to calculate annual cost of living increases for retirees--after their initial benefit.

Why is indexing the initial benefit to wage inflation important? Think of it this way: if that hadn’t been done, people retiring today might receive a benefit based on the standard of living four decades earlier. For Cowan and Kessler not to know the facts about the initial benefit, or to know it and not disclose it, pretty much disqualifies them as Social Security analysts. But that’s not all.

“Since 2010,” they write, “Social Security payouts to seniors have exceeded payroll taxes collected from workers.” This is misleading at best and a gross misrepresentation at worst.

Social Security has three traditional sources of revenue: current payroll taxes, income taxes charged on Social Security benefits, and interest earned by the Social Security trust funds. It’s important to remember that the trust funds themselves are derived from payroll taxes--excess taxes levied on workers since 1983, largely to pre-pay the baby boom generation’s benefits. So the interest is itself derived from payroll taxes lent to the government through the purchase of Treasury bonds.

From 2010 to 2013 there was a fourth source: a general fund reimbursement for the payroll tax holiday of two percentage points enacted as an economic stimulus measure. The point is that Social Security was credited for the full 6.2% payroll tax levied on employees as payroll tax--just that 2% of it was to be suspended for a few years so workers could have a bit more in their pockets.

Since 2010, payouts to seniors have been more than covered by all these payroll tax-related sources. In 2010, benefits were $695.4 billion, the payroll tax, interest, and general fund payback came to $765.2 billion; in 2011 the program paid out $719.5 billion and collected $775.7 billion, and last year the payout was $762.3 billion and income was $810.3 billion.

As for the “undebatable solvency crisis,” Cowan and Kessler should tell that to the Social Security trustees, because the trustees sure debate it. The trustees in their annual reports caution every year against drawing firm conclusions about the program’s future solvency from the financial projections they publish looking decades in the future.

In fact, they publish three main projections--a best-case, worst-case, and middle-of-the-road scenario. all these are based on more than a dozen demographic and economic assumptions, none of which can be projected for certain, and all of which interact with each other in indeterminate ways. The trustees warn that “significant uncertainties surround the intermediate assumptions,” which are largely the basis for the Cowan/Kessler claims. Does that sound like the trustees think they’re “undebatable”?

Cowan and Kessler are also misleading about Warren’s proposal, which involves raising the cap on wages subject to payroll taxes. (The cap is $117,000 for 2014.) They say “her approach requires a $750 billion tax hike over the next 10 years that hits mostly Millennials and Gen Xers, plus another $750 billion tax on the businesses that employ them.”

That makes it sound as though she’s proposing to tax young people just starting out on their careers, doesn’t it? She’s not--she’s proposing to increase payroll taxes on all people earning $117,000, or whatever the cap is each year (it rises with inflation). Since taxes levied in the future naturally will be paid by today’s millennials and GenXers, Cowan and Kessler are sort of right. But unbelievably deceptive.

The real goal of the Cowan/Kessler piece was to discourage Democrats from following Warren and Bill de Blasio, the new progressive mayor-elect of New York. Their op-ed was headlined “Economic Populism is a Dead End for Democrats,” and blamed Warren and de Blasio for encouraging a “left-wing...fantasy.” What the authors don’t seem to acknowledge is that both Warren and de Blasio won elections. They already have followers, and among the reasons for their victories is they’re willing to stand up for economic policies that don’t leave the average person in the dust.

That may not be to Cowan’s or Kessler’s taste, or to that of the current and former executives of Warburg Pincus, Goldman Sachs, and the other corporations and investment firms on Third Way’s board. But for all their chattering about Social Security’s insolvency, it’s their arguments that were bankrupt."

Republican leaders in the House had hoped to pass a bill providing money for several major government agencies. Instead, they halted the vote after a GOP campaign to reduce spending levels hit an unexpected roadblock: Rank-and-file Republicans refused to approve cuts in programs that home-state governors and mayors rely on to fix roads, streets and bridges.

Conservatives were stunned that their more moderate colleagues could not stomach the reductions they all had agreed to a few months ago as part of an austere Republican budget plan.

But other Republicans saw the revolt as inevitable: The budget slashing that has dominated GOP spending talks over much of the last year may have run its course, they said, suggesting that the time may have come to compromise with the White House.

“It might be a wake-up call,” Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson of Georgia, a soft-spoken grandfather and former Sunday school teacher, said as he rode the Senate subway back to his office. “We may have reached our point.”

If so, the nation’s best hope for avoiding a budget crisis and a possible government shutdown this fall may rest in the office of the low-key former real estate broker.

Isakson has assembled a group of like-minded GOP senators who have been meeting quietly with President Obama’s staff. They’ve been seeking a resolution to the budget stalemate that has preoccupied Washington all year and that threatens to create a new crisis soon after Congress returns to work in September.

Their private talks gained sudden currency with the failure late Wednesday of the spending bill covering government transportation, housing and community development programs. The revolt in the House sent Republican lawmakers home on a sour note, frustrated that they had weakened their hand heading into negotiations with the administration.

White House officials saw the House move as an opening. Budget director Sylvia Mathews Burwell called it an “inflection” point in the long-running budget debate because it showed that the low levels of spending called for in the Republican budget plan are not “workable.”

Congress has failed to pass any of the annual appropriations bills needed to fund government agencies. Because of that, when lawmakers return in September, they will have just nine workdays to devise a stopgap plan or risk a government shutdown Oct. 1 when the current funding bills expire.

“I understand the frustration that they’re dealing with,” House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) said as lawmakers prepared to leave town. But he said the House would not agree to a higher level of overall spending or an end to the across-the-board budget cuts known as the sequester.

“I just want make clear: The sequestration is going to remain in effect until the president agrees to cuts and reforms that will allow us to remove it,” he said.

Advertisement

Democrats and the White House want to undo the $100 billion a year in sequester cuts, replacing them with a combination of smaller reductions and some new revenue. Republicans want to continue the cuts, but they also want to shift the burden away from defense-related spending, requiring even deeper cuts in domestic programs. That was the plan they signed on to in theory under the budget written in the spring by Rep. Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), the former vice presidential nominee.

The transportation and housing bill was the first look that many House members got at what those deeper domestic cuts would be like in practice. Many balked.

“Most of our members were looking at that, and they got jittery,” said Rep. Jack Kingston (R-Ga.), who said he would have voted for the reductions. “I think it makes it really difficult to move forward.”

In the Senate, the Democratic majority tried to pursue a compromise worked out with Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) that would have spared transportation from some of the steepest cuts.

Advertisement

But even as the House GOP splintered, Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Republican minority leader, led a filibuster to make sure the Senate would hold the line against increased spending.

“This is so absurd,” an exasperated Collins said after the vote. “I truly don’t know the path forward.”

Isakson says he hopes that talks he has hosted may provide that path. So far, however, the meetings in the Georgia senator’s office have not resolved the stalemate that lawmakers and the administration have been stuck in for months: Republicans want to cut the nation’s Medicare and Social Security retirement programs to reduce spending, while the White House prefers changes in the tax code to bolster revenue.

The group is pursuing a “grand bargain” that could end the cycle of crises for the next decade, but it is well aware that a shorter-term solution for the next year or so may be all that is in reach.

Shear', 'Annie Lowrey']","In Tech Buying, U.S. Still Stuck in Last Century","WASHINGTON — Four years after President Obama vowed to “dramatically reform the way we do business on contracts,” the spectacular failure of the HealthCare.gov website has renewed calls for changes in how the government hires and manages private technology companies.

But despite Mr. Obama’s promises in the last two months to “leap into the 21st century,” there is little evidence that the administration is moving quickly to pursue an overhaul of the current system in the coming year.

Outside experts, members of Congress, technology executives and former government officials say the botched rollout of the Affordable Care Act’s website is the nearly inevitable result of a procurement process that stifles innovation and wastes taxpayer dollars. The Air Force last year scrapped a $1 billion supply management system. Officials abandoned a new F.B.I. system after spending $170 million on it. And a $438 million air traffic control systems update, a critical part of a $45 billion nationwide upgrade that is years behind schedule, is expected to go at least $270 million over budget.

Longstanding laws intended to prevent corruption and conflict of interest often saddle agencies with vendors selected by distant committees and contracts that stretch for years, even as technology changes rapidly. The rules frequently leave the government officials in charge of a project with little choice over their suppliers, little control over the project’s execution and almost no authority to terminate a contract that is failing."

Ted Cruz laid out his strategy on Sunday for trying to dismantle ObamaCare in the Senate, amid increasing questions about whether he has the support of fellow chamber Republicans and if he’ll force a government shutdown to win.

Cruz explained to “Fox News Sunday” his procedural strategy, after suggesting Friday that Senate Republicans use a filibuster to block Senate Democrats’ attempt to use their majority to swiftly vote down the House-approved plan -- which is to fund the entire federal government, except ObamaCare, before the Oct. 1 deadline.

“If Senate Republicans stand together, we can stop [Majority Leader] Harry Reid,” said Cruz, the Tea Party-backed senator.

Cruz suggested Senate Republicans take their stand by attempting to block Reid’s effort to exclude GOP input through cloture, which can block debates and amendments with only 50 'yes' votes.

“If the majority is going to run over the minority with a train, then the minority has the ability to stop them.” he said. “A vote for cloture is a vote for ObamaCare.”

Still, Cruz said he doesn’t know if he can get 41 votes should any vote go a 60-vote super majority.

Cruz’s plan is facing criticism from Democrats as well as Republicans, who, based on recent polls, fear they will be blamed for a government shutdown.

Among the congressional Republican leaders opposing Cruz and his plan are Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker and New York Rep. Peter King, who voted Friday in favor of the House plan but said Cruz’s efforts will expose him as a “fraud.”

Missouri Democrat Sen. Claire McCaskill told “Fox News Sunday” that she couldn't believe Republicans were going to “throw a tantrum and throw the entire economic recovery under a bus.”

She also rejected Cruz’s argument that Senate Democrats are using “brute political force,” saying they are simply following the will of voters who last year re-elected Obama and reject Republicans trying to end ObamaCare.

Cruz said he expects the Senate, if it votes down the House plan, would send it back to leaders of the Republican-controlled chamber, with the deadline for a temporary spending bill just eight days away."
http://news.yahoo.com/dems-back-tax-plan-iowa-211651068.html,,[],"Dems back tax plan, say Iowa gov must compromise","DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Senate Democrats on Monday challenged Gov. Terry Branstad to negotiate with them on how to cut property taxes for Iowa businesses.

The demand came as a Senate subcommittee approved a Democratic plan to cut commercial property taxes that takes a different approach than the one backed by the Republican governor.

After several years of failed efforts to pass property tax cuts, Sen. Matt McCoy, D-Des Moines, said Branstad shouldn't try to ""cram his plan down our throats.""

""We are a separate and co-equal branch of government and we will insist that our views be considered with the same degree of respect,"" McCoy said. ""We won an election too. If we're going to have property tax relief it's going to have to involve compromise.""

Under the Democrats' plan, commercial property owners would gradually get a tax credit equivalent to a roughly 40 percent tax cut on their first $324,000 in assessed property value. Democrats said roughly 80 percent of the state's 116,900 commercial properties are assessed at or below $324,000 and that their plan would give bigger tax breaks to those businesses than Branstad's plan.

Branstad's plan gradually cuts taxable property assessments by 20 percent for all businesses at a cost of $350 million.

The Democratic proposal would cost $250 million over five years and funding would not go to the credit if the state's revenues don't grow by at least 4 percent more than the previous fiscal year.

Tim Albrecht, a spokesman for Branstad, said the governor will support property tax legislation that permanently reduces taxes for all classes. To the call for negotiation, Albrecht said Branstad is prepared to work with lawmakers but ""does not believe finger-pointing and accusations are particularly helpful to this debate.""

Mayors from two Iowa towns testified before the subcommittee about the proposal. Carlisle Mayor Ruth Randleman told a Senate subcommittee that the plan would help her town.

""My local businesses are impacted positively by this kind of approach. It does address the small businesses in my community,"" Randleman said.

Story continues

John Stineman, executive director of the Iowa Chamber Alliance, raised concerns about the fact that the credit won't definitely be funded every year, calling it ""conditional relief.""

McCoy said the Democrats want to create legislation that they know the state can afford.

""We've got to put a budget together that's balanced,"" he said.

McCoy said he expects the tax proposal will go to the full Senate committee for a vote within the next week."

Gee, where could we come up with some of the money need to replace that food stamp funding that was lost this week? Maybe from these people who are all collecting farm subsidies And many, many more

That's a list composed by the Environmental Working Group, using their database of farm subsidy recipients compared to Forbes 400 list of the country's richest people. Between 1995 and 2012, these 50 people—who have have a collective net worth of $316 billion—received $11.3 million in farm subsidy payments. They've probably have even received more in crop insurance payments, but we don't know because the law doesn't allow prohibits the disclosure of the identities of crop insurance policyholders.

While a congressional conference committee meets to decide if they're going to cut $40 billion (House bill) or $10 billion (Senate bill) from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, they are probably going to give billionaires even more!



[P]roposed changes adopted in both the House and Senate versions of the bill will likely allow these billionaires to bank millions more in premium subsidies. Both bills would shift subsidies from programs currently subject to means testing to the more generous crop insurance program. Unlike traditional farm subsidies, crop insurance premium subsidies are not currently subject to means testing, payment limits or conservation requirements. In 2008, Congress created a means test that was designed to deny some subsidies to individuals with annual off-farm income of more than $500,000. The year before, Bloomberg News published a report highlighting some of the billionaires who had been receiving subsidies. But, lawmakers specifically declined to apply it to crop insurance, which has become the primary government support for farm business income.

The system is already skewed for, of course, the largest one percent of farm businesses. They received about $227,000 a year in crop insurance premium support in 2011, according to EWG's analysis from USDA data. Meanwhile, the bottom 80 percent of farmers received only about $5,000 apiece.

There is no reason on earth taxpayers should be subsidizing what are already nothing more than tax write-offs for the nation's wealthiest people. And we particularly should not be subsidizing them when millions are in danger of going hungry because the austerity fetishists in Congress think they're getting too much food."

Now what?,"The Senate on Thursday voted to reject all proposals for an alternative deficit-reduction plan that would avoid sequestration, a process that will trim $85 billion in across-the-board spending from the federal budget this year.

Barring a sudden and unexpected outbreak of bipartisan cooperation (LOL) over the next 12 hours, most federal departments on Friday will begin the process of shaving about 2.5 percent from their projected budgets as part of the sequestration order. Over the next decade, if the policy remains in effect, the federal government will spend about $1.2 trillion less than projected, although spending will still increase over that time.

There has been a lot of noise coming from Washington about the consequences of the sequestration plan, which was originally voted into law in 2011 to encourage lawmakers to pass a ""grand bargain"" replacement that would achieve the same amount of deficit reduction.

The White House on Sunday released an alarming state-by-state breakdown of possible consequences if sequestration occurred. Hawaii Democratic Gov. Neil Abercrombie warned that Pearl Harbor would be less secure. California Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters cautioned that ""over 170 million jobs"" were at risk. (That would mean negative employment, considering there aren't even that many jobs right now in the U.S.) In all likelihood, sequestration will not be nearly as bad as advertised, something even President Barack Obama suggested on Wednesday night.

In seeking an alternative, lawmakers failed to bridge the divide between the Democrats' demand for more tax increases and the Republicans' insistence that the deficit be narrowed by cutting spending alone. On Thursday—one day before the deadline—Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid put a Republican bill and a Democratic bill on the floor to avoid sequestration. Both failed. (Even if the Republican version had passed, Obama had already vowed to veto it anyway. If the Democratic bill passed, the House would likely have rejected it.)

Story continues

Washington has long known that this day would come. But instead of working in recent weeks to replace the across-the-board-style cuts with smarter methods of achieving some deficit reduction, the parties waged a public relations campaign against each other. Republicans focused on ensuring that Democrats took the blame for proposing the sequestration idea in the first place. Democrats worked to highlight the potential impact the cuts would have on federal services across the country, and accused Republicans of protecting tax loopholes for wealthy Americans at the expense of everyone else.

Regardless of who is really to blame, the deadline is here and sequestration will happen. What does that mean for most Americans? Actually, not much, at least in terms of effects people will immediately see and feel.

Yes, federal agencies will be forced to do more with a bit less. Over the past few months, everyone from Capitol Hill aides, military service members, federal workers and government contractors have been told to prepare for cuts. If you fall into any of those camps, Washington's inaction will likely have an effect on your bottom line. Civilian employees who work with the U.S. military may not secure as many contracts in the year ahead, for instance, and anyone who works under most federal agencies will be forced to prioritize their department's spending.

There are also plans to furlough workdays for some federal employees, so some can prepare for three-day weekends—but in return for less take-home pay. State and local government employees will also face budget hurdles as part of sequestration. State governments will have fewer federal dollars to subsidize local projects. Federal grants will become more competitive, and federal loans could become more scarce.

But here's the good news: Congress can vote at any time to replace the sequester with an alternative. The March 1 deadline merely sets the process into motion, and it will be gradual—perhaps so gradual that most people won't even notice.

As Obama put it this week, sequestration is “not a cliff, but it is a tumble downward.” There will be plenty of branches along the way for lawmakers to latch onto. The question is, how far will they let the country tumble before they finally grab one?"

The U.S. economy expanded at a 2.4 percent annual rate during the period, down a tenth of a point from an initial estimate, according to revised figures from the Commerce Department released on Thursday. Analysts had forecast a 2.5 percent gain.

Growth was held back as government spending fell across all levels of government and as businesses outside the farm sector stocked their shelves at a slower pace.

Washington has been tightening its belt for several years but ramped up austerity measures in 2013, hiking taxes in January and slashing the federal budget in March.

Still, economic growth has been surprisingly resilient, supported by the Federal Reserve's low interest rate policies. Most economists expect growth will slow mid-year as budget cuts come into effect.

Government spending fell even more sharply in the fourth quarter, and economists speculate that government agencies pulled back in anticipation of budget cuts initially due to begin in January but which took effect in March.

In the first quarter, government spending dropped at a 4.9 percent annual rate, faster than the 4.1 percent rate initially estimated. Spending fell at federal, state and local government offices, though the majority of the downward revision in Thursday' report came at the county and city level.

The drag from government and inventories was partially offset by an upward revision to consumer spending, which rose at a 3.4 percent annual rate, up two tenths of a point from the government's previous estimate.

However, a cloud hung over that category, as most of the upward revision was due to higher sales of gasoline. Higher prices at the pump are a burden on consumers, leaving them less money to spend on other things. Consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.

After-tax corporate profits fell at a 1.9 percent annual rate in the quarter, the first decline in a year.

Total imports grew at a slower pace in the first quarter than initially estimated, moderating the drag on growth from net trade.

Excluding the volatile inventories component, GDP rose at an upwardly revised 1.8 percent rate, slightly higher than analysts had forecast. (Reporting by Jason Lange; Editing by Andrea Ricci)"

The big moment happened during an an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper on Tapper's new show, ""The Lead."" Boehner initially tried to blame President Obama for the sequester, saying that ""he forced this process [sequestration] to occur."" Then something truly unexpected happened: Tapper pointed out that President Obama didn't want the sequester cuts ... and Boehner conceded the point:



Well, no, he didn't want the cuts. But, uh, we have the sequester as a result of his demands. And I've told my colleagues in the House that the sequester will stay in effect until there's an agreement that will include cuts and reforms that will balance the budget over the next ten years.

So the good news is that Boehner admits the obvious fact that the President Obama didn't and doesn't want the sequester cuts to occur. Nonetheless, he insists on blaming the president for the sequester, a position that makes absolutely no sense given that he also says the president doesn't want the sequester cuts. Moreover, Boehner made it clear that while the president doesn't want the sequester cuts, Boehner does—and that he'll insist on keeping them in place until even harsher budget cuts are enacted. (To achieve balance, the House budget plan cuts an additional $4.6 trillion on top of the $1 trillion in sequester cuts.)

Basically, Boehner just give his stupid #Obamaquester blame game a big old kiss goodbye. Now that he's admitted that President Obama doesn't want the sequester but that Republicans do, he's taking full and complete ownership. And unless he changes his mind, the only way we'll be able to get rid of the sequester is by winning the 2014 elections."

Updated 5:49 p.m. ET Friday 5/31

Washington (CNN) – The Internal Revenue Service has told House GOP investigators they have identified 88 IRS employees who may have documents relevant to the congressional investigation into targeting of conservative groups, according to a congressional source familiar with the investigation.

The IRS asked these employees to preserve all the ""responsive documents"" on their computers, and it has been in the process of collecting it all to comply with congressional requests for information. The IRS missed its May 21st deadline to turn over documents to the House Ways and Means Committee.



The same source said the IRS argues it missed its deadline because of the scope of documents it is collecting.

The request for documents was a bipartisan one, but Republicans are privately preparing to seize on the fact that if nearly 90 IRS employees may have been somehow involved in this targeting, it is evidence that the controversy extends well beyond the mistakes by a few low level employees.

However, with no documents in hand, there is no way to know how many of the employees being asked to preserve documents were truly involved in the activity in question. The IRS, in a statement to CNN, said the large number reflects its effort to ensure they are as responsive as possible to the Congressional requests.

""The IRS and Acting Commissioner Danny Werfel are moving aggressively and taking the data requests very seriously. As a precautionary measure, the IRS is casting a wide net to capture any potentially related materials. Our goal is to be exceedingly thorough during this process to ensure we identify any and all pertinent records,"" the IRS statement said. ""The IRS has received numerous congressional requests involving an extensive set of questions and calls for data. Responding to these requests is a top priority for us. We have been in contact with committee staff, and we continue to provide them updates as we diligently work through these requests.""

The IRS is responding to multiple Congressional requests for information and struggling to meet the deadlines. According to a Senate Finance Committee aide, the IRS told the committee it will also miss Friday's deadline to produce documents relevant to the tea party targeting.

In a joint statement from the press offices of Sens. Max Baucus and Orrin Hatch, the committee's Democratic chairman and its top Republican, said they were disappointed and that the agency needed to do better.

""This is an agency that revolves around making the American taxpayer meet hard deadlines each and every year when they file their taxes, oftentimes penalizing those that are late,"" the statement said.

IRS employees told investigators Washington officials told them to scrutinize conservative groups

WASHINGTON (AP) — A government watchdog has found that the Internal Revenue Service spent about $50 million to hold at least 220 conferences for employees between 2010 and 2012, a House committee said Sunday.

The chairman of that committee, Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., also released excerpts of congressional investigators' interviews with employees of the IRS office in Cincinnati. Issa said the interviews indicated the employees were directed by Washington to subject tea party and other conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status to tough scrutiny.

The excerpts provided no direct evidence that Washington had ordered that screening. The top Democrat on that panel, Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, said none of the employees interviewed have so far identified any IRS officials in Washington as ordering that targeting.

The conference spending included $4 million for an August 2010 gathering in Anaheim, Calif., for which the agency did not negotiate lower room rates, even though that is standard government practice, according to a statement by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.

Instead, some of the 2,600 attendees received benefits, including baseball tickets and stays in presidential suites that normally cost $1,500 to $3,500 per night. In addition, 15 outside speakers were paid a total of $135,000 in fees, with one paid $17,000 to talk about ""leadership through art,"" the House committee said.

The report by the Treasury Department's inspector general, set to be released Tuesday, comes as the IRS already is facing bipartisan criticism after agency officials disclosed they had targeted tea party and other conservative groups.

Agency officials and the Obama administration have said that treatment was inappropriate, but the political tempest is showing no signs of ebbing and has put the White House on the defensive.

Three congressional committees are investigating, a Justice Department criminal investigation is under way, President Barack Obama has replaced the IRS' acting commissioner and two other top officials have stepped aside.

The Treasury Department released a statement Sunday saying the administration ""has already taken aggressive and dramatic action to reduce conference spending.""

IRS spokeswoman Michelle Eldridge said Sunday that spending on large agency conferences with 50 or more participants fell from $37.6 million in the 2010 budget year to $4.9 million in 2012. The government's fiscal year begins Oct. 1 the previous calendar year.

On Friday, the new acting commissioner, Danny Werfel, released a statement on the forthcoming report criticizing the Anaheim meeting.

""This conference is an unfortunate vestige from a prior era,"" Werfel said. ""While there were legitimate reasons for holding the meeting, many of the expenses associated with it were inappropriate and should not have occurred.""

Issa's committee also released excerpts from interviews congressional investigators conducted last week with two IRS employees from the agency's Cincinnati office. The excerpts omitted the names of those interviewed and provided no specifics about individuals in Washington who may have been involved.

One of the IRS employees said in an excerpt that they were told by a supervisor that the need to collect the reports came from Washington, and said that in early 2010 the Cincinnati office had sent copies of seven of the cases to Washington.

The other said ""all my direction"" came from an official the transcript said was in Washington.

One of the workers also expressed skepticism that the Cincinnati office originated the screening without direction from Washington, according to the excerpts.

Appearing Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" Issa said this conflicted with White House comments that have referred to misconduct by IRS workers in Cincinnati. Without naming White House spokesman Jay Carney, Issa said the administration's ""paid liar, their spokesperson"" is ""still making up things about what happens in calling this local rogue.""

He added, ""This is a problem that was coordinated in all likelihood right out of Washington headquarters and we're getting to proving it.""

In briefings with reporters, Carney has not referred to the Cincinnati IRS office as ""rogue.""

""He's good at throwing out outlandish charges but it's unclear what he's saying he lied about,"" White House spokesman Eric Schultz said of Issa's remark.

Cummings said Issa's comments conflicted with a Treasury inspector general's report that provided no evidence that the Cincinnati office received orders on targeting from anyone else.

""Rather than lobbing unsubstantiated conclusions on national television for political reasons, we need to work in a bipartisan way to follow the facts where they lead,"" Cummings said.

The interviews with IRS employees were conducted by Republican and Democratic aides on Issa's committee and also involved aides from both parties from the House Ways and Means Committee.

One of the employees was a lower-level worker while the other was higher-ranked, said one congressional aide, but the committee did not release their names or titles.

The IRS Cincinnati office handles applications from around the country for tax-exempt status. A Treasury inspector general's report in May said employees there began searching for applications from tea party and conservative groups in their hunt for organizations that primarily do work related to election campaigns.

That May report blamed ""ineffective management"" for letting that screening occur for more than 18 months between 2010 and 2012. But that report — and three hearings by congressional committees — have produced no specific evidence that the Cincinnati workers were ordered by anyone in Washington to target conservatives.

The latest report on IRS conferences will be the subject of a hearing Thursday by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.

Werfel is scheduled to make his first congressional appearance as acting commissioner Monday when he appears before a subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee.

According to congressional aides briefed by the inspector general's office, the IRS did not formally seek competitive bids for the city where the agency's 2010 conference was held, for the event planner who assisted the agency, or for the speakers.

The aides, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe a confidential congressional briefing, said other benefits given to some attendees at the Anaheim IRS conference included vouchers for free drinks and some tickets to attend Angels baseball games.

Two videos produced by the IRS were shown at the Anaheim conference. In one, agency employees did a parody of ""Star Trek"" while dressed like the TV show's characters; the second shows more than a dozen IRS workers dancing on a stage. The two videos cost the agency more than $50,000 to make, aides said.

The lecturer who spoke about leadership through art produced six paintings of subjects that included Abraham Lincoln, Michael Jordan, the rock singer Bono and the Statue of Liberty, the aides said."

(CNN) - House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan thanked President Obama for hosting a ""frank discussion about Washington's budget challenges"" when the two met Thursday.

Obama, who dined with 12 Republican senators Wednesday night, invited Ryan and Democratic Rep. Chris Van Hollen, the ranking member on the budget committee, to the White House for lunch.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

In a statement, Ryan said he believes ""everyone needs to be a part"" of the conversation surrounding the country's debt and deficit issues.

""We need an open debate about how best to balance the budget and expand opportunity,"" he continued. ""I look forward to having that debate next week with specific budget proposals from House Republicans and Senate Democrats.""

Ryan, the 2012 GOP vice presidential nominee, is expected to introduce specific proposals in his budget on Tuesday.

Appearing on CNN's ""The Situation Room,"" Van Hollen said the meeting lasted more than an hour and included only the three men, without any aides at the table.

""It was a good lunch, it was a good meal and it was a very good conversation,"" he said. ""The president is trying to open every avenue of dialogue to try and get something done.""

The meeting marked the first time Obama sat down with Ryan since the two competed head on in the presidential race last fall.

""Their relationship is developing very well,"" Van Hollen said, without going into detail about the meeting.

A White House official said the president was ""pleased"" to host Ryan and Van Hollen, adding that the group had a ""constructive discussion.""

Obama, the official said, ""expressed his desire to continue a dialogue with them in the weeks ahead.""

On the menu was lentil vegetable soup and broiled sea bass served with a roasted vegetable ragu, according to the White House.

The meeting came one day after the GOP-controlled House passed a Republican measure to keep the government funded through September, while softening the impact of forced spending cuts on the military and veterans affairs program. The continuing resolution now goes to the Senate for consideration.

In his dinner with a dozen Republicans Wednesday night, the conversation also focused on the country's budget issues–and many senators walked away from the meeting describing it as a cordial and genuine exchange.

The bipartisan meetings signal a shift in approach for the president, as they come less than a week after both sides were engaged in bitter, partisan fight over the failure to produce a deficit-reduction plan that averted $85 billion in across-the-board cuts from going into place.

Obama on Friday placed blame on Republicans for not compromising, while Republicans faulted Democrats for the same reason.

Asked if the latest Republican outreach was a change in strategy, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said on CNN's ""The Situation Room"" that it was ""a change in circumstances.""

""And a strategy that is born out of that change in circumstances,"" Carney continued.

Because there's no impending fiscal deadline, Carney added, then there's ""a little room and time for constructive conversation.""

Carney said the president was specifically reaching out to Republicans in Congress who have expressed an openness to moving forward.

""The president has been...having phone conversations and other kinds of encounters with lawmakers of both parties and we don't read all of them out and we won't read most of them out because, as the president said to me earlier with regards to the dinner, part of the effort here is to foster an environment where these conversations can be held in a way that allows for a free exchange of ideas,"" Carney said earlier in the day during the press briefing.

In an interview with CNN Chief Political Correspondent Candy Crowley, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi applauded Thursday the president's efforts to meet with Republicans.

""He’s been very bipartisan in his approach. So, I think that these meetings are not something to say, ‘well, I’ll do this with you now, and do that with them later.’ I think it is, ‘let’s get some things done together to make elections less important.’ Let’s come together for the benefit of the American people, first and foremost, that’s our responsibility.""

She continued: ""So if he can diffuse some of their opposition to some of these issues, bravo, for the, again, for the American people.""

He Died On June']",Charles Krauthammer: Return of the real Obama,"The rout was complete, the retreat disorderly. President Obama got his tax hikes — naked of spending cuts — passed by the ostensibly Republican House of Representatives. After which, you might expect him to pivot to his self-proclaimed “principle” of fiscal “balance” by taking the lead on reducing spending. “Why,” asked The Post on the eve of the final fiscal-cliff agreement, “is the nation’s leader not embracing and then explaining the balanced reforms the nation needs?”

Because he has no interest in them. He’s a visionary, not an accountant. Sure, he’ll pretend to care about deficits, especially while running for reelection. But now that he’s past the post, he’s free to be himself — a committed big-government social democrat.

As he showed in his two speeches this week. After perfunctory nods to debt and spending reduction, he waxed enthusiastic about continued “investments” — i.e., spending — on education, research, roads and bridges, green energy, etc.

Having promised more government, he then promised more taxes — on “millionaires” and “companies with a lot of lobbyists,” of course. It was a bold affirmation of pre-Clintonian tax-and-spend liberalism.

Why not? He had just won Round 1: raising rates. Round 2 is to raise yet more tax revenue by eliminating deductions. After all, didn’t John Boehner offer him $800 billion of such loophole-closing revenuejust a few weeks ago?

To paraphrase Churchill on the British Empire, Barack Obama did not become president of the United States to preside over the liquidation of the welfare state. On the contrary, he is dedicated to its expansion. He’s already created the largest new entitlement in half a century (Obamacare). And he has increased federal spending to an astronomical 24.4 percent of GDP (the postwar norm is about 20 percent), a level not seen since World War II.

But this level of spending requires a significantly higher level of taxation. Hence his hardball fiscal-cliff strategy of issuing an ultimatum to Republicans to raise tax rates — or be blamed for a massive across-the-board tax increase and a subsequent recession.

I’ll get you the money by eliminating deductions, offered Boehner. No, sir, replied the president. Rates it must be.

Why the insistence?

(1) Partisan Advantage

As I wrote last month, the ultimatum was designed to exploit and exacerbate internal Republican divisions. It worked perfectly. Boehner’s attempted finesse (Plan B), which would have raised rates but only for those making more than $1 million, collapsed amid an open rebellion from a good quarter of the Republican caucus.

At which point, power passed from the House to the Senate, where a deal was brokered. By the time the Senate bill reached the House, there was no time or room for maneuver. Checkmate. Obama neutralized the one body that had stymied him during the past two years.

(2) Ideological Breakthrough

Obama’s ultimate ambition is to break the nation’s 30-year thrall of low taxes — so powerful that those who defied the Reaganite norm paid heavily for it. Walter Mondale’s acceptance speech at the 1984 Democratic convention, promising to raise taxes, ended his campaign before it began. President George H.W. Bush’s no-new-taxes reversal cost him a second term.

On this, too, Obama is succeeding. He not only got his tax increase passed. He did it with public opinion behind him.

Why are higher taxes so important to him?

First, as a means: A high-tax economy is liberalism’s only hope for sustaining and enlarging the entitlement state. It provides the funds for enlightened adventures in everything from algae to Obamacare.

Second, as an end in itself. Fundamentally, Obama is a leveler. The community organizer seeks, above all, to reverse the growing inequality that he dates and attributes to ruthless Reaganism. Now, however, clothed in the immense powers of the presidency, he can actually engage in unadorned redistributionism. As in Tuesday night’s $620 billion wealth transfer.

Upon losing the House in 2010, the leveler took cover for the next two years. He wasn’t going to advance his real agenda through the Republican House anyway, and he needed to win reelection.

Now he’s won. The old Obama is back. He must not be underestimated. He has deftly leveraged his class-war-themed election victory (a) to secure a source of funding (albeit still small) for the bloated welfare state, (b) to carry out an admirably candid bit of income redistribution and (c) to fracture the one remaining institutional obstacle to the rest of his ideological agenda.

Not bad for two months’ work.

Very little, according to a survey of economists released Monday by the National Assn. for Business Economics. The group said that nearly 60% of economists now expect the so-called sequestration, which will slice about $85 billion from the federal budget, to begin March 1 in full or partial form.

The survey of 49 professional economists, representing industry, government and universities, indicates that experts don’t see a recession scenario as a result of the new spending cuts, as they did the “fiscal cliff” of tax increases and fiscal reductions, which were mostly avoided at the last minute at the start of this year.

More than half of these economists predicted that the effects of sequestration and other budget uncertainties would shave economic growth by less than half a percentage point this year. Another one-third said the pain would be greater, with real gross domestic product, or total economic output, sliced by up to a full percentage point.

Either way, that’s no small number given the mediocre pace of GDP growth since the Great Recession of a little more than 2% on average. And many economists, policymakers and business people across the country have expressed fears that the indiscriminate nature of the cuts under sequestration will impose unnecessary hardships on certain programs such as Head Start for preschool children.

Total government spending and investments are now seen as falling by 1% this year from 2012, according to the median, or mid-point, of the responses from the economists surveyed. That is worse than the 0.6% drag forecast in the association’s survey in December.

Real GDP is expected to expand by 2% this year, down a bit from the 2.2% GDP growth in 2012. The nation is projected to add 170,000 jobs a month on average, down from 181,000 last year, according to the median value of responses. That should bring down the unemployment rate gradually, to 7.5% in the fourth quarter of 2013 from 7.9% at the start of this year.

Economists, however, see economic growth accelerating next year as the nation absorbs the fiscal spending cuts and benefits from the housing market recovery and a pickup in business investments. Real GDP is seen as growing by almost 3% in 2014, the survey said, and the unemployment rate is forecast to fall to 7% by the end of next year.

Obama decides he doesn't need these guys for the next jobs effort.

In his State of the Union address last week, President Obama announced a new plan to repair the nation's failing infrastructure and create construction jobs. On Wednesday, the White House unveiled the plan

The first element is a ""fix-it-first"" policy, an investment of $50 billion to address the transportation infrastructure with $40 billion of that targeted to the most urgent projects, the ""highways, bridges, transit systems, and airports most in need of repair."" The second part of the plan is a ""Rebuild America Partnership,"" with all levels of government partnering with business and private capital on infrastructure projects. The third part is a commitment from the federal government to modernize and streamline the agency permitting and regulatory processes for projects.

The outlines of the plan have been well received so far.



After hearing a general description of the proposal, Robert Puentes, director of theMetropolitan Infrastructure Initiative, said that while some of the announcement had been on the president’s agenda for some time, “the important shift seems to be the administration is not waiting for the legislature,” but is “maximizing the things they can do themselves.” Mr. Puentes expressed enthusiasm for the infusion of more private capital into infrastructure investment. “This is not going to solve all our infrastructure problems — we still have a long way to go,” he said, adding that private money cannot meet all of the nation’s needs. However, he said, “this will go a long way.”

Importantly, these are initiatives that minimize the need for congressional approval, where there would likely be a less enthusiastic response, at least from one side. Past efforts at infrastructure jobs bills have regularly been killed by Republicans, whose commitment to real job creation is hollow , at best."

Talks on Capitol Hill advanced with a new urgency after President Obama rejected House Speaker John A. Boehner’s (R) offer to raise the debt limit through late November to give the parties time to negotiate a broader budget deal.

Briefing reporters after financial markets closed for the week, White House press secretary Jay Carney praised a “new willingness” among Republicans to end the government shutdown — now in its 12th day — and to acknowledge that default on the national debt “would be catastrophically damaging.”

But with the Treasury Department due to exhaust its borrowing authority in just six days, Carney said the president would not agree to go through another round of economy-rattling talks in six weeks, just before the Christmas shopping season.

“It at least looks as if there’s a possibility of making some progress here,” Carney said. But, “we have to remove these demands for leverage essentially using the American people and the American economy.”

Where U.S. is feeling the shutdown

Read about people's experiences with the shutdown across the nation.

Before Carney spoke, Obama telephoned Boehner and the two men agreed to keep talking, aides said. Afterward, GOP senators marched into Boehner’s office and counseled him to adopt an approach they had presented to Obama earlier in the day, during their own meeting at the White House.

With Republicans getting battered in public opinion polls over the shutdown, Senate GOP leaders urged Boehner to join them in supporting a single, big-bang measure that would open the government and raise the debt limit in one fell swoop.

“I laid out some of those ideas, and the question is, can the House find a center of gravity to open the government up around those ideas,” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said after exiting the speaker’s office with Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.). The two men, former House members, have been close friends with Boehner for almost 20 years.

Details were still fluid late Friday, but the latest 23-page draft of the emerging measure would immediately end the shutdown and fund federal agencies for six months at current spending levels. It would maintain deep automatic cuts known as the sequester, but give agency officials flexibility to decide where the cuts should fall.

In addition, the proposal would also raise the debt limit through Jan. 31, 2014. Lawmakers were considering whether to include a provision that would direct the House and Senate Budget committees to immediately enter negotiations over broader budget issues and to issue a report by Jan. 15, 2014. If an agreement could be reached, it would clear a path for another increase in the debt limit later that month, without additional drama.

In exchange, Republicans were seeking what they called a few “fig leafs” — minor adjustments to Obama’s new health-care initiative. The first would delay for two years a 2.3-percent tax on medical devices that is unpopular in both parties. The second would require internal auditors to ensure that people who get tax subsidies to buy health insurance are in fact eligible.

Another option under consideration but not included in the latest draft would reduce the number of workers required to receive health coverage from an employer, by changing the definition of a full-time worker from 30 hours a week to 40 hours a week.

In an interview with a Kentucky newspaper Friday, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) signaled that he was helping to shepherd the effort to reach a compromise with Democrats.

“We’re in one of those situations right now where it’s going to require some sort of coming together here to get past the current impasse. And I’m going to continue to work on that,” McConnell told the Herald-Leader of Lexington.

By late Friday, talks over the measure were proceeding on multiple tracks. In the Senate, negotiations had advanced far enough that Senate Republicans — led by Sens. Susan Collins (Maine), Kelly Ayotte (N.H.) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) — sent draft language to their Democratic counterparts, including Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.), a trusted ally of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.).

Meanwhile, Boehner was huddled with his top lieutenants in a hideaway on the first floor of the Capitol, reviewing his options over Chinese carryout and cigarettes.

The Senate proposal differs in critical ways from the approach Boehner sold earlier this week to his rank and file, who had insisted on using the threat of the shutdown to try to undermine the Affordable Care Act.

Given those demands, Boehner had offered to lift the debt limit for six weeks to clear space for negotiations over overhauling the tax code, trimming federal entitlement spending and reforming the health care law. The government would remain shuttered unless Obama agreed to those talks.

House Republicans also proposed to roll back a portion of the sequester cuts, a top Democratic priority. But those cuts would have to be replaced with equal reductions to Medicare spending, such as Obama’s proposal to make well-off seniors pay more for coverage.

It was unclear how long the House offer would have kept the government open without further negotiations. But House Appropriations Chairman Harold Rogers (R-Ky.) quickly blasted the Senate plan to extend temporary funding for six months, calling it “disastrous.”

“It is a punt to the executive branch for the Congress not to exercise judgement about where money is spent,” Rogers said in a statement.

Boehner has scheduled a meeting of the entire GOP conference for 9 a.m. Saturday, but it was unclear whether he would present details of the proposal emerging in the Senate. Senate Republicans were hopeful that Boehner could build support for the plan and push it through the House first.

That could not only help get it to Obama’s desk faster, but also preserve Boehner’s political standing by avoiding a repeat of the New Year’s Day deal over the so-called “fiscal cliff.”

Then, a Senate-passed measure to stop scheduled tax hikes for the vast majority of Americans won the support of only 85 Republicans in the House. More than 150 GOP lawmakers opposed the bill, including some of Boehner’s top deputies, and the humiliating loss emboldened conservatives to vote against his re-election as speaker.

Senate Republicans cautioned, however, that Boehner doesn’t have much time to work things out. GOP senators are eager not only to get the government back to work but to raise the $16.7 trillion debt limit before Thursday, when the Treasury Department has said it would exhaust its ability to conserve cash. Without an increase in the debt limit, independent analysts say the Treasury would begin missing payments by Nov. 1.

GOP senators and aides said Boehner has been told that Senate Republicans will negotiate their own pact with Senate Democrats if he fails to act.

“From my point of view, it’d be better for the country if the House led,” Graham said. “It’s important that we continue to talk among ourselves as senators,” he added, but “if it came out of the House, it would be better.”

Even as negotiations progressed rapidly in the Senate, the uncertainty over procedure cast a shadow of doubt over their ultimate success.

“It’s encouraging to me that the president is now negotiating with both the House and the Senate, after saying that he wouldn’t,” Collins said. “But it is very uncertain to me what the outcome is going to be.”

However, after Markos's new front page diary where he states ""The ONLY leverage Democrats have in this fight is tax rates,"" I feel like this is worth posting:

There is a lot of outrage on our side for ""giving up leverage"" and not tackling all of the major fiscal issues facing us, like the debt ceiling and sequestration, and instead focusing mainly on the tax cuts portion of the deal. Here's what I don't understand: For the last month, isn't this exactly what our side has been advocating for?

Post-thanksgiving, those of us on the left, from the president, to labor, to progressive organizations, and this website, had all been advocating for Congress to ""extend the middle class tax cuts now."" The President used the bully pulpit to call for the House to vote on the Senate bill to extend the Bush tax cuts for those making $250k or less. Nancy Pelosi tried to force a discharge petition through the House to force a vote. We were all asked to sign petitions and call our Congressperson to demand that taxes for the middle class be extended first, outside of the framework of the rest of the deal.

The logic for that was simple. If we extend the middle class tax cuts, two things are accomplished: 1. We take a significant part of the cliff worries off the table, which is that there were going to be major tax raises on the middle class and the poor. 2. We gain leverage because we just got one of our major priorities accomplished, which was to raise tax rates on the rich without having to deal with anything else in the deal first.

Both of these things gave us some protection if we went over the sequestration cliff, since it wouldn't be the big combination of factors that could push us into recession.

Now, as a side note, keep in mind that the Senate bill we were asking the House to vote on was only a one year extension of the middle class tax cuts. So instead of making the rates permanent, we would have kicked the can down the road till the end of this year and had to deal with more drama all over again.

Flash forward to yesterday: a deal emerged between the Vice President and Senate Republicans to handle part of the fiscal cliff, particularly on taxes, outside of dealing with the bigger issues. What did this deal include? We did give up one major concession, which is to increase the Bush Tax cuts for the first $450k of income instead of 250k income that we would have gotten under the Senate bill we've all been pushing. But we also got a heck of a lot of other stuff in return.

We extended unemployment benefits for a year without having to give an offset, we extended research and development tax credits for things like wind energy another year, while extending stimulus tax credits for lower income families another five. We also got the Medicare doc fix patched, so reimbursements don't get cut by 27%, the AMT patched, oh yeah, a freaking FARM BILL EXTENSION PASSED (which I have heard very few people mention, but is as huge a part of this deal as anything else).

So in order to get everything mentioned in the last paragraph, we compromised on the tax rates. How much did we really give up in terms of actual revenue? The answer is, not that much.

Again, the Senate middle class tax cut bill was only for a year, so it would have generated less revenue in an apples to oranges comparison. Let's make it an apple to apple comparison, and we would have extended them permanently. That would have generated about $700b in revenue over 10 years. How much did we end up getting in the tax cut deal? About $600b. So we ended up getting 85% of the original revenue we were aiming for.

Say what you want, but getting 85% of your original target in any negotiation where you don't hold all the cards (and despite what some may think, we don't. We don't control one of the three chambers, and until we fix the filibuster, we don't have full control over the second), is pretty damned good.

So now that we have this deal in place, everyone has changed their tune. Extending the middle class tax cuts on their own went from being our goal to being a bad thing. It went from something that strengthens our hand to something that weakens it? How and when exactly did this happen? Are you really going to tell me because we get 15% less revenue than we originally wanted that it went from a great idea to a bad idea?

We still have to deal with sequester. We still have to deal with debt ceiling. We were still going to have to deal with those even if we passed the Senate middle class tax cut bill.

These are things we are going to have to deal with, but in whatever deal we make, it's also going to be an opportunity to raise more revenues.

No one knows exactly how those negotiations are going to go, but the blueprint laid out in the mini-sequester deal was a pretty good one. It called for reducing the sequester by 50% new revenue, 25% defense cuts and 25% domestic spending. That's a pretty good blueprint moving forward. The President backed up this blueprint by holding that press conference before the vote letting Republicans know that if they vote for this deal, it's not all she wrote on revenues, and that 1:1 is the ratio he expects going forward on deficit reduction.

Many of you here believe the President will cave (which for some appears to mean not getting 100% of everything he asked for). Maybe he will, maybe he won't. My money is on getting most, but not all, of what he asks for going forward, but no one really knows. But conceding defeat before those negotiations even begin is really crappy political strategy.

I'm not saying the debt ceiling/sequester fight will be easy. It will be another shit show, going to the 11th hour, taking our country to the brink of default. But guess what? Be prepared for a lot of those over the next two years that the lunatics are still in charge of the House of Representatives. We're going to have government shutdown threats, more farm bill fights, and more fights on anything where the Republicans think they can use the well-being of the American people as a bargaining chip.

All this could be for naught if the Republicans go through with blowing up the deal. But if we get the deal we cut in the Senate, we are ahead going into the second quarter of a game with a lot left to play. Taking care of the tax cuts first was what we have been advocating for all along, and we should celebrate if it gets taken care of, not mourn it."
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/05/20/indiana-attorney-general-probing-privacy-breach-obamaphone-users/,2013-05-20 00:00:00,[],Indiana attorney general probing privacy breach of ‘Obamaphone’ users,"The Indiana attorney general’s office confirmed Monday it is investigating a security breach in which Social Security numbers and other personal information were posted online for roughly 44,000 low-income Americans who applied for a federal program that provides discount Internet and phone service.

The program was nicknamed the “Obamaphone” during the 2012 election, though it actually started long before President Obama took office. Indiana reportedly has the highest number of applicants, roughly 17,400, who were signed up by TerraCom Inc. and the affiliated YourTel America Inc.

Applicants from at least 26 states were exposed to the security breach, according to a report published by Scripps Howard News Service.

In addition to the application forms, 127,000 supporting documents such as scans or photos of food-stamp cards, driver’s licenses, tax records, pay stubs and parole letters also were available online.

Federal law prohibits carriers from keeping applicants’ proof of eligibility.

A TerraCom attorney told Scripps the records were stored by Call Centers India, a contractor that helps determine eligibility.

The phone companies said the records of 343 people were accessed from at least March and were removed April 26, after Scripps said it found information through a “simple” Google search and informed the companies of the breach.

The news service said TerraCom officials declined numerous requests for an interview but that a company spokesman said federal and state officials were notified of the breach.

The Federal Communications Commission, which runs the program, acknowledged it knew of the situation and said a single privacy violation could cost a company as much as $1.5 million.

The FCC program is known as Lifeline and started in the Reagan administration in large part to help low-income residents in emergencies and to help them find and keep jobs.

But the program was hit with fraud and abuse through the end of President Obama’s first term, after cell phones were added and wireless companies, getting reimbursed as much as $34.25 a line per month, were reportedly signing up people who’d never applied or were dead.

As a result, the FCC last year tightened the guidelines, essentially limiting households to either one land or cell phone line and requiring carriers to document applicants’ eligibility, which cut the number of subscribers from a peak of 18.2 million in August 2012 to 13.2 million last month.

The program became known during the final months of the 2012 election cycle as “Obamaphones,” after a woman in Cleveland in a viral YouTube video touted what she called the “Obamaphone.”

“He gave us a phone,” she said.

The program cost $2.2 billion in 2012 and is funded through the $2.73 surcharge on monthly phone bills."

Knox College was the location of the fifth of seven debates between Democrat Stephen A. Douglas, often known as the “Little Giant” for his small size but large influence in American politics, and Republican Abraham Lincoln.

At Knox, Lincoln and Douglas debated about the institution of slavery, whether it should be restricted in the territories, and its ongoing role in the Republic. Was slavery to remain a traditional, decaying institution left to choke and die under the original Constitution, or was it to be a permanent part of the American social fabric, possibly given new life in the Western territories?

The Lincoln-Douglas debates put Lincoln on the map politically, and even though he lost the 1858 Senate race to Douglas, he triumphed in the 1860 presidential election.

Obama also has a deep connection to Knox College, as it was the site of his 2005 speech on economics when he was a freshman senator. In that speech, he defended the power of government to boost the economy and increase economic opportunity.

Though many American statesmen, including Abraham Lincoln, have believed in government playing a role in building the American economy, Obama’s speeches have turned their philosophy on its head.

In his 2005 speech, Obama attacked the “ownership society” and made an argument for the collective good of government action. This philosophy is opposed to the individual liberty philosophy of the Founding Fathers and of Abraham Lincoln.

Obama said that Americans must have a “sense of mutual regard for each other, the idea that everybody has a stake in the country, that we’re all in it together and everybody’s got a shot at opportunity.

Obama was building up to the “you didn’t build that,” creed that became a key issue during the 2012 presidential campaign. This economic philosophy is fundamentally based on the principle that since individual success relies on the work of others, one owes the rest of society in the form of high taxes.

If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help. There was a great teacher somewhere in your life. Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in roads and bridges. If you’ve got a business–you didn’t build that. Somebody else made that happen.

In essence, Obama has twisted the government “of the people, by the people, for the people” into a government that owns you.

But this set of principles contradicts the idea of individual rights and the “self-made man” that Lincoln supported.

Lincoln’s “beau ideal of a statesman” was Henry Clay of Kentucky, a Whig of the previous generation that helped craft the “American System” of economics. This system was in large part based on funding national infrastructure projects through tariffs, along with a national bank that would give the United States a sound system of money.

But Clay did not believe that individuals owed society anything, and he was famous for making the term “self-made man” popular. Clay, after defending corporations as a positive way for individuals to achieve success and get ahead in the world, said in a speech, “In Kentucky, almost every manufactory known to me, is in the hands of enterprising and self-made men, who have acquired whatever wealth they possess by patient and diligent labor.”

This philosophy of both economic development and an acknowledgement that the individual owns his own labor is based on a Lockean natural rights philosophy that permeated the American founding and has been at the cornerstone of nearly every major American political party. It would certainly be in line with Brietbart News’ own “Hamilton,” who very much represents the philosophy of Alexander Hamilton’s Federalists, Henry Clay’s Whigs, and Abraham Lincoln’s Republicans.

Given Obama’s previous speeches on economics, the philosophy that made America the greatest opportunity society in the world and ended the institution of slavery is unlikely to be heard at Knox College."
http://news.yahoo.com/u-business-leader-remains-confident-boehner-seek-immigration-201821842.html,,[],U.S. business leader remains confident Boehner will seek immigration reform,"By Thomas Ferraro WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of the biggest U.S. business group, a traditional ally of Republicans, said on Thursday that he remains confident that the top Republican in Congress will push to enact comprehensive immigration reform. U.S. Chamber of Commerce President Thomas Donohue said he is not worried about House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner's refusal to negotiate with the Senate on its sweeping bipartisan bill. Donohue said he supports Boehner's decision to instead take a step-by-step approach with smaller measures to fix the nation's broken immigration system. ""I believe it will get done,"" Donohue said at a news conference attended by business, religious and law enforcement leaders, all of whom echoed his determination and optimism. A landmark bill to bolster border security, help business get needed workers and provide an earned pathway to U.S. citizenship for up to 11 million undocumented immigrants won Senate approval in June. But thus far, the House has passed only a handful of limited bills, most dealing with enforcement and none providing a pathway to U.S. citizenship. Donohue promised to help Boehner get the votes to pass a series of bills to provide comprehensive reform, including a pathway to citizenship. He said such legislation would be good for business, labor and the country, and that he expects final congressional approval in the first half of next year. ""We're not going away,"" said Donohue, whose business group, along with organized labor, helped craft the Senate bill. ""We're just getting warmed up."" Boehner drew fire on Wednesday when he said that the House will not negotiate with the Senate to resolve differences between the Senate bill and what the House ends up passing. ""We have made it clear that we are going to move on a common sense, step-by-step approach,"" the speaker said in repeating his opposition to the Senate legislation. ""We have no intention of ever going to conference on the Senate bill,"" he said. Some read Boehner's comments to mean that he was walking away from comprehensive reform. Donohue, whose Chamber of Commerce represents more than 3 million businesses, said he didn't see it that way. ""I'm not upset with Boehner,"" Donohue said, adding that he believes Congress will end up doing what needs to be done to overhaul the U.S. immigration system. ""We will get there,"" he said. ""It doesn't matter to me what music they play for the dance."" OBJECTION TO PATHWAY The Chamber of Commerce, and much of the business community, has long been allies of Republicans, largely because of the party's anti-tax, anti-regulatory positions. Yet many Republicans have balked at the Senate bill because of the pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants. Critics say the pathway would provide ""amnesty"" to law breakers and encourage more illegal immigration. Supporters disagree. They say it would bring millions of illegal immigrants out of the shadows and end exploitation of them. Donohue said he remains confident Congress will enact a comprehensive immigration overhaul largely because polls show more than 70 percent of Americans back it. Jay Timmons, head of the National Association of Manufacturers, joined Donohue at Thursday's news conference and said: ""We're all optimistic up here."" The news conference was a follow-up to a ""fly-in"" last month that saw more than 600 conservative leaders from across the country come to Washington to urge lawmakers to move forward on immigration reform.

WASHINGTON -- The year after a presidential election, fewer people focus on campaign finance issues, but 2013 was well worth your attention. There were financial scandals, a new Supreme Court case, laws rewritten and the anticipation of more money than ever before. Below are 10 of the biggest campaign finance stories of the year.

10. Big money took over North Carolina. Gov. Pat McCrory (R) won election in late 2012 with huge support from the political network funded by wealthy conservative activist Art Pope and immediately announced that Pope would be his budget director. In the ensuing year, the state enacted highly divisive right-wing legislation along the lines long proposed by Pope's outside network of think tanks and political organizations. North Carolina became example number one of how a single donor can influence the political direction of an entire state in the post-Citizens United world.

9. Get ready for the most expensive midterm election ever. More than $815 million has been raised or spent on the 2014 midterm elections and 2013 special elections already. Spending by independent groups like super PACs and ""dark money"" nonprofits is ahead of the 2012 pace, when these groups laid out nearly $1 billion.

Next year's Kentucky Senate race, pitting Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R) against both a tea party primary challenger and a very well-financed Democratic candidate, is also well ahead of the fundraising pace set by the two most expensive Senate campaigns in history. The 2012 Massachusetts race cost candidates Scott Brown and Elizabeth Warren a combined $82 million, and the 2000 New York race between Hillary Clinton and Rick Lazio topped $70 million. The Kentucky candidates have raised nearly $20 million and that's just through September 2013.

8. Are Democrats winning the super PAC war? Just one year after conservative independent groups outspent liberal groups 2.5 to 1, the spending pattern has reversed. Liberal independent groups doled out $16.5 million in 2013, compared to $9 million from conservative groups, and liberal super PACs outraised their conservative counterparts 2 to 1 in the first half of the year.

These numbers, however, are somewhat deceiving. Most of the money was spent in special elections that were highly favorable to Democrats, so major conservative groups sat out those contests. The financial comparison also does not account for ""issue"" advertising that masks an electoral purpose. Conservative groups have already spent millions on this form of independent spending that doesn't have to be disclosed to the Federal Election Commission.

7. OFA turned into a dark money nonprofit. Following another successful electoral campaign, the Obama for America machinery, with its troves of data desired by practically every Democratic candidate in the country, sought a new home. The group transformed itself into the 501(c)(4) nonprofit Organizing for Action, the exact type of dark money group that the president had lambasted during his 2012 reelection.

It may have become a bit trite, even if true, to mock the president for his repeated hypocrisy on the issue, but the transformation of his campaign organization into a nonprofit relying on voluntary disclosure -- the group does disclose its donors, but only as it sees fit -- solidified that hypocrisy for many advocates of openness and campaign finance reform.

6. Obama bundlers were nominated to be ambassadors. Again, after promising to change the culture of Washington, President Barack Obama continued the tried and true practice of nominating his biggest campaign fundraisers to jobs as overseas diplomats. According to the Center for Public Integrity, Obama has nominated 23 campaign bundlers for ambassadorships since January.

The American Foreign Service Association, which represents active and retired Foreign Service officers, has called for an end to this practice: ""Now is the time to end the spoils system and the de facto 'three-year rental' of ambassadorships. The United States is alone in this practice; no other major democracy routinely appoints non-diplomats to serve as envoys to other countries.""

5. California officials tore back the curtain on dark money in their state. The state's investigation into an $11 million contribution to a ballot campaign committee late in 2012 revealed the inner workings of the dark-money nonprofit network connected to the billionaire Koch brothers. Due to poorly redacted documents released during the investigation, many of the original donors were uncovered, including the owners of the Gap clothing brand, investor Charles Schwab, casino billionaire Sheldon Adelson and real estate developer Eli Broad, who had publicly supported the ballot initiative even as his money funded the opposition.

The success of the inquiry propelled Ann Ravel, then head of the California Fair Political Practices Commission, into the vice chairmanship of the FEC.

4. The Republican Party faces civil strife. This tea party vs. big business battle is apparently a real thing. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce plans to dump $50 million into supporting primary candidates from the GOP's establishment wing -- even if those candidates don't differ much on policy from the tea partiers they oppose.

The key contests to watch are the Senate primary races in Kentucky, Mississippi, Nebraska, South Carolina and West Virginia and the House primaries in Michigan's 3rd and 11th districts and Idaho's 2nd District.

3. The Supreme Court debates maybe the next Citizens United. In October, the justices heard arguments on another potentially groundbreaking campaign finance case, McCutcheon v. FEC -- this time challenging the aggregate contribution limits that restrict overall giving by an individual donor.

Following the 2010 Citizens United decision, which upended politics by freeing independent groups to spend unlimited sums of money, including corporate and union funds, campaign finance cases have been watched very closely. Some observers have even worried that the Supreme Court could use the McCutcheon case to roll back all contribution limits, although legal experts consider this unlikely.

2. IRS scandal led to proposed clearer rules for nonprofits. If you think the public relations rollout for Obamacare has been bad, remember how the Internal Revenue Service slowly admitted that it had improperly targeted conservative groups for heightened review. After repeatedly denying any such misdeed, IRS official Lois Lerner apologized for doing precisely that in response to a planted question at a meeting of nonprofit tax lawyers. Months of howling by conservatives and hours of congressional testimony ensued until it was revealed that the IRS had targeted not just conservative groups but also liberal groups and other nonpolitical organizations.

The scandal did bring about greater scrutiny of the agency's oversight of political groups, particularly dark money nonprofits that aren't required to disclose their donors. These groups have proliferated over the last several years following the Supreme Court's rulings in FEC v. Wisconsin Right to Life and the Citizens United case. In November, the IRS proposed new regulations for political activity by such nonprofits. The draft regulations, which were criticized from all sides, will take months, if not years, to wend their way through the regulatory process. Nonetheless, they mark a step toward greater transparency for political spending by nonprofits and, potentially, less abuse of the nonprofit tax code to hide donors' identities.

1. States raised contribution limits. After the Citizens United ruling, proposals were put forward across the country to increase disclosure, rein in rampant independent spending and pass constitutional amendments to reverse the decision. The most popular idea -- among politicians, at least -- was to increase the amount of money they can raise to even the playing field.

Nine states -- Alabama, Arizona, Connecticut, Florida, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina and Wyoming -- increased their campaign contribution limits in 2013. The feat was accomplished by state legislatures run both by Republicans and by Democrats.

Minnesota state Rep. Ryan Winkler (D) told The Huffington Post earlier this year, ""Increasing the money flowing directly through candidates from individuals is a better system. It might not be a perfect world, but we have to live in the world that the Supreme Court created for us and do the best we can.""

The multiple bills to raise contribution limits highlight the gulf between the public, which sees far too much money in politics and supports the reversal of Citizens United, and the lawmakers, who simply want as much money as the independent groups empowered by that decision. Expect even more states to adopt hike their limits in the coming years.

Permanent honorable mention: The FEC is an ongoing disaster."

Send Him Statements To Fact Check Emailing Him', 'Tweeting At Him', 'Or Sending Him A Message On Facebook.']",Sequester politics: Claims about the FAA furloughs,"“The FAA is furloughing thousands of air traffic controllers and will purposely delay thousands of flights every day. The FAA’s unnecessary and reckless action will disrupt air travel for millions of Americans, cost jobs and threatens to ground the U.S. economy to a halt. It doesn’t have to be that way. The FAA can make other cost cuts, and deem air traffic controllers ‘essential employees.’”

— text of online ad “Don’t Ground America” promoted by Airlines for America and other trade groups.

Before the sequester began, we examined closely some of the claims and counterclaims made about the impact on the Federal Aviation Administration. Unlike many of the other agencies we rated, which had predicted cutbacks based on some dubious accounting, the FAA made a pretty good case that its cost structure — 71 percent of the operations budget pays for salaries — left it little wiggle room in making cuts. “The FAA assertions have the appearance of a Geppetto Checkmark,” we wrote, though we held off making a final ruling.

Furloughs of air traffic controllers were implemented last weekend, and the resulting flight delays have created a political firestorm, and lawmakers are already looking for a way to close the gap. Critics — including a coalition of airlines and pilots that has filed a lawsuit to block the action — have charged that the FAA has other ways to cut costs beside furloughing air traffic controllers. In its ad, the group also claims that controllers could be deemed “essential employees” and keep working, such as during a government shutdown because Congress failed to complete appropriations bills.

Rep. Bill Shuster (R-Penn.), chairman of the House Transportation Committee, in a statement listed a number of nonpersonnel costs that he said could be examined first, including “nearly $500 million for consultants; $325 million in supplies and travel; the FAA has 46 aircraft that cost $143 million to operate.”

A committee staff member said some of Shuster’s ire stemmed from the fact that he believes that Transportation Department officials have not responded in a timely way for information on how the agency would cope with the sequester cuts. Still, we did find examples in congressional testimony in which administration officials have addressed questions about some of these line items.

So let’s take a look at the claims in the trade group ad. How much flexibility does the FAA have?

The Facts

The lawsuit makes an interesting claim, arguing that during a similar sequestration in 1986, Congress imposed a budget cut of 4.3 percent, “which was accomplished without freezing hires of air traffic controllers, much less furloughs.” But that’s missing the whole story: as furloughs loomed in 1986, lawmakers passed a special appropriations bill that restored the 4.3 percent cut for a number of crucial programs, including FAA controllers, federal meat inspectors and Coast Guard operations. By itself, the FAA got back almost 75 percent of the $116 million that it would have lost under sequestration, news reports show.

Indeed, this year Congress gave a special exemption from the sequester to the Agriculture Department’s food inspectors. But the airline industry failed to get a similar deal, leading to the furloughs that were avoided nearly three decades ago.

Why do the trade groups believe the controllers could be deemed “essential employees,” as during a government shutdown? Vaughn Jennings, a spokesman for Airlines for America, cited an exception in the U.S. code, drawn from the Antideficiency Act, that the Office of Management and Budget has relied on for government shutdowns. He said it could apply also to a sequester.

This turns on legal interpretation, but we could find no support for this position among government officials, congressional Republicans or legal experts. The Antideficiency Act prohibits federal employees from making or authorizing expenditures in excess of what has been appropriated.

In the case of a government shutdown, there is a temporary lapse in appropriations. So to prevent possible harm to public safety, certain employees can be “excepted” and required to work — temporarily without pay. The assumption is that the government will eventually get funded, and workers will receive their overdue pay.

A sequester is a fundamentally different matter. In this case, Congress, through the budget process, already has decided how much money agencies can receive, so experts say it is against the law for the government to arbitrarily conclude some workers can keep working, even for public safety reasons.

“We stand by our position,” Jennings said. “The courts have not ruled on this, and our opinion still holds that there is no reason why the exception would apply to one aspect of the law (shutdown) but not another (sequester). Our position is based on the plain language of the statutes involved.”

The trade group did not explain how the FAA could make other cost cuts, so let’s look at the items that Shuster provided in his statement. We had looked at some of these issues previously and found them to be misleading. Shuster’s list now has expanded but the FAA provided The Fact Checker with fairly detailed explanations of these line items.

$500 million in consultants: The $514 million spent on “advisory and assistance services” refers not to consultants but to operational contracts to support the air traffic control system. That means things like telecommunications and weather radar — assistance that helps maintain the integrity of the system. Consultant contracts amount to just $21 million, but that mostly means environmental experts who check to make sure noise regulations are being followed.

In response to the sequester, the FAA already is aiming to cut about $50 million, or about 10 percent, from the”advisory and assistance services” contracts, officials said.

$325 million in supplies and travel: The $134 million in “supplies and materials” refers mainly to parts needed for air traffic control, back-up generators, heating and ventilation equipment and the like. Because of the sequester, the $117 million earmarked for parts and maintenance is scheduled to decline 18 percent, to $96 million, while spending on HVAC equipment and fuel has been slashed 40 percent, to $16 million, in 2013.

Meanwhile, the $154 million in “travel and transportation of persons” refers mainly to on-site equipment repair, FAA officials said. It also includes travel for new controller training, but that will be suspended as part of the sequester. FAA says this line item is targeted to decline about 13 percent, to $134 million.

Forty-six aircraft that cost $143 million to operate: The $143 million figure is from a 2010 GSA report, congressional aides say, but FAA officials say that year was an anomaly because $60 million was spent to upgrade the avionics on 17 aircraft. In 2012, the aircraft bill was much lower--$78 million--and that has been cut 12 percent, to $69 million, in 2013.

Why does the FAA need so many planes? Thirty-two of the planes are used for flight checking of navigational aids, both when they are installed and then as a regular test. This program has been reduced 14 percent because of sequester, from $58 million in 2012 to $50 million in 2013. Three planes are based in Atlantic City to test evolving technologies in the NextGen air traffic control system, eight are used for aviation safety inspector training and three are based at Reagan National airport for travel to accident investigations.

Add it up, and the FAA says it plans to cut about $110 million — 12 percent — from $903 million of possible areas for cuts identified by Shuster.

The FAA’s work force is heavily unionized, and the furloughs have been ordered without trying to make allowances for the level of traffic in particular airports. The FAA argues that it did not want to be in the position of picking “winners and losers,” either among airports or union members. We obviously can’t make a judgment about the right course of action.

The Pinocchio Test

The ad, and remarks from congressional critics, makes the dilemma facing the FAA seem all too easy. While some of these questions remain to be adjudicated in a legal setting — assuming Congress does not act first — the trade groups go too far in making it appear as if the FAA has ordered furloughs without first looking for other cost cuts or deeming controllers as essential employees.

The FAA has very high fixed costs — both in terms of salaries and contracts — giving it little flexibility. The ad thus is rather misleading about options facing the agency.

We are not sure why the airline industry blames the FAA in the first place. The Obama administration proposed the sequester, and Congress approved it with bipartisan support. The FAA’s hands are tied unless Congress and the White House reach a deal similar to the solution found in 1986.

Boehner worked behind the scenes to win support from Senate Republicans.

And with a public showdown looming, undecided Republicans opted on Monday to get off the fence. Even some Republicans who had privately signaled opposition last week were coming around, convinced a deal that passed the House 332-94, with a strong majority of Republicans behind it, could not be derailed in the Senate.

“Much more work needs to be done to address the No. 1 drivers of our country’s debt — our entitlement programs. But my hope is that this budget agreement paves the way to greater stability, lasting deficit reduction, and the political will to tackle those challenges in the near future,” Mr. Hatch wrote in a statement.

Under the budget deal, spending on defense and nondefense programs would rise from the $967 billion slated for this fiscal year to $1.012 trillion, mitigating the impact of across-the-board spending cuts and allowing congressional lawmakers to draft detailed spending plans for the first time in several years. Spending in fiscal 2015, which begins Oct. 1, would rise from $995 billion to $1.014 trillion. Though total spending would rise $63 billion over 10 years, the measure would trim the deficit slightly.

Opponents had initially seized on the notion that immediate spending increases would be more than offset by savings spaced over 10 years, with much of those savings in 2021 and 2022. But some Senate Republicans have now pinned their opposition to $6 billion in cuts to military pensions — cuts that have incensed some veterans groups.

Senators Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Roger Wicker of Mississippi, all Republicans, will bring military families to the Senate on Tuesday to protest the cuts. Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, the ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, complained of “a real hit to military retirements,” and said the measure did not do enough to reduce the deficit.

But Mr. Ryan has defended the cuts as extremely modest. Under the plan, veterans of working age would see the cost-of-living increases to their pensions trimmed by 1 percent until age 62. At that point, their pensions would get a one-time boost so that payments during retirement would be the same as if there had been no cuts."

On Jan. 1, an estimated 1,600 hotel and transportation workers in SeaTac, Wash., will see their pay jump to $15 an hour, a 60 percent increase from the state's $9.32 minimum wage.

While many workers look forward to the higher pay, employers are looking for ways to absorb the big increase in labor costs. Some plan on eliminating jobs.

""We're going to be looking at making some serious cuts,"" said Cedarbrook Lodge General Manager Scott Ostrander. ""We're going to be looking at reducing employee hours, reducing benefits and eliminating some positions.""

That's in the short term. Eventually, those jobs and more are expected to return as the Cedarbrook Lodge looks to build an addition to the hotel. The plan is to increase revenue to offset the higher labor costs.

But not every employer is being so ambitious. One has told a trade group it is going to close one of its two restaurants, eliminating 200 jobs.

The plan has also caused Han Kim -- who runs Hotel Concepts, a company that owns and manages 11 hotels in Washington state -- to shelve plans to build a hotel in SeaTac. The company already has three hotels in SeaTac, and Kim and a business partner were looking to build a fourth on land they own.

""Uncertainty is bad for business, and right now we're right in that area so we're just putting everything on hold,"" Kim said.

Opponents of the $15 minimum wage did score a legal victory late last week when a King County, Wash., judge ruled that it does not apply to any of the workers at the SeaTac airport. Superior Court Judge Andrea Darvas ruled only the Port of Seattle can set wage and other work rules at the airport. That eliminates 4,700 workers from the successful ballot initiative.

Backers of the $15 minimum wage vow to appeal the ruling up the state Supreme Court. One of the biggest supporters is Kshama Sawant, a socialist who also won her election to the Seattle City Council. She plans on making Seattle the next city to have a $15 minimum wage.

""There may be a few jobs lost here and there, but the fact is, if we don't fight for this, then the race to the bottom will continue,"" Sawant said.

Sawant is skeptical that the higher minimum wage will lead to mass layoffs. But the American Car Rental Association estimates 5 percent of low-wage jobs will be cut; and another 5-10 percent of those workers will be replaced by more experienced workers.

The owner of Dollar Rental Cars told Fox News she'll outsource some functions, change schedules and cut some staff in response to the new policy."

As the fifth day of the federal government shutdown began, members of the House came together in a moment of rare bipartisanship to pass a bill, by a vote of 407 to 0, approving back pay for furloughed government workers.

President Obama has expressed his support for the measure.

Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid supports the measure, but said Saturday that if furloughed workers are guaranteed back pay, there’s no reason to keep them out of work.

“It’s really cruel to tell workers they’ll receive back pay once the government opens and then refuse to open the government,” Reid said on the Senate floor, suggesting that House Republicans have authorized a “paid vacation” for furloughed workers.

After the House vote, Republican leaders called on Senate Democrats and the president to extend the same courtesy to other groups of Americans hurt by the shutdown.

“If it’s important to ease the pain for [federal employees], what about the vets?” House Majority Leader Rep. Eric I.Cantor (R-Va.) said. “Do the Democrats not feel it’s important to ease the pain on them?”

“What about the sick children who need access to clinical trials?” Cantor continued.

The House has passed several bills providing funding for the National Institutes of Health and other areas of the federal government that have been financially weakened since the shutdown began Tuesday. The Senate has rejected each bill, insisting on a so-called “clean” funding bill that will reopen all parts of the government.

President Obama cancelled his scheduled trip Thursday to Indonesia for the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation conference, citing his need to remain in Washington to help undo the congressional deadlock.

House Majority Whip Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) called it a “unique opportunity” for both parties to break the impasse.

“If he’s here this weekend, we’re here this weekend. This can all end,” McCarthy said Saturday.

In a separate House measure Saturday, lawmakers voted 400 to 1 in favor of a bill allowing military chaplains the ability to minister on Sunday without breaking a federal law that forbids furloughed government employees from working.

The sole vote against the measure came from Rep. Bill Enyart (D-Ill.), a 35-year veteran of the U.S. armed forces who retired last year as an adjunct general of the Illinois National Guard.

“I am not going to vote for any more bills designed to allow people to hide behind the flag – or the cross,” Enyart said in a statement.

Enyart affirmed his support for U.S. service members, but said that he will not vote for what he called “feel-good bills” that only reverse shutdown implications for small groups of people.

“This is no way to govern,” Enyart said.

It’s unclear if or when the Senate will take up the bill."

That, says the Cato Institute’s Michael Tanner, would make more sense than what we do now – and, he says, we’d still have money left over.

Michael Tanner, CATO Institute senior fellow.

Here’s Tanner’s math: By his count, the federal government spends more than $668 billion a year on a total of 126 anti-poverty programs, including those that address housing, hunger, health care, and cash assistance. They range from TANF (Temporary Assistance to Needy Families), which most people associate with traditional welfare, to much smaller programs for Indian tribes, at-risk youth, and others. If you divide Tanner’s total by the roughly 46 million people with incomes below the poverty line, you get nearly $15,000 for every poor man, woman, and child in the U.S.

Tanner acknowledges that poor individuals don’t receive that much money, and that’s his point: government spending isn’t laser-targeted to those most in need. In fact, he says, “throwing money at the problem has neither reduced poverty nor made the poor self-sufficient. It is time to re-evaluate our approach to fighting poverty.”

You’ve taken a fair amount of heat for saying that America should “focus less on making poverty more comfortable.” What do you mean by that? Is poverty ever comfortable?

Poverty is never a good thing. But most of the programs we have to combat poverty are based on taking people who are in poverty and giving them a little more income so their poverty doesn’t feel quite as bad. Instead, we should be focused on how to we get more people out of poverty.

What do you think we are doing wrong?

The problem is that our welfare programs aren’t targeted at the right things: education, pregnancy prevention, and job creation. They’re targeted at giving people who are poor the resources to live in poverty.

We know that if you drop out of high school you’re likely to be poor. If you graduate from college, your chances of escaping poverty are much greater.

We know that if you’re a woman, don’t get pregnant if you’re not married. That’s not a moral judgment, it’s an economic one. It’s simply more difficult to raise a child if you have one income rather than two.

And get a job, any job, even a low-wage job, and stick with it. Even a low-paying job is better than no job at all. People are more likely to move out of poverty if they have a low-paying job than if they are on welfare.

And we need to create more jobs. The fact is, we still have an anti-job atmosphere. Too many taxes, too many regulations. We don’t do a very good job of creating an environment that’s going to create more jobs.

What do we do about the millions of people who are in poverty right now? They are poor, they don’t have skills, they don’t have a good education, they don’t have or can’t get a job. Do we pull the safety net out from under them?

We should target our aid to those people who need the help the most. We have created a situation in which there are a certain number of people who are not going to be able to become an economically viable family unit anytime soon, and we probably have to support them in the short term. In the long term, however, we want to give people in the future more of an opportunity to avoid poverty and to get out of poverty.

It’s unfair to compare my approach to utopia. Let’s compare it to the real world and in the real world, the approach I’m talking about would mean fewer poor people than there are today. Would there be zero? No. I don’t know if a society in the history of the world has ever had zero. Poverty in many ways is the natural condition of man. Throughout most of mankind’s history, most people were poor. The question is, how do you create more prosperity?

People on my side of this have often appeared to be hard-hearted, by arguing on a dollars-and-cents basis. But you shouldn’t measure compassion by inputs. You measure by outcomes. And by that measure, we’re failing. And the burden is on the poor, who are the ones suffering in poverty.

So you think it would be more compassionate to blow up and restructure the system?

It’s not fun to live in poverty. Poor people don’t want to be poor. Most poor people would like to work. Most poor people would like to be non-poor. But we’re not giving them that opportunity. The goal should be that each person gets to achieve their full potential. Most people trapped in the welfare system are not getting to do that.

It was Ronald Reagan who said, we fought a war on poverty and poverty won. Do you agree with that?

Let’s put it this way: We are certainly not beating poverty. We may have had a draw but that’s not where we want to be.

Increasing the minimum wage is ""actually good policy,"" New York Times columnist Paul Krugman wrote in a blog post on Saturday.

President Obama proposed raising the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $9 an hour during his State of the Union address last week. While many on the right say that raising the minimum wage could make it more difficult for employers to hire people and therefore cause higher unemployment, Krugman argued in his post that this simply is not the case.

""There just isn’t any evidence that raising the minimum wage near current levels would reduce employment,"" Krugman wrote, citing a report by John Schmitt from the Center for Economic Policy and Research.

This opinion is a hotly contested one. A 2011 study from the London School of Economics found that higher minimum wages do correlate with an increase in unemployment.

That said, there are a number of ways the labor market could respond to an increase in the minimum wage that do not involve cutting jobs. The Washington Post's Wonkblog has a great summary of these effects, which you can check out here.

The federal minimum wage hasn't increased since 2009. According to a 2012 study from the Center for Economic and Policy Research, the minimum wage would actually be $21.72 an hour if it kept pace with increases in worker productivity.

The same CEPR study found that if the minimum wage kept up with inflation since it peaked in real value in 1968, it would now be $10.52 per hour.

Even if the U.S. raised the federal minimum wage to $9 an hour, the nation would still have a lower minimum wage than many countries around the world. Check out this list of 9 countries with a higher minimum wage than the U.S. below:

The automatic cuts, known as sequester, kick in March 1 because the parties have failed to agree on a less-drastic plan to cut the federal budget and deficit.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi told “Fox News Sunday” that Democrats remain steadfast about tax increases being part of the deal but remain open to spending cuts.

“What we do need is more revenue and new cuts,” the California congresswoman said.

Pelosi said Democrats were “not talking about raising taxes,” but want to close tax loopholes, including those for U.S. oil companies.

More On This...

She also argued Democrats have made $1.6 trillion in cuts over the past two years and suggested the bigger solution to the country’s economic problems is job growth.

Her argument is similar to the one President Obama -- who also has suggested stopping sequester with a mix of tax hikes and spending cuts -- is expected to restate Tuesday during his State of the Union address.

“We need a big, balanced, bold proposal,” said Pelosi, arguing more jobs result in more revenue. The interview was taped last week.

However, Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole said fellow House Republicans will “absolutely not” accept tax increases as part of a deal, which would trigger the cuts to federal defense and discretionary spending.

Cole told ABC News’ “This Week” that the president refused to agree to spending cuts during the recent, so-called “fiscal cliff” negotiations so Democrats are not getting revenue increases now.

“I think (sequester) is inevitable, quite frankly,” he said.

Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain also said Sunday that Republicans don’t want tax increases, considering they just agreed to end more than $1 trillion in income tax breaks, but suggested he might be open to closing some tax loopholes.

He also urged both parties to work together to avoid sequester, which will result in big cuts to the defense budget and roughly $1.2 trillion in total cuts over the next decade.

“I’ll take responsibility as a Republican, but we’ve got to avoid it,” said McCain, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee. “The world is a very dangerous place.”"

This is not something that Republicans want to get blamed for, but unfortunately for House Speaker John Boehner, the only way he got House Republicans to agree to raise the debt limit was by promising to enforce the spending sequester. So now he's in a bit of a trap: He has to defend the sequester at the same time that he has to deny responsibility for it.

Here's how his office tried to accomplish that balancing act today:



""These arbitrary, automatic cuts were a creation and demand of the White House in 2011,"" said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for Speaker of the House John Boehner in response to Carney's comments. ""Twice the House has passed legislation to replace them with common sense cuts and reforms. If there was any uncertainty late last year about the sequester, it was because the Democratic-controlled Senate, per usual, never lifted a finger to pass a plan to replace it.""

Actually, the truth is that the Senate has offered plenty of ways to achieve the same level of deficit reduction as the sequester—it's just that doing so would raise taxes, and Republicans refuse to do that. So it's not that the Senate hasn't lifted a finger, it's that House Republicans don't like the Senate's ideas.

Beyond that, however, there's no eternal rule that says the House couldn't just suspend the sequester indefinitely. The fact that they are insisting on equivalent cuts means that one way or another they are the ones insisting on the sequester.

Boehner's spokesman says the White House is the reason the sequester was created in the first place, back in 2011. But the truth is that Republicans were the ones pushing for the massive spending cuts—the president was trying to figure out how to keep the government running the face of GOP obstruction, and the sequester is what we ended up with.

That being said, what difference does it make who came up with the idea in 2011? It's 2013: What matters is what happens now. The GOP has within its power the ability to put aside the sequester—if it so chooses. If it doesn't, the most logical explanation is that John Boehner was telling the truth when he said this in August of 2011 after passing the debt ceiling deal that created the sequester in the first place:



When you look at this final agreement that we came to with the White House, I got 98 percent of what I wanted. I'm pretty happy.

Republicans created our fiscal nightmare. They can still fix it, or at least get out of the way, but the clock is ticking."

Treasury SecretaryJacob Lew, appearing in a series of Sunday television interviews, predicted the U.S. would likely hit its statutory borrowing limit, now $16.7 trillion, sometime after Labor Day. If lawmakers fail to lift the cap, the U.S. will be unable to borrow money to pay all its bills. [...] Republicans, for their part, in the talks have suggested changes to Medicare, including switching to a slower-growing gauge of inflation that would reduce benefits, and ""means-testing"" the program by charging well-to-do senior citizens higher premiums. In the past, Mr. Obama has said he could consider both ideas as part of a larger deal. Republicans also proposed raising the eligibility age for Medicare, a concept the White House dislikes. [...] The meetings have been relatively informal, with Republicans offering ideas for where to find budget savings which, if implemented, could diminish the across-the-board cuts to the budget. Republicans have made clear they won't accept raising new tax revenues to erase the sequester, a Senate GOP aide said. [...] Mr. Lew said on Sunday the White House wants to replace the sequester with a combination of changes to entitlement programs and adjustments to the tax code—often code for raising revenue by eliminating tax breaks.

President Obama is going to try to flip the idea of his Grand Bargain with a new trade of taxes for jobs. But that doesn't mean Grand Bargain 1.0, entitlement cuts for taxes, isn't still proceeding on a separate track. It is. The bullshit caucus , the Republican senators who went around leader Mitch McConnell to broker a filibuster deal with Harry Reid, are still being wooed by senior administration staff, including Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, and it still puts Medicare and Social Security on the chopping block Great. Republicans have ruled out new tax revenue and White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough ""and other senior aides"" are still meeting with them, still offering up benefits cuts from Medicare and Social Security [the ""slower-growing gauge of inflation"" would be the chained CPI for Social Security, not Medicare as the story suggests]. Once upon a time, President Obama promised no entitlement cuts unless he got revenue. And yet, here we still are with benefit cuts on the table and no new taxes on the table. Now he's negotiating for adjustments to the tax code, which Republicans will probably insist on making revenue neutral.

With his latest pivot to the economy, and a renewed focus on income inequality and the middle class and jobs, the last thing President Obama should be doing is offering up these programs—which are so vital to the income security of the majority of seniors—for cuts. Especially when he's making the offer to Republicans who are as intractable on revenue as ever."

On Wednesday the House is expected to vote on a Republican bill that would let the Treasury Department borrow new money until mid-May.

President Obama will not oppose the bill, even though he would prefer a longer term debt ceiling increase, the White House said.

The legislation could still be tripped up in the House or Senate, but there's a good chance for House passage at the very least.

""It's not a slam dunk. But the main thing is that the Republicans will cave on the debt ceiling. So we're now just arguing over the details,"" said Greg Valliere, chief political strategist for Potomac Research Group.

On CNN.com: House GOP wants to balance budget in 10 years

House Republicans have said for the past two years that they would not raise the debt ceiling unless the increase is matched by a comparable amount of spending cuts. But the bill they're voting on this week doesn't include that quid pro quo.

Instead, it includes a provision that House Speaker John Boehner called ""no budget, no pay.""

Here's how the bill would work:

The proposal would suspend the debt ceiling until May 18, which means Treasury could continue to borrow without restriction. The debt ceiling would then be restored at its current level of $16.394 trillion plus however much Treasury borrowed during the suspension.

Related: Debt ceiling FAQs

Come May 18, Treasury could once again use ""extraordinary measures"" to stave off the prospect of default for up to two months, giving Congress a little more time to raise the debt ceiling, said Pete Davis, a former Hill budget staffer who now runs Davis Capital Investment Ideas.

The bill would also open a path to a longer term increase: It would require the House and Senate to each agree by April 15 to a budget resolution for fiscal year 2014. And such a measure, which is intended to set spending and revenue levels for the next five to ten years, can include debt ceiling increases, Davis said.

If the House and Senate don't meet the April 15 deadline, lawmakers' pay would be withheld until they pass a budget resolution or until the current Congress ends in January 2015.

So it's not that lawmakers won't get paid if they miss the deadline. Their salaries would be held in escrow and paid out at some point later.

House Republicans, in coming up with the temporary debt ceiling solution, are in essence conceding the debt ceiling fight is not their best shot at securing spending cuts and substantive deficit reduction.

And that change could spur progress toward meaningful budget talks.

""The House Republicans' plan shows a constructive shift of focus away from threats of default and towards the need for a budget. That should improve the chances for negotiations over a serious fiscal plan,"" Concord Coalition Executive Director Robert Bixby said in a statement.

Two make-or-break opportunities loom for those negotiations. Unless Congress act by March 2, the pending sequester would trigger close to $1 trillion in defense and non-defense spending cuts that no one in Congress likes.

And if they fail to act by March 27, federal funding will expire entirely and the government would be shut down until lawmakers can find some way to agree on spending and taxes for the next year or at least another few months."

30-year%2C fixed mortgage rate averages 3.53%25 nationwide

Nearly 12 million homeowners hold loans from Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac

Proposal would reduce rates%2C up-front fees%2C eliminate appraisal costs

WASHINGTON (AP) — A sharply divided Congress isn't likely to jump at President Barack Obama's challenge for quick passage of a mortgage refinancing bill that supporters say could help millions of homeowners save big each year and boost the economy.

Obama praised the legislation in his State of the Union speech last week, saying the proposal would help more homeowners with mortgages backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac take advantage of low interest rates and refinance their loans.

Even with mortgage rates near a 50-year low, Obama said, too many families that have never missed a payment and want to refinance are being turned down.

""That's holding our entire economy back, and we need to fix it,"" the president said. ""Right now, there's a bill in this Congress that would give every responsible homeowner in America the chance to save $3,000 a year by refinancing at today's rates. Democrats and Republicans have supported it before.""

The economy's slow recovery from the recession gives the idea urgency, Obama said. ""Send me that bill,"" he told members of Congress listening to his speech in the House chamber.

The proposal is part of a push by Democrats and the White House to help homeowners take advantage of low interest rates as a way to help the housing market recover and to give the economy a shot in the arm.

While the bill could gain traction in the Democratic-controlled Senate, it faces a rough road in the GOP-run House, where many Republicans favor scaling back the government's role in the housing market as a way of aiding the economy. Similar versions of the measure died in the House and Senate's lame duck sessions last year.

""At the moment, it's an uphill battle,"" said Rep. Peter Welch, D-Vt., who plans to file the House version of the bill.

Welch said he will reach out to Republicans this year in hopes of building more support, but the bill's association with the government-controlled Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the federal housing agencies partly blamed for the collapse of the housing market, hurts its support base among GOP lawmakers.

""The American taxpayers have already sunk $190 billion dollars into the operations of Fannie and Freddie,"" said Rep. Randy Neugebauer, R-Tex., a member of the House Financial Services Committee. ""It's time that we wind their operations down instead of using them as a piggy bank for failed programs that further delay the housing recovery. ""

In the Senate, Democrats Bob Menendez of New Jersey and Barbara Boxer of California have legislation to aid borrowers who are current on their loans backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, but who are not able to refinance because their home values have declined too much.

Nearly 12 million homeowners have Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans and stand to benefit refinancing, the two senators said. Many can't refinance at a lower rate because of red tape and high fees. The red tape has reduced competition among banks, so borrowers pay higher interest rates than they would if they were able to shop around more, according to the senators.

The bill also would reduce up-front fees that borrowers pay on refinances and eliminate appraisal costs for all borrowers. The measure seeks to expand the Obama administration's Home Affordable Refinancing Program, which saves an average homeowner about $2,500 per year, they said.

""Homeowners will have more money in their pockets, Fannie and Freddie will see fewer foreclosures, and the housing market and economy will continue building momentum,"" Boxer said.

Among the bill's supporters are the Mortgage Bankers Association, the National Association of Realtors and the National Association of Home Builders.

""It is another tool that can be out there to help stabilize the housing market and kick start the economy if consumers can, in fact, put another $100 bucks in their pockets every month,"" said John Hudson, government affairs chairman of the Association of Mortgage Professionals.

Similar proposals by Boxer and Menendez last year got bogged down in the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee. Republican attempts to add amendments on other housing issues beyond refinancing led to a stalemate.

Twenty Senate Democrats are co-sponsors of this year's bill, but no Republicans have signed on.

""I support finding ways to smartly streamline the refinance process, but I'm not sure that eliminating all documentation requirements makes sense,"" said GOP Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, a committee member. ""I also think we need to quickly move beyond short-term stimulus and start focusing on the structural issues in our housing finance system.""

Sen. Mike Crapo, the committee's top Republican, declined through a spokeswoman to comment on the bill.

Welch's House bill also died during the last Congress. Welch accused Republicans of not wanting to give Obama an election-year boost by passing the mortgage refinance measure.

""Last year was even tougher because it was an election year,"" said Welch. ""The Republican leadership wanted Obama to fail."""

On Tuesday, it found one close to home.

Tours of the executive mansion will be canceled starting March 9, the White House announced, citing “staffing reductions resulting from sequestration.” The tours will not be rescheduled and the freeze will be in effect “until further notice.”

The cancellation will annoy plenty of tourists who tour the White House after securing their tickets well in advance through their elected representative’s office. It will also certainly annoy those congressional offices that must begin notifying disappointed constituents.

“We very much regret having to take this action, particularly during the popular spring touring season,” the White House said in a recorded message on the tour hotline.

QUIZ: How much do you know about sequestration?

Within hours of the announcement, Republicans began to criticize the decision as a stunt. One GOP congressman offered his own solution to the budget cutting at the White House. In an amendment to a bill to fund the government, Texas Rep. Louis Gohmert proposed that none of the money “may be used to transport the president to or from a golf course until public tours of the White House resume.”

The automatic budget cuts are a result of a deficit-reduction deal signed into law in 2011. Lawmakers and the White House agreed to the across-the-board cuts, hoping that the prospect of finding $85 billion in immediate savings would spark compromise on a broader deficit and debt-reduction deal. It did not.

In the lead-up to the budget cuts, which kicked in on Friday, the White House tried to pressure Republican lawmakers to reach a deal by highlighting the pain that would come from axing federal services. But its top spokespeople on the matter occasionally overstepped.

Education Secretary Arne Duncan on Monday apologized for saying that teachers in a West Virginia school district were receiving “pink slips” because of the budget cuts. The district’s superintendent told the Washington Post that the teachers were receiving transfer notices and the move was not directly related to the federal funding cuts.

Republicans pounced on Duncan’s comments and other claims as examples of the president hyping the cuts for political gain. On Tuesday, the news of the canceled tours prompted similar skepticism among some on the Hill and the GOP-led House administration committee offered tourists an alternative: “House Admin welcomes Americans visiting D.C. to tour Capitol instead,” the committee tweeted.

In a sign that the warnings may have gone too far, President Obama sought to dial back some of the rhetoric. Most Americans, he said, won’t immediately feel the effects of the complex process known as sequestration, which is expected to unfold like a slow-motion budgetary car crash.

“The longer these cuts remain in place, the greater the damage to our economy — a slow grind that will intensify with each passing day,” Obama said after meeting congressional leaders for less than an hour in the Oval Office. “This is not going to be an apocalypse.... It’s just dumb. And it’s going to hurt.”

The pain of $85 billion in across-the-board cuts will kick in next month when agencies are forced to order air traffic controllers, food inspectors, prosecutors, janitors and other federal workers to take one or two days of unpaid leave for every two-week pay period. Most federal agencies are required to give workers at least 30 days’ notice of any furloughs.

The slow ramp-up gives Obama and congressional Republicans time to strike a deal before the next crisis hits — a potential government shutdown. The legislation authorizing money to run the government expires March 27.

The GOP-led House plans to pass a budget bill next week, giving the Democratic-controlled Senate a chance to act in time to keep the government running.

“I’m hopeful that we won’t have to deal with the threat of a government shutdown while we’re dealing with the sequester at the same time,” House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) told reporters after the White House meeting.

The Justice Department and National Labor Relations Board issued furlough notices ahead of Friday’s midnight deadline. The vast majority of furloughs at other agencies are not expected to begin until April.

The acting head of the Internal Revenue Service, Steven T. Miller, informed employees that they would not be furloughed until after tax-filing season ends this summer. They then would need to take five to seven days of unpaid leave before Sept. 30.

The Pentagon said it would furlough most of its 800,000 civilian employees one day a week — amounting to a 20% pay cut — with notifications coming this month.

Except for military pay and a few other accounts, all the Pentagon’s 2,500 budget accounts will be cut by up to 15% for the rest of the fiscal year, as the Defense Department is required to cut spending by $42.7 billion in 2013.

“As the year goes on, it will be unmistakable,” Ashton Carter, the deputy secretary of Defense, said of the effect. “It’s not subtle.”

Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said the Air Force would start reducing flying hours immediately, the Army would curtail training and the Navy would “gradually stand down” four of its air wings. A Navy air wing typically has seven or eight squadrons of aircraft.

When asked for specific actions the Pentagon would take this weekend, Carter did not name any. Over the next two weeks, he said, Army units scheduled to go to the National Training Center, a vast installation in the California desert, would see those plans canceled.

Other reductions also are coming.

Cuts in Medicare reimbursements to doctors, hospitals and other medical providers would take effect in April, as claims administrators must update their systems to implement an across-the-board 2% reduction in reimbursement payments.

Most cuts in federal funding for education would not take place until the fall as grants for the current school year have already gone out.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that $44 billion of the $85 billion in cuts would be imposed by the end of September, the first part of nearly $1.2 trillion in spending reductions over the next decade.

The greatest hit will be to the defense budget, which would see spending for 2013 cut 7.9%. Non-defense spending would be reduced 4.6%.

Some major budget items are exempt, including Social Security benefits, veterans programs, Medicaid and many types of assistance for low-income Americans.

The threat of the impending cuts already has had some effect.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials said this week that they had released “several hundred” low-risk immigrants from deportation centers nationwide in anticipation of spending reductions, though news reports Friday indicated the release may have been much larger.

Advertisement

The Federal Aviation Administration has alerted more than 100 airports with fewer than 150,000 landings and takeoffs a year, such as Santa Monica Airport, that their air traffic control towers could be shut down. Overnight shifts at an additional 60 towers could be eliminated.

In his comments Friday, Obama tried to put a personal face on the budget standoff.

“Starting tomorrow, everybody here, all the folks who are cleaning the floors at the Capitol ... they’re going to have less pay, the janitors, the security guards. They just got a pay cut, and they’ve got to figure out how to manage that,” the president said. “That’s real.”

Bruce Moyer, chairman of the Federal-Postal Coalition, an alliance of unions representing about 2.5 million federal and postal service employees, said those workers are the victims in the political standoff.

Advertisement

“It’s stressful. It’s uncertain,” he said. “You can’t actually come in to do your job as the American people expect you to if you’re furloughed.”

Obama put the blame on Republicans, saying they chose the steep cuts rather than agree to compromise. He insisted the only way to avert the cuts was a package that combined reduced spending with new revenues from higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations.

But Republicans blamed Obama for the across-the-board cuts and said they would not approve new taxes after agreeing to several in the deal to avert the so-called fiscal cliff crisis Jan. 1.

“Let’s make it clear the president got his tax hike on Jan. 1,” Boehner said. “The discussion about revenue, in my view, is over. It’s about taking on the spending problem in Washington.”

Private-sector pensions were still rare then, but California lawmakers had a particular reason for wanting a public-sector pension system: Without one, unproductive older workers had an incentive to stay on the job and just “go through the motions” to get a paycheck, as a 1929 state commission put it. Pensions would encourage those workers to retire. The commission cautioned, however, against setting a retirement age so low that it would “encourage or permit the granting of any retirement allowance to an able-bodied person in middle life.”

Accordingly, California set its initial retirement age for state workers (and, beginning in 1939, for local government employees) at 65, at a time when the average 20-year-old entering the workforce could expect to live for another 46 years, until age 66. The system’s first pensions were modest, though far from miserly. An employee’s pension equaled 1.43% of his average salary over his last five years on the job, multiplied by the total number of years he had worked. That formula typically provided longtime workers with pensions equal to half or more of their final salaries.

Advertisement

The pensions were funded by three sources: contributions from employers (that is, state and local governments); contributions from employees (though some governments opted to cover that expense); and money that the pension fund would gain by investing those contributions. With the 1929 stock market crash in mind, California opted for a cautious investment approach.

“An unsound system,” the 1929 commission warned, would be “worse than none.” The employees’ contributions were fixed, so if investment returns weren’t sufficient to fund the promised pensions, the employers’ contributions would have to increase to make up the difference.

In the decades since, that cautious approach has been virtually abandoned as public employee unions have taken control of the system. The retirement age has been lowered, benefits have been increased and investments have become far riskier.

The major changes began in the late ‘60s, during a time of rapidly growing public-sector union power. In 1968, the Legislature added one of the most expensive of all retirement perks — annual cost-of-living adjustments — to CalPERS pensions. Other enhancements followed, including, in 1970, a far more generous pension formula that would allow an employee who worked for 40 years to retire at 60 and collect an annual pension equal to 80% of his salary. If he kept working for another five years, his pension fattened to 90%. In 1983, public safety workers got an even better pension formula, and the age at which they could start collecting was dropped to 55.

Not surprisingly, the costs of the enlarged pensions weighed heavily on California’s budget. In 1991, with the nation mired in a recession and the state in a fiscal crisis, the Legislature closed the existing pension system to new workers, for whom it created a second tier. This less-expensive plan no longer required workers to make pension contributions, and it lowered the value of the pension to 1.25% of final average salary for every year worked; further, a worker couldn’t begin to receive the pension until age 65.

But that economy lasted only until 1999, when the fund’s board concocted an astonishing proposal that would take all the post-1991 state employees and retroactively put them in the older, more expensive pension system. The initiative went further, lowering the retirement age for all state workers and sweetening the pension formula for police and firefighters even more.

Advertisement

CalPERS wrote the legislation for these changes and then persuaded lawmakers to pass it. In pushing for the change, though, the pension fund downplayed the risks involved. A brochure about the proposal that CalPERS handed to legislators read like a pitch letter, not a serious fiscal analysis. It didn’t mention that state law protected government pensions, so that taxpayers would be on the hook for any shortfall in pension funding. In essence, the CalPERS position was that government workers should carry zero risk, sharing the bounty when the fund’s investments did well but losing nothing if investments went south.

During that period, many local governments tried to keep pace with the state, allowing earlier retirements, raising the percent of income paid upon retirement and decreasing contributions from employees.

Advertisement

The retirement system’s projections that it could afford all these changes relied on an 8% return on the money it held, which proved impossible, in part because of the economic downturn and in part because of bad investment decisions. That has left governments on the hook to meet the shortfalls. CalPERS has delayed much of the reckoning by shifting costs down the line, but that only means government budgets are likely to be enslaved to pension debt for decades to come.

Already, local governments are taking a huge hit. Glendale, for example, has seen its annual pension bill rocket from $1.3 million in 2003 to $13.7 million in 2007. San Jose’s tab almost doubled, from $73 million in 2001 to $122 million in 2007, and then rose even faster over the next three years, hitting a jaw-dropping $245 million in 2010. San Bernardino’s annual pension obligations rose from $5 million in 2000 to about $26 million last year. The state budget took a massive hit too: Its pension costs lurching from $611 million in 2001 to $3.5 billion in 2010.

Advertisement

In August, California did pass modest pension reforms, which apply mostly to workers hired starting this year. But Gov. Jerry Brown’s proposal to reshape the board of CalPERS in a way that would have made it more responsive to taxpayer concerns did not make it into the reform legislation.

CalPERS’ advocacy for higher benefits and its poor investment performance in recent years have locked in long-term debt in California and driven up costs, problems for which there are no easy solutions. As former Schwarzenegger administration economic advisor David Crane, a Democrat, has said of the fund’s managers and board: “They are desperate to keep truths hidden.”

His Latest Novel Is', 'The Paladin.']",David Ignatius: Sequestration is feeding a slow-motion decay,"For people (like me) who worry that the U.S. government is becoming dysfunctional, it’s worth studying the subtle and largely hidden effects of sequestration on the military and other agencies. What’s happening is the slow-motion decay of programs and readiness, which should scare the heck out of most citizens.

Sequestration, you will remember, was the meat-ax approach to budget-cutting whose consequences were thought to be so capricious and damaging that Congress would have to come up with a more rational alternative. Congress instead chose the path of least resistance — which was doing nothing — so the automatic, across-the-board cuts mandated by the 2011 Budget Control Act took effect in March.

The conventional wisdom now seems to be that sequestration isn’t as bad as people expected and that the Obama administration cried wolf unnecessarily. Sorry, but the wolf is here all right; he’s just eating the seed corn stored out of sight in the warehouse, as opposed to the food on the table. Officials at different agencies provide a sense of what’s at risk.

Let’s start with effects on the military — not because the Pentagon deserves any special budget breaks but because the consequences are easy to understand. A simple way to think about it is that sequestration is preserving what’s politically popular — soldiers’ pay, veterans’ benefits, military bases and the like — and cutting things such as training, which the politicians care little about. The effect, a few years from now, will be degraded performance.

The Air Force has grounded 13 fighter squadrons, or about one-third of its total. That amounts to about 250 planes. The danger isn’t that we’ll be defenseless to a foreign attack but that pilots who don’t fly and mechanics who don’t fix engines will lose their edge — or maybe quit and work for the commercial airlines. The Air Force is canceling for the rest of the year its big “Red Flag” combat training exercises, along with courses at the Air Force Weapons School.

“We are not as capable as we historically have been at handling a pop-up contingency,” says an Air Force spokesman.

The Army is sharply cutting training above the basic squad and platoon level. All but one of the Combat Training Center rotations scheduled for brigades this fiscal year have been canceled. Depot maintenance has been halted for the rest of the fiscal year, meaning that six divisions won’t have the necessary equipment readiness. The Army will cut 37,000 flying hours from its aviation training, creating a shortfall of 500 pilots by the end of the fiscal year.

“Should a contingency arise, there may not be enough time to avoid sending forces into harm’s way unprepared,” Gen. Ray Odierno, the Army chief of staff, told Congress in February.

The Navy reports that by the end of this fiscal year, two-thirds of its non-deployed ships and aviation squadrons won’t meet readiness targets. The Navy has also delayed planned fleet deployments, including the aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman to the Persian Gulf and the frigate USS Thach to the South Atlantic. “In the near term, we will not be able to respond in the way the nation has expected and depended on us,” Adm. Jonathan Greenert, the chief of naval operations, told Congress in February.

The effects on the intelligence community are also scary. Contracts, collection systems and analysis are all being trimmed. Some satellite reconnaissance systems may be decommissioned. “We’ll reduce global coverage and may risk missing the early signs of a threat,” says Shawn Turner, spokesman for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.

Now, let’s look at civilian programs. Here, again, the effects are mostly hidden from immediate view, but they could impact the long-term health, education and welfare of the country.

The National Institutes of Health has delayed or halted 700 research awards that help fund the study of diseases affecting millions of Americans. The Labor Department estimates that 1.5 million claimants for emergency unemployment compensation have been affected. The Education Department says nearly $600 million has been cut from special education funding and $700 million from assistance to low-income school districts.

What’s depressing is that the sequestration cuts are being imposed in part so that Congress can avoid making decisions about real fiscal reforms that add revenues and reduce spiraling future costs in Medicare and Social Security. People who wonder why the federal government’s performance is deteriorating should consider what their family or business finances would look like if they had to be approved by Congress.

Born In San Francisco', 'He S A Graduate Of Stanford University.']",McManus: President Obama 3.0,"We got a good long look at the second-term edition of Barack Obama last week, and he’s sounding more like Bill Clinton every day.

It’s not all that surprising. Over the last two years, Obama has turned repeatedly to Clinton for counsel. And Obama was a target of Clinton’s advice even before he asked for it. In a 2011 book and a series of public appearances, the former president laid out a polite but biting critique of Obama’s first-term stumbles.

Warning No. 1, coming from the man who proclaimed (in his 1996 State of the Union message) that “the era of big government is over,” was that Obama shouldn’t fall into the trap of defending big government.

TRANSCRIPT: 2013 State of the Union

Advertisement

Sure enough, in Obama’s State of the Union speech last week, we heard this: “It’s not a bigger government we need, but a smarter government.”

Obama’s rhetoric still aims high; he hasn’t given up all hope of transforming American politics. But his concrete proposals these days are smaller and more Clintonian, a necessary adjustment in the face of entrenched Republican opposition.

In his State of the Union address, Obama promised to revive manufacturing jobs, but the major details turned out to be modest: long-proposed tax changes to make “offshoring” more expensive and $1 billion to create “innovation institutes.”

He vowed to repair crumbling infrastructure but suggested that, with little money available, he’d settle for fixing the country’s most dangerous bridges.

He called for universal preschool education, but the programs he offered turned out to be not quite universal and mostly aimed at spurring states to act.

In a sense, we’re seeing the third version of the Obama presidency.

Obama 1.0 was the ambitious Obama of 2009, swept into office in a landslide amid economic crisis. That expansive Obama tackled everything at once — a giant economic stimulus program, a healthcare law and financial reform — and intended to pass immigration reform and climate-change legislation too.

But that agenda turned out to be too ambitious, even with both houses of Congress in Democratic hands. When the economy didn’t spring back to life in the ill-named “Recovery Summer” of 2010, voters revolted and delivered the House of Representatives to the tea party Republicans.

Advertisement

Obama 2.0 tried to draw lessons from those setbacks. If voters were worried about the deficit, he’d work on the deficit. He spent much of 2011 trying to negotiate a “grand bargain” over spending and taxes with House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio), but they couldn’t find middle ground. Many Republicans didn’t want a compromise; they simply wanted to turn Obama out of office.

So, by the end of 2011, we began to see Obama 3.0: a more confrontational president bent on reestablishing a popular mandate for his core policies, beginning with tax hikes on the wealthy. That Obama, the Obama of last year’s election campaign, turned out to be pretty skilled at his job, winning convincingly in November.

Now, as the second term gets under way, Obama is still traveling around the country campaigning for modest new government programs and against Republican obstruction. Last week, he went to North Carolina to talk about manufacturing, to Georgia to talk about preschool education and to Illinois to talk about gun control and the minimum wage.

Does the president really expect to win a $9 minimum wage, universal preschool education and a ban on assault weapons despite the GOP-held House? No.

Advertisement

But those are proposals that please not only confirmed Democrats but many swing voters as well. Provoking Republicans into opposing them helps Obama cast the GOP as a party of cranky conservatives — another tactic at which Clinton excelled.

There’s an irony, of course, in the echoes of Bill Clinton that turn up in Obama’s strategy today. In the race for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008, Obama not only ran against Hillary Rodham Clinton; he dismissed her husband’s tenure in the White House as unimpressive.

“Ronald Reagan changed the trajectory of America … in a way that Bill Clinton did not,” Obama said then. Reagan “put us on a fundamentally different path, because the country was ready for it,” Obama said, a circumstance he clearly thought was also the case in 2008.

But Obama 3.0 is a more practical man. He no longer talks brashly about transforming American politics, even though his 2012 campaign may turn out to have done so.

Bill Clinton’s second term wasn’t an unqualified success; he spent much of his tenure battling personal scandals and impeachment. (Somehow, Obama appears unlikely to follow that pattern.) But Clinton left office with a solid list of accomplishments, high popularity and a healthy economy. That kind of legacy is another thing Obama would like to emulate.

But myriad other federally funded programs also are threatened, and the combined effect is expected to slow the momentum that California’s economy has been building over the last year.

As the state braces for pain from so-called sequestration, there are warnings of long delays at airport security checkpoints, potential slowdowns in cargo movement at harbors and cutbacks to programs, including meals for seniors and projects to combat neighborhood blight.

Despite the grim scenarios from local and state officials, economists say the cuts’ overall blow to the economy would be modest, felt more acutely in regions such as defense-heavy San Diego and by Californians dependent on federal programs, such as college students who rely on work-study jobs to pay for school.

Critics say the cuts come at an inopportune time because the economic recovery in the U.S. and California is still weak.

“We need stimulus, not premature austerity,” Gov. Jerry Brown said during a break at the National Governors Assn. meeting in Washington.

Rep. John Campbell (R-Irvine) contends that critics of the cuts are exaggerating the effects.

“If we can’t do this, what can we do” to reduce Washington’s red ink, he asked. “We ought to be panicked about the day when people won’t buy our debt anymore because we borrowed too much.”

If automatic spending cuts occur as planned, the growth in the country’s gross domestic product is likely to slow by 0.4 percentage points this year, from about 2% to 1.6%, economists said.

California’s GDP would see a similar slowdown. The state stands to lose as much as $10 billion in federal funding this year, according to Stephen Levy, director of the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy in Palo Alto.

Levy said the more than $1 trillion in cuts planned over the next decade include “items in the federal budget that invest for the future,” such as support for research and clean energy, that particularly affect California because of its “innovation economy.”

The ripple effects the cuts might have on business and consumer confidence — which would further dampen economic activity — remain to be seen, said Jason Sisney, a deputy at the state’s nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office.

“We’re at a point where gains in housing and construction markets have begun to take hold,” Sisney said. “A slowdown from sequestration would come at just the moment that the economy was beginning to right itself.”

Jerry Nickelsburg, a UCLA economist who writes a quarterly economic forecast on the Golden State, said the state’s recent economic gains would provide a buffer against sequestration.

“California can absorb it,” Nickelsburg said. “Will it slow economic growth? The answer is yes. Will it result in negative economic growth? I think the answer is no.”

Los Angeles officials project that the city would lose more than $100 million at a time when they’re struggling to close a hole in the city’s budget.

Douglas Guthrie, chief executive of the Los Angeles city housing authority, said Monday that rent subsidies to as many as 15,000 low-income families would be cut an average $200 a month, forcing many families to search for less expensive housing. His agency also might face as many as 80 layoffs in an already reduced workforce.

But Guthrie said in a letter to the Los Angeles City Council that the housing authority must plan for the “painful consequences” of the federal budget cuts and is preparing to send warning notices to participants in the housing assistance program “as soon as we see that the cuts are made and there are no immediate prospects to resolve the budget crisis.”

At Yosemite National Park, snow plowing of a key route over the Sierra would be delayed, ranger-led programs are likely to be reduced and the park would face “less frequent trash pickup, loss of campground staff, and reduced focus on food storage violations, all of which contribute to visitor safety concerns and increased bear mortality rates,” according to the National Park Service.

Some programs, such as Social Security, would be spared from the $85 billion in cuts nationwide due to kick in Friday. But defense programs are expected to be cut by about 13% for the remainder of the fiscal year and domestic spending by about 9%, according to the White House budget office.

The Obama administration sought Monday to highlight the effects close to home in an effort to step up the pressure on Congress to replace across-the-board cuts with more targeted reductions and new tax revenue collected from taxpayers earning more than $1 million a year.

The Los Angeles Unified School District is bracing for a loss of $37 million a year in federal funding. Supt. John Deasy said Monday that he is sending a letter to the California congressional delegation warning about the “potential very grave impact” of the cuts on Los Angeles schools.

Rachelle Pastor Arizmendi, director of early childhood education at the Pacific Asian Consortium for Employment in Los Angeles, said she anticipated that the cuts would cost her agency $980,000 in federal Head Start funding. That would force PACE to eliminate preschool for about 120 children ages 3 to 5.

“It’s not just a number,” she said. “This is closing down classrooms. This is putting our children behind when they’re going to kindergarten.”

The nonprofit serves about 2,000 children, providing most of them two meals a day in addition to preschool education. The cuts would mean PACE would have to lay off four of its 20 teachers, forcing the closure of eight Head Start classrooms, Arizmendi said.

“Manhattan has serious affordability problems,” said Mr. Braconi, the economist. In the last decade, the percentage of people who are paying “unaffordable rents” (defined as more than 30 percent of their income) has increased significantly, according to a report issued in September by the city’s comptroller.

If that trend continues, it will feed the perennial panic that Manhattan’s middle class is on the brink of extinction, no longer able to cope with the city’s prices and fast retreating to its natural habitat, the suburbs.

It is true that the middle class here is smaller than anywhere else in the country. It is true that price pressures from both real estate and the cost of living are not slowing down anytime soon. But it is also true that calamity has been forecast for over a century now.

“Soon, there will be no New Yorkers,” proclaimed the Sunday magazine of The New York Times in 1907, in an article that detailed how families making $1,000 to $3,000 a year — $24,000 to $72,000 a year in today’s dollars — were being pushed out because of increasing rents, and servants’ wages, as well as the crushing cost of ice and coal. Adjusted for inflation, laundry alone for a family cost $115 a week. A pound of chicken? $8.08. Rent, on the other hand, for a “small, middle-class flat in a decent, but unfashionable locality,” would seem to be a bargain in today’s market, at the price of $272 per room per month.

In 1968, New York magazine documented the mad scramble for affordable apartments in a cover article detailing the extreme lengths to which average people went to secure one. “Surgeons have postponed operations, housewives have gone back to work, hippies have cut their hair and families have destroyed their pets,” the magazine reported. “Little hope is held out for the middle-income ($15-20,000 a year) people, career girls who do not want roommates and couples with more than one drawer-sized infant.” Brownstones that had sold for $125,000 in 1958, according to the article, were selling 10 years later for twice that much (in today’s dollars, a jump from $827,000 to $1.65 million).

Reports of the middle class’s demise also appeared in 1978, 1998, 2006 and 2009, when The New York Observer chimed in with “City to Middle Class: Just Not That Into You.”

But members of the middle class remain, scattered among the elite and the growing numbers of the working poor, in that place where lucky deals and tiny kitchens converge, wondering, just as they did in 1910 and 1968, how long they’ll be able to stay put.

Ms. Azeez in TriBeCa is pondering the question. The only young people she sees moving in around her are often buoyed by parental support, given an apartment at graduation the way she was given a Seiko watch. As her own friends and neighbors age or die out, she wonders, “who is going to take our place?”"

Mayor Vincent C. Gray vetoed legislation Thursday that would force the District’s largest retailers to pay their workers significantly more, choosing the potential for jobs and development at home over joining a national fight against low-wage work.

Gray’s quandary is playing out in many U.S. cities, where local leaders who generally sympathize with worker causes are also eager to lure jobs and commerce for their constituents. Retailers, most notably Wal-Mart, have placed an increasing focus on urban expansion, while unions and advocates for workers have pushed measures like the District’s “living wage” bill as a valuable hedge against the proliferation of low-paying jobs.

The veto, which is unlikely to be overridden by the D.C. Council, clears the way for Wal-Mart to continue its entry into the District — plans years in the making that were thrown into question after lawmakers embraced the wage proposal this year.

Gray (D) announced his veto in a letter delivered to Council Chairman Phil Mendelson on Thursday morning. It explained his opposition to the bill and tried to soften the political consequences by disclosing his intention to seek a minimum-wage increase from all employers, not just large retailers.

In the letter, Gray said the measure was “not a true living-wage bill,” because its effect would be limited to “a small fraction of the District’s workforce.” He called the bill a “job-killer,” citing threats from Wal-Mart and other retailers that they would not locate in the city if the bill becomes law.

“If I were to sign this bill into law, it would do nothing but hinder our ability to create jobs, drive away retailers, and set us back on the path to prosperity for all,” he said.

In an interview, Gray did not say what minimum wage he would seek, except that any increase would be “reasonable” and would come after consultation with lawmakers and interested parties.

Mendelson, who shepherded the bill through the council after introducing similar bills for years to no avail, said he was disappointed by the mayor’s decision. “The issue is, do we want to attract low-paying jobs?” he said. “We want decent jobs that pay decent wages so our residents can afford to live in the District of Columbia.”

The bill, known as the Large Retailer Accountability Act, would require retailers with corporate sales of $1 billion or more and operating District stores of at least 75,000 square feet to pay their employees a “living wage” — no less than $12.50 an hour in combined wages and benefits. The proposal includes an exception for employers who collectively bargain with their workers. Existing employers would have four years to come into compliance.

The city’s minimum wage is $8.25 an hour. The bill would raise the annual earnings of a full-time employee making the lowest legal wage from about $17,000 to $26,000.

While the bill’s supporters repeatedly said it was not targeted at Wal-Mart, the debate was inextricably tied to the retail giant’s plans, announced in late 2010, to open as many as six stores in the city in the coming months and years.

The union exemption and square-footage requirement rankled Wal-Mart officials, who said those provisions created an uneven playing field — particularly with the unionized grocery chains they plan to compete with in the city.

View Graphic D.C. lawmakers gave final approval Wednesday to a bill requiring certain large retailers to pay their employees a 50 percent premium over the city’s minimum wage, a day after Wal-Mart warned the law would jeopardize their plans in the city.

A day ahead of the bill’s final passage in July, Wal-Mart told council members and the public that it would not pursue three of the six planned stores and would explore options for withdrawing from the others should legislators proceed. The ultimatum changed no votes on the council.

Wal-Mart spokesman Steven Restivo called the veto “good news for D.C. residents,” saying Gray chose “jobs, economic development and common sense over special interests.”

Restivo said the company will move forward with its stores in the District: “We look forward to finishing the work we started in the city almost three years ago.”

Wal-Mart’s entry into the city has prompted a political identity crisis for many elected officials, forced to reconcile their liberal, pro-union sentiments with the desire to create jobs and better retail options for their constituents.

Key council members, including Mendelson (D) and Business Affairs Committee chair Vincent B. Orange (D-At Large), were unabashed in support of the bill. But Gray made no secret in recent months that, for him, jobs and retail took priority.

Wal-Mart's entry into the city was an early political coup for Gray, and he personally lobbied — some say threatened — top company executives to commit to a store at the Skyland Town Center development not far from his home in Ward 7.

The Skyland store is among those Wal-Mart has threatened to abandon should the living-wage bill become law. Gray said Thursday that the effect of the retailer’s ultimatum was not a decisive factor.

“If I thought that this was really going to be otherwise a tremendous benefit for the people of the District of Columbia, then I would have swallowed hard and done it,” he said.

A coalition of labor unions, clergy members and progressive political activists backing the bill has canvassed neighborhoods and held media events in hopes of pressuring Gray into signing the bill. Wal-Mart and other large retailers, they argued, could pay their workers better wages without significantly harming their bottom lines.

Some said they considered Wal-Mart’s ultimatum a bluff; others said they would rather see the retailer walk away than accept its “poverty wages.” Wal-Mart has pushed back on the notion that its wages are considerably less than other retailers, saying its pay would be “competitive” and accusing the grocery workers union of signing a contract that pays some of its members wages that would not comply with the living-wage law.

Business groups, other retailers and even former mayor Anthony A. Williams urged Gray to veto the bill, citing the potential job losses, the effect on grocery access, “retail leakage” to the suburbs and potential harm to the city’s business reputation.

Gray’s decision sets up a final political showdown with the council, which can override the veto with a two-thirds vote within 30 days. Shortly after he received the veto letter, Mendelson informed colleagues that the override vote will take place Tuesday, at the council’s first legislative meeting since giving the bill final passage in July.

An override would require the approval of nine of the council’s 13 members. The bill passed 8 to 5 , and no member has since acknowledged that their vote could change.

Mike Wilson, a spokesman for Respect DC, blasted Gray’s veto but said he was hopeful the council would overturn it.

“Unfortunately, the mayor bought the line of the Wal-Mart lobbyists and the other sort of corporate interests that have been pushing against it,” Wilson said. “We’re counting on the council to do the right thing on Tuesday, to stand with the residents and override his poor decision.”

One of the members who voted against the bill, Mary M. Cheh (D-Ward 3), said that although she disliked Wal-Mart’s ultimatum in July, her view had hardened that it could put the District at a competitive disadvantage at luring retailers from Maryland and Virginia.

“When I weigh the District’s interests, they weigh more heavily in voting against the bill. I’m not for Wal-Mart or against Wal-Mart,” she said, “I’m against this bill.”

The District's living-wage measure has followed a nearly identical trajectory to a similar bill taken up by the Chicago City Council in 2006. With Wal-Mart planning its first stores there, lawmakers passed the bill, sending it to Mayor Richard M. Daley, who vetoed it. An override vote narrowly failed.

Wal-Mart now operates 10 Chicago stores.

Peters', 'Jonathan Weisman']",2 Parties’ Budgets Show Big Rift,"WASHINGTON — Senate Democrats and House Republicans on Tuesday outlined vastly divergent approaches to shoring up the government’s finances, a reminder of how far apart they remain on fiscal policy even as both sides insist publicly that a bipartisan compromise is possible.

As part of the effort to find common ground, President Obama made a rare appearance at a gathering of Democratic senators — his first of four meetings with lawmakers on Capitol Hill this week — to explore ways that the two parties could overcome differences that have deadlocked the budget process for much of the last five years.

But in many ways, the two parties seemed to be working in parallel universes.

House Republicans, led by Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, presented a tax and spending plan that relies on many of the same policies that became lightning rods for critics during the 2012 presidential campaign, when Mr. Ryan was the party’s vice-presidential nominee. At the White House, a senior administration official said that the Republican budget demonstrated how complicated negotiations would be.

The Republican plan sets out to balance the budget in a decade and would cut spending by $4.6 trillion through 2023, in large part by rolling back many of Mr. Obama’s signature legislative accomplishments. It would repeal the health care overhaul of 2009, eliminate the subsidized insurance exchanges and Medicaid expansion that make up the core of the law, and turn Medicare into a system of private insurance plans financed by federal vouchers."

With remarkable speed, the House overwhelmingly approved legislation to give the secretary of transportation enough financial flexibility to shift as much as $253 million to the air traffic control system, less than a week after the onset of politically problematic flight delays driven by across-the-board spending cuts. The money will be shifted from airport improvement funds, and none would come from additional revenues, once a key demand of Mr. Obama and the Democrats. The 361-to-41 vote came less than 24 hours after the Senate rushed the measure through.

Republicans claimed victory. “Consider that the Democrats’ opening position was they would only replace the sequester with tax increases,” Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the House majority leader, said in a memo to members before the vote. “By last night, Senate Democrats were adopting our targeted ‘cut this, not that’ approach. This victory is in large part a result of our standing together.”

The Congressional action effectively undoes one of the thorniest results of “sequestration,” the $85 billion in spending cuts that took effect March 1 and have rippled across the federal government. With the president’s promised signature, Democrats will lose significant leverage they had hoped would force Republicans into a larger agreement since the flight delays were seen as the sort of inconvenience that could force a reversal of the cuts."

Detroit Free Press

Dan Akerson says GM shouldn%27t have to repay Treasury for losses from the bailout

The government lost about %2410 billion

He says the government benefited from its investment

Correction: An earlier version of this story omitted the significance of gender in describing Mary Barra's historical ranking among General Motor CEOs.

WASHINGTON -- The General Motors bailout may have cost the government $10 billion, but GM CEO Dan Akerson rejects any suggestion that the company should compensate for the losses.

He says Treasury officials took the same risk assumed by anyone who purchases stock.

""I would not accept the premise that this was a bad deal,"" Akerson said during a question-and-answer session at the National Press Club in Washington. He also said the government's $49.5-billion aid to GM helped save billions of dollars in tax revenue and government social services.

Akerson spoke in the wake of Treasury announcement last week that it sold its last shares in GM and Akerson's decision to retire in January. The automaker's board of directors named Mary Barra, the company's first woman CEO, to succeed Akerson.

The speech also came as GM announced it is investing $1.2-billion in five U.S. plants, which Akerson said is a recognition that after 15 straight profitable quarters the automaker can't rest on its success.

""We are in a capital-intensive business that demands steady and significant investment,"" Akerson said, as he discussed many of the changes that had to be made to the automaker's corporate structure after exiting a ""quick rinse"" bankruptcy in 2009.

Akerson said it fell to him and his team to restore GM's good name, transform operations and ""put quality and the customer back at the center"" of the company's decision-making, a process he called ""the biggest cultural change we've been able to infuse into the new GM.""

He said GM's bloated and overly complex operations have been streamlined, products are better and, with the government's help, a crushing debt was reduced.

""We've been trying to fix this airplane while in the air,"" he said.

Akerson said that GM repaid all the debt issued by the government beginning in December 2008 when George W. Bush was still president and extending into the first year of Barack Obama's presidency. He added that it was the Treasury's decision -- though one he clearly supported -- to take an ownership stake in the form of company shares.

Asked whether GM should pay the difference between the amount the government provided the company and the return from the sale of the shares, Akerson said the ""die was cast"" by Treasury when it decided to take shares. For GM to make up for any shortfall could result in lawsuits from other shareholders. Those investors expect the company to resume paying a dividend for the first time since it exited bankruptcy in July 2009.

He also defended the deal as one that saved millions of jobs, saying ""net-net, it was a positive for the U.S. economy.""

Now, it will be up to Barra to continue GM's success. Monday's news that the automaker is upgrading and expanding facdtories in Flint, Detroit-Hamtramck and Romulus; as well as others in Toledo, Ohio, and Bedford, Ind., was meant to demonstrate that momentum.

""This will bring the four-year total of investments in our U.S. plants to more than $10 billion,"" Akerson said. He said about 7,500 people already work in those five plants and today's announcements will create or retain more than 1,100 jobs."

“The fiscal situation is grave enough, the threat of sequestration is so serious in terms of its impact on our domestic priorities and on our security, that I believe that if we can get this in front of the Congress, because it will have huge public support, it will pass,” Mr. Levin said in an interview.

But even the architects of such efforts are pessimistic that they have time to win passage.

“I think sequester’s going to happen,” Mr. Coburn said. “I think people want it to happen.”

Yet the economic recovery remains weak, and unemployment high. This week, Washington got one of the first signs of how the sequester might play out in the economy, when government figures showed that the economy had contracted in the final three months of 2012, largely a result of a 22 percent drop in military spending.

Economists cautioned that they did not expect such a precipitous decline to continue in the coming quarters. Moreover, the drop came after a surge in military spending in the third quarter, as offices rushed to spend money obligated to the 2012 fiscal year."

30-year%2C fixed mortgage rate averages 3.53%25 nationwide

Nearly 12 million homeowners hold loans from Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac

Proposal would reduce rates%2C up-front fees%2C eliminate appraisal costs

WASHINGTON (AP) — A sharply divided Congress isn't likely to jump at President Barack Obama's challenge for quick passage of a mortgage refinancing bill that supporters say could help millions of homeowners save big each year and boost the economy.

Obama praised the legislation in his State of the Union speech last week, saying the proposal would help more homeowners with mortgages backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac take advantage of low interest rates and refinance their loans.

Even with mortgage rates near a 50-year low, Obama said, too many families that have never missed a payment and want to refinance are being turned down.

""That's holding our entire economy back, and we need to fix it,"" the president said. ""Right now, there's a bill in this Congress that would give every responsible homeowner in America the chance to save $3,000 a year by refinancing at today's rates. Democrats and Republicans have supported it before.""

The economy's slow recovery from the recession gives the idea urgency, Obama said. ""Send me that bill,"" he told members of Congress listening to his speech in the House chamber.

The proposal is part of a push by Democrats and the White House to help homeowners take advantage of low interest rates as a way to help the housing market recover and to give the economy a shot in the arm.

While the bill could gain traction in the Democratic-controlled Senate, it faces a rough road in the GOP-run House, where many Republicans favor scaling back the government's role in the housing market as a way of aiding the economy. Similar versions of the measure died in the House and Senate's lame duck sessions last year.

""At the moment, it's an uphill battle,"" said Rep. Peter Welch, D-Vt., who plans to file the House version of the bill.

Welch said he will reach out to Republicans this year in hopes of building more support, but the bill's association with the government-controlled Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the federal housing agencies partly blamed for the collapse of the housing market, hurts its support base among GOP lawmakers.

""The American taxpayers have already sunk $190 billion dollars into the operations of Fannie and Freddie,"" said Rep. Randy Neugebauer, R-Tex., a member of the House Financial Services Committee. ""It's time that we wind their operations down instead of using them as a piggy bank for failed programs that further delay the housing recovery. ""

In the Senate, Democrats Bob Menendez of New Jersey and Barbara Boxer of California have legislation to aid borrowers who are current on their loans backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, but who are not able to refinance because their home values have declined too much.

Nearly 12 million homeowners have Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans and stand to benefit refinancing, the two senators said. Many can't refinance at a lower rate because of red tape and high fees. The red tape has reduced competition among banks, so borrowers pay higher interest rates than they would if they were able to shop around more, according to the senators.

The bill also would reduce up-front fees that borrowers pay on refinances and eliminate appraisal costs for all borrowers. The measure seeks to expand the Obama administration's Home Affordable Refinancing Program, which saves an average homeowner about $2,500 per year, they said.

""Homeowners will have more money in their pockets, Fannie and Freddie will see fewer foreclosures, and the housing market and economy will continue building momentum,"" Boxer said.

Among the bill's supporters are the Mortgage Bankers Association, the National Association of Realtors and the National Association of Home Builders.

""It is another tool that can be out there to help stabilize the housing market and kick start the economy if consumers can, in fact, put another $100 bucks in their pockets every month,"" said John Hudson, government affairs chairman of the Association of Mortgage Professionals.

Similar proposals by Boxer and Menendez last year got bogged down in the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee. Republican attempts to add amendments on other housing issues beyond refinancing led to a stalemate.

Twenty Senate Democrats are co-sponsors of this year's bill, but no Republicans have signed on.

""I support finding ways to smartly streamline the refinance process, but I'm not sure that eliminating all documentation requirements makes sense,"" said GOP Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, a committee member. ""I also think we need to quickly move beyond short-term stimulus and start focusing on the structural issues in our housing finance system.""

Sen. Mike Crapo, the committee's top Republican, declined through a spokeswoman to comment on the bill.

Welch's House bill also died during the last Congress. Welch accused Republicans of not wanting to give Obama an election-year boost by passing the mortgage refinance measure.

""Last year was even tougher because it was an election year,"" said Welch. ""The Republican leadership wanted Obama to fail."""

Business leaders have lobbied for a guest worker program, arguing that they need low-skilled labor for jobs — in agriculture, for instance — that American workers cannot or will not do. (A leaked draft of the president’s immigration proposal said nothing about a guest worker program, perhaps a tacit acknowledgment that the White House was looking to labor and business leaders to forge their own agreement on the issue.)

The principles outlined on Thursday — the product of months of negotiations between the groups — required compromise from both sides. Labor unions, acknowledging that “there are instances — even during tough economic times — when employers are not able to fill job openings with American workers,” agreed that there may be a need for a new type of guest worker program. In return, the unions insisted that American workers get a first shot at open jobs, and they secured an agreement that the number of incoming lower-skilled workers would be set based on need.

But even as there appears to be a growing consensus on some issues, a full-scale immigration overhaul remains a far-off prospect. This week, Representative Robert W. Goodlatte, Republican of Virginia and the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, came out against a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants — a crucial component for Democrats for any immigration plan.

“People have a pathway to citizenship right now: It’s to abide by the immigration laws, and if they have a family relationship, if they have a job skill that allows them to do that, they can obtain citizenship,” Mr. Goodlatte told NPR. “But simply someone who broke the law, came here, say, ‘I’ll give you citizenship now,’ that I don’t think is going to happen.”"

Right after the House passed the fiscal cliff compromise, President Obama said, ""I will not have another debate with this Congress over whether or not they should pay the bills that they've already racked up through the laws that they passed.""

But Republicans continue to insist that any increase in the debt ceiling must be exceeded by spending cuts and entitlement reforms.

""[The president] doesn't even want to have a discussion about it because he knows this is where we have leverage,"" Sen. Pat Toomey said on MSNBC earlier this week. ""We absolutely have to have this fight over the debt limit.""

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Thursday that Republicans in coming months will ""force the conversation that Washington needs to have"" about spending cuts if need be.

The country's borrowing has already hit its legal limit -- currently $16.394 trillion. As a result the Treasury can't borrow any more money in the markets, so it has begun to use ""extraordinary measures"" to ensure that the government can continue to pay all its bills in full and on time. But those measures can only buy about two months' of headroom.

If the ceiling isn't raised by late February or early March, the United States runs the risk of defaulting on its obligations because the Treasury would no longer have enough money available to pay all the country's bills.

Related: Fiscal cliff deal leave big issues pending

To cover a year's worth of borrowing, the debt ceiling may need to be raised by close to $1 trillion.

Obama and McConnell agree on one thing: They both say they have no interest in resolving the debt ceiling debate at the very last minute the way they did in 2011, the last time they went through the exercise.

That debate was so bruising that the United States was downgraded after the fact by Standard & Poor's.

The government's borrowing rates remained very low throughout. But the Government Accountability Office nevertheless estimates that they were higher during the standoff than they would have been otherwise. The result: An additional $19 billion in interest payments will be owed over the next decade, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center.

There's a good chance the debate this year will go down to the wire if not past it.

""The two groups are farther apart than they've ever been,"" said Steve Bell, senior director of economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center.

If Congress does not approve a debt ceiling increase, some believe the president could invoke the 14th Amendment, which states: ""The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned.""

By doing so, the argument goes, Obama could direct the Treasury secretary to keep borrowing in order to pay the country's bills in full.

The White House has indicated that's not a strategy the president would employ.

It would be risky politically -- there could be moves to impeach Obama.

And the country could still be hurt financially. By invoking the 14th Amendment, the president could spark a constitutional crisis -- not an affirming message to send markets already questioning Washington's ability to get beyond its dysfunction.

And yet, it's not yet clear what else the president could do to contain the damage.

""It is hard to imagine any Treasury secretary, or any president, allowing himself -- or herself -- to be the first to default on the public debt,"" said Joseph Minarik, research director at the Committee for Economic Development and a former chief economist at the White House Budget Office.

""That having been said, no one knows what other options lurk in the file cabinets of the attorneys in the Treasury. They aren't talking ... And I wouldn't have a very high opinion of anyone who did."""

Sens. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), touting a compromise on work visas brokered Friday by union officials and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, predicted that a bipartisan plan could be announced as soon as next week, when the Senate returns from a two-week recess.

But Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), whose support is seen as critical to attract the votes of conservative GOP senators to a comprehensive effort, said that talk of an agreement was “premature.”

“We have made substantial progress and I believe we will be able to agree on a legislative proposal,” he said in a terse statement released Sunday. “However, that legislation will only be a starting point.”

Rubio strongly cautioned that the bill would still require extensive public debate in committee hearings and on the Senate floor. “In order to succeed, this process cannot be rushed or done in secret,” he said.

Despite Rubio’s caution, other senators in the so-called Gang of Eight that is working on immigration appeared optimistic that Congress is near a historic breakthrough on reform.

“With the agreement between business and labor, every major policy issue has been resolved,” Schumer said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “I am very, very optimistic that we will have an agreement among the eight of us next week.”

Graham, speaking on CNN’s “State of the Union” show, said: “I think we’ve got a deal. We’ve got to write the legislation, but 2013, I hope, will be the year that we pass bipartisan immigration reform.”

The senators were encouraged by the deal that the AFL-CIO and the chamber reached on a new visa program that would allow low-income laborers into the country. Negotiators had been hung up on how to set the wages for those immigrant workers, but they resolved the issue late Friday.

Schumer acknowledged the caution expressed by Rubio, noting that the legislative language for the bill has not been drafted, but he was optimistic that the group has passed the biggest hurdles. “There’ll be little kerfuffles. But I don’t think any of us expect there to be problems,” he said.

The eight senators, as well as a group in the House, are drafting the bill to solve one of the nation’s most perplexing issues. President Obama also hopes to settle the issue. He has largely left the legislation-writing to Capitol Hill, while continuing to call for a solution at public events.

David Axelrod, who has worked as a top political advisor to the president, said on NBC that Obama was equally hopeful because he views immigration reform as a “legacy item” for his presidency.

“He wants this accomplishment,” Axelrod said. “There’s no doubt in my mind that he wants to pass comprehensive immigration reform.”

A look at the Obama administration’s efforts in trying to help homeowners and bring the nation out of its housing slump.

A look at the Obama administration’s efforts in trying to help homeowners and bring the nation out of its housing slump.

A look at the Obama administration’s efforts in trying to help homeowners and bring the nation out of its housing slump.

The Obama administration is engaged in a broad push to make more home loans available to people with weaker credit, an effort that officials say will help power the economic recovery but that skeptics say could open the door to the risky lending that caused the housing crash in the first place.

President Obama’s economic advisers and outside experts say the nation’s much-celebrated housing rebound is leaving too many people behind, including young people looking to buy their first homes and individuals with credit records weakened by the recession.

In response, administration officials say they are working to get banks to lend to a wider range of borrowers by taking advantage of taxpayer-backed programs — including those offered by the Federal Housing Administration — that insure home loans against default.

Housing officials are urging the Justice Department to provide assurances to banks, which have become increasingly cautious, that they will not face legal or financial recriminations if they make loans to riskier borrowers who meet government standards but later default.

Officials are also encouraging lenders to use more subjective judgment in determining whether to offer a loan and are seeking to make it easier for people who owe more than their properties are worth to refinance at today’s low interest rates, among other steps.

Obama pledged in his State of the Union address to do more to make sure more Americans can enjoy the benefits of the housing recovery, but critics say encouraging banks to lend as broadly as the administration hopes will sow the seeds of another housing disaster and endanger taxpayer dollars.

“If that were to come to pass, that would open the floodgates to highly excessive risk and would send us right back on the same path we were just trying to recover from,” said Ed Pinto, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and former top executive at mortgage giant Fannie Mae.

Administration officials say they are looking only to allay unnecessary hesi­ta­tion among banks and encourage safe lending to borrowers who have the financial wherewithal to pay.

“There’s always a tension that you have to take seriously between providing clarity and rules of the road and not giving any opportunity to restart the kind of irresponsible lending that we saw in the mid-2000s,” said a senior administration official who was not authorized to speak on the record.

The administration’s efforts come in the midst of a housing market that has been surging for the past year but that has been delivering most of the benefits to established homeowners with high credit scores or to investors who have been behind a significant number of new purchases.

“If you were going to tell people in low-income and moderate-income communities and communities of color there was a housing recovery, they would look at you as if you had two heads,” said John Taylor, president of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, a nonprofit housing organization. “It is very difficult for people of low and moderate incomes to refinance or buy homes.”

Before the crisis, about 40 percent of home buyers were first-time purchasers. That’s down to 30 percent, according to the National Association of Realtors.

From 2007 through 2012, new-home purchases fell 30 percent for people with credit scores above 780 (out of 800), according to Federal Reserve Governor Elizabeth Duke. But they declined 90 percent for people with scores between 680 and 620 — historically a respectable range for a credit score.

“If the only people who can get a loan have near-perfect credit and are putting down 25 percent, you’re leaving out of the market an entire population of creditworthy folks, which constrains demand and slows the recovery,” said Jim Parrott, who until January was the senior adviser on housing for the White House’s National Economic Council.

One reason, according to policymakers, is that as young people move out of their parents’ homes and start their own households, they will be forced to rent rather than buy, meaning less construction and housing activity. Given housing’s role in building up a family’s wealth, that could have long-lasting consequences.

“I think the ability of newly formed households, which are more likely to have lower incomes or weaker credit scores, to access the mortgage market will make a big difference in the shape of the recovery,” Duke said last month. “Economic improvement will cause household formation to increase, but if credit is hard to get, these will be rental rather than owner-occupied households.”

Deciding which borrowers get loans might seem like something that should be left up to the private market. But since the financial crisis in 2008, the government has shaped most of the housing market, insuring between 80 percent and 90 percent of all new loans, according to the industry publication Inside Mortgage Finance. It has done so primarily through the Federal Housing Administration, which is part of the executive branch, and taxpayer-backed mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, run by an independent regulator.

The FHA historically has been dedicated to making homeownership affordable for people of moderate means. Under FHA terms, a borrower can get a home loan with a credit score as low as 500 or a down payment as small as 3.5 percent. If borrowers with FHA loans default on their payments, taxpayers are on the line — a guarantee that should provide confidence to banks to lend.

But banks are largely rejecting the lower end of the scale, and the average credit score on FHA loans has stood at about 700. After years of intensifying investigations into wrongdoing in mortgage lending, banks are concerned that they will be held responsible if borrowers cannot pay. Under some circumstances, the FHA can retract its insurance or take other legal action to penalize banks when loans default.

“The financial risk of just one mistake has just become so high that lenders are playing it very, very safe, and many qualified borrowers are paying the price,” said David Stevens, Obama’s former FHA commissioner and now the chief executive of the Mortgage Bankers Association.

The FHA, in coordination with the White House, is working to develop new policies to make clear to banks that they will not lose their guarantees or face other legal action if loans that conform to the program’s standards later default. Officials hope the FHA’s actions will then spur Fannie and Freddie to do the same.

The effort requires sign-on by the Justice Department and the inspector general of Department of Housing and Urban Development, agencies that investigate wrongdoing in mortgage lending.

“We need to align as much as possible with IG and the DOJ moving forward,” FHA Commissioner Carol Galante said. The HUD inspector general and Justice Department declined to comment.

The effort to provide more certainty to banks is just one of several policies the administration is undertaking. The FHA is also urging lenders to take what officials call “compensating factors” into account and use more subjective judgment when deciding whether to make a loan — such as looking at a borrower’s overall savings.

“My view is that there are lots of creditworthy borrowers that are below 720 or 700 — all the way down the credit-score spectrum,” Galante said. “It’s important you look at the totality of that borrower’s ability to pay.”"

Of course, a big reason so much attention has been paid to the shuttering of the World War II Memorial and other landmarks is because groups of veterans have stormed these spots anyway. A group of World War II veterans visited the memorial to that war on Tuesday, bypassing the barriers; the same day, Korean War veterans moved the barricades at the Korean War Veterans Memorial to lay a wreath. The scene repeated itself on Wednesday, with another group of veterans (again accompanied by members of Congress) entering the grounds of the World War II Memorial.

Stories about veterans storming closed memorials were quickly picked up by news outlets and spread far and wide on social media platforms.

But all closures are not created equally. The Smithsonian museums on the Mall? Those are definitely locked. Some of the parks and memorials around D.C.? Not so much.

On Friday, the fourth day of the shutdown, gates and closed signs remained but visitors weren’t paying them much heed. The Post’s Michael Ruane reports that at the World War II Memorial on Friday, visitors simply walked by the park rangers manning a gate without being stopped. The American Legion also held a news conference there, saying they want the memorial to stay open. At the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, gates had been pushed aside, and the memorial was crowded with visitors.

This followed several days of similar events around the Mall and elsewhere. Children played on Wednesday inside supposedly closed parks on Capitol Hill.

Still, even though visitors are still making their way into closed memorials and strolling around the Mall, they are encountering a different problem. Some memorials may be accessible, but the bathrooms are all closed."

FEC, Supreme Court may give the rich even more power Cohen, Ahrens: We need democracy that represents the people, not super rich donors

Editor’s Note: Ben Cohen is co-founder of Ben and Jerry’s Ice Cream and founder and Head Stamper at the Stamp Stampede, which aims to build a movement to amend the Constitution to get big money out of politics. Betty Ahrens is the vice president for outreach and operations at Public Campaign, a nonprofit that raises awareness about election finance.

(CNN) —

Five years ago, on October 3, 2008, with the economy in a tailspin, President George W. Bush signed the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program into law, giving the government the ability to bail out the big banks to prevent further calamity.

A number of factors caused the economic collapse, but one in particular stands out – a witch’s brew of money and politics.

As the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission wrote in its 2011 report, “It did not surprise the Commission that an industry of such wealth and power would exert pressure on policy makers and regulators. From 1999 to 2008, the financial sector expended $2.7 billion in reported federal lobbying expenses; individuals and political action committees in the sector made more than $1 billion in campaign contributions.”

Five years later, with millions of Americans still unemployed or underemployed, not much has changed.

Wall Street is still the biggest player in Washington. The industry dished out more dough than any other industry during the 2012 election. In the first six months of 2013, the finance, insurance and real estate sector has already given $63 million to federal candidates and committees. It has spent $242 million on more than 2,000 lobbyists.

The Dodd-Frank financial reform was an important legislation and it has, and will continue, to protect consumers from abuses of the banks. But the industry played a major role in what rules were passed and it continues to play a role in the implementation of regulation rules.

Soon, the Supreme Court may give bankers and wealthy special interests – the same guys and gals who wrecked the economy in 2008 – even more influence.

On October 8, the court will hear oral arguments in McCutcheon v. FEC, a case brought by Alabama businessman Shaun McCutcheon and the Republican National Committee that threatens to remove the aggregate limits that individual donors can give, in total, to federal candidates and committees each election cycle.

For the 2014 election cycle, that total is $123,200 – more than double the median American family income. If the court sides with McCutcheon, an individual donor could bundle more than $1 million to congressional fundraising committees.

So what does this have to do with Wall Street and TARP? Plenty.

Some 28% of the roughly 1,200 individuals who got within 10% of the aggregate limit in the 2012 election work on Wall Street. These super donors work at Goldman Sachs, Elliott Management and other top financial firms. Wall Street was the biggest industry to put money into politics.

If aggregate limits are thrown out, a future presidential candidate could be allowed to ask for a $2 million donation for his campaign and various committees. Congressional leaders could set up a fundraising committee that could take in $3.5 million from one donor. That’s a sweet deal for Wall Street, but it’s a raw deal for democracy.

Based on past precedent, the court should uphold the current limits. But whether the justices do or do not, our democracy is already in trouble. Congress must act to raise the voices of We the People.

StampStampede.org brings the issue home to Main Street.

The Stampede encourages people to legally stamp messages such as “not to be used for bribing politicians” on our nation’s currency to support reforms to #GetMoneyOut of politics. Every bill is seen an average of 875 times and helps demonstrate a growing, sustained demand for reform.

One solution is modeled on successful systems in Arizona, Connecticut and Maine, which allow candidates to run competitive campaigns for office by relying on a mix of small donations and limited public funds. There are a handful of similar measures already introduced in Congress. They would empower small dollar donors and help them compete with the lobbyists, bankers and wealthy donors writing big checks.

The American people want and deserve a representative democracy that represents the people, not super-rich donors. But unless we come together and demand change, Congress will continue to be owned (or at least rented) by big money.

Boehner, the man who spent significant portions of the last Congress shuttling to and from the White House for fiscal talks with President Obama that ultimately failed twice to produce a grand bargain, has come around to the idea that the best negotiations are no negotiations.

As the president and Congressional Democrats have tried to force Mr. Boehner back to the table for talks to head off the automatic budget cuts set to take effect on Friday, Mr. Boehner has instead dug in deeper, refusing to even discuss an increase in revenue and insisting in his typical colorful language that it was time for the Senate to produce a measure aimed at the cuts.

“The revenue issue is now closed,” Mr. Boehner said Thursday, before the House left town for the weekend without acting on the cuts and a Senate attempt to avert them died. Mr. Boehner said the dispute with Democrats amounted to a question of “how much more money do we want to steal from the American people to fund more government.”

“I’m for no more,” he said.

While the frustrations of Congressional Democrats and Mr. Obama with Mr. Boehner are reaching a fever pitch, House Republicans could not be more pleased with their leader."

http://news.yahoo.com/rising-tax-revenue-eases-pressure-budget-cuts-181420241.html,,[],Rising tax revenue eases pressure for budget cuts,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Rising tax receipts are shrinking the federal deficit, and that will shape the budget debate when Congress returns from vacation next month. The big question for lawmakers: Should they renew, end or modify the tens of billions of dollars in ""sequester"" cuts in government spending that took effect earlier this year?

Tax revenue through June was up 14 percent from a year earlier, and that trend is expected to continue. New figures for July are due out next week, and for August on Sept. 12. That's just three days after lawmakers return to face threats by some conservatives of a government shutdown on Oct. 1 or an economy-threatening default on the national debt weeks later.

With revenue rising, what's the fight about?

Now that the government is taking in more money, Republicans in Congress are more opposed than ever to tax increases sought by President Barack Obama and his Democratic allies.

""This year the federal government will bring more revenue in than in any year in our history,"" says House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio. ""We have a spending problem in Washington. It has to be addressed.""

But Obama and the Democrats want to do away with some of the existing spending cuts, and they say they won't accept significant further reductions — unless there's also action to bring in still more revenue.

""Democrats know we must do more to reduce the deficit,"" says Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada. ""We believe in a balanced approach that pairs spending cuts with having those that can afford it pay more.""

At the same time, some economists worry that currently rising revenue numbers will reduce the pressure to address the nation's long-term debt problems.

""I don't think political leaders feel that they have a gun to their head the way they did a couple years ago,"" said William Gale, a former economic adviser to President George H.W. Bush and now co-director of the Tax Policy Center. ""There's a desire on some sides to declare 'mission accomplished' and ignore the long-term deficits and move on to other issues.""

Story continues

Several factors are contributing to the increase in revenue. Congress increased income tax rates on high-income families in January. The Congressional Budget Office says some of those taxpayers probably cashed in investments ahead of the tax hike, boosting capital gains taxes. Congress also let a temporary payroll tax cut expire at the end of 2012, increasing Social Security taxes.

CBO also said a rise in personal income is adding to tax revenue, even though economic growth has been sluggish.

To see how important the economy is to federal tax receipts, look at what happened in 2009, after the nation plunged into the worst economic recession since the Great Depression. Income tax receipts dropped by 20 percent from the year before, and corporate tax receipts dropped by 55 percent. Social Security tax receipts dropped for the first time since 1946.

The budget deficit, which topped $1 trillion for four straight years, is projected to fall to $642 billion in the budget year that ends in September, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The spending cuts enacted over the past several years are combining with higher tax receipts to reduce government borrowing.

Under current law, the budget office projects that the federal deficit will shrink even further in the next several years before starting to grow again at the end of the decade. But with the national debt approaching $17 trillion, the long-term financial problems aren't exactly solved, Gale said.

""It's kind of like somebody carrying an extra 15 pounds around their waist,"" he said. ""Over the long term it kind of hurts your health, wears you out, reduces your mobility.""

Congress is headed toward two potential budget showdowns this fall, one when funding for the government runs out at the end of September and another when the U.S. reaches the limit of its borrowing authority later in the fall.

Republicans are demanding spending cuts in exchange for a debt limit increase, which will be needed to prevent an unprecedented default on U.S. obligations. But Obama says he won't negotiate over raising the debt limit.

That debate could provide an opportunity to address the nation's long-term finances. But there doesn't seem to be much appetite in Washington for the kind of ""grand bargain"" deficit reduction package that Obama and Boehner tried to negotiate in 2011. That package would have cut spending and increased revenues, but Obama and Boehner were never able to agree on the details.

If not a grand bargain, a ""somewhat"" bargain evolved over the following 17 months.

Republicans willing to trigger a default on the government's debt forced Democrats and Obama in August 2011 to agree to cutting government spending by $2.1 trillion over the following decade, including $1.2 trillion in the automatic spending cuts — taken equally from military and domestic programs — that began in earnest this March.

Democrats and some moderate Republicans now want to undo those automatic cuts. Most Republicans want to keep them but switch more of the reductions from defense to domestic programs.

Then this past January, two months after his re-election, Obama finally won a tax increase, nearly $620 billion over 10 years, most of it from people with annual incomes above $400,000.

With this year's projected deficit less than half what it was from 2009 through 2011, economist Gale questions whether there's an overwhelming will to do more on either the tax or spending side of the ledger.

""I think people are kind of like, well, it's not as bad as it was in 2009, so there's kind of a fatigue in dealing with debt stuff,"" Gale said.

Rand Paul accused both Republicans and Democrats of being ""guilty of spending too much"" in his tea party response to President Barack Obama's State of the Union address on Tuesday night.

""It is often said that there is not enough bipartisanship up here. That is not true. In fact, there is plenty of bipartisanship,"" Paul said in a speech for Tea Party Express that streamed live on the group's website shortly after Obama's speech. ""Both parties have been guilty of spending too much, of protecting their sacred cows, of backroom deals in which everyone up here wins, but every taxpayer loses.""

Despite being an elected member of the Senate, the junior senator from Kentucky at times spoke as though he were an outsider—even using the word ""they"" when referring to other members of the institution to which he belongs.

Paul delivered his remarks after the official Republican response, given by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio from the Capitol. Paul joined Rubio in accusing the president of working to undermine the ""free market,"" but Paul's remarks also included a call for an amendment to the Constitution that would require the federal government to balance its budget every year, a tea party rallying cry.

""What the president fails to grasp is that the American system that rewards hard work is what made America so prosperous,"" Paul said. ""What America needs is not Robin Hood but Adam Smith.""

Paul advocated for term limits for members of Congress as punishment for not passing a budget and reining in spending.

""If Congress refuses to obey its own rules, if Congress refuses to pass a budget, if Congress refuses to read the bills, then I say: Sweep the place clean. Limit their terms and send them home,"" Paul said. ""I have seen the inner sanctum of Congress, and believe me there is no monopoly on knowledge there. If they will not listen, if they will not balance the budget, then we should limit their terms.""

The speech gave Paul, who has said he's thinking about running for president someday, an opportunity to brand himself as an alternative to the party establishment. Because being an outsider, of course, is what being a tea party lawmaker is all about."

The Nevada Democrat won't be directly involved in the formal House-Senate budget negotiations set to begin Wednesday. But he has been among the most overt in blaming the opposite party -- even before the talks begin. And he has given perhaps the bleakest assessment for a potential compromise on tax increases and cuts to entitlement spending.

""You keep talking about Medicare and Social Security,"" Reid said on Thursday, cutting off a Nevada Public Radio host. ""Get something else in your brain. Stop talking about that. ... There is not going to be a grand bargain.""

He also said Republicans would have to agree on tax-revenue increases for Congress to achieve a large-scale agreement, but they instead have their mind set on ""nothing more on revenue.""

""And until they get off that kick, there's not going to be a grand bargain,"" Reid said. ""There's not going to be a small bargain. The only people who feel there shouldn't be more [tax money] coming in to the federal government from the rich people are the Republicans in the Congress. Everybody else, including the rich people, is willing to pay more. They want to pay more.""

To be sure, lawmakers, their aides and observers who will be monitoring the talks say entrenched differences over taxes is perhaps the biggest roadblock toward a substantive deal.

Republicans won't agree to more taxes atop the 10-year, $600 billion-plus increase on upper-income earners that President Obama and Democrats muscled through in January. And Democrats won't yield to cuts in benefit programs like Medicare, without higher taxes.

""If we focus on some big, grand bargain then we're going to focus on our differences, and both sides are going to require that the other side compromises some core principle and then we'll get nothing done,"" said House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wis.

Ryan, his party's vice presidential nominee a year ago, and Senate Budget Committee Chairman Patty Murray, D-Wash., are two of the key congressional figures in the talks.

They have already talked informally and say they're seeking ""common ground"" between the sharply different Republican and Democratic budgets.

That would likely involve finding ideas upon which they can agree instead of compromising principles -- including Republicans' opposition to tax increases or many Democrats' unwillingness to consider cutting future Social Security benefits by decreasing the annual cost-of-living adjustments.

Ryan says he's seeking a ""smaller, more achievable objective"" instead of a broader agreement encompassing tax hikes and structural curbs on the relentless growth of benefit programs like Medicare and Medicaid.

Though the pre-meeting talk appears to be limiting Americans' expectations, none so far has included the hard-line positions that led to a partial government shutdown earlier this month and almost resulted in the country exceeding its project debt limit ceiling.

The new deal would be to fund government operations through September 2014. The temporary funding measure that allowed the government to fully reopen last week is set to expire in early January.

If Reid, Ryan and others see one potential agreement in the talks, it would be on the across-the-board federal spending cuts known as sequester.

Sequester mostly hits so-called discretionary spending, the money approved by Congress each year to run agency operations.

Ryan wants to cut autopilot-like spending on so-called entitlement programs like Medicare to ease sequestration's effects on both the Pentagon and domestic programs.

""I think we all agree that there's a smarter way to cut spending"" than sequestration, Ryan said. ""If I can reform entitlement programs where the savings compound annually ... that is more valuable for reducing the debt that a one-time spending cut in discretionary spending.""

The automatic spending cuts are mandated by the failure of the 2011 deficit super committee to reach an agreement. They would carve $91 billion from the day-to-day budgets of the Pentagon and domestic agencies in 2014 compared with the limits set by the 2011 budget deal. The Pentagon would absorb almost 60 percent of the cuts.

Republicans are looking at several cuts to Medicare health care providers found in Obama's budget. They also have voiced support for curbing Social Security cost-of-living adjustments, or COLAs, an idea Obama has backed, but only in the context of a broader deal in which Republicans would allow tax increases. That proposal won't fly in the current talks.

So where might common ground be found? One option embraced by Murray and utilized earlier this year to ease $12 billion worth of sequestration cuts would be to lower spending ""caps"" in future years to offset some of the automatic cuts now. That would save $142 billion over the coming decade.

There are also several super committee ideas like curbing Postal Service cost overruns, making federal workers contribute more to their pensions and raising premiums on higher-income Medicare beneficiaries.

There are also lots of fee proposals contained in Obama's budget, but most of them promise lots of irritation while raising relatively little money. Lawmakers have annually repelled attempts by Obama to increase airline security fees by $18 billion over a decade to help pay for Transportation Security Administration operations.

Democrats, meanwhile, are wary of using cuts to Medicare and other entitlement programs to ease cuts in the defense budget.

http://news.yahoo.com/boehner-protests-obama-veto-threats-155727651.html,,[],Boehner protests Obama veto threats on budget,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- White House veto threats against legislation that implements spending cuts in the austere GOP budget plan are ""reckless"" and would lead to a government shutdown, House Speaker John Boehner said Thursday.

Boehner, R-Ohio, said the veto warnings mean Obama is threatening to shut down the government unless he wins tax increases and higher spending.

The White House said Monday that Obama will veto any legislation implementing the GOP's budget, which endorses spending levels forced by across-the-board spending cuts known as sequestration and shifts about $30 billion from nondefense programs to the Pentagon.

""No one wants to make more progress on deficits than I do. I've been working at it for years now. I know how hard it is,"" Boehner said. ""That's why the idea of shutting down the government if we can't find a deal is so irresponsible.""

But even with a budget impasse, a government shutdown could be averted if Congress approved separate stopgap legislation. Such measures, known as continuing resolutions, are routine, and there hasn't been a government shutdown since the 1995-96 confrontation between President Bill Clinton and a Republican Congress.

The two sides finessed their differences earlier this year by agreeing to a catchall spending bill permitting $1.043 trillion for agency operations funded annually by Congress. Across-the-board cuts automatically reduced spending to $986 billion and could be implemented again if the ongoing budget impasse isn't broken.

Republicans are drafting spending bills for the upcoming budget year at a lower $967 billion cap. The White House supports a level $91 billion higher.

""We simply won't sign into law the Republican budget, which would drastically slash the investments the middle class, seniors and our economic growth depend on,"" said White House spokeswoman Amy Brundage. ""It's time for Speaker Boehner to match his promises of an end to manufactured crises with actions."""

Pollak'],Sperling's Disingenuous Defense of Sequester,"White House economic adviser Gene Sperling, who controversially told journalist Bob Woodward he would “regret” accusing the Obama administration of shifting the goalposts to include tax hikes in debate over the sequester, offered a misleading defense of the sequester on CNN’s State of the Union with Candy Crowley on Sunday.

Sperling told Crowley that the original intent of the sequester was “to force both sides to come back to the type of grand bargain that Bowles-Simpson have called for, that most budget experts call for…”.

But President Barack Obama rejected the recommendations of the Bowles-Simpson commission, even though he had established it to propose solutions to the country’s long-term budget crisis.

As Woodward recalled in The Price of Politics, and as is easily confirmed by a variety of other sources, including former Secretary of the Treasury Tim Geithner, Obama rejected the Bowles-Simpson formula because he was not willing to accept reforms to the country’s entitlements, including Social Security.

Obama and the Democrats wanted larger tax hikes and fewer cuts to spending and entitlements. Many Republicans, too, rejected the plan, largely because it left the massive new entitlement of Obamacare in place.

Moreover, as Woodward pointed out elsewhere in the book (and as Breitbart News highlighted long before Woodward’s claims about the sequester made him a White House target), it was Obama himself who scuttled a “grand bargain” by demanding additional revenues through tax hikes when a deal had been within reach.

Sperling’s revisionist history invites the question: if the sequester had been meant to encourage a grand bargain like Bowles-Simpson, why hasn’t Obama simply embraced Bowles-Simpson?

The obvious answer is that Obama had no intention of reaching a deal, and hoped to use the sequester as he used the “fiscal cliff”–to squeeze more concessions out of Republicans on tax rates, and to blame the opposition for whatever horrible economic outcomes the administration could conjure."

The program was nicknamed the “Obamaphone” during the 2012 election, though it actually started long before President Obama took office. Indiana reportedly has the highest number of applicants, roughly 17,400, who were signed up by TerraCom Inc. and the affiliated YourTel America Inc.

Applicants from at least 26 states were exposed to the security breach, according to a report published by Scripps Howard News Service.

In addition to the application forms, 127,000 supporting documents such as scans or photos of food-stamp cards, driver’s licenses, tax records, pay stubs and parole letters also were available online.

Federal law prohibits carriers from keeping applicants’ proof of eligibility.

A TerraCom attorney told Scripps the records were stored by Call Centers India, a contractor that helps determine eligibility.

The phone companies said the records of 343 people were accessed from at least March and were removed April 26, after Scripps said it found information through a “simple” Google search and informed the companies of the breach.

The news service said TerraCom officials declined numerous requests for an interview but that a company spokesman said federal and state officials were notified of the breach.

The Federal Communications Commission, which runs the program, acknowledged it knew of the situation and said a single privacy violation could cost a company as much as $1.5 million.

The FCC program is known as Lifeline and started in the Reagan administration in large part to help low-income residents in emergencies and to help them find and keep jobs.

But the program was hit with fraud and abuse through the end of President Obama’s first term, after cell phones were added and wireless companies, getting reimbursed as much as $34.25 a line per month, were reportedly signing up people who’d never applied or were dead.

As a result, the FCC last year tightened the guidelines, essentially limiting households to either one land or cell phone line and requiring carriers to document applicants’ eligibility, which cut the number of subscribers from a peak of 18.2 million in August 2012 to 13.2 million last month.

The program became known during the final months of the 2012 election cycle as “Obamaphones,” after a woman in Cleveland in a viral YouTube video touted what she called the “Obamaphone.”

“He gave us a phone,” she said.

The program cost $2.2 billion in 2012 and is funded through the $2.73 surcharge on monthly phone bills."

The solid job growth wasn't enough to push down the unemployment rate, which stayed 7.8 percent last month, the Labor Department said Friday. The rate for November was revised up from an initially reported 7.7 percent.

Stock futures inched higher after the report was released at 8:30 a.m. Eastern time.

Robust hiring in manufacturing and construction fueled the December job gains. Construction firms added 30,000, the most in 15 months. That increase likely reflected hiring needed to rebuild after Superstorm Sandy and also gains in home building that have contributed to a housing recovery.

Manufacturers added 25,000 jobs, the most in nine months.

Even with the gains, hiring isn't strong enough to quickly reduce still-high unemployment. For 2012, employers added 1.84 million jobs, an average of 153,000 jobs a month, roughly matching the job totals for 2011.

But the stable hiring last month shows that employers didn't panic during the high-stakes talks between Congress and the White House over tax increases and spending cuts that weren't resolved until New Year's.

That's an encouraging sign for the coming months, because an even bigger federal budget showdown is looming. The government must increase its $16.4 trillion borrowing limit by around late February or risk defaulting on its debt. Republicans will likely demand deep spending cuts as the price of raising the debt limit.

Friday's report did point to some weakness in the job market. For example, the number of unemployed actually rose 164,000 to 12.2 million. The unemployment figures come from a survey of households; the number of jobs that were added each month comes from a separate survey of businesses.

Still, the economy is improving. Layoffs are declining. And the number of people who sought unemployment aid in the past month is near a four-year low.

The December jobs report showed that hourly pay is staying slightly ahead of inflation. Hourly wages rose 7 cents to $23.73, a 2.1 percent increase compared with a year earlier. Inflation rose 1.8 percent over the same period.

The once-depressed housing market is recovering. Companies ordered more long-lasting manufactured goods in November, a sign that they're investing more in equipment and software. And Americans spent more in November. Consumer spending drives nearly 70 percent of economic growth.

Manufacturing is getting a boost from the best auto sales in five years. Car sales jumped 13 percent in 2012 to 14.5 million. And Americans spent more at the tail end of the holiday shopping season, boosting overall sales that had slumped earlier in the crucial two-month period."

In no particular order:

1. The Vitter amendment. Concocted by David Vitter (R-La.), this majestically cynical measure is based on the common misconception that members of Congress and their staffs are “exempted” from the Affordable Care Act. It would prohibit the government from paying for any part of the health insurance for federal legislators or their staff.

The facts of the “exemption” are these: During the 2010 debate over the ACA, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) mischievously inserted an amendment requiring that members of Congress and their staffs get their insurance from the insurance exchanges to be set up under Obamacare. They thus became the only employees of a large employer in the country required to buy their coverage from the exchanges -- in almost every other case, big employers provide worker insurance themselves.

Like other big employers, the government customarily covered about 70% to 75% of their premium costs. But there isn’t a provision in the ACA for employer contributions to exchange-provided policies, which are designed largely for individuals who don’t get coverage through their jobs. Accordingly, the federal Office of Personnel Management issued a special ruling allowing the government to continue its usual share of employee premiums.

Vitter’s amendment is directed at the soft-minded people who think there’s something unusual or untoward about this. He undoubtedly knows the truth. The measure would impose a significant pay cut on congressional staffers, especially lower-paid workers who will have trouble making up the lost employer contributions from their own pockets. What species of person screws his own employees this way? A “Vitter,” apparently.

2. The Lankford bill. The “Government Shutdown Prevention Act” introduced by Rep. James Lankford (R-Okla.) in March, this bill would keep the government open at existing spending levels if Congress failed to pass a budget by the end of the fiscal year. But it would impose a 1% spending cut after 120 days without a budget, and additional 1% cuts every 90 days thereafter.

It’s a classic poison pill, and it’s the U.S. economy that would get poisoned. It obviously does nothing to incentivize an intransigent minority in Congress to come to grips with economic or political reality, and isn’t that exactly where we are now?

In fact, it’s a formula for the slow strangulation of economic growth, which is the problem the economy faces already, thanks to the mindlessly destructive sequester. What will it take for Congress to finally realize that economic growth is the one sure remedy for shrinking the budget deficit and the federal debt, and that efforts to cut government spending in a period of low growth only makes the economy worse?

3. Ryan’s unconscionable “conscience” clause. Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), who has a mysterious reputation for economic smarts in Washington, has reportedly now floated the idea of conditioning an end to the fiscal stalemate by inserting a “conscience” clause into the Affordable Care Act. That’s a provision that would allow employers and insurers to refuse to provide birth control coverage to their workers or policyholders on religious or moral grounds. This is nothing but a sop to the religious far right, some of the same people who got us into the standoff to begin with. It’s a battle from the 19th century, and one would think we moved past that.

4. The return of starving the seniors. Another idea from the Ryan shop. This proposal would require cuts to Social Security and Medicare as a condition for raising the debt ceiling. Ryan has been shopping this idea for more than two years now, and it’s been thoroughly repudiated -- most recently by the voters in the 2012 election, when Ryan and his running mate, Mitt Romney, were solidly thumped. There’s something fundamentally immoral about trying to balance the federal budget on the backs of the neediest and most elderly members of society.

What’s worse about all these ludicrous ideas isn’t their particular stupidity, of course. It’s that they evade the point that the Republican Party has long since abandoned its rationale for the shutdown and the threat to the debt limit in the first place -- rolling back Obamacare. That’s no longer even on the table. What’s happening in Washington right now is an infantile exercise in face-saving. To have to list the four stupidest ideas for ending the shutdown just shows how hopelessly stupid the shutdown is."

Before Becoming An Editor', 'She Was A Reporter Covering U.S. Economic Policy']","Obama, Republicans in debt talks on two fronts","President Obama opened talks with House Republicans on Thursday about their plan to lift the federal debt limit through late November, raising hopes that Washington would avert its first default on the national debt.

But after a 90-minute meeting at the White House, the two sides remained at odds over how and when to end the government shutdown — now in its 11th day — with Obama insisting that Republicans reopen federal agencies before negotiations over broader budget issues can begin.

In the Senate, top Republicans began crafting a proposal that would reopen the government and raise the federal debt limit for as long as three months — an approach closer to the terms Obama has set to end the standoff.

The developments meant that bipartisan negotiations were suddenly underway on two separate tracks Thursday after weeks of stalemate. Major questions remain, however, about the path ahead.

Both sides described Obama’s evening session with House Republicans as a “good meeting” and said talks will continue.

Graphic House Republicans have proposed funding that amounts to about one-third of discretionary funding. See the bills here.

“The president’s goal remains to ensure we pay the bills we’ve incurred, reopen the government and get back to the business of growing the economy,” the White House said in a statement.

House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) left the session and returned to the Capitol without speaking to reporters. Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) said the meeting was “clarifying,” even though it did not produce a resolution.

“He didn’t say yes. He didn’t say no,” said House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.). “We’re continuing to negotiate this evening.”

White House officials were careful not to characterize the meeting as a negotiation, after the president spent weeks publicly and privately declaring that he would not negotiate over lifting the debt ceiling. According to a Democrat familiar with the meeting, Obama agreed to review GOP proposals for reopening the government but reiterated that he would not make policy concessions.

Republicans, however, did describe the process as a negotiation. The 20 House Republicans — Boehner declined the offer to bring all 232 GOP lawmakers to the White House — gathered in the Roosevelt Room with Obama, Vice President Biden, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew and other senior officials.

A similar huddle is slated for late Friday morning when Obama will host Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and the Senate Republican Conference. McConnell and Biden have been largely on the sidelines the past few weeks despite having served as the closers for the past three large fiscal compromises.

With the Treasury Department at risk of running short of cash to pay the nation’s bills as soon as next week, the stock market soared Thursday on signs that an end to the impasse may be at hand. The Dow Jones industrial average shot up more than 300 points to close at 15,126.07, recovering most of the value it had lost since the shutdown began Oct. 1. The Nasdaq and Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose more than 2 percent.

The House proposal that emerged Thursday would push off the threat of default until Nov. 22, but it would not end the shutdown, an idea that fell flat in the Senate with members of both parties. For the first time since the brinkmanship began in early September, McConnell added into the fray, holding meetings with his rank-and-file members to develop a competing Senate proposal.

The package was being assembled by Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who said she is also in talks with Senate Democrats.

“I was surprised that the House decided to deal only with the debt limit and not with the continued closure of government,” Collins said. “I think that we have to deal with both issues, and we need to do so quickly.”

Senate Democrats were intrigued by Collins’s proposal but unhappy with its demand for Democratic concessions. Those would include the repeal of a tax on medical devices that helps fund Obama’s health-care law, the Affordable Care Act, and new

income-verification procedures for people who receive tax subsidies to buy health insurance on the law’s new exchanges.

In addition, Collins’s proposal would maintain deep cuts known as sequestration through at least March, although it would grant agencies greater flexibility to decide where the cuts would fall. Sequestration remains a red flag for the White House and many Democrats, who want to restore funding for domestic programs.

Senior Democrats involved in the talks declined to comment, saying the discussion had reached a sensitive stage.

The Senate, meanwhile, is on track to vote Saturday on a separate Democratic proposal that would suspend enforcement of the debt limit through 2014. It was unclear late Thursday whether that measure would proceed or whether it would be replaced if a deal with Republicans emerged.

Even if such an agreement advanced in the Senate, it could face rough sledding in the House, where a contingent of Republicans remains committed to using the shutdown to undermine the health-care law.

Indeed, Boehner’s offer to temporarily lift the debt limit but keep the government shuttered was engineered in part to satisfy far-right conservatives, who first suggested using the threat of a shutdown to strip funding for the law. Those conservatives have grown anxious in recent days as talk of making this stand singularly about the health law died off among many rank-and-file Republicans.

On Thursday, many creators of that strategy — including Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) and Mike Lee (R-Utah) — voiced support for Boehner’s latest gambit.

“It’s to continue [the] fight on Obamacare, to not leave that as a side issue,” said Rep. Raúl Labrador (R-Idaho).

Heritage Action for America, a conservative advocacy group influential with tea party Republicans, said it will not ask lawmakers to vote against raising the debt limit with no strings attached in order to refocus attention on the health-care law. The conservative Club for Growth also announced that it will look the other way on the debt limit vote.

The conservative Madison Project issued a broadside against McConnell, who faces a tough reelection campaign in 2014 and has stayed mainly on the sidelines until now.

“After remaining largely silent when conservatives were fighting Obamacare, Senator Mitch McConnell is, once again, re-emerging from the shadows to sell out conservatives in the eleventh hour,” the project’s Drew Ryun said in a statement.

GOP leaders, meanwhile, appear increasingly eager to extract the party from the health-care fight, which has not only failed to achieve its goals but also has decimated the party’s reputation among voters. According to a Wall Street Journal/NBC News survey released Thursday, 24 percent of voters have a positive view of the GOP — an all-time low in 24 years of polling.

After briefing rank-and-file lawmakers on the details of the latest strategy in a closed-door meeting Thursday, Boehner told reporters that the goal was to offer the president “a temporary increase in the debt ceiling, an agreement to go to conference on the budget, for his willingness to sit down and discuss with us a way forward to reopen the government, and to start to deal with America’s pressing problems.”

Asked which problems he hoped to address in that conversation, Boehner did not mention any specific issue, saying only, “I don’t want to put anything on the table, I don’t want to take anything off the table.”

Since the shutdown began, senior Republicans have sought to shift the debate away from the Affordable Care Act and toward goals such as overhauling the tax code and replacing sequestration with cuts to entitlement programs, including Social Security and Medicare.

“If you’re in a global negotiation over the entire budget, then [the health-care law] is part of the negotiation. But it’s probably not the only part and may not even be the central part,” said Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.).

The latest House GOP plan calls for suspending the debt limit until Nov. 22, the Friday before Thanksgiving. It would forbid Lew from using “extraordinary measures” to conserve cash, creating a firm deadline when Treasury would be forced to rely solely on incoming revenue to pay bills.

Before holding a vote on that plan, House leaders want Obama to agree to enter budget negotiations. Only then would they talk about reopening the government — and they declined to say what concessions they would demand for funding federal agencies.

Obama has indicated that he could support a short-term debt-limit increase, but he has also demanded that Republicans allow the government to reopen before he would negotiate.

White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters Thursday that “the president is happy that cooler heads at least seem to be prevailing in the House, that there at least seems to be a recognition that default is not an option.” However, Carney said, “it would be far better for the economy if we stopped this episodic brinksmanship and . . . mothballed the nuclear weapon here, which is the threat of default, for a longer duration.”

Their comments follow the IRS acknowledgment Friday that the agency targeted such groups during the 2012 election cycle to see whether they were violating their tax-exempt status -- a revelation followed by a report that such activity dated back to the previous year.

“The conclusion that the IRS came to is that they did have agents who were engaged in intimidation of political groups,” Michigan Rep. Mike Rogers told “Fox News Sunday.” “I don't care if you're a conservative, a liberal, a Democrat or a Republican, this should send a chill up your spine. It needs to have a full investigation.”

Evidence that the IRS was flagging such groups in 2011 was included in a draft inspector general's report obtained Saturday by Fox News and other news organizations and is expected to be released in full later this week.

That information seemingly contradicts public statements by IRS Commissioner Douglas Shulman, who told congressional investigators in March 2011 that specific groups were not being targeted.

On Sunday, Fox News obtained a timeline from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration that shows the practice started in 2010 and that IRS agents also were looking for groups associated with such phrases as ""We the People,"" and ""Take Back the Country.""

Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins on Sunday also called the IRS activities chilling and said she was disappointed that President Obama had not condemned the actions.

“This is truly outrageous and it contributes to the profound distrust that the American people have in government,” Collins told CNN’s “State of the Union.” “It is absolutely chilling that the IRS was singling out conservative groups for extra review. And I think that it’s very disappointing that the president hasn’t personally condemned this.”

At about the same time, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney released a statement saying: “If the inspector general finds that there were any rules broken or that conduct of government officials did not meet the standards required of them, the president expects that swift and appropriate steps will be taken to address any misconduct.""

Michigan Republican Rep. Dave Camp, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said Friday his committee will hold a hearing on the issue.

The IRS said Friday that it was sorry for what it called the ""inappropriate"" targeting of the conservative groups during the 2012 elections.

But the draft report seemingly contradicts public statements by Shulman and shows senior IRS officials knew agents were targeting Tea Party groups as early as 2011.

Lois G. Lerner, who heads the IRS division that oversees tax-exempt organizations, said Friday that the practice was initiated by low-level workers in Cincinnati and was not motivated by political bias.

But on June 29, 2011, Lerner found out that such groups were being targeted, according to the inspector general's report.

She was told at a meeting that groups with ""Tea Party,"" ""Patriot"" or ""9/12 Project"" in their names were being flagged for additional and often burdensome scrutiny, the report states.

The 9/12 Project is a group started by conservative TV personality Glenn Beck.

Collins also said she does not believe the activity was limited to “a couple of rogue IRS employees.""

""After all,” she added, “groups with `progressive' in their names were not targeted similarly.""

California Republican Rep. Darrell Issa, chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Affairs, was also dubious about the explanation that the flagging was a limited, low-level activity.

""This mea culpa is not an honest one,"" he told NBC’s “Meet the Press.”

Lerner said that about 300 groups were singled out for additional review, with about one-quarter scrutinized because they had ""tea party"" or ""patriot"" somewhere in their applications.

She also said 150 of the cases have been closed and no group had its tax-exempt status revoked, though some withdrew their applications.

The economy added an estimated 195,000 jobs in June, according to the monthly report released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday morning. The unemployment rate remained unchanged at 7.6 percent, though the report was highlighted by the jobs figure, which outpaced most forecasters’ estimates.

""The economy has now added private sector jobs for 40 consecutive months, and a total of 7.2 million jobs has been added over that period,"" said Alan Krueger, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers. ""In spite of monthly volatility, over the past three years the pace of job growth has increased each year. So far this year, 1.23 million private sector jobs have been added.""

RELATED: Job creation revved up in June

To be sure, the report on Friday offered a modest political boon to President Barack Obama. Despite dire warnings about the effect of the ongoing sequester – the automatic, indiscriminate cuts to federal spending that were enacted earlier this year – the economy continues to add jobs, though not at the type of robust pace that would be needed to further reduce the unemployment rate.

But Republicans seized on some indicators of persistent economic weakness in the jobs report, namely a surge in part-time workers reflected in the statistics, and an uptick in the U-6 unemployment rate from 13.8 percent in May to 14.3 percent in June. The U-6 rate is a broader measure of unemployment, which includes discouraged workers and the underemployed.

“There’s some good news in this report, but economic growth is still tepid, the unemployment rate is far too high, and the president continues to promote policies that undermine robust job creation,” said House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, in a statement.

Boehner and other top Republicans used the June jobs report specifically to ding Obama over his administration’s announcement earlier this week that it would delay a key component of its health care reform law, the penalty for most employers who fail to offer insurance to their workers.

""ObamaCare has been predicted to be a drain on employment since before its passage and that outcome was confirmed by the Obama Administration’s delay of the employer mandate,"" House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., said in a statement. ""Delaying the inevitable for one year will bring no solace. We must have a permanent delay of ObamaCare before we can realize our full job creating potential."""
http://news.yahoo.com/us-economy-shrinks-0-1-pct-1st-time-142114641--finance.html,,[],"US economy shrinks 0.1 pct., 1st time in 3½ years","WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. economy unexpectedly shrank from October through December, the first quarterly drop since 2009 and a reminder of the economy's vulnerability as automatic cuts in government spending loom.

The Commerce Department said the economy shrank at an annual rate of 0.1 percent mainly because companies restocked at a slower rate and the government slashed defense spending. Those trends partly reflected uncertainty late last year about the fiscal cliff, which Congress averted in a deal reached Jan. 1.

Economists say those factors could prove temporary, and the likelihood of another recession appears remote. Still, the sharp slowdown from the 3.1 percent annual growth rate in the July-September quarter, also driven by a drop in U.S. exports, raised concerns about 2013.

Congressional Republicans seem determined to permit deep cuts to defense and domestic programs to kick in as scheduled March 1. And Americans are coming to grips with an increase in Social Security taxes that has begun to leave them with less take-home pay.

Government spending cuts and slower company restocking, which can fluctuate sharply, subtracted a combined 2.6 percentage points from GDP. Those two factors offset a 2.2 percent increase in consumer spending. And business spending on equipment and software rose after shrinking over the summer.

The Federal Reserve referred to the fourth-quarter slowdown in a statement after it ended a policy meeting Wednesday. The U.S. economy appears to have ""paused in recent months,"" the Fed said, mainly because of temporary factors. The Fed reaffirmed its commitment to stimulating the economy by keeping borrowing costs low for the foreseeable future.

For all of 2012, the economy expanded 2.2 percent, better than 2011's growth of 1.8 percent. For 2013, analysts generally think the economy will grow at a steady if modest pace of roughly 2 percent as the housing and auto sectors continue to recover along with bank lending and consumer spending.

Story continues

""Frankly, this is the best-looking contraction in U.S. GDP you'll ever see,"" Paul Ashworth, an economist at Capital Economics, said in a research note. ""The drag from defense spending and inventories is a one-off. The rest of the report is all encouraging.""

The plunge in defense spending in the October-December quarter followed a jump in the third quarter. The fluctuation might have reflected higher-than-usual spending that occurred in the July-September period in anticipation of government spending cuts later in the year. Some defense contractors reported lower government spending at the end of the year.

Last week, General Dynamics blamed a $2 billion loss in the fourth quarter on ""slowed defense spending.""

Exports fell by the most in nearly four years, a result of Europe's recession and slower growth in China and some other large developing countries.

Incomes, though, jumped last quarter as companies paid out special dividends and bonuses ahead of expected tax increases in 2013. Commerce estimated that businesses paid nearly $40 billion in early dividends. After-tax income, adjusted for inflation, rose 6.8 percent, the most in nearly four years.

Superstorm Sandy likely also dragged on growth by closing factories, disrupting shipping and shutting down retail stores. While the department did not specify Sandy's effect on GDP, it estimated that Sandy destroyed about $36 billion in private property and $8.6 billion in government property.

Subpar economic growth has held back hiring. The economy has added about 150,000 jobs a month, on average, for the past two years. That's barely enough to reduce the unemployment rate, which has been a still-high 7.8 percent for two months.

Economists forecast that unemployment stayed at that rate in January. The government will release the January jobs report Friday.

The slower growth in stockpiles followed a jump in the third quarter. Slower inventory growth means factories likely produced less. Heavy equipment maker Caterpillar Inc. said this week, for example, that it reduced its inventories in the fourth quarter as global sales declined from a year earlier.

Still, with consumer spending rising, companies might have to rebuild inventories in the current January-March quarter, economists say. That could boost growth.

Wednesday's report is the first of three estimates of GDP the government issues each quarter. GDP measures the nation's total output of goods and services — from restaurant meals and haircuts to airplanes and appliances. The estimates of GDP are revised by an average of 1.3 percentage points between the first and third estimate. That means the final figure for the fourth quarter might end up showing either growth or a steeper contraction.

A big question for 2013 is how consumers will react to the expiration of the Social Security tax cut. Congress and the White House allowed the temporary tax cut to expire in January but prevented income taxes from rising for most Americans.

The Social Security tax increase will reduce take-home pay this year by about 2 percent. A household earning $50,000 a year will have about $1,000 less to spend. A household with two high-paid workers will have up to $4,500 less.

A key measure of consumer confidence plummeted this month after Americans noticed the reduction in their paychecks, the Conference Board reported Tuesday.

Several trends, though, are expected to boost growth later this year.

Home builders are stepping up construction to meet rising demand. That should create more construction jobs.

And home prices are rising steadily. That tends to make Americans feel wealthier and more likely to spend. Housing could add as much as 1 percentage point to economic growth this year.

In addition, auto sales reached their highest level in five years in 2012. That's boosting production and hiring at U.S. automakers and their suppliers."

Think again.,"For many environmentally conscious Americans, there’s a deep satisfaction to chucking anything and everything plasticky into the recycling bin—from shampoo bottles to butter tubs—the types of plastics in the plastic categories #3 through #7. Little do they know that, even if their local trash collector says it recycles that waste, they might as well be chucking those plastics in the trash bin. “[Plastics] 3-7 are absolutely going to a landfill—[China's] not taking that any more… because of Green Fence,” David Kaplan, CEO of Maine Plastics, a post-industrial recycler, tells Quartz. “This will continue until we can do it in the United States economically.”

China's demand for low-cost recycled raw materials has meant waste shipments from Europe, the US, Japan and Hong Kong have arrived thick and fast, with scrap becoming the top US export to China by value ($11.3bn) in 2011. China controls a large portion of the recycling market, importing about 70% of the world's 500m tonnes of electronic waste and 12m tonnes of plastic waste each year. Sudden Chinese policy changes therefore have a significant impact on the global recycling trade, which puts pressure on western countries to reconsider their reliance on the cost-effective practice of exporting waste, a habit that's reinforced by a lack of domestic recycling infrastructure and a lower demand for secondary raw materials.

Historically, higher labor costs and environmental safety standards made processing scrap into raw materials much more expensive in the US than in China. So the US never developed much capacity or technology to sort and process harder-to-break down plastics like #3 through #7. Green Fence might be a chance to change that, says Mike Biddle, CEO of California-based recycling company MBA Polymers. “China’s Green Fence offers a real opportunity to the US government and recycling industry to step up its efforts on recycling and catalyze a strong domestic recycling market in the US,” Biddle said at a recent webinar on Green Fence.

The policy also has leveled the playing field by allowing large-scale companies that have invested additional money in pollution control and recycling services to operate at a more equal and fair-cost level, according to Kathy Xuan, CEO of full-service recycler Parc Corp. of Romeoville, Ill. With China taking a harder look at the plastic waste it imports, U.S.-based recyclers are looking for opportunities in the changing global market. Parc has doubled production in the last six months, Xuan said in a July 2 webinar hosted by the Society of the Plastics Industry Inc. of Washington.

Think those plastic items you carefully separate from the rest of your trash are being responsibly recycled? Think again. U.S. recycling companies have largely stayed away from recycling plastic and most of it has been shipped to China where it can be processed cheaper. Not anymore. This year China announced a Green Fence Policy, prohibiting much of the plastic recycling they once imported: U.S. recyclers are scrambling to come up with a solution now that China is drastically cutting back on their top import from the U.S.: China's Green Fence policy just might spur the U.S. government and recyclers into much-needed innovation: Some U.S. recycling companies are applauding the news: The opportunity for big change (and big profits) is there. Let's hope the U.S. government and recycling companies don't throw away the opportunity to lead the way."

On July 18, Detroit became the biggest U.S. city to file for bankruptcy, with an estimated $19 billion in debt. Here’s a look at some staggering facts about Motor City’s population, unemployment rate and more. The data come from a June report called “Proposals for Creditors.”

On July 18, Detroit became the biggest U.S. city to file for bankruptcy, with an estimated $19 billion in debt. Here’s a look at some staggering facts about Motor City’s population, unemployment rate and more. The data come from a June report called “Proposals for Creditors.”

The battle over the future of Detroit is set to begin this week in federal court, where government leaders will square off against retirees in a colossal debate over what the city owes to a prior generation of residents as it tries to rebuild for the next.

Soon after Detroit emergency manager Kevyn D. Orr and Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder (R) approved a bankruptcy filing Thursday, groups representing the 20,000 retirees reliant on city pensions successfully petitioned a county court to effectively freeze the bankruptcy process.

Now, city and state officials, who say the court ruling will not affect their plans, are asking a federal judge to hold hearings early this week to validate the bankruptcy and move forward with a strategy for Detroit to discharge much of its estimated $19 billion debt.

Orr has promised that retired city workers, police officers and firefighters will not see pensions or health benefits reduced for at least six months. But on Sunday, he said those retirement benefits will have to be cut down the road.

“There are going to be some adjustments,” Orr said on “Fox News Sunday.” “. . . We don’t have a choice.”

“This is a question of necessity,” he added.

But the prospect of cuts has sent a deep wave of fear over Detroit’s retirees, who like many in the city are skeptical of Orr, a corporate lawyer who previously worked in the District, and Snyder, a Republican unpopular in this deeply Democratic city.

“It’s been a nightmare for all of us,” said Shirley Lightsey, president of the Detroit Retired City Employees Association. “We don’t have that many people with pensions big enough for anything to be taken away from them.”

Of Detroit’s overall debt, about half — $9.2 billion — represents pension and health benefits that the city has promised retirees but that it now says it does not have enough money to fully pay. The lion’s share of the remaining debt is owed to bondholders.

Orr has discussed a range of steps the city could take to pay off its debts, and some have speculated that they could include selling Detroit’s international airport and valuable collections from the Detroit Institute of Arts. For current workers, he has proposed stopping pension contributions and shifting employees to individual retirement savings accounts.

But no part of the bankruptcy process is stirring as many passions as the potential need to slice pensions and benefits for retirees. Small cities that have filed for bankruptcy protection in recent years have significantly cut retirees’ benefits.

Harry Harper, who lives in northeast Detroit and retired in 2003 from the city’s Water and Sewerage Department after 30 years of service, said talk of benefit cuts is making him very anxious.

View Graphic The decline of Detroit.

“I feel very vulnerable. I don’t feel we have any protection,” said Harper, 61, who receives $2,100 a month in pension payments. “I thought that at 30 years, you earned a pension that was accrued and you did not have to have a concern about that.”

Retirees such as Harper say that living in Detroit on a fixed pension is tough since public transit has been cut back and fuel prices have been going up. Michigan’s gasoline prices are among the highest in the country.

“I’m currently living check to check,” Harper said. “Every time I get in my car, the first stop I’m making is at a gas station because of my cash flow.”

Jeanette Fitz, who retired after 35 years working in accounting for the city government, said she fears that a cut to her pension or medical coverage will be devastating.

Fitz said that she pays more than $100 a month for a half-dozen medications and that much of what remains from her pension payments goes toward her housing and other necessities.

“If they cut it, I’m not going to be able to pay my rent,” she said. “I’m not going to have money. I’m going to be homeless. I’m going to be living out of my car, I guess.”

On Sunday, Orr and Snyder said that they empathize with the fears of retirees but added that the city had ignored its problems for too long and that now there is no choice but to limit pension payments.

“You get honest about it to start with,” Snyder said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “. . . In many cases for the last 60 years, people have ignored the realities of the situation. We’re being real now.”

Detroit Mayor Dave Bing said on ABC’s “This Week With George Stephanopoulos” that one option not on the table is a federal bailout. “I think it’s very difficult right now to ask directly for support,” he said.

Technically, the dispute between the retirees and government leaders is about math — how to calculate how much of the pension system is not properly funded. But that is an unsettled area of accounting, and both sides are able to marshal expertise in their favor.

More fundamentally, though, the question facing Detroit is how much of its remaining financial resources it will use to repay bondholders who will be needed to lend money to the city in the future, to invest in the city’s basic services and to hold fast to promises made to retirees.

“Ultimately, it’s going to come down to a finite ability to pay,” said Brian O’Keefe, a lawyer who represents retired city workers, police officers and firefighters. “We just simply believe that we must honor our obligation to pensioners who spent their entire lives working for the city.”

Detroit’s financial and demographic decline will make that difficult, some experts note. The dramatic population slide the city has experienced over the past decade has hit municipal government hard.

In 2004, for instance, there was an even ratio of city workers to pensioners, but now there are six retirees for every four workers, according to a recent report by Orr.

Orr also has cast significant doubt on the calculations the pension systems have used to determine whether they have enough funding to meet obligations, noting that individuals involved in the pension system have recently faced criminal charges."

http://news.yahoo.com/house-votes-cut-food-stamps-2-billion-232659155.html,,[],House votes to cut food stamps by $2 billion,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The House voted on Wednesday to cut food stamps by $2 billion a year as part of a wide-ranging farm bill.

The chamber rejected 234-188 a Democratic amendment to the five-year, half-trillion-dollar farm legislation that would have maintained current spending on food stamps, now called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. The overall bill cuts the $80 billion-a-year program by about 3 percent and makes it harder for some people to qualify.

The food stamp cuts have complicated passage of the bill and its farm-state supporters were working to secure votes Wednesday. Many conservatives have said the food stamp cuts do not go far enough since the program has doubled in cost in the last five years and now feeds 1 in 7 Americans. Liberals have argued against any reductions, contending the House plan could take as many as 2 million needy recipients off the rolls. The White House has threatened a veto over the food stamp cuts.

The amendment by Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., and other Democrats would have eliminated the SNAP cuts and taken the money from farm subsidies instead.

""It's too big, it's too harsh and it's going to hurt so many people,"" McGovern said of the food aid cuts.

Other amendments chipped away at the program. The House adopted by voice vote an amendment to require drug tests for SNAP recipients, angering Democrats who said the tests would be demeaning to people who apply for the food aid. Lawmakers also adopted by voice vote an amendment that would end a 2004 U.S.-Mexico agreement to educate Mexican-Americans about food stamps. More amendments are expected to try and scale back the program.

Also complicating passage is growing Republican opposition to farm subsidies, some of which are expanded under the bill. Republicans have proposed amendments that would cut back dairy and sugar supports that could turn lawmakers from certain regions of the country against the bill if they were to succeed.

Story continues

The House is scheduled to continue voting on 103 amendments to the bill Thursday with a vote on passage possibly next week. As of Wednesday, it was unclear if Republicans had enough votes.

In an effort to push the legislation through, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said last week that he would vote for it, while making it clear that he did not really like it. He said he wants to get the bill to House and Senate negotiators for a potential deal, and that passing the bill was better than doing nothing.

The legislation would cut around $4 billion a year in overall spending on farm and nutrition programs. The Senate passed its version of the farm bill last week, with about $2.4 billion a year in overall cuts and a $400 million annual decrease in the SNAP program - about a fifth of the amount of the House food stamp cuts.

Democratic leaders have said they will wait to see how the House votes on the many amendments, but have so far signaled opposition to the measure. Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California argued against the food stamp cuts on the floor Wednesday and was a ""likely no"" on the bill, according to an aide. No. 2 House Democrat Steny Hoyer of Maryland called the food stamp cuts ""irresponsible.""

The chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, Rep. Frank Lucas, R-Okla., told colleagues that a robust farm policy was necessary to avoid farm crises like those in the 1930s and 1980s.

""I will work with all of you to improve this draft,"" he said Tuesday. ""I ask you to work with me.""

The legislation would achieve some of the food stamp cuts by partially eliminating what is called categorical eligibility, or giving people automatic food stamp benefits when they sign up for certain other programs. The bill would end a practice in some states of giving low-income people as little as $1 a year in home heating assistance, even when they don't have heating bills, in order to make them eligible for increased food stamp benefits.

Lucas said the cuts would still allow people who qualify to apply for food stamps, they just wouldn't automatically get them.

The Oklahoma Republican has called the overall legislation the ""most reform-minded bill in decades"" because it would make needed cuts to food stamps and eliminate $5 billion a year in direct payments, subsidies that are paid to farmers whether they grow or not. The bill would expand crop insurance and makes it easier for rice and peanut farmers to collect subsidies.

The bill also sets policy for international food aid abroad, which is currently shipped from U.S. farms. The House rejected an amendment to shift around half of international food aid money to more flexible accounts that allow for cash purchases abroad.

The Obama administration has proposed shifting the way the food aid is distributed, saying it would be more efficient to make purchases closer to conflict areas.

Now, some new reporting suggests we've created a new kind of welfare -- only most Americans aren't aware of it.

The number of people who depend on checks from Social Security's disability programs has soared in recent years, according to NPR's series ""Unfit for Work: the Startling Rise of Disability in America."" The reports, which began over the weekend and continue this week, raise the question: How disabled are the recipients, really? As you might imagine, they have touched a nerve.

A quick primer: the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program provides monthly cash assistance to people who are poor and disabled, including families with disabled children. The basic monthly SSI cash benefit is a set amount -- currently $710 for an individual and $1,066 for a couple. The Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) program also provides monthly cash assistance, to disabled people who have worked in jobs covered by Social Security. People who leave the workforce and go on disability also qualify for Medicare.

After six months of investigation, NPR reporter Chana Joffee-Walt concluded that Social Security's disability programs have become ""a de facto welfare program for people without a lot of education or job skills."" In the past three decades, she reports, the number of Americans who are on disability has skyrocketed:

Every month, 14 million people now get a disability check from the government.

The federal government spends more money each year on cash payments for disabled former workers than it spends on food stamps and welfare combined. [...]

[And] story of these programs -- who goes on them, and why, and what happens after that -- is, to a large extent, the story of the U.S. economy. It's the story not only of an aging workforce, but also of a hidden, increasingly expensive safety net.

Joffee-Walt's report takes listeners to Hale County, Ala., where one in four working-age adults is on disability, a local doctor is the go-to-guy for people in pain, and on ""the day government checks come in every month, banks stay open late, Main Street fills up with cars, and anybody looking to unload an old TV or armchair has a yard sale"" because people are relatively flush with cash.

She takes us inside ""the disability industrial complex,"" including one of the private call centers that states pay to scrutinize their welfare rolls, contact as many people as possible who might qualify for federal disability payments, and move them off the state's rolls and into the federal disability system.

The PCG [Public Consulting Group] agents help the potentially disabled fill out the Social Security disability application over the phone. And by help, I mean the agents actually do the filling out. When the potentially disabled don't have the right medical documentation to prove a disability, the agents at PCG help them get it. They call doctors' offices; they get records faxed. If the right medical records do not exist, PCG sets up doctors' appointments and calls applicants the day before to remind them of those appointments.

Joffee-Walt also reports on the 1.3 million kids on SSI, and says that some parents in Hale County told her they want kids who can ""pull a check"" so the family gets extra income. She suggests that some families who are surviving on that check may be holding their kids back from overcoming disabilities because they don't want to lose the money.

Critics call the report riddled with factual errors, devoid of context and ""ill-informed"". NPR's This American Life says it stands by its story.

The essence of the backlash is this: While critics admit the NPR report raises worthwhile questions, they say it does so in a sensational manner, traffics in inaccuracies and myths about Social Security's disability programs, and fails to tell the story about the millions of people these disability programs help. Here's how one critical analysis puts it:

The piece ignored that the recent rise in disability benefits is tied to the recession and higher rates of poverty, that qualifying for benefits is difficult, that SSI encourages employment, and that the current program has significantly reduced poverty among children with disabilities.

Listen to the report, read the criticisms, tell us your thoughts and personal experiences with the Social Security disability programs."

Boehner delivered an uncharacteristically forceful response to conservative groups lining up against the budget compromise announced Tuesday, accusing them of “using” people to advance their own goals rather than the GOP’s.

Speaking with reporters at the Capitol on Wednesday, the Ohio Republican mocked the powerful conservative forces that he said were staking out opposition to the deal even before its full details were public.

“They’re using our members and they’re using the American people for their own goals,” Boehner charged. “This is ridiculous.

“If you’re for more deficit reduction, you’re for this agreement,” he added.

The Club for Growth, one of the more prominent anti-tax groups, was the latest to come out against the deal forged by Senate Budget Committee Chairman Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and House Budget Committee Chairman Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), calling it “flawed.”

PHOTOS: The battle over Obamacare

“Apparently, there are some Republicans who don’t have the stomach for even relatively small spending reductions that are devoid of budgetary smoke and mirrors,” the group’s president, former Rep. Chris Chocola, said Wednesday.

Another group, Heritage Action, said Wednesday it would urge Republicans to vote against the deal and factor the vote into its influential rating system.

The agreement would set spending levels for 2014 at $1.012 trillion, higher than the $967-billion level that would have taken effect under the sequester in January. It would restore some funding to military and domestic spending programs, paid for with new fees and cuts elsewhere in the budget.

The House is expected to vote on the measure Thursday.

Boehner’s blunt response stands in contrast to his tone during previous budget battles, when conservative groups such as the Club for Growth and Heritage Action were complicating leadership’s efforts to come to agreements with the Senate’s Democratic leaders by coming out against proposed compromises.

When asked about the groups’ influence on his members in late October, Boehner answered simply: “Pass.”

That shift could reflect his confidence that the deal could pass without the support of a block of conservatives, whose votes were needed in previous deals since Democrats were voting nearly unanimously against them.

As members left a closed-door conference meeting Wednesday morning, many expressed concerns with the deal but nonetheless indicated they could support it.

“There’s a lot of mixed feelings about it,” said Rep. Marlin Stutzman (R-Ind.), who said he was still mulling over the proposal.

Responding to Boehner’s remarks, the Club for Growth issued a second statement from Chocola.

“We stand with Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, Tom Coburn, Rand Paul, members of the Republican Study Committee and every other fiscal conservative who opposes the Ryan-Murray deal,” he said, adding that his organization did not comment until the deal was complete. “We support pro-growth proposals when they are considered by Congress. In our evaluation, this isn’t one of those.”

Rep. Raul R. Labrador (R-Idaho), one of at least a dozen of the more conservative Republicans who will vote against the deal, also defended the conservative groups.

“What is it that these outside groups said yesterday about this deal that is false today?” he asked. But he also downplayed their influence on his vote. “Anybody who thinks my vote is for sale to Heritage Action is sadly mistaken.”

She Also Writes A Weekly Column.']","Ruth Marcus: In government shutdown, Obama faces a Solomonic moment","In summer 2011, as the debt ceiling loomed, Barack Obama saw his predicament in Solomonic terms. He was the president, charged with safeguarding the national economy. Republicans threatening default therefore had the leverage. They might have been prepared to split the baby. Obama was not willing to — like the true mother, he couldn’t — let that happen.

“There’s no doubt that the challenge we had here was ultimately I and [Treasury Secretary] Tim Geith­ner were responsible for averting another financial meltdown,” Obama later told Bob Woodward. “And so my interest in not playing chicken, or seeing any miscalculation here that leads to a default, was profound.”

Two long years later, the presidential calculus has been transformed. It boils down to: He has to be willing to split the baby in order to save it, or, more precisely, to prevent future baby-splitting.

In the administration’s sadder-but-wiser view, the no-negotiation-over-the-debt-ceiling line must be drawn brightly, once and for all, in order to avert a never-ending cascade of extortionist episodes. Otherwise, Obama and his successors will be subject to incessant, escalating demands for concessions. Better to edge up to, or even leap off, the cliff of default disaster now than to be saddled with it forevermore.

“The president has made clear that the era of threatening default has to be over,” White House economic adviser Gene Sperling said at a Politico Playbook Breakfast on Monday.

The White House is serious about not blinking — to a somewhat unsettling degree. It was disconcerting, during the lead-up to calamity in 2011, to hear administration officials so forthright about the ultimate weakness of their position. Now, my discomfort is reversed.

Has the administration over-learned the lessons of 2011? Is it being unhelpfully dogmatic in its refusal to negotiate? Don’t Republicans — particularly House Speaker John Boehner — need a face-saving bonbon to dangle in front of colleagues and base voters?

I put these concerns in question form for two reasons.

First, I’m not saying that the administration is mishandling this non-negotiation. Especially given Republicans’ assumption — based on past performance — that the president will ultimately blink, Obama may be right to err on the side of chest-thumping.

Second, let’s be clear: The fundamental fault is with Republicans who have been willing to push the boundaries of debt-ceiling brinkmanship to dangerous new extremes.

The need to lift the debt ceiling has regularly been an occasion to obtain budgetary concessions. But the tacit understanding has always been that the limit would be lifted in the end. The know-nothing notion that default would not be disastrous, whether on Treasury bonds or other government obligations, reflects the emergence of a new, scary faction of the Republican Party.

But the administration has a thin and wobbly tightrope to walk. The White House does not want to signal openness to negotiating on the debt ceiling. At the same time, it does not want to let Republicans successfully cast Obama and Democrats as the intransigent ones. That path becomes even more politically precarious as Republicans edge the discussion away from the unthinkable (repeal/defund/delay Obamacare) into the realm of the traditionally negotiable (discussions of spending levels, tax reform and the like).

Thus the president at the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Monday and his news conference Tuesday repeatedly touted his willingness to negotiate — later. “I am willing to work through all those issues,” Obama told reporters. “The only thing that our democracy can’t afford is a situation where one side says, ‘Unless I get my way and only my way, unless I get concessions before we even start having a serious give-and-take, I’ll threaten to shut down the government, or I will threaten to not pay America’s bills.’ ”

The glimmerings of an eventual agreement are beginning, slowly, to emerge. Democrats want relief from the straitjacket idiocy of “sequester” cuts. Republicans want entitlement reforms, including some that the president has already ponied up.

The riddle is how to get to the point where some such deal can be struck. The administration insists on handling the issues seriatim — first fund government and raise the ceiling, then we can talk. Congressional Democrats, seeing improved electoral prospects in 2014, are similarly disinclined to budge.

The wisdom of Solomon was that he could grasp the motivation of each mother and bluff accordingly. But the fundamental difference between biblical times and now is that Solomon was dealing with rational actors. Obama’s got Ted Cruz. Babies beware.

Even before the address, Obama’s plan to call for “investments” was panned by House Speaker John Boehner. ""If government spending were the tonic for all our ills, this would have been solved a long time ago,” Boehner told reporters.

But Obama stressed that his proposals would not add to the deficit.

“Tonight, I’ll lay out additional proposals that are fully paid for and fully consistent with the budget framework both parties agreed to just 18 months ago,” Obama said in prepared remarks. “Let me repeat -- nothing I’m proposing tonight should increase our deficit by a single dime. It’s not a bigger government we need, but a smarter government that sets priorities and invests in broad-based growth.”

At the beginning of his second term, Obama is pushing anew to make economic growth a priority. In his remarks, he says it is this generation’s task “to reignite the true engine of America’s economic growth -- a rising, thriving middle class.”

Regardless of whether Obama’s proposals add to the deficit, he is sure to face a mixed reception in putting the emphasis on new government programs when many -- particularly House Republicans -- are more interested in paring back the spending out of Washington. Some argue this could even help the economy by sending a signal that the federal government is at last tackling the budget deficit.

The president is expected to speak at 9 p.m. ET.

While Obama's aides say Tuesday night is all about the economy, he is expected to hit several other themes during the hour-long speech. First lady Michelle Obama’s guest list, announced Tuesday afternoon, provided a glimpse into what those agenda items might be -- gun control, immigration, education, science and technology funding, and more.

In each guest's biography is reflected a theme, almost certain to make its way into the president's speech.

Among those in Michelle Obama's guest box are Alan Aleman, a so-called ""DREAM student"" -- someone who arrived in the U.S. as a young illegal immigrant, but has been given a reprieve to pursue an education by the administration. Aleman's presence will be symbolic as the president pushes for immigration reform which, if he gets his way, will include some permanent provision dealing illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. as children.

Also in the guest box is Cleopatra Cowley-Pendleton, mother of Hadiya Pendleton who was killed in Chicago in late January. The first lady attended Hadiya's memorial service over the weekend. Cowley-Pendleton, together with other victims of gun violence in the crowd Tuesday night, represents the president's push for new gun control measures.

Several other guests speak to Obama's stance on the budget. Highlighting the president's push for science funding, the flight director for the Mars Curiosity Rover will be in the crowd. And highlighting the president's push for tax cuts on the middle class (and hikes on top earners), the guest box will include Lisa Richards, a single mom who voiced concern to the White House about taxes rising on the middle class.

The president will have several other weighty issues to address Tuesday night, not the least of which is North Korea's latest nuclear test. The president also plans to announce 34,000 U.S. troops will be brought home from Afghanistan within a year.

That will bring the force size to roughly half what it is now, in the run-up to the withdrawal deadline of the end of 2014.

The centerpiece of the address, though, is still expected to be the economy. The president is expected to revive his calls Tuesday for government ""investments"" in infrastructure and education -- meaning spending. While the recurring push, for Republicans, brings back bad memories of the stimulus law they opposed, White House economic adviser Gene Sperling told Fox News on Tuesday that closing the deficit ""doesn't mean you pull back on everything.""

""I don't think that laying the foundation for future growth (with research and highway spending) is anything to discount in any way,"" Sperling said. ""What you need to do is be smart.""

Boehner, though, dismissed the push. ""If government spending were the tonic for all our ills, this would have been solved a long time ago,"" he said Tuesday. Boehner said the president added ""$5 trillion in new debt over the last four years. How much further is he going to run us into the sewer?""

Boehner also claimed the president doesn't have the ""guts"" to tackle the budget deficit.

Obama and Congress are scrambling to find a way to avoid automatic spending cuts poised to hit March 1 unless a deal is reached to replace them.

Obama, to the chagrin of Republicans, wants to replace those cuts with a blend of tax hikes and separate cuts. Republicans, citing the tax-hike concessions they gave during the fiscal crisis talks, are averse to more tax increases -- even if this time, those increases do not come in the form of rate hikes."

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) Monday, calling him a ""schoolyard bully"" for trying to insert instructions into Senate budget negotiations that would prohibit raising taxes or the debt ceiling.

""My friend from Texas is like a schoolyard bully,"" Reid said. ""He pushes everybody around and is losing, and instead of playing the game according to the rules, he not only takes the ball home with him but changes the rules. That way no one wins except the bully who tries to indicate to people he has won. We’re asking Republicans to play by the rules and let us go to conference.""

""I object too, but what my friend suggests is fairly ridiculous if you want the truth -- before we go to conference determine what you do and not do in the conference, that's not how we do things around here,"" he continued.

Cruz responded, ""I wasn't aware we were in a schoolyard.""

""There's either an objection or no objection,"" Reid shot back. ""We've had enough of reserving the right to object.""

""Reserving the right to object,"" said Cruz.

""Mr. President, there is no such thing,"" Reid said.

Cruz finally objected.

The exchange came after Reid tried to move toward ""regular order,"" in which Senate Republicans appoint budget conferees to negotiate with the House, which passed its own budget resolution.

The Senate passed a budget on March 23, neutralizing a key Republican talking point that the Senate had not passed a budget. The bill passed 50-49 with no Republican votes and increased taxes.

Cruz, like many Republicans, had criticized the Senate for not passing a budget. ""As you know, we haven't had a budget in over three years,"" he said on Fox News in November 2012, before taking office. ""I think if the Democrats want to pursue big government policy, they ought to vote on it. They've got to go on record and say this is what we want to do, this is our budget."""

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., scrambled late Monday to iron out the specifics of an emerging budget proposal after a string of prior plans fizzled.

Reid appeared on the chamber floor Monday night to announce, ""We've made tremendous progress -- we are not there yet -- but tremendous progress, and everyone just needs to be patient.""

McConnell added, ""We've had a good day...I think it's safe to say we've made substantial progress and we look forward to making more progress in the near future.""

The House GOP Conference is scheduled to meet at 9 a.m. to discuss the tentative framework of the budget proposal with members, many of whom cast a skeptical eye toward the details of the negotiations that were dripping out Monday night. The Senate Republican Conference is scheduled to meet at 11 a.m. to receive an update on negotiations.

More On This...

Resistance in the House could scuttle, or at least stall, anything that emerges from the Senate.

The White House abruptly postponed a meeting with congressional leaders set for Monday afternoon, to give senators space to work.

""We're going to get this done,"" Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., claimed.

It's unclear whether the optimism would be matched by results. After several prior plans fell apart over the weekend, lawmakers are working on a tight timeframe. Congress, aside from grappling with the partial government shutdown, faces an Oct. 17 deadline to raise the debt ceiling. After that date, the Treasury Department warns, the U.S. government will not be able to pay all its bills.

Fox News has learned that the emerging framework would raise the debt ceiling through February, and include a spending bill meant to last through Jan. 15.

Importantly, a tentative provision to repeal or delay the medical device tax in ObamaCare has been taken out, a senior Democratic aide said. But the proposal could include other modest items pertaining to ObamaCare, including income verification for those getting subsidies and a one-year delay of at least one obscure fee which had been sought by unions.

House Republicans are watching the negotiations play out, and according to sources still want to see provisions to strip ObamaCare subsidies for congressional staff. It's unclear where they will ultimately fall, but conservative members predicted a ""huge fight"" if McConnell ""completely capitulates.""

Negotiators are still tinkering with the framework, and the details could change.

Asked earlier Monday if they were closer to a deal, Reid said: ""I hope so.""A McConnell spokesman said the two were ""engaged in good faith negotiations and those talks will continue.""

The new framework appears to be driven largely by Senate Democrats, but potentially with buy-in from McConnell.

Pressure is mounting from all sides to reach an agreement. There is fear that the financial markets could start to dive if traders lose confidence that a deal will ultimately emerge. And furloughed federal workers, now entering week three of the partial shutdown, are just now starting to see the hit to their paychecks.

But both sides of the debate were having a difficult time keeping track of what the other wants out of a deal. A standoff that began as a fight by Republicans to unravel ObamaCare is now largely a fight over spending levels -- which has emerged as a major sticking point.

After a string of budget proposals fell apart over the weekend, GOP lawmakers on Sunday pointedly accused Democrats of trying to squeeze Republicans to roll back across-the-board spending cuts known as sequester.

""I agree that Republicans started with the overreach, but now Democrats are one tick too cute,"" Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., told ""Fox News Sunday."" ""They are now overreaching.""

He said ""both sides need to come to the middle of the road.""

A prior plan, fronted by Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, would have funded the government for six months, raised the debt limit through Jan. 31, and delayed the health care law's medical device tax.

As Reid dismissed the plan on Saturday, the dispute over spending levels escalated.

Republicans want to continue current spending at $986.7 billion and leave untouched the new round of cuts on Jan. 15 that would reduce the amount to $967 billion.

Democrats, though, want to figure out a way to undo the reductions, plus enact a long-term extension of the debt limit increase and a short-term spending bill to reopen the government.

Republicans bristled at Democrats' demands. A House Republican leadership aide said Sunday that Reid ""moved the goalposts"" by trying to ""violate"" spending levels set in the 2011 Budget Control Act.

But Democrats denied they were trying to violate those levels.

A Senate Democratic leadership aide said ""the suggestion that Democrats insist on breaking the budget caps is false and belied by the facts.""

Essentially, Democrats argue that they would accept current spending levels for a short period -- just not as long as Collins proposed -- so they can have another go at the sequester cuts in the near future.

Congressional sources confirmed to Fox News that the talks between Reid and McConnell are focusing on the length of the spending bill versus the length of the debt-ceiling increase. Reid wants a longer extension on the debt ceiling, but a shorter-term spending bill.

Unclear was whether any Senate deal would pass the Republican-controlled House by Thursday, though Senate Democrats were hoping momentum and the debt-ceiling deadline would pressure House lawmakers.

http://news.yahoo.com/shutdown-ruins-vacations-hurts-local-economies-041811789.html,,[],"Shutdown ruins vacations, hurts local economies","FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. (AP) — Stop at a cafe in the remote stretches of northern Arizona and southern Utah in the fall, and you're likely to hear a mix of languages as tourists from around the world step into the iconic western landscape, marked by breathtaking canyons and massive rock formations.

Millions of visitors tour the region each year for what can be once-in-a-lifetime vacations.

Those visitors didn't stop with the government shutdown, which forced officials to close down roads, campgrounds and tourist centers at national parks dotting the landscape.

Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer has offered to use state money to keep the Grand Canyon open, and several businesses made similar pledges — all of which have been politely rejected by the national park.

The impact isn't just ruining vacations. It also has brought local economies to a near standstill.

THUMBS DOWN

Outside Yellowstone's north entrance, two men on a bus with Indian and Chinese passengers frown and give the thumbs down sign after seeing the park is shut down. A family of Japanese tourists leaves the Grand Canyon in tears. An English couple and a Belgium couple touring national parks out West settles for a drive around Yosemite without being able to put their feet on the ground.

""Looks as though both sides are having a bit of a childish tantrum,"" says Englishman Neil Stanton.

Songyi Cho, on a separate trip to Yosemite, says: ""This is crazy. How can a whole government shut down?""

While some international tourists kept tabs on American politics in the days before they ventured to national parks, others were blindsided.

Alan Platt and his wife, Leana, first heard about a possible shutdown while at the Grand Canyon on Monday. Platt guessed that lawmakers would be pushed to the brink but pass a budget by the deadline. He was wrong, and the couple was forced to cut their three-day Grand Canyon stay short.

""For the rest of the world, we're concerned about the fact you have partisan positioning going on,"" he says. ""No matter who's in power, there's a national pride in engagement we saw. Suddenly, we see a great divide.""

Story continues

ICONS FROM A DISTANCE

Some of the country's most recognizable icons can be viewed from a distance — the full faces of Mount Rushmore, Devils Tower, the granite formations in Yosemite, the Grand Canyon and Mount Rainier. No one needs to tell tourists that it's not the same as camping on the beaches of the Grand Canyon off the Colorado River, walking the slot canyons at Zion or watching water spew at Old Faithful in Yellowstone.

""There's no question it's disappointing,"" says Bruce Brossman of the Grand Canyon Railway, which has furloughed conductors and engineers who run trains into the canyon. ""You can get a sneak peak and maybe get inspired to come back.""

Returning to the national parks might be easier said than done, particularly for international tourists who often plan expensive and lengthy vacations.

SALVAGING TRIPS

Jock Holland, of Melbourne, Australia, is among those forced to make alternate plans. He was heading to Grand Teton from Yellowstone when he was stopped by the park closure. He planned to chart a new course after grabbing a bite to eat in Jackson, Wyo.

The Yosemite Sierra Visitors Bureau outside the national park helped Stanton and his wife, Clare, set up horseback rides and hikes outside. He says Yosemite has ""been somewhat on our bucket list for years, and you get here and you can't get to it. A bit frustrating but we still made the most of it.""

Julie Jaeger and her friend are leaving California on Friday for what would have been a trip to Zion, Bryce Canyon, the Grand Canyon's North Rim, Canyonlands and Mesa Verde national parks. They've renamed their vacation the ""magical mystery tour,"" as they search for state parks and interesting towns to visit along the way. They still hope the federal government resumes operations and they can salvage part of their original itinerary.

BUSINESSES TAKE HIT

Rafting outfitters, fishing guides, Jeep companies, hotels and restaurants are hurting without the 715,000 people who spend about $76 million a day visiting the national park system.

About 90 percent of the business at Phoenix-based Across Arizona Tours is for the Grand Canyon, says company co-founder Leonardo Gem.

""It's like closing Macy's the day after Thanksgiving,"" he says.

At Lees Ferry Anglers, which runs fishing trips in Glen Canyon National Recreation Area in northern Arizona, employees are busy calling customers to cancel trips scheduled this week.

""It is devastating,"" says employee Kaila Bruner. ""You can't really function normally. We just have to depend on the lodging and the through traffic to stay open.""

Greg Bryan, mayor of the tiny town of Tusayan outside the Grand Canyon entrance, manages a hotel in town and says he is downsizing staff as fewer and fewer people come through. The town should be bustling with tourists sharing pictures of sunsets over the South Rim, of mule rides down the park's trails and massive expanses of geology.

It looks more like a ghost town these days.

Before Becoming An Editor', 'She Was A Reporter Covering U.S. Economic Policy']",Congress approves ‘fiscal cliff’ measure,"Congress approved a plan to end Washington’s long drama over the “fiscal cliff” late Tuesday after House Republicans surrendered to President Obama’s demand to let taxes rise on the nation’s richest households.

The House voted 257 to 167 to send the measure to Obama for his signature; the vote came less than 24 hours after the Senate overwhelmingly approved the legislation.

House Speaker John A. Boehner (Ohio) and most other top GOP leaders took no public position on the measure and offered no public comment before the 10:45 p.m. vote. Boehner declined even to deliver his usual closing argument, leaving House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp (R-Mich.) to defend the measure as the “largest tax cut in American history.”

The bill will indeed shield millions of middle-class taxpayers from tax increases set to take effect this month. But it also will let rates rise on wages and investment profits for households pulling in more than $450,000 a year, marking the first time in more than two decades that a broad tax increase has been approved with GOP support.

The measure also will keep benefits flowing to 2 million unemployed workers on the verge of losing their federal checks. And it will delay for two months automatic cuts to the Pentagon and other agencies that had been set to take effect Wednesday.

View Graphic The impact of tax increases on taxpayers

Many economists had warned that the scheduled tax increases and spending cuts would have plunged the economy back into recession.

Conservatives complained bitterly that the legislation would raise taxes without making any significant cuts in government spending. For much of the day, the measure appeared headed for defeat as Boehner contemplated tacking on billions in spending cuts, a move that would have derailed a compromise that the White House and Senate leaders had carefully crafted.

In the end, GOP lawmakers decided not to take a gamble that could force the nation to face historic tax increases for virtually every American — and leave House Republicans to take the blame.

“I don’t know if playing chicken with the American people at this point is in the best interest of the people,” said freshman Rep. Lou Barletta (R-Pa.).

The bill drew 85 votes from Republicans and 172 from Democrats, meaning well more than half of its support came from the Democratic minority.

With 151 Republicans voting “no,” the GOP tally fell far short of a majority of the GOP caucus. That broke a long-standing preference by Boehner to advance only bills that could draw the support of a majority of his Republican members.

In a sign of the moment’s gravity, Boehner himself cast a rare vote: He supported the bill. So did Rep. Paul Ryan (Wis.), the GOP’s vice-presidential candidate last year, who parted ways from Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), a potential 2016 presidential contender, who voted against the measure.

But other top GOP leaders voted no, including Majority Leader Eric Cantor (Va.) and Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (Calif.).

Boehner was humiliated just two weeks ago when the Republican rank-and-file refused to support a GOP alternative that would have permitted taxes to rise only on income over $1 million a year. But when he scheduled a vote on the Senate bill, even some of the chamber’s staunchest conservatives agreed that giving up the fight was probably the best course.

In a brief statement, Obama praised congressional leaders for advancing the legislation, which he said would produce $620 billion in new tax revenue. “But I think we all recognize this law is just one step in the broader effort to strengthen our economy and broaden opportunity for everybody,” he said, noting that the fight over the budget will continue when the new Congress faces the imposition of sequestration cuts in just two months.

But Obama warned again that he would not negotiate with Republicans over the $16.4 trillion debt limit, which must be raised in the coming weeks. “While I will negotiate over many things,” he said, “I will not have another debate with this Congress over whether they will pay the bills they’ve already racked up.”

With that, Obama took off for Hawaii, where he left his wife and daughters the day after Christmas. It was unclear when he planned to sign the fiscal cliff measure, which calls for the top tax rate to rise immediately from 35 percent to 39.6 percent on income over $450,000 for married couples and $400,000 for single people.

The measure will protect more than 100 million families earning less than $250,000 a year from significant income tax increases set to take effect this month — although their payroll taxes will rise with the expiration of a temporary tax cut adopted two years ago.

In addition to avoiding much of the fiscal cliff, the measure will extend federal dairy policies through September, averting a threatened doubling of milk prices. The measure also will cancel a scheduled pay raise for members of Congress.

After weeks of partisan bickering over whether taxes should increase for anyone, the compromise bill rolled through the Senate early Tuesday in a highly unusual New Year’s Day vote. The vote was 89 to 8, with both parties offering overwhelming support.

The moment served as a rare bipartisan coda to what has been one of the most rancorous, partisan Congresses in recent history. The 11 senators who are retiring received hugs and kisses from their colleagues. The current Congress ends at noon Thursday, when the new Congress will be seated, and lawmakers would have been forced to scrap the fiscal-cliff legislation and start over.

Three Democrats voted against the measure, including liberal Tom Harkin (Iowa), and moderates Thomas R. Carper (Del.) and Michael F. Bennet (Colo.).

Bennet complained that the bill would do little to reduce record budget deficits. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the measure would cause the national debt to be $4 trillion higher by 2022 than if all of the cliff’s tax increases and spending cuts had been allowed to take effect.

Five Senate Republicans also rejected the measure, including tea party favorites Rand Paul (Ky.) and Mike Lee (Utah).

But 40 others voted for it, including such GOP leaders on tax-and-spending policy as Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (Pa.) and Ronald H. Johnson (Wis.), a tea party star who frequently consults with House conservatives.

Neither party was entirely happy with the bill. While conservatives complained about new taxes and a lack of spending reductions, liberals complained about its provisions regarding inherited estates.

Although the tax rate will rise from 35 percent to 40 percent, estates worth as much as $5 million — $10 million for married couples — will go untaxed. And an inflation adjustment will guarantee that the size of the exemption will grow to $15 million for couples by the end of the decade.

Still, House Democrats largely embraced the measure, which was negotiated by Vice President Biden and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and endorsed by Obama. After receiving a point-by-point 90-minute briefing from Biden on Tuesday, Democrats rallied around the package.

“It’s long overdue for us to have this solution to go forward and remove all doubt as to what comes next for our country,” said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).

But it was a different story among House Republicans, who at first appeared to strongly oppose it. In the early afternoon, the GOP gathered for the first of two lengthy closed-door briefings in the basement of the Capitol.

There, Boehner told members that he wanted to hear their views but would not take a position. Cantor, meanwhile, “forcefully” aired concerns that the measure would raise taxes but not cut spending, said Rep. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.). Afterward, Cantor emerged and told reporters: “I do not support the bill.”

That view was widespread in the room, where House members vented their frustrations at the Senate for foisting the arrangement upon them. Many rose to say they should take advantage of the legislative process, tack on billions in new spending reductions and force the Senate to respond.

“We should not take a package put together by a bunch of sleep-deprived octogenarians on New Year’s Eve,” retiring Rep. Steven C. LaTourette (R-Ohio) said in a dig at Senate leaders. LaTourette, who has championed ambitious deficit-reduction efforts, faced the prospect of casting his last vote in Congress for a measure that would sharply deepen deficits.

Rep. Spencer Bachus (R-Ala.) said a consensus was developing that the GOP should amend the Senate’s plan. “I would be shocked if the bill did not go back to the Senate,” he said.

The negative reaction threatened to plunge Washington back into the high-stakes, last-minute drama that has characterized both the fiscal-cliff negotiations and a series of other recent confrontations between the two parties over spending and taxes, including the fight over raising the federal borrowing limit in the summer of 2011.

Senate Democrats and administration officials warned that the Senate would reject any move to amend the measure. The House would be responsible for a dive over the cliff hours before U.S. financial markets were set to open Wednesday after the New Year’s holiday.

For hours, there was no decision on how to proceed. As leaders huddled, rank-and-file members returned to their offices and were greeted with confusing messages from conservatives and constituents.

Former House speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), who has opposed any deal to raise taxes, voiced support for Cantor. But conservative writer William Kristol, wrote a blog post titled “Say Yes to the Mess.”

“Politically, Republicans are escaping with a better outcome than they might have expected, and President Obama has gotten relatively little at his moment of greatest strength,” Kristol said, advising House Republicans to take the deal.

Shortly before dinner, Republicans gathered behind closed doors again to settle on a new plan: Leaders would survey members about the spending-cut package to determine if it could pass. If not, they would allow the Senate bill to move ahead.

Around 8 p.m., they announced a decision. The Senate bill would receive a vote, with the expectation that Democrats and Republicans would join forces to approve the measure.

During floor debate, Camp, chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, said GOP members should support the bill because it would make “permanent tax policies Republicans originally crafted” under President George W. Bush.

Rep. Sander M. Levin (Mich.), the ranking Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee, countered that Democrats should back the bill because it would let the Bush tax cuts expire for the wealthy, breaking the “iron barrier” to tax increases since 1993.

Senator says immigration stats show welfare rules not enforced,"Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions is accusing the Obama administration of failing to enforce a century-old law meant to prevent immigrants from taking root in the U.S. only to live on the government dole -- after the administration reported it did not cite anyone for this last year.

""Virtually no one one is being examined before they enter the country on whether or not they'll ... immediately begin to depend on government welfare,"" Sessions, R-Ala., top Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, told Fox News.

As Congress weighs new immigration legislation, Sessions said any reform package ""has got to end that.""

Sessions turned up new statistics from the Department of Homeland Security last week showing what he describes as a startling trend. DHS reported how relatively few immigrants are being turned away on the grounds that they are likely to become a ""public charge"" -- or individuals who depend on welfare programs -- despite a 100-year-old law that's supposed to prevent this.

The department, blaming ""data entry quality,"" said it did not have complete information on how many immigrants became public charges. But the department did a case-by-case review for the bulk of fiscal 2012, and found just one where that claim was leveled at an immigrant. ""However, the charge was later withdrawn,"" DHS reported.

Further, the department reported that just a tiny fraction of people are rejected on these grounds when seeking entry under a program that allows admission for 90 days for travelers from certain countries. Between fiscal 2005 and most of fiscal 2012, a total of 9,796 were denied -- a fraction of a percent of those admitted. State Department figures for visa applications showed a similar trend, with just .068 percent of visa applications denied on those grounds in fiscal 2011.

Sessions has been hammering this issue for months. He and other Republican senators earlier wrote to the departments of Homeland Security and State arguing that a bedrock principle of immigration law is that ""those who seek citizenship in this country ought to be financially self-sufficient.""

The senator suggests the immigration system has produced a lopsided result in which high-skill immigrants are turned away while those who end up absorbing more taxpayer dollars than they contribute stay.

Recent studies show welfare spending on immigrant-headed households is relatively high. A Center for Immigration Studies report found that 36 percent of these households were using ""at least one major welfare program"" in 2010 -- compared with 23 percent of other households.

Sessions' office says the number of non-citizens on food stamps has skyrocketed in recent years. And the conservative Heritage Foundation claims low-skill immigrant households take in roughly $20,000 more in government benefits every year than they pay in taxes.

Sessions suggests the government is fueling this trend. He earlier made a stink over long-running U.S. Department of Agriculture radio ""novelas"" that depicted people being pressured into going on food stamps. The ads were later discontinued. The senator also is drawing attention to the WelcomeToUSA.gov site that provides information on a host of taxpayer assistance programs for immigrants, including Medicare, food stamps, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and others."

It is at the park’s northeast, not northwest, entrance. This version has been corrected.

— The giant yellow snowplows that wake Yellowstone from its winter slumber every March are idled, waiting for the sun to make up for federal budget cuts that are forcing the park to open late for peak season.

Mandatory cuts kicked in three days before the plows were to start clearing snow and ice from 300 roads at altitudes that reach 11,000 feet. Faced with an order from Washington to slice $1.8 million from his budget, the park superintendent, Dan Wenk, had considered his options.

He could slash the ranks of the 430 seasonal rangers, guides and other employees who help keep Yellowstone running every summer. But it would mean fewer visitor centers open, fewer walking tours and a risk to public safety.

He could halt the bison-management program — but the program is required under a court settlement. He could close the park for two weeks before the fiscal year ends Sept. 30, but that would mean shutting out 267,000 visitors.

Or he could keep the seasonals, just fewer of them, and bring them on two weeks later, saving $450,000. He could freeze all permanent hires ($1 million), delay the snowplows ($250,000) and open most entrances two weeks late. About 50,000 visitors would be lost, and hundreds of fishing and hiking guides, rangers, and concession workers would lose their livelihoods.

But it seemed the best bad alternative. The sun would melt and soften the snow, saving $30,000 a day.

“We didn’t say we’re going to shut the park down” for the season, Wenk said. “But it will have real impacts.”

At parks, military bases and federal agencies across the country, managers such as Wenk are weighing choices being forced by the budget reductions known as sequestration.

“Everybody says, ‘We want you to run the park like a private business,’ ” he said, referring to the 5.1 percent cut he must make over seven months, which will feel a lot bigger. “Well, here it is. The impact is 9 percent.”

Early Monday, he sat in regulation khakis in the brown armchair in his office, five miles inside the park, 2,174 miles from Washington. The temperature outside was 3 degrees. He looked over a long list of calls and meetings on his schedule to make it official that plowing would not start on time.

He dialed the governor of Montana.

“There’s a lot of misinformation out there that we are just doing this to make a statement about the effects of sequestration,” he told Gov. Steve Bullock (D), walking him through his decision.

“That’s where we are, sir,” Wenk said.

Bullock thanked him for the briefing. Then things got messy.

By midday, a news release had gone out, and the angry while-you-were-out slips were piling up. Tour guide Rusty Cole’s was at the top.

“He’s mad as hell and not buying your argument,” read the message.

“Rusty should call his congressman,” Wenk said in frustration, rubbing his eyes.

And Cole did. Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) returned his call that night.

“He said the delayed opening is not a done deal,” recounted Cole, who is furious that park officials are slashing two weeks from his 20-week season.

“They spend millions of dollars to operate Air Force One, and they can’t come up with some money to blow open the roads in Yellowstone?” Cole said.

But the sequestration law slices money from most budgets across the government, including $136 million from the 398 national parks.

In 1872, the federal government saw to it that the spectacular landscape of 2.2 million acres, which is ringed by the Rocky Mountains in Wyoming, Montana and Idaho, was protected as America’s first national park. Today, Yellowstone country is a deeply conservative place, where government is regarded with great suspicion.

Just ask Wyoming’s lone House member, Rep. Cynthia M. Lummis (R), who applauded the $85 billion carved across the board in a letter to constituents.

“Instead of blindly filling empty desks,” she wrote last week, “federal agencies will be forced to consider which positions are crucial and make their decision based on necessity rather than luxury.”

In an interview, Lummis suggested that Wenk petition House and Senate appropriators for permission to take money from his capital budget to cover the cuts, an idea he said was not legal and would never get through Congress in time.

The late opening has further inflamed the area’s anti-government sentiment as small, rural communities that serve park visitors absorb the reality of the cuts. In the large scheme of 3.4 million annual visits, losing 50,000 seems small.

But the ripple effect on jobs and tourism could means millions of dollars in lost income. The plowing delay also means that snow won’t be cleared until mid-June from the scenic Beartooth Highway, which straddles Montana and Wyoming outside the park. The National Park Service plows about half the the road.

“We have 90 days to make a living,” said Sam Bolinger, 56, who leads whitewater rafting tours along the Yellowstone River from Gardiner, Mont., in the summer and grooms park trails in the winter. “If people get the impression they can’t get into the park, they just won’t come.”

There was the hostile reaction from the mayor of Jackson, Wyo., 60 miles from the park’s south entrance, who told Wenk that anyone knows how to cut 5.1 percent from a budget without inflicting this much pain.

“This is, with all due respect, an asinine decision,” Mark Barron said in a conference call with business and community leaders. Jackson recently cut its budget by 22 percent, Barron said, “and we didn’t cut any services.”

“This is a small cut in your budget, sir,” Barron continued. “If I ran my business like this, I wouldn’t be in business long.”

It was the day’s one moment when Wenk, a self-possessed and widely respected 60-year-old civil servant, got mad. He was acting Park Service director in Washington in 2011 when the top job opened at Yellowstone. He had been a management assistant to the park superintendent in the early 1980s, and he and his wife couldn’t wait to get back.

Wenk managed to contain his temper, though, telling Barron that Yellowstone’s $33 million budget is $3.7 million smaller than it was three years ago. He asked Barron whether the park should continue to stay open in the winter, when each visitor costs $55 — vs. $10 in the summer. When the call was over, Wenk and his deputy, Steve Iobst, wondered how one could slash 22 percent just like that.

As sequestration hit, the park was preparing for high season, closing the hotels and restaurants that serve its fewer than 100,000 winter tourists. Yellowstone in winter is a landscape of white, broken only by pine trees and half-

frozen rivers. Clouds of steam from the park’s many geysers billow into the cold, while herds of bison forage. The only way around is by snowmobile, and that’s the tourist draw.

“We just saw a fox for the second time today,” marveled Tina Don, visiting from Cedarhurst, N.Y., and warming up inside a concession trailer. “The same fox!” Her husband, Scott Dere, pulled out his iPhone and scrolled through his photos. A bison, an elk, a bald eagle. Don pointed out that her hot chocolate cost just $2.25 (“There’s no place in New York you could get hot chocolate for that”) and said the park should raise the price to cover the budget cuts.

By late May, the place will be humming with cars and RVs, campfires and hikers.

The small towns at the park’s edge have been closely following Washington’s budget wars. All roads to survival lead to Yellowstone. “We’re here all day, hoping someone comes in for a cup of coffee,” said Jan Gaertner, who owns the Buns N Beds restaurant and cabins in Cooke City, Mont., population 300. “For us, $400 in a day in April is good.”

At the Old Faithful visitor center, Rich Jehle said half of his six supervisor jobs are vacant and won’t be filled, which will mean fewer guided walks around the geyser and other attractions.

“We’ll be spread thin, but we’ll adapt,” said Jehle, who oversees about half of the park’s the visitor centers and interpretive programs.

On Wednesday, Wenk was 90 minutes into a meeting with his managers to decide which seasonal workers would not be called back and how the park would adjust to permanent vacancies, when the Wyoming governor’s office called. The governor was getting complaints about the opening delay.

And Cooke City residents in particular were in a civil war. Cooke City sits on an eight-mile section of highway outside the park’s northeast entrance that’s usually plowed by the Park Service, opening access to eastern Montana. Wenk offered to plow the road first, but the snowmobile industry balked: Paved roads mean less business. Now the plow crews won’t arrive until the end of May, angering other businesses who want the road cleared.

Wyoming Gov. Matt Mead (R) organized an emergency conference call for Wednesday to figure out whether Wenk could reverse his decision or whether there was any other way to open the park on time. About 20 mayors, tourism and business leaders and state transportation officials dialed in. Mead was asked whether the state would plow the roads in the park.

It was an uncomfortable spot. A state bailout of the federal government to help his constituents? Wyoming has just sliced 6.5 percent from state spending while raising the fuel tax — a combination of new revenue and cuts that Washington can’t seem to agree to.

“It’s a bad message for Wyoming to say, Yellowstone is not open, call back later,” Mead said in an interview. “But do I ask that state resources step in to cure a large federal screw-up?”

His answer late Friday: No. His office announced that the state would provide labor and equipment — but will not “backfill federal dollars lost through sequestration.” That means the park communities must pay for the plowing.

Local leaders said they are trying to raise the money. But every day causes more delays.

Wenk is already thinking about next year, when he said he will be forced to consider closing the park in the winter. Sequestration, he thought, is here to stay.

http://money.cnn.com/2013/05/03/news/economy/april-jobs-report/,2013-05-03 00:00:00,['Annalyn Kurtz'],April jobs report: Hiring picks up,"The U.S. economy seemed to be headed for a spring slowdown this year. Then the April jobs report was released Friday morning, and now some economists are doing a double-take.

The economy added 165,000 jobs in April, according to the Labor Department. That was more than the 140,000 jobs economists expected, and it marked an improvement over March.

The even bigger story, though, came from large revisions to earlier numbers. It's a common practice for the Labor Department to revise its data for the two prior months, and this time, those revisions showed an additional 114,000 jobs were added in the U.S. economy over February and March alone.

Previously, March hiring had looked particularly weak, with only 88,000 jobs added that month. Now, the Labor Department says 138,000 jobs were added in March.

February job growth, which had already looked solid, now looks even stronger. About 332,000 jobs were added in February, making it the strongest month for hiring since the Census hired temporary workers in 2010.

The report goes a long way ""toward soothing fears of another spring slowdown,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist for Capital Economics.

Economists had been warning of a spring swoon for the third year in a row, this time driven largely by government spending cuts and global economic weakness. Retail sales slumped unexpectedly in March, the manufacturing sector stalled in April, and signs abroad point to a global deceleration. China's rapid economic growth has lost some steam and Europe is still mired in a recession.

But those fears eased following the report. Stocks jumped. For the first time ever, the Dow topped 15,000 and the S&P 500 climbed above 1,600.

Service jobs boom: The strongest job growth in April came from restaurants and bars, which added 38,000 jobs; temporary services, which added 31,000 jobs; and retailers, which added 29,000 jobs. On the flip side, the government is now the biggest drag on the job market. Overall, federal, state and local governments cut 11,000 jobs in April.

The bigger picture, however, remains static. About 11.7 million people remain unemployed, and the unemployment rate fell to 7.5% in April, but that's still high compared to historical levels. Before the recession hit, the unemployment rate was 4.5%.

""This is a classic 'hold-steady' report -- enough job growth to keep the unemployment rate stable but not much more,"" said Heidi Shierholz, an economist with the Economic Policy Institute. ""In good times, this would be fine, but at a time like this, it represents an ongoing disaster.""

A big question still hangs in the air about how many jobless Americans are simply not being counted in the unemployment figures. The unemployment rate only includes people who have looked for work in the prior four weeks. Workers who have given up on the job market are not counted.

Only 63.3% of the civilian population, over age 16, is either working or looking for a job. That's the lowest labor force participation rate since May 1979.

Blue-collar jobs take a hit: Over the last six years, the labor force has declined most dramatically in auto manufacturing states like Michigan, Ohio and Indiana. While some veteran workers may simply be retiring, the trend could also reflect former blue-collar jobs transforming into fewer high-skill, technical positions.

""These jobs pay more, but there aren't as many of them either,"" said Mark Vitner, senior economist for Wells Fargo. ""In order to fill those jobs, workers may need to be retrained.""

Nationwide, manufacturing hiring came to a halt in April.

Construction firms also cut 6,000 jobs. The sector had been adding jobs for the prior 10 months, fueled mainly by the housing recovery. But, as of April, job cuts by commercial firms were large enough to offset jobs added by homebuilders. Those job cuts are most likely tied to recent declines in government-funded construction projects, for example on infrastructure and schools.

Health care remained a strong sector, adding 19,000 jobs in April. Hospitals and doctors' offices hired more workers, and demand for more health care for the elderly is driving a surge in home health care services. That industry added 6,000 jobs in April. The Labor Department expects home health aide to be the fastest growing occupation in the country this decade.

How far we've come: Overall, the U.S. economy lost 8.7 million jobs in the financial crisis, and since then has added back about 6.2 million jobs.

Once you factor population growth into the mix, Shierholz estimates there is still a gap of 8.6 million jobs ""missing"" from the U.S. economy. If hiring keeps up at its current pace, it will take about five more years to get back to a pre-recession job market."

The partial government shutdown is now in its eighth day. While some people aren't feeling the impact yet, effects are hitting communities across the country.

Here's what you need to know.

What's happening in Washington (or, what's not happening)



While Republicans and Democrats are expected to do a lot of talking Tuesday, little of it is with members of the opposite party to work on a way to break the stalemate.

House Speaker John Boehner indicated that he's willing to talk. He told reporters Tuesday he's ""not drawing any lines in the sand."" ""I want to have a conversation,"" he told reporters in Washington. ""It's time to ... resolve our differences.""

President Obama called Speaker Boehner Tuesday morning – just minutes after his statement. The president said he is willing to negotiate, but only “after the threat of government shutdown and default have been removed.” In other words, nothing’s changed.

Obama could move the discussion forward when he speaks to reporters Tuesday afternoon.

And Senate Democratic and Republican leaders will also talk to reporters - separately - after their weekly lunches.

Debt ceiling debate: Preaching to the choir

Setting up the next fiscal fight, Senate Democrats could up the ante by filing a bill today that would lift the country's debt limit and force Republicans to go on record as having voted against it. The Treasury runs out of ways to pay its debts sometime after next Thursday, which administration officials say would be catastrophic to the country's economy. But some on the right aren't so sure that would be a bad thing.

The bill would increase the debt ceiling until after the 2014 elections and does not include any of the demands issued by Republicans, such as reductions in government spending and changes to the health care law.

The Senate has not agreed to take up a bill, however, that would provide back pay to furloughed government workers. The House passed it Saturday. The second-ranking Senate Republican, Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, said, ""I think it's really premature to be dealing with that until we resolve the underlying problem.""

What history says

The White House vows it will not negotiate any policy concessions attached to an increase in the nation's debt ceiling, hoping to avoid a sideshow every time the limit needs to be raised. But there is precedent for Congress to link other issues to such a hike.

• In 1989, the House and Senate agreed to repeal a tax rule approved three years earlier barring discrimination in employer-paid health insurance plans.

• And in 2011, an increase in the debt ceiling was allowed after promised budget cuts outlined in the Budget Control Act.

• Even more, in the 1970s and 1980s, votes on the debt limit included requirements for a balanced budget vote, a cigarette tax and the push for an alternative minimum tax.

Your count seems a bit off

Boehner said he doesn't have the votes to pass a ""clean"" continuing resolution - a bill with no strings attached that would fund the government for the next month or two.

But CNN surveyed the House and found that 218 lawmakers would support a ""clean"" government funding bill. CNN has identified 200 Democrats and 18 Republicans who would support such a measure. That is one more than the 217 is the number of votes needed to pass a bill in the House.

Shutdown showdown: Where it's headed

Additionally, if Boehner brought a ""clean CR"" to the floor, there's a good chance a lot more Republicans would probably join in, one Republican said. But the 17 who said publicly they'd vote for a clean CR declined an opportunity in a procedural vote Monday night to break with their party on the funding issue.

There's your problem right there

John King, CNN chief national correspondent, says the problem with the current stalemate is a lack of trust.

""(W)hat you don't have is that basic trust and the people who matter most - the people who can deliver a deal to the finish line - sitting down together. In part because the president says he won't negotiate at all on the issue of a government shutdown, and he won't negotiate for the debt ceiling increase.

""So, the trust deficit at the moment is still in the way of any progress. We're on Day 8. That debt ceiling deadline (is) now within 10 days from now. The government would run out of money within a week or two of that.

""Forgive me, but you should have Bill Murray come in and do this for the next couple days because it seems like 'Groundhog Day.' ""



There's a lot of anger

Most Americans say the partial government shutdown is causing a crisis or major problems for the country, according to a new national poll.

And while the CNN/ORC International survey also indicates that slightly more people are angry at Republicans than Democrats or President Obama for the shutdown, it is clear that both sides are taking a hit.

Huge majorities of Democrats are angry at Republicans, and huge majorities of Republicans are angry at Obama and Democrats. Independents are equally angry at all sides, with 59% of independents very or somewhat angry at Democrats, six in 10 angry at the GOP, and 58% angry at Obama.

What's more, the poll indicates that 18% of the public says the shutdown is a crisis and an additional 49% say the shutdown has caused major problems.

Would a shot of caffeine help?

The Starbucks Corp. CEO is using his megaphone to express his discontent. Howard Schultz urged fellow business leaders to ratchet up the pressure on U.S. political leaders to end the stalemate.

""This weekend I heard from several business leaders who shared their concern about our relative silence and impact in urging the political leadership to act on behalf of the citizenry,"" he wrote in a letter posted on the company's website. ""It is our responsibility to address the crisis of confidence that is needlessly being set in motion.""

Government shutdown: What's closed, what's open

And a wealthy couple donated $10 million to reopen shuttered Head Start programs around the country. Laura and John Arnold's donation will allow 7,200 children to return to the early education program for low-income children.



Health concerns

While Washington politicians appear to be playing a game of chicken over who will cave first, a dangerous salmonella outbreak, probably caused from tainted chicken, has affected at least 278 people in 18 states and raises questions about food safety during the partial shutdown.

While the agency is working to contain the problem, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Thomas Frieden, tweeted his frustration with his agency's inability to do its job during the shutdown. ""Microbes/other threats didn't shut down. We are less safe,"" he said via Twitter last week.

CDC had to furlough 8,754 people. They protected you yesterday, can't tomorrow. Microbes/other threats didn't shut down. We are less safe. — Dr. Tom Frieden (@DrFriedenCDC) October 2, 2013

Comings and goings

The CDC's 8,754 furloughed workers are a small portion of the approximately 483,000 government employees told to stay at home during the partial shutdown.

After Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said most of the furloughed civilians at the Defense Department would be called back to work, just 14% of federal workers are now listed as furloughed.

Obama calls Boehner as stalemate continues over shutdown, default

And the Federal Aviation Administration is telling more than 800 employees to return to work, including 600 inspectors and safety staff.

Other agencies are just now beginning their furloughs. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission said Monday it expects to furlough about 3,900 employees at the close of business Thursday if the impasse isn't resolved.

The National Guard is attempting to weather the storm.

In Florida, nearly 1,000 Florida National Guard employees were called back to work Monday, but it could be short-lived.

""We have no money to do operations and maintenance,"" Major Gen. Emmett Titshaw said. ""We can't buy fuel, we can't buy parts, and so we are very limited in our training.""

The Guard is facing another shutdown mid-month if money issues and the federal government shutdown aren't resolved.

And in Idaho, half of the state's National Guard - 850 civilian workers - has been furloughed. If there is an emergency, such as a wildfire, the state will step in and provide funding.

No fear, though. Newly elected Republican Rep. Mark Sanford of South Carolina brought the total down a few by recalling all the furloughed workers in his office.



Shutdown meltdown: for the economy

If the weeklong government shutdown stretches to a month, it would cost the economy $50 billion.

That estimate is actually $5 billion lower than the initial estimate of Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody's Analytics. He lowered his forecast after the Defense Department recalled nearly half of 800,000 federal employees furloughed last week, and it appeared that Congress would quickly approve a measure to pay other furloughed workers retroactively.

That's only the direct impact. There are indirect costs, too.

... for consumers

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have relaxed rules that would have kept banks from approving mortgages during the government shutdown.

Typically, Fannie and Freddie require lenders to verify a borrower's income with the Internal Revenue Service before closing on a mortgage. But last week, some lenders reported that they could not approve the mortgages because the shutdown had severely curtailed IRS operations.

The government-backed mortgage giants have since said lenders could continue to issue new loans even without the IRS's confirmation.



... and around the world

China and Japan, which hold a combined $2.4 trillion in U.S. debt, have called for a quick resolution to the crisis and expressed worries about the economic consequences of a default.

In the first official response by China, Vice Finance Minister Zhu Guangyao said that a solution must be found quickly in order to ""ensure the safety of Chinese investments"" and provide stability for economies around the globe.

A senior Japanese official, speaking to the Financial Times, said that country's Ministry of Finance is ""very worried,"" and cited the market turmoil and ""chaos"" brought on by the failed House vote to authorize bank bailout funds in 2008.

Apparently Boehner didn't want to let these guys near the White House

So here's the story: President Obama is inviting members of the House and Senate from both parties to meetings at the White House this week. His goal: To encourage Congress to end the government shutdown and avoid a debt limit default.

The president is starting his meetings today, meeting with the full House Democratic caucus. But when he invited House Republicans they couldn't bring themselves to accept his offer without twisting themselves into a knot:



Boehner's office said Wednesday that the GOP leader would send a small group to Obama's meeting Thursday, but not the full invited caucus. Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck said the meeting was only worthwhile if it was focused on finding a solution. So Buck said only the elected leadership and select committee chairmen will attend - 18 lawmakers out of the 232 invited

If you're like most people, you're probably shaking your head at the fact that Boehner rejected a full conference meeting just one day after claiming that the GOP had only shut the government down because Obama won't even talk to them.

But you should really try tearing a page from the ""Both sides do it"" playbook and hail Boehner for agreeing to give Obama a substantial portion of what Obama requested: 18 of the 232 invited member of Congress. That's almost 8 percent of what Obama had asked—7.7 percent, to be precise. In non-numerical terms, that's an unprecedented concession. Surely, the president should reciprocate by accepting House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan's plan to end Medicare as we know it, right?



@markknoller WH says Pres Obama is ""disappointed"" that only a small group of House Republicans will attend shutdown/default meeting tomorrow at WH.

Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and other Republican Party leaders have staked their party's future on a false premise. They say the wealthy are already providing for everyone else, and middle class families need to sacrifice for a change while millionaires reap the benefits.

This year's Ryan budget is a product of this assumption. It treats the government to which Rep. Ryan has been elected as something between a nuisance and a menace, with no role in helping the economy except to transfer more wealth upward.

Plenty of people have pointed out that these ideas lost in November. What they often forget is that a more positive vision also won that election: a vision of an America that helps us all achieve more than we could individually, a government that acts when the moment calls for it.

The Congressional Progressive Caucus, which we're proud to co-chair, introduced its Back to Work Budget on March 13 because we know that putting Americans back to work, not cutting investments, is the answer to our nation's problems. We put 7 million people back to work in the first year and reduce the deficit $4.4 trillion over the next decade.

Good jobs and fair pay, not favors for a lucky few, are what make this country run. The magic elixir Rep. Ryan and his colleagues are selling - blank checks to the Pentagon, tax cuts for the wealthy, subsidies for fossil fuels, less opportunity for the rest of us - has simply failed to help our economy. We need to rebuild this country by cutting tax loopholes we don't need and investing in the things we do: roads, bridges, schools, health care, infrastructure, and other basics of a prosperous nation. That's what our budget does.

There is no question which approach the American people support. A Gallup poll released this week found that 72 percent of Americans, including a majority of Republicans, support putting people back to work repairing our infrastructure. The same percentage supports investment to create jobs.

We're not afraid of the contrasts our budget suggests with conservative ideology. Instead of closing the Department of Education, as Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) called for at the Conservative Political Action Conference last week, we believe in building schools and putting more teachers on the job. Instead of continued tax breaks for large corporations, such as the $112 billion we will give away to wealthy fossil fuel companies in the next decade, we end preferential treatment for perks like corporate jets and put the money back into job creation for the American people.

Two years ago, Rep. Ryan's blueprint was greeted with cheers by conservative activists and considerable deference by the pundits. This year, his plan is being treated as what it is: a radical transformation of the American experience. If he got his way, Medicaid would wither, Medicare as we know it would cease to exist, and the decades of progress we've made in fighting hunger and poverty would be wiped out.

We agree with the American people who made their preference known in November: we can do better. The right-wing myth of makers and takers has had a pernicious effect on our politics and will take some time to fade away. In the meantime, we need to get our national conversation back on track. It's time for a serious effort to get America working again.

The House Republican majority didn't pass our budget in last Wednesday's vote, but after two years of ignoring the jobs crisis, we hope our plan starts a new conversation that can continue past budget season. All we've heard from Republicans is the same exhausted line about cutting everything in sight, retrenching, reining in the American dream, and foreclosing on any positive government role in our nation's future. It's time for jobs to be the priority for Washington that it already is for the American people.

The Fed%27s easy-money policies have not produced many jobs.

They have produced a persistent%2C low rate of inflation that is choking the American middle class.

They are a godsend for a Republican Party in search of a middle-class economic policy.

Opposing Janet Yellen's nomination as chair of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors is both good policy and good politics for Senate Republicans.

In her remarks Thursday before the Senate Banking Committee, Yellen made it clear that she will keep interest rates low and the Fed's balance sheet growing in an effort to boost employment. What remains less clear is whether this policy will actually work. After all, labor participation rates remain near 20-year lows despite the Fed's nearly $4 trillion balance sheet.

While the Fed's easy-money policies have not produced many jobs, they have produced a persistent, low rate of inflation that is choking the American middle class. Since the asset purchases began five years ago, the average American family has experienced rising prices and stagnant wages. The resulting decline in living standards explains why voters ranked rising prices nearly tied with unemployment as their top economic concern during the 2012 election.

As the middle class struggles, America's wealthy are benefiting from the Fed-induced rally in asset prices. Given the selection of New York City apartments now listing in the $100 million range, it is with good justification that Andrew Huszar, the former Fed official who managed its quantitative easing program, called the Fed's policies ""the greatest backdoor Wall Street bailout of all time."" Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, a Democrat on the banking committee, reinforced this point in Thursday's hearing, flatly stating that the ""trickle down"" the Fed has been expecting hasn't happened.

Worst of all for those focused on limiting the size of government, Yellen's easy-money policies are encouraging Washington's continued fiscal irresponsibility. With the Fed as a ready buyer of Treasury debt, even the Tea Party Republicans have not been able to meaningfully shrink the government's size.

While Yellen's easy-money policies are a problem for America, they are a godsend for a Republican Party in search of a middle-class economic policy. Yellen's extremism offers the Republicans the perfect opportunity to embrace sound money and send a clear signal to voters that they are listening to their concerns about rising prices and falling living standards.

If easy money delivers what it always has throughout history — growing inflation, growing inequality and growing government — a Republican embrace of sound money will offer America a way back to prosperity and the GOP a way back to a governing majority.

(CNN) —

The Justice Department and attorneys general from six states and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit Tuesday challenging the $11 billion merger of American Airlines and US Airways, saying the combination would lead to higher prices and less service for consumers.

The merger, which would create the world’s largest airline, would “substantially lessen competition” for commercial air travel, contends the complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington.

The carriers said in a joint statement that they would mount a “vigorous and strong defense” of their deal and pursue all legal options to move it forward.

“We believe that the DOJ is wrong in its assessment of our merger. Integrating the complementary networks of American and US Airways to benefit passengers is the motivation for bringing these airlines together. Blocking this procompetitive merger will deny customers access to a broader airline network that gives them more choices,” the companies said.

Opinion: Why American-US Airways deal is good

US Airways shares slid more than 9 percent on Wall Street. American is operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

A top concern is local markets, the Justice Department said. It cited the example of Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, where the combined airline would control 69% of takeoff and landing slots, and 63% of the outbound nonstop routes.

The Justice Department also said in its complaint that if the two airlines were allowed to merge, there would be higher fees for baggage and flight changes.

The states that joined the antitrust lawsuit are: Texas, where American’s parent company AMR Corp. is based; Arizona, home base for US Airways; Florida; Pennsylvania; Tennessee; and Virginia.

The lawsuit comes as somewhat of a surprise. In recent years the Justice Department has allowed other big airline mergers – Delta gobbled up Northwest, and United absorbed Continental – in part because the airline industry was losing so much money and the mergers were seen as necessary for survival.

But airlines are now making billions of dollars, not only from higher fares but also from $6 billion in fees they collected in 2012 alone, for baggage and seat selection and other things that used to be included in fares.

Minority businesses would fight any US Air merger

American and US Airways had touted their combination as one that “joins two highly complementary networks with access to the best destinations around the globe – offering you increased choices, improved efficiency and better options” under American’s Oneworld alliance.

The Justice Department lawsuit cites internal documents from the airlines to show that the merger isn’t needed and in fact would lead to cuts in programs that benefit travelers.

An example is US Airways’ Advantage Fares discount program, which executives said would likely be eliminated after the merger, according to the Justice Department. Without the merger, antitrust officials said, other airlines would be forced to continue to match US Airways’ discounts to compete.

American has been in bankruptcy protection since 2011 and has been working to get approval from antitrust authorities and shareholders for the merger so it can emerge from court protection. The companies had hoped to complete the deal by the end of September.

The European Union this month cleared the merger with the condition that the airline give up slots to allow new competition in the Philadelphia-to-London route.

The budget office continues to say the federal government faces a long-range budget problem — mostly caused by the costs of an aging population — but its new forecast pushes the crunch point for that problem off into a considerably more distant future: well after the 2020 presidential election.

The deficit projection for this year — $642 billion — is almost 25% less than the deficit the budget office had forecast as recently as February. At the new level, the annual deficit would be back to where it was before President Obama took office. It would continue to fall for the rest of Obama’s tenure, the budget office now projects. By contrast, the deficit for fiscal year 2012 came in at just over $1 trillion.

Three major factors account for most of the long-term improvement: a better economy, a continued slowdown in the rate of medical inflation — which reduces the cost of Medicare and Medicaid — and higher taxes that Congress approved as part of the “fiscal cliff” deal in January, the budget office said.

In addition, the automatic budget cuts that took effect this spring have reduced spending in the short term. The government also will benefit this year from dividend payments it is getting from the two giant housing finance agencies bailed out during the financial crisis.

The federal government’s annual deficit this year amounts to about 7% of the gross domestic product. By 2015, the budget office forecasts, the deficit will fall to just over 2% of GDP, a level that most economists would consider relatively insignificant. At that point, the deficit would begin to climb slowly again, reaching about 3.5% of GDP by the end of the decade.

The report also forecasts that the federal debt will shrink relative to the size of the economy for the rest of Obama’s term. The budget office expects the debt to begin to rise slowly after 2018 as the effects of an aging population increase the cost of retirement programs.

The federal deficit is the gap between what the government spends each year and its revenue, mostly taxes. The government has run a deficit almost every year for the last half-century. The federal debt represents the accumulated money that the government borrows to cover that deficit.

The numbers have an important political impact. Republicans have pushed for big reductions in government programs this year, arguing that the country could face a debt crisis if spending is not curtailed. The Obama administration and congressional Democrats have argued that big new reductions have less urgency because the budget picture is already getting better. The new figures from the budget office, which both parties rely on as a nonpartisan arbiter, will probably give more impetus to the Democrats’ position.

The report also signaled that the next confrontation in Washington’s budget wars may not come until late fall. Republican leaders have planned to push for budget cuts when Congress next votes on raising the federal debt ceiling. Because the debt is now growing more slowly than expected, the deadline for that vote probably won’t come until October or November, the report says.

Underscoring the political dynamic, Republicans, who trumpeted news of higher deficits during Obama’s first term, fell largely silent in reaction to the new figures.

The office of House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) declined to comment. The House Budget Committee, chaired by Rep. Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), issued a short statement calling the report a “fresh reminder of Washington’s out-of-control spending” and noting that by decade’s end the federal government will collect $5 trillion in tax revenue.

Liberal Democrats, by contrast, said the new numbers showed that government spending was falling too fast and that the sharply lower deficits amounted to an austerity policy that is hurting economic growth.

“It would be nice if policymakers … recognized that we need less austerity now and more health savings [and revenue] later,” Jared Bernstein, a former administration economic advisor, noted on his blog. The deficit, he wrote, “is coming down too fast given the still weak economy.”

Other Washington deficit hawks reacted cautiously. Maya MacGuineas, head of the Campaign to Fix the Debt, issued a statement calling the updated numbers “a good sign” but added that the country still faced a “long-term fiscal imbalance.”

“We need to keep making steady improvements to keep the good news coming,” she said.

The revised outlook comes as congressional Republicans are trying to figure out a budget strategy that can unite their disparate factions.

In January, GOP leaders got a deal through the House to avert the so-called fiscal cliff, but only by relying on Democratic votes. Aides to the leadership admit that no consensus exists among their members about how to raise the debt ceiling and avoid a default by the government when the deadline hits.

Advertisement

The president maintains that the debt ceiling should be raised without any conditions attached. Republicans are expected to continue to insist upon some concessions — either new budget cuts or, perhaps, a commitment to reforming the federal tax code.

“We’re going to have a big conversation with our members … to talk about a way forward,” Boehner said last week. “Dealing with the long-term structural spending problem we have, frankly, is at the core of it. But we also know we can’t cut our way to prosperity. We need real economic growth.”

House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp (R-Mich.) and House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) have been meeting with members to discuss options for a tax reform plan. Camp said last month that he expected a tax plan to pass the House but did not hazard a guess about whether agreement could be reached with the Democratic majority in the Senate.

Jon Cowan and Jim Kessler, the authors, promptly got called out by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., a champion of expanding Social Security who was one of the main targets of their piece. “It’s just flatly wrong,” she said of their description of Social Security, which they claim is in an “undebatable solvency crisis.”

Warren is demonstrably correct. Let’s take a look.

Cowan and Kessler start by asserting, “A growing cascade of baby boomers will be retiring in the coming years, and the Social Security formula increases their initial benefits faster than inflation.”

Advertisement

They’re wrong about the formula. Initial Social Security benefits are indexed to wage inflation. This is a measure that tracks the standard of living prevailing at the time people retire, which generally improves over the course of their working lives. Wage inflation generally, though not invariably, rises at about 1% a year faster than the consumer price index used to calculate annual cost of living increases for retirees--after their initial benefit.

Why is indexing the initial benefit to wage inflation important? Think of it this way: if that hadn’t been done, people retiring today might receive a benefit based on the standard of living four decades earlier. For Cowan and Kessler not to know the facts about the initial benefit, or to know it and not disclose it, pretty much disqualifies them as Social Security analysts. But that’s not all.

“Since 2010,” they write, “Social Security payouts to seniors have exceeded payroll taxes collected from workers.” This is misleading at best and a gross misrepresentation at worst.

Social Security has three traditional sources of revenue: current payroll taxes, income taxes charged on Social Security benefits, and interest earned by the Social Security trust funds. It’s important to remember that the trust funds themselves are derived from payroll taxes--excess taxes levied on workers since 1983, largely to pre-pay the baby boom generation’s benefits. So the interest is itself derived from payroll taxes lent to the government through the purchase of Treasury bonds.

From 2010 to 2013 there was a fourth source: a general fund reimbursement for the payroll tax holiday of two percentage points enacted as an economic stimulus measure. The point is that Social Security was credited for the full 6.2% payroll tax levied on employees as payroll tax--just that 2% of it was to be suspended for a few years so workers could have a bit more in their pockets.

Since 2010, payouts to seniors have been more than covered by all these payroll tax-related sources. In 2010, benefits were $695.4 billion, the payroll tax, interest, and general fund payback came to $765.2 billion; in 2011 the program paid out $719.5 billion and collected $775.7 billion, and last year the payout was $762.3 billion and income was $810.3 billion.

As for the “undebatable solvency crisis,” Cowan and Kessler should tell that to the Social Security trustees, because the trustees sure debate it. The trustees in their annual reports caution every year against drawing firm conclusions about the program’s future solvency from the financial projections they publish looking decades in the future.

In fact, they publish three main projections--a best-case, worst-case, and middle-of-the-road scenario. all these are based on more than a dozen demographic and economic assumptions, none of which can be projected for certain, and all of which interact with each other in indeterminate ways. The trustees warn that “significant uncertainties surround the intermediate assumptions,” which are largely the basis for the Cowan/Kessler claims. Does that sound like the trustees think they’re “undebatable”?

Cowan and Kessler are also misleading about Warren’s proposal, which involves raising the cap on wages subject to payroll taxes. (The cap is $117,000 for 2014.) They say “her approach requires a $750 billion tax hike over the next 10 years that hits mostly Millennials and Gen Xers, plus another $750 billion tax on the businesses that employ them.”

That makes it sound as though she’s proposing to tax young people just starting out on their careers, doesn’t it? She’s not--she’s proposing to increase payroll taxes on all people earning $117,000, or whatever the cap is each year (it rises with inflation). Since taxes levied in the future naturally will be paid by today’s millennials and GenXers, Cowan and Kessler are sort of right. But unbelievably deceptive.

The real goal of the Cowan/Kessler piece was to discourage Democrats from following Warren and Bill de Blasio, the new progressive mayor-elect of New York. Their op-ed was headlined “Economic Populism is a Dead End for Democrats,” and blamed Warren and de Blasio for encouraging a “left-wing...fantasy.” What the authors don’t seem to acknowledge is that both Warren and de Blasio won elections. They already have followers, and among the reasons for their victories is they’re willing to stand up for economic policies that don’t leave the average person in the dust.

That may not be to Cowan’s or Kessler’s taste, or to that of the current and former executives of Warburg Pincus, Goldman Sachs, and the other corporations and investment firms on Third Way’s board. But for all their chattering about Social Security’s insolvency, it’s their arguments that were bankrupt."

The report noted that the shutdown did not affect total jobs.

Employers also added 60,000 more jobs in the previous two months than earlier estimated.

The figures show hiring has picked up in the fall. Employers added an average of 202,000 jobs from August through October, up from 146,000 from May through July.

Stock futures fell after the report was released at 8:30 a.m. EDT, and the yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose. That suggests investors are worried that the better job numbers will prompt the Federal Reserve to pull back on its stimulus efforts sooner than expected.

One troubling detail in the report: the percentage of Americans working or looking for work fell to a fresh 35-year low. But that figure was likely distorted by the shutdown, too.

About 800,000 government workers were furloughed for all or part of the shutdown, which lasted from Oct. 1 through Oct. 16. Many were counted as unemployed and on temporary layoff for purposes of the unemployment rate.

But the furloughed workers were still counted as employed by the government's survey that counts jobs because they were ultimately paid for their time off. Federal government jobs fell only 12,000 last month.

Some reports have hinted that hiring was improving. Retail stores, shipping companies, and other services firms stepped up hiring in October, according to private survey of service firms.

And the number of people seeking unemployment benefits has fallen back to pre-recession levels after four weeks of declines. Unemployment benefit applications are a proxy for layoffs. The steady decline suggests companies are cutting fewer jobs.

Economic growth accelerated in the July-September quarter to an annual rate of 2.8 percent, the government said Thursday. That's up from 2.5 percent in the April-June quarter.

But greater restocking by businesses drove much of the increase, a trend that may not be sustainable. Consumers and businesses both cut back on spending over the summer.

* Concern as deadline approaches on debt limit

* ""This whole thing is crazy"" -Democratic representative

* Republicans ready to negotiate, senior House member says

By Phil Stewart and Thomas Ferraro

WASHINGTON, Oct 5 (Reuters) - The Pentagon said on Saturday it would recall most of the roughly 400,000 civilian Defense Department employees sent home during the government shutdown, in a move that could greatly lessen the impact of the shutdown on America's armed forces.

The exact number to be recalled remained uncertain. Civilian Pentagon employees comprise about half the 800,000 federal employees currently furloughed.

Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said a legal review of the ""Pay Our Military Act,"" signed by President Barack Obama on Monday on the eve of the shutdown, would allow him to bring a still unspecified number of civilians back to work next week.

The announcement came as Democrats and Republicans in the House of Representatives agreed to pay all furloughed employees retroactively once the government reopens. It was a rare moment of cooperation in the House as the two parties were entrenched in their positions on the shutdown. The U.S. Senate is expected to go along.

But the actions did not solve the basic problem - the failure of Democrats and Republicans to settle their political differences and agree on a bill to fund and reopen the government.

The House measure prompted Democratic Representative Louise Slaughter of New York to suggest that since the employees were going to get their salaries anyway, ""why don't we just let them come back to work?""

""This whole thing is crazy,"" she said.

Outside the Capitol where Congress was meeting on Saturday, two small children sat at the foot of the stairs holding placards reading: End the shutdown"" and ""Stop acting like children.""

As they moved into the second week of a shutdown, members appeared no closer to finding a way to end it, or to head off a possible default by the government on Oct. 17, the deadline for Congress to increase the government's authority to borrow money.

Talk of using broader budget deals to bring the standoff to an end has picked up in recent days, but without any visible result.

Democrats say bills to fund the government and raise the debt ceiling could be resolved quickly if House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner permitted votes on simple, no-strings-attached measures.

But most House Republicans want strings attached, including one aimed at crippling Obama's signature healthcare law, popularly known as Obamacare, and Boehner has so far refused to promise votes on either, in part because he could face a revolt that might cost him his job.

Democrats have already begun efforts to force a vote on the shutdown using complex and time-consuming parliamentary procedures.

House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Boehner signed by 195 of 200 House Democrats, demanding a vote on a bill to reopen the government without any rollback in Obamacare.

Pelosi said if Boehner did so, they would agree to the Republicans' government funding level for the next six weeks, more stringent than the Democratic level, which has already been approved by the Senate.

Democrats are also trying to persuade Boehner to convene a ""conference committee"" with the Senate to discuss broader budget issues, something Boehner has resisted, fearing that Democrats might use arcane House rules to bring other measures to the House floor, such as raising taxes on the wealthy.

Pelosi made what she called ""an unprecedented offer."" She said if he would permit a House-Senate conference on funding for the rest of the year, Democrats would surrender their right to use the rules to add items that might embarrass Republicans.

Boehner's press secretary, Michael Steel, brushed off Pelosi's offer, saying, ""At this point, it's Senate Democrats and the president who are blocking progress on reopening the government and providing the American people fairness under Obamacare.

DEBT CEILING

The standoff, which began at the start of the new fiscal year on Tuesday and shuttered all but essential government operations, was sparked by Republicans' determination to block or delay implementation of the healthcare law.

The law aims to provide healthcare to millions of uninsured Americans. Republicans argue it is a massive government intrusion into private medicine that will cause insurance premiums to skyrocket, put people out of work and eventually lead to socialized medicine.

Republicans are also seeking concessions in exchange for raising the nation's $16.7 trillion debt limit. If the borrowing cap is not increased, the United States could go into default, with what officials and economists say would be seriously damaging consequences for the U.S. and global economies.

Democrats vow they will make no such concessions on the funding bill or the debt ceiling.

Obama said in an interview with the Associated Press released on Saturday that he did not expect to have to take any unusual steps to prevent the United States from defaulting on its debt because he believes Congress will raise the debt ceiling.

""I don't expect to get there,"" Obama said. ""There were at least some quotes yesterday that Speaker Boehner is willing to make sure that we don't default,"" he said.

""And I'm pretty willing to bet that there are enough votes in the House of Representatives right now to make sure that the United States doesn't end up being a deadbeat,"" Obama said.

Republicans blame the White House for the fiscal deadlock, saying the president is refusing to compromise.

After the House vote on retroactive pay, Kevin McCarthy, the Republican majority whip, said his party was ready to negotiate with Obama and his fellow Democrats. ""The president is here this weekend, we are here this weekend. Now is the time, since everyone is in town, to pick up the phone and talk,"" he said.

Scott Rigell, a Republican representative from Virginia who has called for a ""clean"" vote to fund the government that does not involve Obama's healthcare law, said as far as he knew, there were no behind-the-scenes negotiations between Republicans and Democrats over the shutdown or the debt ceiling.

""No one is talking,"" Rigell told Reuters.

Facing public anger over the government shutdown, House Republicans have adopted a strategy of voting piecemeal to fund some popular federal agencies - like the Veterans Administration, the National Park Service and the National Institutes of Health - that are partially closed.

Democrats have rejected that, arguing Congress has a duty to pass a bill funding the entire government."

Sixteen presidents before Barack Obama got a second chance at giving an inaugural address for the ages. Here are some of them.

Sixteen presidents before Barack Obama got a second chance at giving an inaugural address for the ages. Here are some of them.

The President Obama who will be publicly inaugurated to a second term Monday is a very different political man than he was four years ago. He is harder and harder-edged, both more confident in what he can do and more aware of what he can’t. He remains a political pragmatist, but a far more wary one. He is older and, it would seem — politically, at least — wiser.

Put simply: Obama seems to have learned the right lessons from what was by any measure a surprisingly rocky first term in office. Below are the three main lessons that the past four years taught him and how they inform the man who will take the inauguration stage Monday.

● Stop negotiating with yourself. One of the defining characteristics of Obama’s first-term legislative agenda was his problematic approach to political negotiations. His strategy was flawed in two ways: (1) He started where he wanted to end up policy-wise, giving him little room to negotiate without giving away things he badly wanted, and (2) his attempt to kick-start stalled talks was to publicly (and privately) negotiate with himself, a move that further weakened his bargaining position.

Although Obama ultimately won big fights with Congress over the economic stimulus plan and health-care legislation, the political pain — both for him and for his party — was significant. And his willingness to extend the George W. Bush-era tax cuts for two years after the 2010 midterm elections was cast by the Democratic base as something close to a total capitulation.

Fast-forward to today. Obama’s unwillingness to back off his campaign pledge of raising taxes on the wealthy delivered him a political victory on the “fiscal cliff.” And his repeated assertion that the debt ceiling couldn’t be used as a bargaining chip for Republicans led the GOP to cave, setting up a vote to extend the nation’s credit limit through April 15.

View Graphic INTERACTIVE | The age of Obama: See how unabated stress has changed the president over the past four years.

● Partisanship > personality. When Obama won the presidency in 2008, he clearly believed that he could break the partisan deadlock in Congress solely by force of personality. His life up to that point provided him evidence for that belief — most notably the fact that he had upended former first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton for the Democratic nomination (a victory that was close to unimaginable even a year before it happened) and then cruised to a general-election victory to become the first African American president in the country’s history. Not too shabby.

But that seemingly unstoppable force of personality ran head-on into the immovable object of partisanship in the nation’s capital — and the immovable object won. No one, not even a figure who shot into the political stratosphere as quickly as Obama, was able to fundamentally alter the political process by personality alone.

In his first news conference of 2013, Obama acknowledged that reality when asked about whether he socialized enough with Republicans, and particularly with House Speaker John Boehner (Ohio). “When we went out and played golf, we had a great time, but that didn’t get a deal done in 2011,” the president said, adding later: “When I’m over here at the congressional picnic and folks are coming up and taking pictures with their family . . . we have a wonderful time, but it doesn’t prevent them from going onto the floor of the House and . . . blasting me for being a big-spending socialist.”

●You can’t control the message. Obama is the first president to govern in the age of social media and one of the first to govern at a time when political cable talk shows are all the rage. The pace at which news travels today would have been unimaginable to, say, George W. Bush when he first came into office — and that was little more than a decade ago.

What the explosion of Twitter as a news — or maybe the news — vehicle and cable television as the place where political stories are made or broken means for a president is that the idea of driving any particular message for a week (or even a day) is a thing of the past. Being president, or serving the president at a senior staff level, means having to be willing to change the plan to adjust to new realities. Given the way news can go viral in minutes, it’s impossible to distinguish a political molehill from a political mountain anymore.

And so you can’t ignore anything — even if you believe it to be beneath contempt — because it can keep churning without you doing a thing. Need proof? How about Obama’s decision to hold a media event in which he showed his birth certificate in an attempt to end chatter that he wasn’t born in the United States? Can you imagine any past president having to do such a thing for a “story” that was driven by a fringe of American politics?

Being flexible and hyper-aware is the name of the game. Messaging in the vortex of social media and cable television isn’t impossible, but it is in­cred­ibly difficult."

Are we going to wade into a struggle we don’t really want to fight? Are we going to mire ourselves in a senseless, grinding conflict whose possible outcomes range from bad to worse?

I’m talking about the upcoming budget battles in Washington, of course. (What, you thought I meant something else?)

Incredibly, Congress seems determined to spend much of the fall demonstrating its boundless talent for dysfunction. House Republicans say they will threaten once again to send the nation into default — and the economy over a cliff — by refusing to raise the federal debt ceiling, now set at $16.7 trillion. This means that by mid-October, the government would exhaust its borrowing authority and be left without enough money to pay its bills.

“The president doesn’t think this is fair, thinks I’m being difficult to deal with,” House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) said last week at an Idaho fundraiser. “But I’ll say this: It may be unfair, but what I’m trying to do here is to leverage the political process to produce more change than what it would produce if left to its own devices. We’re going to have a whale of a fight.”

In other words, Boehner is looking forward to the opportunity to threaten the nation with grievous harm. Nice little economic recovery you’re working on. Wouldn’t want anything to happen to it.

President Obama, who has seen this movie before, says there will be no fight because he categorically refuses to negotiate over the debt ceiling. He demands that Congress do its job — which amounts to a routine bit of bookkeeping — without all the needless drama.

Investors around the world still consider U.S. Treasury bills, notes and bonds to be the ultimate safe haven, especially in times of economic uncertainty. It is unthinkable that our elected officials, supposedly working in the nation’s best interests, would threaten this exalted and immensely beneficial status by intentionally triggering a default.

So who’s going to blink?

Obama certainly has the stronger political position. His approval numbers may be stuck in the 40s, but ratings for Congress are down in the teens — and sinking.

Boehner has almost no room to maneuver. House Republicans are still fuming at having been forced to swallow a modest tax increase for the wealthy as part of the “fiscal cliff” deal earlier this year. The responsible thing would be for Boehner to bring a simple bill raising the debt ceiling to the floor, where it would pass with the votes of Democrats and non-crazy Republicans. But that would probably cost Boehner his job.

You’re depressed already? I’m just getting started.

Before we even get to the debt-ceiling fight, the government will run out of authority to spend money on Sept. 30 — which means no ability to function — unless Congress approves a continuing resolution. Doing so should be another no-brainer, but some Republicans are itching for a government shutdown. Because, you know, that worked so well for Newt Gingrich in the ’90s.

Boehner wants none of that. But in an attempt to get House Republicans to avert a shutdown by passing a short-term funding bill, he promises them a “whale of a fight” later over the debt ceiling. (He treats his caucus as if it were a cage full of rabid wolverines.)

Oh, and there’s another whole dimension to the pointless political snarling and bickering we will have to endure over the next few months: Obamacare.

Some Republicans believe, or say they believe, that they can use the continuing-resolution fight or the debt-ceiling fight, or maybe both, to force Obama to sign legislation nullifying all or part of his health-care reforms. One idea is to take away Obamacare’s funding. Another is to delay the individual health insurance mandate, due to take effect next year.

Do they really believe the president is willing to forsake his most important legislative accomplishment? Before it even comes fully into effect?

This is a tragic waste of time and effort, and the House Republicans are to blame. Remember when Democrats captured the House in 2006? They worked with George W. Bush even though they disagreed with his policies. Most Democrats adamantly opposed the Iraq War, but then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi made sure that Bush got the funding he required for the troops.

Boehner and his crew need to act like grown ups. If they don’t, voters need to send them home.

The federal government will face the sequester—massive automatic budget cuts—should Congress not vote on a package of alternate cuts by March 1. The original deadline was Jan. 1—but Biden had negotiated a deal with McConnell at the last minute that put it off for two months. (Both deadlines were a consequence of not reaching an agreement on a bipartisan deficit reduction deal in 2011.)

Republicans and Democrats have both proposed plans to replace the $2.1 trillion in across-the-board cuts with more reasonable measures, but McConnell said he doesn't foresee enough time to reach a compromise before the deadline.

""Read my lips: I'm not interested in an 11th-hour negotiation,"" McConnell told reporters Tuesday. ""It's pretty clear to me that the sequester is going to go into effect. I see no evidence that the House plans to act on this matter before the end of the month.""

President Barack Obama has called for a plan to avoid the automatic cuts with a bill that includes more tax increases, but Republicans immediately rejected it. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on Tuesday said that Senate Democrats were drafting a bill that achieves $2.1 trillion in savings through an equal amount of spending cuts and tax increases, but McConnell said he does not expect it to pass.

""The majority is going to offer a proposal. I anticipate that we will have an alternative proposal. That, however, doesn't lead to a solution, it just leads to a couple of votes,"" McConnell said.

Although the possibilities that McConnell and Biden will reach a deal together appear dim—McConnell said he had no plans to meet with the vice president—Reid indicated on Tuesday that he had a personal meeting scheduled with House Speaker John Boehner about the issue later this week.

The last time the two men were in the same room, however, Boehner began the meeting by urging Reid to attempt an anatomically impossible act, an encounter Reid said Tuesday he has not since forgotten."

On July 18, Detroit became the biggest U.S. city to file for bankruptcy, with an estimated $19 billion in debt. Here’s a look at some staggering facts about Motor City’s population, unemployment rate and more. The data come from a June report called “Proposals for Creditors.”

On July 18, Detroit became the biggest U.S. city to file for bankruptcy, with an estimated $19 billion in debt. Here’s a look at some staggering facts about Motor City’s population, unemployment rate and more. The data come from a June report called “Proposals for Creditors.”

The battle over the future of Detroit is set to begin this week in federal court, where government leaders will square off against retirees in a colossal debate over what the city owes to a prior generation of residents as it tries to rebuild for the next.

Soon after Detroit emergency manager Kevyn D. Orr and Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder (R) approved a bankruptcy filing Thursday, groups representing the 20,000 retirees reliant on city pensions successfully petitioned a county court to effectively freeze the bankruptcy process.

Now, city and state officials, who say the court ruling will not affect their plans, are asking a federal judge to hold hearings early this week to validate the bankruptcy and move forward with a strategy for Detroit to discharge much of its estimated $19 billion debt.

Orr has promised that retired city workers, police officers and firefighters will not see pensions or health benefits reduced for at least six months. But on Sunday, he said those retirement benefits will have to be cut down the road.

“There are going to be some adjustments,” Orr said on “Fox News Sunday.” “. . . We don’t have a choice.”

“This is a question of necessity,” he added.

But the prospect of cuts has sent a deep wave of fear over Detroit’s retirees, who like many in the city are skeptical of Orr, a corporate lawyer who previously worked in the District, and Snyder, a Republican unpopular in this deeply Democratic city.

“It’s been a nightmare for all of us,” said Shirley Lightsey, president of the Detroit Retired City Employees Association. “We don’t have that many people with pensions big enough for anything to be taken away from them.”

Of Detroit’s overall debt, about half — $9.2 billion — represents pension and health benefits that the city has promised retirees but that it now says it does not have enough money to fully pay. The lion’s share of the remaining debt is owed to bondholders.

Orr has discussed a range of steps the city could take to pay off its debts, and some have speculated that they could include selling Detroit’s international airport and valuable collections from the Detroit Institute of Arts. For current workers, he has proposed stopping pension contributions and shifting employees to individual retirement savings accounts.

But no part of the bankruptcy process is stirring as many passions as the potential need to slice pensions and benefits for retirees. Small cities that have filed for bankruptcy protection in recent years have significantly cut retirees’ benefits.

Harry Harper, who lives in northeast Detroit and retired in 2003 from the city’s Water and Sewerage Department after 30 years of service, said talk of benefit cuts is making him very anxious.

View Graphic The decline of Detroit.

“I feel very vulnerable. I don’t feel we have any protection,” said Harper, 61, who receives $2,100 a month in pension payments. “I thought that at 30 years, you earned a pension that was accrued and you did not have to have a concern about that.”

Retirees such as Harper say that living in Detroit on a fixed pension is tough since public transit has been cut back and fuel prices have been going up. Michigan’s gasoline prices are among the highest in the country.

“I’m currently living check to check,” Harper said. “Every time I get in my car, the first stop I’m making is at a gas station because of my cash flow.”

Jeanette Fitz, who retired after 35 years working in accounting for the city government, said she fears that a cut to her pension or medical coverage will be devastating.

Fitz said that she pays more than $100 a month for a half-dozen medications and that much of what remains from her pension payments goes toward her housing and other necessities.

“If they cut it, I’m not going to be able to pay my rent,” she said. “I’m not going to have money. I’m going to be homeless. I’m going to be living out of my car, I guess.”

On Sunday, Orr and Snyder said that they empathize with the fears of retirees but added that the city had ignored its problems for too long and that now there is no choice but to limit pension payments.

“You get honest about it to start with,” Snyder said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “. . . In many cases for the last 60 years, people have ignored the realities of the situation. We’re being real now.”

Detroit Mayor Dave Bing said on ABC’s “This Week With George Stephanopoulos” that one option not on the table is a federal bailout. “I think it’s very difficult right now to ask directly for support,” he said.

Technically, the dispute between the retirees and government leaders is about math — how to calculate how much of the pension system is not properly funded. But that is an unsettled area of accounting, and both sides are able to marshal expertise in their favor.

More fundamentally, though, the question facing Detroit is how much of its remaining financial resources it will use to repay bondholders who will be needed to lend money to the city in the future, to invest in the city’s basic services and to hold fast to promises made to retirees.

“Ultimately, it’s going to come down to a finite ability to pay,” said Brian O’Keefe, a lawyer who represents retired city workers, police officers and firefighters. “We just simply believe that we must honor our obligation to pensioners who spent their entire lives working for the city.”

Detroit’s financial and demographic decline will make that difficult, some experts note. The dramatic population slide the city has experienced over the past decade has hit municipal government hard.

In 2004, for instance, there was an even ratio of city workers to pensioners, but now there are six retirees for every four workers, according to a recent report by Orr.

Orr also has cast significant doubt on the calculations the pension systems have used to determine whether they have enough funding to meet obligations, noting that individuals involved in the pension system have recently faced criminal charges."
http://news.yahoo.com/food-stamps-again-vivid-symbol-poverty-debate-190719247.html,,[],Food stamps again a vivid symbol in poverty debate,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Food stamps have figured in Americans' ideas about the poor for decades, from President Lyndon Johnson's vision of a Great Society to President Ronald Reagan's scorn for crooked ""welfare queens"" and President Bill Clinton's pledge to ""end welfare as we know it.""

Partisans tend to see what they want to see in the food stamp program: barely enough bread and milk to sustain hungry children, or chips and soda — maybe even steak and illicit beer — for cheaters and layabouts gaming the system.

Those differences were on display Thursday when the House voted to cut almost $4 billion a year, or 5 percent, from the roughly $80 billion-a-year program.

The House bill would tighten eligibility standards, allow states to impose new work requirements and permit drug testing for recipients, among other cuts to spending. A Senate bill would cut around one-tenth of the amount of the House bill, or $400 million a year.

Republicans argued that work requirements target the aid to the neediest people. Democrats said the swelling rolls — more than 47 million people are now using the food stamps, or 1 in 7 Americans — show that the program is working at a time of high unemployment and great need.

A look at the history and future of food stamps:

___

NO MORE STAMPS

These days, people in the nation's largest food aid program pay with plastic.

These special debit cards are swiped at convenience store or supermarket checkouts to pay for groceries. The cards can't be used for alcohol or cigarettes or nonfood items such as toothpaste, paper towels or dog chow. Junk food or high-priced treats are OK.

The first food stamps were a temporary plan to help feed the hungry toward the end of the Great Depression of the 1930s. The government subsidized the cost of blue stamps that poor people used to buy food from farm surpluses.

The idea was revived in the 1960s and expanded under Johnson into a permanent program that sold food coupons to low-income people at a discount. Beginning in the 1970s, food stamps were given to the poor for free. Benefit cards began replacing paper in the 1980s, a move designed to reduce fraud and ease the embarrassment food stamp users felt at the cash register.

Story continues

Food stamps aren't the government's only way to feed those in need. There are more than a dozen smaller programs, including the one for Women, Infants and Children, and free and reduced-price school lunches.

In 2008, food stamps were officially renamed the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. Most people still know the name that's been familiar since 1939.

___

ONE IN EVERY 7 AMERICANS

In a nation of 314 million people, more than 47 million are eating with food stamps each month.

Who are they? Children and teenagers make up almost half, according to the Agriculture Department. About 10 percent are seniors.

The vast majority don't receive any cash welfare. Many households that shop with SNAP cards have someone who's employed but qualify for help because of low earnings.

The average food stamp allotment is $133 a person per month. The monthly amount a family gets depends on the household's size, earnings and expenses, as well as changing food prices and other factors.

Households can qualify for help with earnings up to 30 percent higher than the federal poverty level, making the limit about $30,000 for a family of four this year. These households are limited to no more than $2,000 in savings, or $3,250 if there are elderly or disabled residents.

In addition, most states allow people to qualify automatically for food stamps if they are eligible for certain other welfare programs, even if they don't meet the strict SNAP standards. Although food stamps are paid for with federal tax dollars, states administer the program and have some choices in setting requirements.

Language in Clinton's 1996 welfare overhaul required able-bodied adults who aren't raising children to work or attend job training or similar programs to qualify for food stamps after three months. But those work requirements across most of the nation have been waived for several years because of the high unemployment rate.

People who are living in the United States illegally aren't eligible for food stamps. Most adults who immigrate legally aren't eligible during their first five years in the country.

___

RISING LIKE YEAST

The cost to taxpayers more than doubled over just four years, from $38 billion in 2008 to $78 billion last year.

Liberals see a program responding to rising need at a time of economic turmoil. Conservatives see out-of-control spending, and many Republicans blame President Barack Obama. While seeking the GOP presidential nomination in 2012, Newt Gingrich labeled Obama the ""food stamp president.""

Some of the growth can be attributed to Obama's food stamp policies, but Congress' budget analysts blame most of it on the economy.

The big factors:

—The SNAP program is an entitlement, meaning everyone who is eligible can get aid, no matter the cost to taxpayers.

—Millions of jobs were lost in the recession that hit in 2007. Unemployment is still high, and many people who have jobs are working fewer hours or for lower pay than before, meaning more people are eligible.

—Obama's 2009 economic stimulus temporarily increased benefit amounts; that boost is set to expire on Nov. 1. Time limits for jobless adults without dependents are still being waived in most of the country.

—Food stamp eligibility requirements were loosened by Congress in 2002 and 2008, before Obama became president.

—Fluctuating food prices have driven up monthly benefit amounts, which are based on a low-cost diet.

___

FEWER TO FEED?

The number of people using food stamps appears to be leveling off this year, and long-term budget projections suggest the number will begin to fall as the economy improves.

Why is it taking so long? Although the jobless rate has dropped from its 2009 peak, it remains high, leaving a historically large number of people eligible for food stamps. Since the recession began, a bigger portion of people who are eligible have signed up for food stamps than in the past.

Many people who enrolled during the worst days of the recession still qualify for SNAP cards, even if they are doing a little better now. For example, they may have gone from being laid off to working a low-paying or part-time job.

The Congressional Budget Office predicts in about a decade the number of people using food stamps will drop to 34 million, or about 1 in every 10 people.

___

FOOD AND FRAUD

Abuse was a worry from the start. The 1939 food stamp program was launched in May and by that October a retailer had been caught violating the rules.

There's been progress along the way, especially after the nationwide adoption of SNAP cards, which are harder to sell for cash than paper coupons were. The government says such ""trafficking"" in food stamps has fallen significantly over the past two decades, from about 4 cents on the dollar in 1993 to a penny per dollar in 2008.

But many lawmakers say fraud is still costing taxpayers too much. Some people lie about their income, apply for benefits in multiple states or fail to quit the program when their earnings go up. Recipients must tell their state agency within 10 days if their income goes over the limit.

Some stores illegally accept food stamps to pay for other merchandise, even beer or electronics, or give out cash at a cut rate in exchange for phony food purchases, which are then reimbursed by the government.

___

FOOD AND FARMS

In Congress, it's a marriage of convenience.

Food stamp policy has been packaged in the same bill with farm subsidies and other agricultural programs since the 1970s. It was a canny way of assuring that urban lawmakers who wanted the poverty program would vote for farm spending. That worked until this year, when conservatives balked at the skyrocketing cost of food stamps.

In June, a farm bill that included food stamps was defeated in the Republican-led House because fiscal conservatives felt it didn't cut the program deeply enough.

In response, GOP leaders split the food and farm programs in two. The House passed the farm version in July and the food stamp version on Thursday. Both passed with narrow votes.

The House and Senate versions must be reconciled before the five-year farm bill can become law, and that won't be an easy task.

Food stamps remain in the farm bill passed by the Senate. That bill made only a half-percent cut to food stamps and the Democratic-led Senate will be reluctant to cut more deeply or to evict the poverty program from its home in the farm bill. Obama supported the cuts in the Senate bill, but has opposed any changes beyond that. The White House threatened to veto the House food stamp bill.

___

WHAT NOW?

The current farm and food law expires at the end of the month.

If the two sides can't agree by then, a likely scenario, Congress could vote to extend the law as it is, at the expense of many planned updates to agricultural policy. There won't be much urgency to do that until the end of the year, when some dairy supports expire and milk prices could rise.

Other farm supports won't expire until next year, but farmers have been frustrated with the drawn-out debate that has now lasted two years, saying they need more government certainty as they manage their farm operations.

SNAP benefits would still be available for now. While farm bills set food stamp policy, the money is paid out through annual appropriations bills that so far have left benefits intact.

Boehner announced Thursday that House Republicans would agree to a six-week extension of the federal government’s ability to borrow to pay its bills, setting up late-night negotiations between the White House and Congress.

In announcing his plan, Boehner said Republicans no longer would insist on any policy changes in return for allowing the government to continue borrowing. But he did not agree to reopen government programs that shut down last week.

At a late-afternoon meeting at the White House, where Boehner and other House GOP leaders presented their proposal, the president told them that he wants the debt ceiling lifted and the government reopened, according to administration officials speaking on condition of anonymity. That put Obama in line with Senate Democrats, who have insisted that both issues be resolved together.

“The president didn’t say yes, didn’t say no,” said House Budget Committee Chairman Rep. Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.). “We’re continuing to negotiate.”

Another senior Republican, Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers (R-Ky.), said: “I think it’s clear that he would like to have the shutdown stopped.”

The issue for negotiators is to find something that Boehner could use to help sell Republicans on ending the shutdown but that Obama could also accept, Rogers suggested.

“We’re trying to find out what it is he would insist upon in a CR and what we would insist upon,” Rogers said, using the legislative jargon for a continuing resolution to fund government agencies. The president’s healthcare law, which Republicans spent weeks trying to block or delay as a condition of approving any money bills this fall, was “not discussed,” Rogers said.

Earlier in the afternoon, Senate Democrats emerged from a meeting with Obama insisting that the shutdown end.

“We want the government opened,” Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said.

Some of the Senate’s more centrist Republicans also expressed support for legislation that would end to the shutdown and extend the debt limit.

“We need to do both,” said Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.). “The country’s disgusted by this shutdown, and so am I. We need to reopen the government.”

“Both of them have to be resolved,” said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). “It’s not rocket science.”

Although he didn’t mention the holiday, his remarks suggested that we give thanks to him, for what he called “some good things happening in our economy”—all of which turn out to be as deceptive as his claims about ObamaCare.

The president said, “Our businesses have created 7.8 million new jobs in the past 44 months.” However, as economic commentator Kenn Jacobine points out, that averages to 177,000 jobs per month over 44 months, whereas during the same time period, the working age population has grown by an average of 213,000 workers per month. Thus, under Mr. Obama, his jobs “recovery” is actually a jobs recession.

[pullquote]

Furthermore, as McClatchy Tribune Services reports, “according to Labor Department statistics, the number of people working part time in the U.S. grew four-and-a-half times as fast as the number of full-time workers. And the share of all workers who mainly hold part-time jobs is at levels not seen since the early 1980s.” This underemployment exposes as fantasy the president’s boast that “we have fought our way back…to rebuild on a new foundation for stronger, more durable economic growth.”

Actually, economic growth (in gross domestic product) under President Obama has averaged 2.3% over the past four years. Yet to produce anywhere near the job growth the president aspires to, GDP growth would have to roughly double—and to achieve that would require a miracle: that the president would change Obamanomics to the tax-cutting and free market policies of Reaganomics. As economist Peter Morici writes, “Four years into the Reagan recovery, after a deeper recession than the one Obama inherited, GDP was advancing at a 4.9 percent annual pace, and jobs creation was quite robust.”

In his radio address, the president boasted that, “We decided to reverse our addiction to foreign oil. And today, we generate more renewable energy than ever, more natural gas than anybody, and for the first time in nearly 20 years, America now produces more oil than we buy from other countries.”

That’s no thanks to President Obama. According to Investor’s Business Daily, “While production is up under Obama, this has nothing to do with his policies, but is the result of permits and private industry efforts that began long before Obama occupied the White House.” IBD adds, “Obama has chosen almost always to limit production. He canceled leases on federal lands in Utah, suspended them in Montana, delayed them in Colorado and Utah, and canceled lease sales off the Virginia coast. His administration also has been slow-walking permits in the Gulf of Mexico, approving far fewer while stretching out review times.”

In his radio address, Mr. Obama admits about ObamaCare that, “…the rollout of the marketplace where you can buy affordable plans has been rough,” but he offers as compensation that, “health care costs are growing at the slowest rate in 50 years.”

Not true, according to FactCheck.org, a project of the Annenberg Public Policy Center, which writes, “Obama greatly exaggerated when he credited the health care law for bending the cost curve on health care spending. Experts say the down economy is the overwhelming reason that national health care spending has been growing at historically slow rates in recent years.”

Ignoring his role (especially the role of ObamaCare) in creating that “down economy,” in his radio address the president patted himself on the back when he said, “…since I took office, we’ve cut our deficits by more than half.”

But in a fact check, the Associated Press writes, “An estimated $78 billion of that deficit reduction comes from automatic across-the-board spending cuts, called sequestration, that began taking effect in March—over Obama's protests.” The AP adds, “While annual deficits are declining, the national debt—the accumulation of deficits going back to the days of George Washington—is still rising. It stood at $10.6 trillion the day Obama took office. It's now $16.7 trillion, according to the Treasury Department's Bureau of the Public Debt.” That is, the AP writes, “…the largest increase to date under any president.”

In his radio address, President Obama lamented, “Imagine how much farther along we could be if both parties were working together.”

The president’s hand wringing is underhanded. That’s because he has disdainfully rejected Republican ideas and legislative proposals regarding almost every one of his major policy initiatives, including reforms in health care, financial regulation, taxes, spending, immigration, and energy use.

Here’s how President Obama concluded his radio address: “…as long as I’m President, I’ll keep doing everything I can to create jobs, grow the economy, and make sure that everyone who works hard has a chance to get ahead.”

All this is reminiscent of the way President Clinton described a string of Mr. Obama’s fabrications during the 2008 Democratic primaries. President Clinton said, “Give me a break. This whole thing is the biggest fairy tale I’ve ever seen.”"

The Republican frame for 40 years has been that Democrats are the party of tax, spend and regulation, while Republicans are the party of tax cuts, austerity and deregulation. It’s hard to let go of this message; for many years, it worked. But then we had the presidency of George W. Bush and the campaign of Mitt Romney. Bush won because he was a compassionate conservative, the supposed antidote to the callousness of Newt Gingrich. But he governed, with the exception of the prescription drug benefit, as an orthodox Republican, pursuing tax cuts for the wealthy and loose regulations. The deficit exploded and the economy collapsed. While these policies cannot be blamed exclusively for these economic outcomes, the rosy and ridiculous Republican assumption that cutting taxes on the wealthy and reducing regulation lead to prosperity was finally and brutally exposed. The trickle in trickle-down dried up, and Republican economic policies were blamed."

Sometimes, outside of election campaign seasons, even progressives wonder what’s so great about unions. Sure, we had a role to play before job safety laws, the eight-hour day, Social Security and civil rights laws were passed. But today?

Even our friends aren’t immune to the relentless attacks on unions from the right and the stereotypes that come with them: union thugs, lazy workers, relics of the past, self-absorbed, yadda, yadda, yadda.

Most of you know that as union strength has declined over the past three or so decades, so has the middle class. That's because unions are just regular working people who come together to balance power with employers and bargain for better living and working standards. And when unions are weakened by corporate and right-wing politicians, all working people feel the squeeze.

But there’s probably a lot about what unions do that’s less familiar. Like that we run one of the largest worker training programs in this country. That innovative work by union members fuels today’s green technology. And that we supply a great deal of the man- and woman-power as well as the funding for community service programs, from running food drives to disaster recovery and winning health care benefits for people who don’t belong to unions.

These aren’t things we do to win political elections—they’re things we do because they represent our values. So we’ve created a new online feature that shows examples of working people and their union values in motion “@Work.” I hope you’ll visit it at www.aflcio.org/atwork—and until you do, here are some examples:

• UAW members are leading the way in creating more fuel-efficient cars. At Johnson Controls, they are manufacturing absorbent glass mat (AGM) batteries that allow your car to shut down its big energy users while idling, but keep your lights and radio on and easily restart your car when you take your foot off the brake pedal.

• AFT partners with the First Book program to provide new books to under-served children. Teachers are making sure that students from any background have the tools they need to succeed in school.

• The Domestic Workers United grassroots organization in New York created the Park Slope Education Project to inform local domestic workers of their rights under state and federal laws and to help responsible employers understand how to comply with the laws and be good bosses.

• Helmets to Hardhats helps train and place military veterans in civilian careers—including construction jobs rebuilding the World Trade Center.

• The United Steelworkers helped carwash workers in Los Angeles get the health care they need and deserve.

• Taxi drivers in New York City, despite being exempt from most labor laws because they are considered ""independent"" contractors, organized and formed the National Taxi Workers Alliance. They’ve won increased take-home pay and expanded access to health care.

Even if you think you know unions, give us another look—you might be surprised."

In other words, the only thing standing between mainstream Republicans and a hellish future of kowtowing to Ted Cruz, never seeing the inside of the White House and possibly losing the House is President Obama’s refusal to give in to the shutdown blackmail that Cruz & Co. have cooked up. The more pragmatic Republicans, who know that this is a disaster for their party but won’t confront Cruz & Co., have settled on this bogus line: “Well, sure, maybe Cruz and the Tea Party went too far, but it’s still President Obama’s fault. He’s president. He should negotiate with them. He needs to lead.”

President Obama is leading. He is protecting the very rules that are the foundation of any healthy democracy. He is leading by not giving in to this blackmail, because if he did he would undermine the principle of majority rule that is the bedrock of our democracy. That system guarantees the minority the right to be heard and to run for office and become the majority, but it also ensures that once voters have spoken, and their representatives have voted — and, if legally challenged, the Supreme Court has also ruled in their favor — the majority decision holds sway. A minority of a minority, which has lost every democratic means to secure its agenda, has no right to now threaten to tank our economy if its demands are not met. If we do not preserve this system, nothing will ever be settled again in American politics. There would be nothing to prevent a future Democratic Congress from using the exact same blackmail to try to overturn a law enacted by their Republican rivals.

The president has said that he would give the G.O.P. an agenda for negotiations that could start when the government is funded and the debt ceiling lifted. He’s ready to consider trading the medical-device tax in Obamacare for another equivalent source of revenue or having a talk about closing tax loopholes and reforming entitlements — to both lower the deficit and raise revenue to invest in infrastructure or early childhood education. What Obama will not do, and must not do, is pay an entry fee to that negotiation — say giving up the medical-device tax — just to help Boehner down from the tree. Cruz & Co. would claim victory.

The reason so many mainstream Republican lawmakers want Obama to give something to Cruz & Co. is that they want to get out of this mess, but they’re all afraid to stand up to the far-right fringe themselves — with its bullying network of barking talk-show hosts and moneymen. But Obama shouldn’t take them off the hook. Only Republicans can delegitimize the nihilistic madness at the base of their party. (I wouldn’t exaggerate this, but I think Boehner underestimates how many mainstream Republicans feel their party is being stolen from them by radicals — and hunger for a leader who will take them on.)"

(CNN) - While a Senate deal may be in the works, a key White House meeting is on hold. Still, government workers have received a reduced paycheck that reflects the furloughs, unemployment claims have skyrocketed, government-affiliated businesses are scrambling to stay afloat, states are dipping into their rainy-day funds. Oh, and markets are extremely nervous as the debt limit deadline is just three days away. Now, it’s getting serious.

Meanwhile in Washington, Republicans and Democrats have still not reached a final agreement.



Reid urges patience, remains optimistic over deal prospects

But top Senate leaders say they are optimistic.

Here’s what you need to know:



Up to speed

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and his counterpart, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell appear closer to a deal. After a morning of negotiations, both Senate leaders expressed optimism that a deal is in the works. Reid called negotiations with McConnell “constructive,” adding that he’s “optimistic that we will reach an agreement.” McConnell said he “echo[s]” Reid’s remarks.

But until the hands shake, the clock keeps ticking.

Because momentum has increased, a meeting between President Obama and top House and Senate leaders was supposed to take place at the White House this afternoon has been postponed “to allow leaders in the Senate time to continue making important progress towards a solution.

While visiting a local charity in Washington, DC, Obama said “there's some progress on the Senate side.""

Reid, President Barack Obama and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi continue to demand that any proposal reopen the government and lift the debt ceiling with no strings attached.

Meanwhile, Maine Republican Susan Collins, continues to work with a bipartisan group of Senators on a plan. The framework of her proposal would lift the debt ceiling until 2014, fund the government until March and postpone a tax on medical devices.

Sen. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia, who is part of the Collins group, sounded an optimistic tone Monday morning saying “we’re 70%, 80% there.” He said they have a template and leadership needs to finalize the details, including how much Congress is going to allocate to fund the government.

Wondering about what happened to President Obama and House Speaker John Boehner, who appeared to be close to a deal last week? Those talks fell apart Saturday morning when the President rejected Boehner’s plan to lift the debt limit for only six weeks.

Washington could learn from baseball strike

National outlook

After a loss in U.S. stock futures Monday morning, Wall Street is feeling the optimism expressed in Washington on prospects of a deal.

The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq were all higher in afternoon trading.

U.S. Treasury markets are closed Monday because of Columbus Day.

Global outlook

Asian markets, which hold a high percentage of U.S. debt, are closed Monday. Again, Monday is a critical day for those markets as well.

European markets were mostly weaker in morning trading.

The top financial officials from around the world gathered in Washington over the weekend. And they were nervous about the U.S. inaction.

Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, said Saturday the consequences of a failure to raise the debt limit would be dire for economies around the world.

""You know, I've just spent the last two days with representatives of about 188 countries around the world. I wouldn't say they are confident. I would say they are concerned, and they are very anxious to see this crisis resolved, because they know it's going to impact on their economy,"" Lagarde told CNN’s Richard Quest at an Institute of International Finance conference in Washington.

Personal outlook

CNN’s Alison Kosik said that if the U.S. defaults on its debt, ""A default interest rates for credit cards and student loans would spike as well and payments from the government would go up”

Number of the day

3 – At day 14, this is the third longest government shutdown in American history, according to a Democratic assessment.

Anger mounts

Protestors gathered Sunday at the World War II Memorial to protest its closure caused by the shutdown. Texas Senator Ted Cruz, whose demands to defund the president’s health care law was largely responsible for the shutdown, spoke at the event as did former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin. Cruz said the closure of the memorial was a political ploy.

The rally, billed as the ""Million Vet March on the Memorials,"" drew far fewer than a million people and evolved into a protest that resembled familiar tea party events from 2009, with yellow ""Don't Tread On Me"" flags throughout the crowd and strong anti-Obama language from the podium and the audience. And one speaker said the President should “put the Quran down,” implying that Obama is Muslim.

States step up

The state of New York dug into its own coffers to reopen the Statue of Liberty. New York state will pay $61,600 a day over the next several days from its tourism budget. Cuomo determined that the financial commitment was well worth it because of the economic gain to New York the 10,000 daily tourists bring to the state and local businesses.

People visit Utah to ski and visit its national parks. Their closure was too much for the state, so the state government is stepping in and filling the federal government’s void. Utah has reopened eight national parks. It will pay the National Park Service up to $166,572 per day to do so.

Citizens step up

A local charity in Calvert County, Maryland, a suburb of Washington, DC is feeding the furloughed. Thirty percent of the county’s residents are government employees and the local group End Hunger in Calvert County is distributing food to furloughed workers at a local food bank.

Money is first round of Sandy aid approved by Congress

States say block grants offer flexibility

New York will get most of money

WASHINGTON – New York, New Jersey and other states hit by Superstorm Sandy will get $5.4 billion in the first wave of recovery money approved by Congress, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said Tuesday.

The funds come from the Community Development Block Grant program of the the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). States have said that money will be critical for rebuilding because the block grant program offers them flexibility to use the money where it's most needed.

""The work it took to pass the Sandy aid bill is starting to pay off,"" Schumer said in a statement. ""We know there is desperate need and anxious waiting in the places hit by the storm, and we will be making sure that this money gets to homeowners, small businesses and communities as quickly as possible.""

New York will get 65% of the first round of block grant money, or $3.5 billion, with about half ($1.8 billion) going to New York City and the rest ($1.7 billion) going to other parts of the state.

The remaining $1.9 billion will be split among Connecticut, Maryland, New Jersey and Rhode Island.

States and New York City must submit plans to HUD explaining what they want to do with the money. Additional details will be released in mid-February on specific projects that will be funded.

The money comes from the $50.5 billion disaster relief bill passed by Congress and signed into law last month. That bill contained $16 billion for states through the block grant program, meaning about $10.6 billion remains to be allocated.

Tuesday's announcement comes more than three months after the Oct. 29 storm wiped out entire communities in coastal New York and New Jersey. It killed more than 100 people in 10 states — 41 in New York City alone — and left tens of thousands of people homeless. Mass transit systems were paralyzed and power was cut to more than 8 million homes."

WASHINGTON -- If the federal government shuts down at midnight, it's not just federal workers who will feel the effects. Tourists visiting Washington, D.C. will also have to cope with closed doors at many major museums and monuments.

The cutest casualty may be the Smithsonian National Zoo's panda cam, which stars its five-week-old female cub; the zoo confirmed on Twitter that all of its cams ""have not been deemed essential.""

What is considered essential during a shutdown? The New York Times explains:

The Hope Diamond, all 45.5 carats of it, will remain securely guarded here at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. The Japanese giant salamanders of the National Zoo need not worry if the HVAC systems keeping their habitat just right break down — a maintenance crew will be on call.

In a blog for HuffPost DC, tour guide Canden Schwantes focuses on the bright side of a shutdown: ""Think of this as a way to see the lesser known side of D.C. and sites that are often, sadly, skipped over. Some of the best places in D.C. are the smaller, historic house museums.""

In the United States, half of the 7.5 million jobs lost during the Great Recession were paid middle-class wages, ranging from $37,000 to $68,000. But only 2 percent of the 3.4 million jobs gained since the recession are mid-pay. (AP Photo/Paul Sancya, File)

The January jobs numbers released earlier on Friday show that while the private sector added 166,000 jobs, the government shed 9,000 positions in January.

Those job losses have ripple effects throughout the economy, economist Dean Baker explained. ""If these people were still getting paychecks, they would have spent them, and that would have employed people elsewhere in the economy,"" the co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research told The Huffington Post. He estimated that government job cuts have cost the economy more than 1 million jobs total.

The unemployment rate rose to 7.9 percent in January, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday, not much lower than a year ago. In contrast, the unemployment rate averaged 4.6 percent just before the recession, according to BLS.

""The stimulus was helpful, but it wasn't nearly enough,"" said Baker, who also blogs for The Huffington Post.

The government now is focused on deficit reduction instead of helping put people back to work, he said. ""No one is talking about how we shouldn't be cutting the deficit; we really need more jobs and that means larger deficits. No one prominent in the debate is saying that.""

The government reduced the maximum duration of unemployment benefits last year. But instead of boosting hiring, this only led some jobless workers to give up looking for work, according to a statement from Baker. (Receiving unemployment benefits is contingent on searching for a job.) The average duration of unemployment has declined over the past year from 40 weeks to 35 weeks, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

The government is scheduled to soon slash spending even more. The government recently postponed but did not eliminate the sequestration, across-the-board spending cuts scheduled to kick in starting on March 1 after a congressional committee formed in response to the debt ceiling crisis failed in 2011 to agree on a deficit reduction plan.

The Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank, estimates that sequestration would eliminate 689,000 jobs in 2013 and cut GDP growth by 0.6 percentage points.

Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and former Obama administration economic adviser, who also blogs for HuffPost, said that letting the sequestration go into effect probably would send the unemployment rate up to 8.2 percent.

""While the government's fiscal policy was adding to growth back in 2009 and 2010, at this point it's subtracting from growth,"" Bernstein said, pointing to the end of the stimulus and payroll tax cut. ""If state and local employment had held up instead of falling so quickly, the unemployment rate would easily be a point lower than it is today [6.9 percent]."""

Airports would stay open%2C but pilots would have to talk to each other

More towers at more airports can still be affected

Smaller communities say closing their towers can hurt local economies

WASHINGTON -- The Federal Aviation Administration announced Friday it would close 149 air-traffic control towers that direct flights at smaller airports across the country.

The airports range from Phoenix Goodyear airport in Arizona to Ithaca Tompkins airport in Ithaca, N.Y. Also to see their towers shut: Sacramento Executive airport in California's state capital, St. Louis (Mo.) Regional and Philip Billard Municipal in Topeka, Kansas' state capital.

The towers will close April 7, as part of $85 billion in federal spending cuts across the government. The closures are part of $637 million that FAA must cut by Sept. 30.

""We will work with the airports and the operators to ensure the procedures are in place to maintain the high level of safety at non-towered airports,"" said FAA Administrator Michael Huerta.

An additional 16 federal contract towers under the ""cost share"" program will remain open because Congress sets aside funds every fiscal year for these towers.

""We heard from communities across the country about the importance of their towers and these were very tough decisions,"" Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said. ""Unfortunately, we are faced with a series of difficult choices that we have to make to reach the required cuts under sequestration.""

For a full list of affected airports, go to: http://www.aaae.org/?e=showFile&l=TDDZKA

The announcement affects towers operated under contracts with FAA that have fewer than 10,000 commercial arrivals or departures and 150,000 general-aviation operations per year.

""Contract towers have long been an integral part of the FAA's system of managing the nation's complex airspace, and the decision to shutter these critical air-traffic control facilities on such an unprecedented and wide-scale basis raises serious concerns about safety — both at the local level and throughout the aviation system,"" said Spencer Dickerson, executive director of the U.S. Contract Tower Association.

Despite a lack of controllers, airports could remain open with pilots communicating with each other for landing and taking off. But airport officials and controllers warned the closures would reduce safety and hurt local economies and military operations that depend on the smaller airports.

The FAA has also announced that most of its 47,000 workers will have unpaid furloughs one day for every two-week pay period through the end of September.

The furloughs taking effect in April could cause flight delays at the busiest airports during the busiest times of day, which transportation officials warn may also prompt airlines to cancel flights.

The FAA is also expected to close up to 43 towers with fewer flights where agency controllers work. But the agency hasn't yet announced which ones or where midnight shifts will be eliminated for controllers.

Doug Church, spokesman for the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, said the FAA would have to give the union one year's notice in order to close towers staffed by the FAA.

Closing the towers raises some safety concerns, despite the small number of annual flights.

One airport on the list, Lakeland Linder Regional Airport in Central Florida, warned that the closure would hurt a Sun 'n Fun aviation event involving 5,000 aircraft and 200,000 visitors between Tampa and Orlando.

The event is scheduled to start two days after the closure, from April 9 to 14. But in the past FAA has sent 50 air-traffic controllers and technical-operations staffers to the airport to help manage 15,000 takeoffs and landings during the event.

""The tower at LAL is not a luxury but rather is essential to the operation of this facility,"" Eugene Conrad III, the airport director, wrote in a letter to the FAA.

Many of the contract towers support military training and emergency medical flights.

Another airport on the list, Lonestar Executive Airport north of Houston, supports training for 24 Apache Longbow helicopters that rotate to Afghanistan. The military flies 10 missions and five maintenance flights each day — half of them at night, according to Lt. Col. Michael Odom, who commands the 1-158th Attack Reconnaissance Battalion.

""In summary, the closure of the … tower would result in a less safe airport and a less beneficial training environment,"" Odom wrote to the FAA.

Lonestar is also home to aviation units for Customs and Border Protection, and the Drug Enforcement Administration.

""Consequently, it is clear that the national interest is being served each and every day at this airport,"" Alan Sadler, a county judge wrote to FAA in support of the airport."

Obama has repeatedly championed a set of government investments that he argues would expand the economy and strengthen the middle class, including bolstering early-childhood education, spending more on research and development, and upgrading the nation’s roads and railways. He has said his comfortable reelection victory in November shows the country is with him.

But none of those policies have come close to being enacted. Instead, after returning this weekend from a trip to the Middle East, Obama is set to sign a government funding measure that leaves in place the across-the-board cuts known as sequestration — a policy that undermines many of the goals he laid out during the 2012 campaign.

Obama thinks the cuts are, in his words, “dumb,” and he says they will slow the economy and harm priorities by cutting spending on education, research and development, and many other programs. Yet Obama now finds himself enacting a broad domestic policy that he doesn’t support and that he believes will harm the country.

“What he got in terms of the sequester is clearly incompatible with his investment plans,” said Jared Bernstein, a former White House economic adviser.

Obama is in this predicament after failing to persuade congressional Republicans to agree to a plan of tax hikes and more targeted spending cuts to replace the sequester. The president misjudged his GOP opponents, who have held firm in opposing more tax increases and, so far, have decided to stomach the sequester cuts.

House Republicans, who passed a budget last week with even deeper domestic spending cuts than the sequester, say Obama should be able to manage the government with significantly less spending.

“We want to restrain spending. They want to spend more,” House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said last week after passing the House budget. “We think taxpayers give enough to Washington.”

One of the clearest examples of Obama’s dilemma is early-childhood education, a centerpiece of his State of the Union speech in February. Obama has proposed offering preschool to all 4-year-olds from low- and moderate-income families, which research suggests would help move children up the economic ladder.

The idea isn’t cheap. W. Steven Barnett, the director of the National Institute for Early Education Research at Rutgers, who was consulted by the White House, has estimated it could cost up to $10 billion a year.

Rather than raising new funds to pay to expand early-childhood education, however, Obama is now being forced to slash it. The sequester this year will cut about $400 million from the Head Start early-childhood education program, which will mean that tens of thousands of poor children would lose access to it, according to the administration.

“It’s not in the right direction, and it is disappointing,” Barnett said.

The administration never expected the sequester to happen, a former official says, and Obama himself said during a debate last year that it would not occur. White House officials had judged that deep defense cuts included in the sequester would move Republicans — who had warned loudly of risks to the Pentagon — to embrace an alternative, as they did in a Jan. 1 tax deal that delayed the cuts for two months.

Obama has proposed changes to Medicare, Social Security and other programs to generate savings, as well as scaling back hundreds of billions of dollars of tax breaks that benefit the wealthy and corporations. Republicans oppose any new taxes.

Obama could have forced a confrontation over the sequester, threatening to shut down the government if Congress insisted on the spending cuts. He chose a different strategy, avoiding an immediate fiscal crisis while encouraging Congress to spend several months on its own trying to find a solution.

Historians note that presidents sometimes get what they want, as Obama did with health-care reform, or they are rebuffed, as George W. Bush was in attempting to privatize Social Security. But rarely do presidents find themselves enacting major policies they fundamentally oppose.

Lawrence Mishel, president of the liberal Economic Policy Institute, said Obama shoulders part of the blame. Since 2010, he said, Obama has spent too much time focused on the debt, including agreeing to significantly shrink domestic spending as part of his own budget proposals.

“I think they brought it on themselves to the extent that they validated the deficit issue,” Mishel said. “It was always the case that the actual budget policy being pursued contradicted the rhetoric in the campaign. Now it’s even worse.”

White House officials say they will continue to press forward on proposals that would not require new federal funding, such as raising the minimum wage, opening manufacturing institutes, revamping housing policies and overhauling immigration laws.

“The reality is that the president’s economic vision is broad and his economic strategy is calibrated to try to make progress on a number of fronts,” said Brian Deese, a top White House economic adviser. “There is no reason why we can’t work on issues where there is and has been bipartisan support in the past, and the existence of the sequester today shouldn’t stop that.”

Advisers say they also won’t give up on replacing the sequester, rejecting the notion that it will be permanent. The budget measure expires at the end of September, and another battle is already brewing for the summer. Obama will continue to nurture relationships with Republicans potentially willing to compromise.

“The president has already got public opinion on his side. He’s got an election on his side,” said Ben LaBolt, a Democratic strategist who was the spokesman for Obama’s reelection campaign. “Now he has to go get a separate set of votes.”

The sequester undermines Obama’s vision for middle class-driven economic growth in two significant ways, economists and his allies say. First, it takes tens of billions of dollars out of the economy in the next six months. The Congressional Budget Office, echoing other analysts, says that will slow the economy by 0.6 percent this year and destroy 750,000 jobs.

Second, the sequester reduces spending on non-defense discretionary spending, a budget category with a mouthful of a name but a central role in the president’s plans. This is the part of the budget where government invests in programs that pay off in the future, like education or clean energy research.

The sequester cuts more than $25 billion from discretionary spending in the next six months, a 5 percent reduction. It saves $1.2 trillion by cutting discretionary and defense spending over the decade. These budgets were already under pressure as a result of a summer 2011 deal to constrain spending.

“The sequester cuts the things that are the investments and spending that are the best for long-term economic growth,” said Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress, which is also close to the White House.

Obama’s supporters say he has already accomplished a lot toward his vision of helping the middle class — namely by securing the revenue from $600 billion in tax hikes at the start of the year and through his health-care overhaul.

Some say that might have to be enough, given the Republican opposition in Congress is intent on dramatically shrinking government services.

“He has to be the firewall presidency,” said Douglas Brinkley, a historian at Rice University. “All he is really ultimately trying to do is protect the progressive legacy of the New Deal.”"

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/03/30/veterans-fight-changes-to-disability-payments/,2013-03-30 00:00:00,[],Veterans fight changes to disability payments,"Veterans groups are rallying to fight any proposal to change disability payments as the federal government attempts to address its long-term debt problem. They say they've sacrificed already.

Government benefits are adjusted according to inflation, and President Barack Obama has endorsed using a slightly different measure of inflation to calculate Social Security benefits. Benefits would still grow but at a slower rate.

Advocates for the nation's 22 million veterans fear that the alternative inflation measure would also apply to disability payments to nearly 4 million veterans as well as pension payments for an additional 500,000 low-income veterans and surviving families.

""I think veterans have already paid their fair share to support this nation,"" said the American Legion's Louis Celli. ""They've paid it in lower wages while serving, they've paid it through their wounds and sacrifices on the battlefield and they're paying it now as they try to recover from those wounds.""

Economists generally agree that projected long-term debt increases stemming largely from the growth in federal health care programs pose a threat to the country's economic competitiveness. Addressing the threat means difficult decisions for lawmakers and pain for many constituents in the decades ahead.

But the veterans groups point out that their members bore the burden of a decade of war in Iraq and Afghanistan. In the past month, they've held news conferences on Capitol Hill and raised the issue in meetings with lawmakers and their staffs. They'll be closely watching the unveiling of the president's budget next month to see whether he continues to recommend the change.

Obama and others support changing the benefit calculations to a variation of the Consumer Price Index, a measure called ""chained CPI."" The conventional CPI measures changes in retail prices of a constant marketbasket of goods and services. Chained CPI considers changes in the quantity of goods purchased as well as the prices of those goods. If the price of steak goes up, for example, many consumers will buy more chicken, a cheaper alternative to steak, rather than buying less steak or going without meat.

Supporters argue that chained CPI is a truer indication of inflation because it measures changes in consumer behavior. It also tends to be less than the conventional CPI, which would impact how cost-of-living raises are computed.

Under the current inflation update, monthly disability and pension payments increased 1.7 percent this year. Under chained CPI, those payments would have increased 1.4 percent.

The Congressional Budget Office projects that moving to chained CPI would trim the deficit by nearly $340 billion over the next decade. About two-thirds of the deficit closing would come from less spending and the other third would come from additional revenue because of adjustments that tax brackets would undergo.

Isabel Sawhill, a senior fellow in economic studies at The Brookings Institution, a Washington-based think tank, said she understands why veterans, senior citizens and others have come out against the change, but she believes it's necessary.

""We are in an era where benefits are going to be reduced and revenues are going to rise. There's just no way around that. We're on an unsustainable fiscal course,"" Sawhill said. ""Dealing with it is going to be painful, and the American public has not yet accepted that. As long as every group keeps saying, `I need a carve-out, I need an exception,' this is not going to work.""

Sawhill argued that making changes now will actually make it easier for veterans in the long run.

That's not the way Sen. Bernie Sanders sees it. The chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs said he recently warned Obama that every veterans group he knows of has come out strongly against changing the benefit calculations for disability benefits and pensions by using chained CPI.

""I don't believe the American people want to see our budget balanced on the backs of disabled veterans. It's especially absurd for the White House, which has been quite generous in terms of funding for the VA,"" said Sanders, I-Vt. ""Why they now want to do this, I just don't understand.

Sanders succeeded in getting the Senate to approve an amendment last week against changing how the cost-of-living increases are calculated, but the vote was largely symbolic. Lawmakers would still have a decision to make if moving to chained CPI were to be included as part of a bargain on taxes and spending.

Sanders' counterpart on the House side, Rep. Jeff Miller, R-Fla., the chairman of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, appears at least open to the idea of going to chained CPI.

""My first priority is ensuring that America's more than 20 million veterans receive the care and benefits they have earned, but with a national debt fast approaching $17 trillion, Washington's fiscal irresponsibility may threaten the very provision of veterans' benefits,"" Miller said. ""Achieving a balanced budget and reducing our national debt will help us keep the promises America has made tdirector for Veterans of Foreign Wars, acknowledged that veterans would see little change in their income during the first few years of the change. But even a $36 hit over the course of a year is ""huge"" for many of the disabled veterans living on the edge, he said.

The amount lost over time becomes more substantial as the years go by. Sanders said that a veteran with a 100 percent disability rating who begins getting payments at age 30 would see their annual payments trimmed by more than $2,300 a year when they turn 55."

He Previously Wrote About The Russia Investigation.']",Analyst calls governor’s budget plan ‘reasonable’,"Gov. Jerry Brown’s budget proposal may be too optimistic, but California’s finances still have shown dramatic improvement, the Legislature’s top financial advisor said Monday.

Legislative Analyst Mac Taylor said the state is likely to generate $2.1 billion less in revenue and savings than the governor is counting on. But after years of catastrophic deficits, that’s a relatively small gap in an estimated $97.7-billion proposal, he said.

“That’s not a startling difference,” said Taylor, who called the governor’s plans “reasonable.”

Brown and Taylor both see California’s finances on the upswing, but they’ve differed on how fast the finances are improving. The governor says the state’s deficit already has been wiped out; in November, the analyst projected a $1.9-billion budget gap this year.

Taylor did not back away from that estimate in his Monday report but described it as a “small problem” -- “not big enough at this point to worry too much.”

H.D. Palmer, spokesman for Brown’s Department of Finance, said the analyst’s report is proof the governor is taking the right approach. “Living within our means, paying down debt and strengthening education are the right policy choices for California,” Palmer said in a statement.

Taylor raised some concerns. The end of the federal payroll tax cut could lower economic activity, taking a bite out of tax revenue. A drawn-out fight in Congress over raising the debt ceiling could cause a slump in the stock market.

He also noted that Brown’s proposal “does nothing” to address mounting costs for teacher pensions and retiree healthcare. “There’s no plan as to how we pay those off,” Taylor said.

Unfunded obligations in the teachers’ pension fund were estimated at $64.5 billion over 30 years. For retiree healthcare, the estimate was $62.1 billion.

In addition, Taylor said, Brown’s plan could burn through much of California’s potential surplus, leaving the state without a cushion. Then, “if you get to the point where you have a downturn,” he said, “you’ll need to go back on those spending commitments.”

Assemblyman Jeff Gorrell (R-Camarillo), vice chairman of the Assembly budget committee, said California will need financial breathing room when the temporary taxes that voters passed in November expire in 2019. Otherwise, Gorrell said, the state could face “another massive deficit.”

Palmer said the administration’s own estimates show the state having healthy surpluses through 2017.

Taylor’s most pointed criticism involved Brown’s plan to use new revenue from Proposition 39, which changed how corporate taxes are calculated, to make schools more energy-efficient.

Because the ballot measure said projects would be selected based on energy savings and job creation, devoting the money to schools may not give the state the most bang for its buck, according to the report.

“The governor’s proposal very likely would not maximize state energy and job benefits,” it said.

Taylor did not offer alternatives.

Detroit Free Press

The city%27s unemployment rate has nearly tripled since 2000

Roughly 78%2C000 city structures have been abandoned

Bankruptcy filing more than 100%2C000 creditors%2C more than %241B in estimated liabilities

DETROIT — Detroit, the once-thriving Midwest metropolis that gave birth to the nation's auto industry, is now the largest city in U.S. history to file for bankruptcy.

Kevyn Orr, the city's appointed emergency manager, formally sought federal bankruptcy court protection on Thursday after Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican, approved the filing, deeming the decision necessary ""as a last resort to return this great city to financial and civic health for its residents and taxpayers.""

""I know many will see this as a low point in the city's history,"" Snyder wrote in a letter authorizing the bankruptcy filing. ""If so, I think it will also be the foundation of the city's future — a statement I cannot make in confidence absent giving the city a chance for a fresh start, without burdens of debt it cannot hope to fully pay.""

In the letter, Snyder explained his decision by citing statistics that have hobbled the city's operations:

• The city's unemployment rate has nearly tripled since 2000 and is more than double the national average.

• The homicide rate is at historically high levels, and the city has been named among America's most dangerous for more than 20 years.

• Detroiters wait an average of 58 minutes for police to respond, compared with the national average of 11 minutes.

• An estimated 40% of the city's street lights didn't work in the first quarter of 2013.

• Roughly 78,000 city structures have been abandoned.

The combination of lost auto industry jobs and rising crime rates prompted many middle-class whites and African Americans to flee Detroit over the past few decades. That exodus left behind an overwhelmingly poor and nearly 83% African-American population, making Detroit the nation's largest black-majority city.

The U.S. Bankruptcy Court filing represents perhaps the biggest body blow yet to a faded city that's now home to barely 700,000 — down from a peak of 1.8 million during the auto industry boom years of the 1950s — and struggles to cope with the abandoned buildings and decaying municipal services.

The filing listed more than 100,000 creditors and more than $1 billion in estimated liabilities, but Orr has said Detroit's total financial responsibilities could be as high as $20 billion.

Because of the stakes involved, and the impact on residents statewide, as well as 30,000 current and retired city workers and Detroit's ability to stay in business, the case could be precedent setting in the federal judiciary. It could also set an important trajectory for the way troubled cities deal with shrinking populations, dwindling tax bases and large debts from municipal pension systems and government services.

""I think you're looking at a very long and protracted bankruptcy,"" said Brad Coulter, a managing director at O'Keefe LLC, a turnaround consultancy in the Detroit area. ""The fight that's taking place in Detroit is the fight that's going to take place around the country as other struggling cities and municipalities come to grips with major financial issues.""

The bankruptcy isn't likely to spur many similar filings by other U.S. cities because state and local laws in most cases don't allow localities to turn to the federal court system for protection, said Michael Pagano, dean of the College of Urban Planning and Public Affairs at the University of Illinois-Chicago.

Cleveland defaulted on its debt during the 1970s but didn't go bankrupt. New York City teetered at bankruptcy's edge in 1975 after President Gerald Ford rejected its emergency aid request in a famous ""Drop Dead"" speech, but a last-minute bailout arrived via a $150 million investment in municipal securities from the city teacher union's pension fund.

In April, Stockton became California's fourth city to seek bankruptcy protection since the national recession's start five years ago. There have been 36 municipal bankruptcy filings since January 2010, according to Governing Magazine. Two proceedings, in Harrisburg, Pa., and Boise County, Idaho, were dismissed.

Orr, a turnaround specialist, spent recent months in tense, but unsuccessful negotiations attempting to get Detroit's creditors to settle for a fraction of what they're owed and persuade municipal unions to accept cuts in benefits.

The city's two pension funds, which collectively have claims to $9.2 billion in unfunded pension and retiree health care liabilities, filed state lawsuits this week in a bid to prevent Orr from slashing retiree benefits as part of a bankruptcy restructuring.

Ambac Assurance Guaranty, which insures some of Detroit's general obligation bonds, has also objected to Orr's plan to treat those bonds as ""unsecured,"" which would mean they're not tied directly to a dedicated city revenue stream and would be worth pennies on the dollar in value. Ambac and other city creditors have threatened to sue.

The filing starts a 30- to 90-day period that will determine whether the city is eligible for federal Chapter 9 protection and define how many claimants might compete for Detroit's dwindling settlement resources.

Coulter said city unions and other creditors are likely to argue that Detroit in fact is not insolvent and could pay its bills if forced to sell city resources and further cut services to raise money.

""A lot of issues like this have never been tried before in bankruptcy court,"" Coulter said.

The Detroit that ultimately emerges from bankruptcy ""is going to emerge a very different city than when it went in,"" said Pagano. ""It's going to have to have a tough conversation and decision about what are the core critical services the city has to provide, and at what level.""

Months later, instead of offering sympathy and promises of a full and fair investigation, Jean Quan made another stunning pronouncement. This time to Adam and Jeralyn Blueford, not long after their son had been executed by an Oakland Police Officer on May 6th, 2012. She said

""You're probably going to sue me, right?""

Now she's at it again.



Scott Olsen, the Occupy Oakland protester and Iraq War veteran who suffered brain injuries after police shot a tear gas canister at his head, says Oakland Mayor Jean told him he had ""a chip on his shoulder"" at the conclusion of Wednesday night's community meeting on public safety.



J.Quan told me she realizes I have a chip on my shoulder. Insulting, more like a broken skull and brain trauma. — Scott Olsen (@OlsenVet) March 7, 2013



The same Scott Olsen who received a quilt from Daily Kos peeps ? The Scott Olsen who selflessly helped stage a protest in support of Bradley Manning this summer ? The Scott Olsen who stood in peaceful protest beside his buddy on October 25th, 2011, nearly losing his life as a result of actions by Quan's thugs?Really?

Mayor, you are a pathetic, disgusting individual. No, you are below that. You are a sad excuse for a turd. No wonder 60% of Oakland residents say they disapprove of your job performance.

Here we see Mayor Quan in action, at said public safety meeting Wednesday last.

Scott Olsen, the person whose brutalization at the hands of her police outraged a nation and was partially responsible for sending 50,000+ people into the streets of Oakland on November 2nd, 2011, is asking a rather important question of Bob Wasserman. He's the man at the podium who is being paid $250,000 to ""solve"" the violence problem in Oakland.



Olsen... asked what sort of example it sends to the community when police are not prosecuted for crimes they allegedly commit.

Wasserman didn't answer the question. (No police officer has yet or likely will ever be indicted in the assault on Olsen).

Quan, shown in the background sitting next to the metal guide rail, is playing with her smartphone or tablet; she probably didn't even hear the question.

Let's compare labor's share of income to the S&P 500 since 2000.

Two things to note - the stock market is going up while labor's share is going down. I don't think is a a real surprise, but the graph shows the cause pretty well. But there is a second point I want to make as well. In addition to a lack of demand, a world where the rich have too much money is a world that is going to be subject to asset bubbles. If the rich don't spend their money it is going to go somewhere. That somewhere is in part various financial markets. But because financial markets are prone to panic, I think you can predict that we will see more bubbles build and then burst.

The graph suggests at least in part that my second point is true is well.

There are many conclusions you can draw on this. Some here will say that this is a house of cards that will all come crashing down. I don't think this is really right for a variety of reasons. But I DO think that until something happens to change the balance of power between labor and capital, the economy will not perform as it could, and the fruits of that economy will be very unequally distributed.

I close with Marriner Eccles' (the head of the Fed under FDR) famous explanation of the cause of the Great Depression. His words ring true today:



As mass production has to be accompanied by mass consumption, mass consumption, in turn, implies a distribution of wealth -- not of existing wealth, but of wealth as it is currently produced -- to provide men with buying power equal to the amount of goods and services offered by the nation's economic machinery. [Emphasis in original.] Instead of achieving that kind of distribution, a giant suction pump had by 1929-30 drawn into a few hands an increasing portion of currently produced wealth. This served them as capital accumulations. But by taking purchasing power out of the hands of mass consumers, the savers denied to themselves the kind of effective demand for their products that would justify a reinvestment of their capital accumulations in new plants. In consequence, as in a poker game where the chips were concentrated in fewer and fewer hands, the other fellows could stay in the game only by borrowing. When their credit ran out, the game stopped.

Since this is on the reclist, I thought I would point people to a very wonkish - but still important piece by Brad Delong this morning. Delong is pretty much required reading if you want to understand the economy - he was one of the leaders of the attacks on Reinhart and Rogoff.

He notes in part about the incredible gap between corporate profits and the Treasury rate:""Right now the profit share in the US economy is at levels far and away higher than I at least ever imagined I would see. And, given the high profit share and the extremely low return on Treasury notes the stock market is far and away lower than I at least ever imagined I would see. With downward pressure on real wages from elevated unemployment making it more likely that profits will grow faster than the economy rather than shrink, the 9% point gap between the S&P earnings yield of 7% and the Treasury note real yield of -2%--I never thought I would see anything like this in my lifetime."""

Well that land would be one where...



President-elect Romney would be planning his inauguration right now.

If states stop awarding votes on a winner-take-all basis, Republicans could also win — and without necessarily getting more votes. Determining Electoral College voting by congressional districts represents one obvious opportunity for Republicans: In that scenario, the effect of urban Democratic strongholds (such as those Philadelphia precincts where Obama was supported by 99 percent of voters) would be isolated. Instead of shifting the entire state’s electoral votes, those precincts would only influence their congressional districts.

Trinko can almost see it. All it would take, she writes, is:Pretty simple. There are a lot of rural low population counties that vote Republican and a smaller number of large population counties that vote Democratic. If the GOP can change the rules to take advantage of this then the 47% of Romney supporters could lord over the 53% of non-Romney supporters. Genius!

Trinko's column cites research by FairVote.com which is ironic since that group is specifically working against systems (including the electoral college) which skew the value of different citizen's votes. In fact, Fairvote is warning against what Republicans might do. They present six ideas that would improve GOP prospects and make winning possible when losing the popular vote:



it's all predicated, of course, on something I fervently hope isn't true: that Republicans in these six key states would be willing to ignore the large majority of voters who prefer a level playing field in our elections - an attitude we call on all elected officials to reject with our Stand with Voters pledge.

But Trinko is excited about these six plans, especially two which would have given Romney electoral college wins of 274-264 and 280-258. Both are based on changing rules in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Virginia and Florida to award electoral votes proportionally by congressional district. These are states with Republican governors and legislatures.

But if these ideas won't fly, Trinko suggests a look at Fairvote's goal: a national popular vote. As she puts it, that way the GOP could win even if the number of red states declines. I think she's wrong but now might be the best time to propose this constitutional change [EDIT: See Kos's comment below]. Currently our system grants disproportionate power to small population states because they all get 3 electoral votes regardless of how small they are.

Either way, you know the GOP is heading down the wrong path if, instead of soul searching and making real changes, they are looking to game the system."

“Did you see his convention speech?” she asked the crowd. “It was really bad. And I must say, though I loved Chris Christie, I’m now a single issue voter against amnesty, so Christie is off my list.” She noted, however, that Senator Ted Cruz (R – TX) “is still on (her) list.” Coulter has hopes for Senator Marco Rubio (R – FL) but wondered, “Why on earth is Marco Rubio and these endless Republicans supporting [amnesty]?”

Governor Christie was not invited to the annual conference this year. The decision raised questions among conservatives again if Christie’s actions during the Romney-Ryan campaign, particularly towards the end damaged his credibility with the GOP’s conservative base.

“This year, for better or for worse, we felt like he didn’t deserve to be on the all-star selection, and for decisions that he made,” CPAC Chairman Al Cardenas told reporters. “And so hopefully next year he’s back on the right track and being a conservative.” Cardenas noted that Christie “is popular figure, but everyone needs to live by the parameters of the movement.”

Coulter said that she does not know who she is focused in on for 2016 but she described what kind of candidate should not be running. She previously supported former Republican Delaware Governor Pete du Pont, conservative political commentator Pat Buchanan, business mogul Steve Forbes, and former Congressman Duncan Hunter (R – CA). Coulter admitted she made mistakes with some of her past choices.

“No, you can’t run a congressman. I have learned that. You cannot run a governor from a state that’s only as big as a congressional district. That’s the equivalent of running of congressman. We can’t run businessmen, pundits,” she said, adding, “People who have not run and won elections in at least a mid-size state. We’re looking at governors and senators. Once you throw in the governors and senators, let’s see how they debate, let’s see their positions then.”

Coulter was particularly critical of conservatives who put themselves before the movement. She pointed to the Senate races lost by Republicans in 2012. Coulter pointed to former Congressman Todd Akin’s unwillingness to drop out of the Senate race in Missouri and those who supported his decision. “Passion is great but in politics, scoring is all that counts,” she said."

We will need fossil fuels like oil and gas for the foreseeable future. So there’s really little choice (sigh). We have to press ahead with fracking for natural gas. We must approve the Keystone XL pipeline to get Canadian oil. This mantra, repeated on TV ads and in political debates, is punctuated with a tinge of inevitability and regret. But, increasingly, scientific research and the experience of other countries should prompt us to ask: To what extent will we really “need” fossil fuel in the years to come? To what extent is it a choice? ... “It’s absolutely not true that we need natural gas, coal or oil — we think it’s a myth,” said Mark Z. Jacobson, a professor of civil and environmental engineering and the main author of the study, published in the journal Energy Policy. “You could power America with renewables from a technical and economic standpoint. The biggest obstacles are social and political — what you need is the will to do it.”

President Obama visits the Middle East, makes history as he speaks war to Syria and Iran and peace to Israelis and Palestinians, and the talk back home circles The Big Question: Will Hillary run?

Not incidentally, the women’s vote is hers. Even Republican women would find it hard not to cast a ballot for Hillary. If not her, then who?

Head Start education programs for low-income students are being slashed. So are medical services for 2 million native Americans living on Indian reservations and in Alaska. The Army is suspending tuition assistance for soldiers hoping to enroll in classes, while scholarship funds have been curtailed for children of troops who were killed in combat. ... Still, not everyone who depends on the federal government is suffering in these austere times. According to the Wall Street Journal, the USDA is on the verge of purchasing 400,000 tons of sugar in a massive bailout of domestic sugar processors. The move would cost taxpayers about $80 million.

The major beneficiaries of this bailout would be cane growers in Florida and beet operations in Minnesota, Michigan and North Dakota. Big Sugar has outsized political clout in Washington, as evidenced by the silence of so-called fiscal conservatives. Heavy campaign contributions are spread among Democrats and Republicans alike. Barack Obama took money from the sugar industry, as did Mitt Romney. Hefty donations went to both of Florida’s senators, Bill Nelson and Marco Rubio. Every time somebody in Congress tries to kill the sugar subsidy, the measure gets voted down — by some of the same lawmakers who love to rail against public spending on welfare benefits, health care and education.

Judging from the squeals we're hearing from members of Congress whose districts are threatened by cuts, the effects are intolerable. The complaints from Democrats, who never wanted the sequester to go into effect, were predictable. But some of the complaining comes from Republicans who welcomed the sequester as an overdue act of belt-tightening. Tea Party Rep. Steve Stockman (R-Texas) has decried cuts to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which he called ""one of the few legitimate functions of government."" (The Johnson Space Center, with about 3,000 civilian employees, happens to be in his Houston-area district.) The sequester, Stockman warned, could put all Americans in danger — by hampering NASA's work to protect the Earth from asteroids.

Kathleen Parker is apparently fixated on Hillary 2016, and thinks that you are, too.Um, maybe inhome, Kathleen, but the rest of America kind of cares about what the current president is doing. Still, Parker does admit something that has to be tough for her to acknowledge. Carl Hiaasen looks at a portion of government that's miraculously dodged the budget cuts.Maybe they're just too sweet to fail. Or maybe... Doyle McManus says that the sequester is showing up in more than just programs that help kids and soldiers.But who really ""wins"" on the sequester is still an open question. Consider this your ""read it all"" political article of the morning.

Paul Krugman examines another small instance of the Rand-ification of the right.

On today’s right, not only is civic virtue, nay patriotism, associated with narrow defense of your own self-interest, any deviation from that standard — like being an affluent person who nonetheless supports aid to the poor paid for by progressive taxation — is considered prima facie hypocritical. … All through the 2012 campaign we were lectured about the evils of “attacking success“, which was defined as any criticism of how a wealthy individual got that way. But as soon as they think they spot an opening, right-wingers go ahead and … attack success.

A perfect storm has gathered over Colorado. The prevailing winds of value-free politics, the decline of authentic debate, and the increasing global warming of relativism will collide with the upslope of secularism and the denial of religious liberties to converge with individualistic notions of freedom absent responsibility, producing powerful thunderstorms of hypocrisy, and the rain of radical liberalism.

Sarah Huntzinger deserves an award for her piece in the Denver Post. Maybe two awards.

You know you're going to read the rest of it just to see if she can keep up this level of indignent insanity. She can. Good lord, she can.

But remember, while a little ranting can be good for you, a lot is not.

Two studies were conducted to explore how people experience and express their anger on a particular type of Web site, known as a rant-site. Study 1 surveyed rant-site visitors to better understand the perceived value of the Web sites and found that while they become relaxed immediately after posting, they also experience more anger than most and express their anger in maladaptive ways. Study 2 explored the emotional impact of reading and writing rants and found that for most participants, reading and writing rants were associated with negative shifts in mood.

So, in all things moderation. Including being immoderate."

Elizabeth Warren calls for the release of trade documents,"President Barack Obama’s administration should release documents the U.S. and 10 other Pacific-region nations are using as they negotiate a new trade agreement, Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren said. In a letter to Michael Froman, Obama’s nominee to lead the U.S. Trade Representative’s office, the Massachusetts lawmaker said releasing details of what is being considered by the parties would give citizens a chance to evaluate the deal before negotiations are completed. “I appreciate the willingness of the USTR to make various documents available for review by members of Congress, but I do not believe that is a substitute for more robust public transparency,” Warren wrote to Froman, who is now an assistant to the president. “If transparency would lead to widespread public opposition to a trade agreement, then that trade agreement should not be the policy of the United States.”

Trade rules affect nearly every aspect of our lives -- the food we eat, the air we breathe, the water we drink, the price of medicines we may need, the jobs we depend on. It is therefore absolutely critical that the public has a say in how trade rules are formulated and implemented. Today, trade rules are usually written under a cloud of secrecy. For example, the Trans-Pacific Partnership -- potentially the largest free trade agreement ever -- has been under negotiation for over three years and may conclude as early as this October. And yet, not a single word of draft text has been released to the public. Without draft text, the public is left to guess what may be included in trade deals and is unable to meaningfully engage. Responsible trade begins with public participation.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren continues to fight for government transparency. This time, she's taking on the U.S. Trade Representative’s office: She seems to be hinting that if the general public knew the details of these secret negotiations, they would be staunchly opposed to the new deal. When Michael Froman was nominated for the post of U.S. Trade Representative in early May, Ilana Solomon at the Huffington Post said his #1 priority should be transparency: Hats off to Sen. Warren for once again demanding transparency and action.

Want to see more transparency in trade negotiations? Sign our petition backing up Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s request that all documents being used to negotiate the Trans-Pacific Partnership be released for review by the public."

Cole, 60, was Ventura’s city manager for eight years before abruptly stepping down last year. He was city manager of Azusa before that and is a former mayor of Pasadena.

During his tenure in Ventura, he championed the adoption of an all-infill general plan, reorganized departments and recruited high-tech businesses to the laid-back coastal city.

As the economy tanked in 2008, Cole presided over a 15% budget cut that included 100 jobs eliminated and the closure of a popular city library. But he managed to preserve most services and also worked out a plan to improve emergency response times.

With the election of a new City Council majority last year, however, his sometimes blunt style clashed with that of Ventura Mayor Mike Tracy, the city’s former police chief. He announced that he was resigning last July.

Cole said he was approached by Garcetti’s transition team and met with the mayor last week. Garcetti’s team was attracted by his use of performance-based budgeting first in Azusa and then in Ventura.

“That which gets measured gets done,” Cole said. “Government has been slow sometimes to adapt organizational best practices. Tracking performance and being accountable for results is what I’ve tried to implement going back 30 years.”

The city’s workforce needs to be well-equipped, well-trained and “sustainably compensated,” Cole said, and employees also need to use technology that makes them more efficient and be focused on results. Although Ventura and Azusa are far smaller than metropolitan L.A., the same principles have been applied successfully in big cities such as New York and Boston, Cole said.

“We’re starting with a very big city that has been in business for more than 100 years,” he said. “The job is to move aggressively and responsibly to keep the city moving forward, and in a way that people notice improvements in their neighborhoods.”

He doesn’t know Garcetti and didn’t contribute to his mayoral campaign. But he supports Garcetti’s “back to basics” vision, Cole said:

“I believe in their message, and I believe they are real about their message.”

For the last year Cole, a devout Catholic, was the administrator of Ventura’s historic mission in the city’s downtown. He focused on linking the church’s resources with city programs for the poor.

In recent months, he’s also served as interim chief operating officer to the Local Government Commission, a nonprofit based in Sacramento.

Cole lives in Ventura with his three teenage children but said he will be moving to Los Angeles as soon as he can.

“If you work for a city, you need to live there,” he said.

Cole will draw an annual salary of $172,000.

Cincinnati, Cleveland and Dayton, Ohio

The labor force has been shrinking in all of Ohio's major cities other than its state capital, Columbus.

Cleveland has lost 52,000 workers, or about 5% of its labor force, since November 2007, and Cincinnati lost 39,000 workers, or about 4% of its labor force, since May 2009, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Job growth is anemic, particularly in Ohio's main industry, manufacturing. Signs point to workers giving up, said Amy Hanauer, executive director of Policy Matters Ohio.

""I think people are getting discouraged and leaving the labor market,"" she said.

Ohio lost 388,000 jobs in the financial crisis, and has since gained only about a fifth of them back.

Phoenix and Tucson, Ariz.

The fallout from the housing bust is still felt here. The construction sector slashed more than half its jobs in the crisis, and they've only started to trickle back in the last few months.

But the decline in the labor force isn't solely due to construction. In neighboring Nevada, the heart of the housing bust, the labor force didn't drop nearly as dramatically as in Arizona.

Phoenix alone lost 64,000 workers, or 3% of its labor force, and Tucson lost 29,000 workers, or a 6% of its labor force, over the last four years.

Most of those declines have come from young men, ages 25 to 34, and middle-aged women, ages 45 to 59.

The Latino labor force has also declined, which could be due in part to stricter immigration laws.

Hartford, Bridgeport and New Haven, Conn.

Like much of New England, Connecticut generally has an older population than the nation as a whole. With the stock market improving since the recession ended, the number of Baby Boomers retiring has been increasing, said Alissa DeJonge, director of research at the Connecticut Economic Resource Center.

At the same time, the unemployment rate among young minorities has climbed in the state's urban centers, such as Hartford and Bridgeport.

""It may be that these younger minority workers have stopped looking for work and will reenter the labor force when the state's economy improves,"" said Orlando Rodriguez, senior policy fellow at Connecticut Voices for Children.

Detroit and Kalamazoo, Mich. and Milwaukee, Wis.

Michigan's population was declining three years before the recession even hit, as the auto industry moved jobs elsewhere.

The state's largest city, Detroit was hit particularly hard. Three years ago, the U.S. Census found that the city's population had fallen to its lowest level since 1910.

Other manufacturing cities in the Midwest are facing similar declines.

Milwaukee lost 16,000 workers, or 2% of its labor force since June 2009. And Kalamazoo lost 17,500 workers -- a whopping 10% of its labor force -- since January 2007."

Like its decision to end White House tours when the sequester cuts took effect, there is no rational reason for this. The Park Police, nominally in charge of monitoring these spaces, isn’t even affected by the shutdown. Shutting off access to these sites is gratuitous and petulant.

On Monday, the first day of the government shutdown, a number of WWII veterans showed up at a memorial to their service to find that access had been blocked. The memorial is in a public space and is open 24/7, with almost no oversight from Park Police personnel. (Who, by the way, are exempt from the government shutdown.) The White House was, according to reports, informed of the veterans’ visit and chose to block access.

Having lived in DC for 18 years, I can tell you, the WWII Memorial is simply an architectural structure in an open public space. There is no official “access” to it. There are no guards. It’s a building in a park. Yet, the Obama Administration tried to block veterans from viewing the public memorial, even after hearing about the planned visit.

Fortunately, the “greatest generation” was having nothing of this and easily overcame the government barricades. (Do we yet again have to rely on this generation to show the promise of America?)

On Wednesday, the veterans’ group is planning to visit the Lincoln Memorial, which the Obama Administration has also vowed to close to visitors. I have regularly visited this memorial at one or two in the morning. At those hours, it is a peaceful and reflective place. It is an open space. There is no access that needs to be blocked. It is only by a conscious decision, and a great deal of work, that access would be blocked.

This is nothing more than a petulant response by the Obama Administration to the government shutdown. Over the next week, more than 500 WWII veterans are expected in DC to visit the memorial dedicated to their sacrifice. If the Park Police again try to erect barricades to this public space, it will be another sign that the Obama Administration has made an affirmative decision to separate itself from the American public.

Obama chose this pass. He ought to be made to own it."
http://security.blogs.cnn.com/2013/06/01/hagel-ties-china-to-cyber-attacks/,2013-06-01 00:00:00,[],Hagel ties China to cyber attacks,"From CNN’s Nunu Japaridze

Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel pointed the finger at China Saturday when addressing cybersecurity threats, the latest in a series of rhetorical skirmishes between the United States and China on the issue.

Speaking to an audience of defense professionals at a regional security summit in Singapore, Hagel said the United States was concerned about “the growing threat of cyber intrusions, some of which appear to be tied to the Chinese government and military.”

Even as he singled out China, Hagel added that United States was “determined to work more vigorously with China” in order to address the problem.

Acknowledging the risk of “miscalculations and mistakes as to who was behind the attack,” Hagel insisted that the most effective way to combat the cyber threat is through mutual cooperation between countries and governments.

“Cyber threats are not just a threat to the United States or a threat to any one country. They are threats to China,” Hagel said.

Hagel also noted that the United States has increased investments in cybersecurity to counter the increasing threats.

The Pentagon previously blamed China in its annual report to U.S. lawmakers on Chinese military capabilities.

The report, published in May, stated that some of the recent cyberattacks in the United States appeared “to be attributable directly to Chinese government and military.”"

Tom Coburn and Jim Inhofe. She worked for Republican Gov. Mary Fallin. She worked for Sen. John McCain's (R-Ariz.) last Senate campaign.

But ever since the tea party gained a dominant hold on the GOP agenda, Caliendo has taken both her vote and her small campaign contributions to the Democrats.

""They've gone so hard right,"" Caliendo, who calls herself a Colin Powell Republican, said. ""They have no common sense left.""

In 2012, Caliendo began making small donations to the reelection campaign of President Barack Obama. After the election, she gave to the chief political arm of congressional Democrats, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. She has now made more than 13 contributions totaling $376.

In the first 10 months of 2013, the DCCC dominated its Republican counterpart in fundraising. It did so in no small part by attracting new donors like Caliendo, frustrated with the Republican-led House of Representatives.

""The tea party, more than anything, and their growing influence in Congress,"" said Mike Snider, who works on a Navy base in southern Maryland, when asked why he has made at least 17 contributions to the DCCC totaling $513 this year.

That may not seem like much when the most expensive 2014 House race has already topped $9 million in fundraising. But Democrats have been remarkably successful at tapping huge numbers of small donors like Snider and Caliendo, who give over and over. That success may translate beyond money in next year's elections. As Caliendo noted, ""Smaller donors are where the votes are at.""

More than 15 percent of the DCCC's $65.2 million in fundraising through October -- or $10.1 million -- came from more than 11,700 donors who did not make a contribution in the 2012 election cycle, according to a review of Federal Election Commission records by The Huffington Post.

The National Republican Congressional Committee raised $5.7 million from more than 4,200 donors who did not give in 2012. Through October, the NRCC had raised $52.4 million.

More than half of the new DCCC donors made more than one contribution. Nearly 700 individuals made 10 or more donations. These repeat donors accounted for $3.4 million of the new donor money raised by the committee. That may only be one-third of the total raised from new donors, but these repeat donors are far more likely to keep giving through Election Day 2014.

While the DCCC is successfully getting new donors to pony up multiple times, the NRCC is struggling. Just 28 percent of new NRCC donors made more than one contribution. Only 19 individual donors made more than 10 contributions.

The NRCC, heavily reliant on big donors, received more than half of its new money from donors giving $10,000 or more. Donors giving $1,000 or more accounted for 90 percent of all new contributions to the Republican committee.

The NRCC did not respond to a request for comment.

Big donors also played a huge role for the DCCC, with 47 percent of its new donor funds coming from those giving $10,000 or more. Two-thirds of the new money came from donors making a contribution of $1,000 or more.

But donors giving less than $1,000 accounted for one-third of the new DCCC money. The NRCC raised 10 percent from that category of donors. These donors do not include those giving less than $200, the threshold for public disclosure of a donor's name and amount they gave.

Controversy has aided the Democrats' fundraising successes. The committee's two best fundraising months, among both overall and new donors, came during the 16-day government shutdown in October and the political standoff that led up to it.

""Mainly my giving works when [Republicans have] done something really stupid, made a really stupid remark, and the [DCCC] comes out with their thing saying can you give $5,"" Caliendo explained. ""In one week I think I gave like $250 because I was so mad. That was leading into the shutdown.""

The elevation of Democrats' enemies, like the austerity-promoting House Budget Committee chair Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), also helped rake in money. The DCCC's third-best fundraising month came in March, after the House passed Ryan's budget, which would have cut Social Security and Medicare benefits.

“Every time House Republicans denigrate women, double down on millionaires over the middle class or push their agenda to hurt seniors, our grassroots supporters step up -- and, needless to say, it’s happened a lot this year,"" DCCC digital director Brandon English said.

These strategies are at the heart of the DCCC's successful digital fundraising program. The committee has carefully tailored its appeals to Democratic partisans, angry at the tea party and the Koch brothers. This is done through a stream of emails to the DCCC's massive list of supporters.

""Once you've given once, if you give them your email, you get lots of emails,"" Snider said.

Some help the DCCC raise more money.

Randall Redmon, a bagger and janitor at a Kroger supermarket in Versailles, Ky., has made more than 56 contributions totaling $370. He posts every fundraising email he gets from the DCCC to Facebook and Twitter to try to help raise more money than he can give himself.

""If they say that Republicans are trying to steal something or take away something, I'm trying to get as many people as I can to help stop them,"" Redmon said. ""That's what I do. I spread the word.""

Supporters can set up a recurring donation to keep their support flowing, as Caliendo, Snider and Redmon, among many others, have done.

The DCCC also raises money through an online store, a tactic pioneered by the 2008 Obama presidential campaign.

""Sometimes I buy stuff from their store and that's like a contribution, too,"" Redmon said. ""Sweaters and stuff, and shirts.""

These new Democratic donors will likely continue to pile on contributions whenever the DCCC amplifies the actions of House Republicans. But there are always some important factors that could lead some to cut off their giving.

""It depends on how things are going with polls and my finances and my job,"" Snider said.

The Labor Department report, delayed 2 1/2 weeks because of the partial federal government shutdown, reflected an economy growing at a lackluster rate. The latest job gains matched the pace since the start of summer but came in below Wall Street’s forecast for an increase of about 175,000 jobs.

The disappointing growth is likely to reinforce the hesitance of Federal Reserve officials to begin a withdrawal of its monetary stimulus program. Fed policymakers are weighing a cutback in its $85-billion-a-month purchase of bonds, but officials have been waiting for stronger employment growth.

The economy added on average about 195,000 jobs a month in the first half of this year, but growth has slowed since then to about 143,000 a month, enough to keep up with population growth and new job entrants but much too slow to absorb at a satisfactory rate many of the 11.3 million officially unemployed or help the nearly 8 million part-time workers who want more hours.

The unemployment rate has been inching down this past summer, but that’s partly the result of workers dropping out of the labor force. The labor force did not shrink in September. The latest jobless figure is the lowest since November 2008 during the depths of the Great Recession,

Job growth in September was led by retail trade, transportation and warehousing, and temporary-help industries -- with each category adding more than 20,000 jobs. The construction sector added 20,000 jobs, its strongest gain since February. Manufacturing was flat, and the once-booming leisure sector, which includes hotels and restaurants, lost 13,000 jobs over the month.

Government payrolls rose by 22,000 in September, though federal employment shrank by 6,000.

The 16-day partial shutdown of government offices and facilities, which began Oct. 1, had no direct bearing on the September employment data, but surveys and anecdotal reports indicate that the uncertainty over the budget stalemate weighed on employers and possibly their hiring decisions last month.

The increase in temporary-help employment may signal a pickup in broader hiring to come. Another so-called leading indicator, the average hours worked in a week, showed no change in September at 34.5 hours. Average hourly earnings for all private employees rose a measly 3 cents from August, to $24.09 last month.

It will take some weeks if not months before analysts can fully assess the economic impact of the government shutdown, but most economists think the temporary closure of operations and furloughs of about 800,000 employees will shave half a percentage point off economic growth in the fourth quarter. That would most likely mean fourth-quarter growth of even less than the sluggish 2% average pace since the recovery began in mid-2009.

He Died On June']",Charles Krauthammer: Call Obama’s sequester bluff,"For the first time since Election Day, President Obama is on the defensive. That’s because on March 1, automatic spending cuts (“sequestration”) go into effect — $1.2 trillion over 10 years, half from domestic (discretionary) programs, half from defense.

The idea had been proposed and promoted by the White House during the July 2011 debt-ceiling negotiations. The political calculation was that such draconian defense cuts would drive the GOP to offer concessions.

It backfired. The Republicans have offered no concessions. Obama’s bluff is being called and he’s the desperate party. He abhors the domestic cuts. And as commander in chief he must worry about indiscriminate Pentagon cuts that his own defense secretary calls catastrophic.

So Tuesday, Obama urgently called on Congress to head off the sequester with a short-term fix. But instead of offering an alternative $1.2 trillion in cuts, Obama demanded a “balanced approach,” coupling any cuts with new tax increases.

What should the Republicans do? Nothing.

Republicans should explain — message No. 1 — that in the fiscal-cliff deal the president already got major tax hikes with no corresponding spending cuts. Now it is time for a nation $16 trillion in debt to cut spending. That’s balance.

The Republicans finally have leverage. They should use it. Obama capitalized on the automaticity of the expiring Bush tax cuts to get what he wanted at the fiscal cliff — higher tax rates. Republicans now have automaticity on their side.

If they do nothing, the $1.2 trillion in cuts go into effect. This is the one time Republicans can get cuts under an administration that has no intent of cutting anything. Get them while you can.

Of course, the sequester is terrible policy. The domestic cuts will be crude and the Pentagon cuts damaging. This is why the Republican House has twice passed bills offering more rationally allocated cuts. (They curb, for example, entitlement spending as well.)

Naturally, the Democratic Senate, which hasn’t passed a budget since before the iPad, has done nothing. Nor has the president — until his Tuesday plea.

The GOP should reject it out of hand and plainly explain (message No. 2): We are quite prepared to cut elsewhere. But we already raised taxes last month. If the president wants to avoid the sequester — as we do — he must offer a substitute set of cuts.

Otherwise, Mr. President, there is nothing to discuss. Your sequester — Republicans need to reiterate that the sequester was the president’s idea in the first place — will go ahead.

Obama is trying to sell his “balanced” approach with a linguistic sleight of hand. He insists on calling his proposed tax hikes — through eliminating deductions and exemptions — “tax reform.”

It’s not. Tax reform, as defined even by the White House’s own Web page on the subject, begins with lowering tax rates. It then makes up the lost revenue by closing loopholes.

Real tax reform is revenue neutral. It’s a way to clean the tax code by eliminating unfair, inefficient and market-distorting loopholes on the one hand while lowering rates to stimulate economic growth on the other.

Obama has zero interest in lowering tax rates. He just got through raising them at the fiscal cliff and has made perfectly clear ever since that he fully intends to keep raising taxes. His only interest in eliminating loopholes is to raise more cash for the Treasury — not to use them to lower rates.

That’s not tax reform. That’s a naked, old-fashioned tax increase.

Hence Republican message No. 3: The sequester is one thing, real tax reform quite another. The sequester is for cutting. The only question is whether it will be done automatically and indiscriminately — or whether the president will offer an alternative set of cuts.

Then we can take up real tax reform. Reprise the landmark Reagan-Tip O’Neill-Bill Bradley tax reform of 1986, a revenue-neutral spur to economic growth and efficiency, and a blow for fairness for those not powerful enough to manipulate the tax code.

The country needs tax reform. But first it needs to rein in out-of-control spending. To succeed in doing that, Republicans must remain united under one demand: cuts with no taxes — or we will let the sequester go into effect.

The morning after, they should sit down with Obama for negotiations on real tax reform as recommended by the president’s own Simpson-Bowles commission: broaden the base, lower the rates.

The White House responded Friday night to a petition on its website urging construction of a Death Star for job creation and national defense purposes by 2016.

Here's why, according to Paul Shawcross, chief of the Science and Space Branch of the Office of Management and Budget, who wrote an epic response to the petition and its nearly 35,000 signatories:

The construction of the Death Star has been estimated to cost more than $850,000,000,000,000,000. We're working hard to reduce the deficit, not expand it.

The Administration does not support blowing up planets.

Why would we spend countless taxpayer dollars on a Death Star with a fundamental flaw that can be exploited by a one-man starship?

Shawcross did take the opportunity to explain what is being done already, instead of the government spending the the estimated $852 quadrillion (in case you were wondering what the above number was) to build the ultimate planet-destroying machine.

There's the International Space Station (which doesn't destroy planets). There's the two rovers on Mars (""one wielding a laser""). Oh yeah, here's the president wielding a light saber! Who knew -- the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is even ""supporting research"" on building Luke Skywalker's arm.

Shawcross closed by plugging a big initiative of the Obama administration: science, technology, engineering and math education:

If you do pursue a career in a science, technology, engineering or math-related field, the Force will be with us! Remember, the Death Star's power to destroy a planet, or even a whole star system, is insignificant next to the power of the Force.

Sorry, ""Star Wars"" fans, it seems the gravitational pull of Washington's budget battles was too much to make a $852 quadrillion investment."

The Arizona Republic

McCain%27s bill would allow consumers to choose and pay for only the channels they want

Critics say plan would have negative impact on diversity in programming

Analysts say cable industry%27s lobbying power would likely block any chances of a la carte pricing

Online music retailers usually don't force consumers to buy an entire album to get a favorite song.

Many consumers wonder why satellite and cable operators can't do something similar and allow them to purchase TV service by the channel instead of a bundle of dozens or even hundreds of networks, many of which they'll never watch.

The idea of ""a la carte"" cable and satellite television has been around for years. But Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., has jump-started a new national conversation with a bill he introduced in Congress this month that would use regulatory incentives to encourage programmers and distributors to unbundle their channels and offer a la carte programming.

McCain immediately picked up support from watchdog groups such as the Consumers Union and others who see his legislation as a way to shake up the status quo while technological innovations such as Internet TV break into the mainstream video market.

Ever-rising cable prices also are fueling the calls for a la carte. According to a Federal Communications Commission survey, rates for expanded basic cable, a popular cable tier, grew an average of 6.1 percent a year between 1995 and 2011. The average monthly price for the service is $54.46.

""I believe the consumers are at a tipping point when it comes to their monthly pay-TV bill,"" McCain told a Senate subcommittee last week. ""In my view, the a la carte option is a non-regulatory and consumer-friendly way to provide consumers with the freedom to lower their bills and pay only for what they watch.""

But while the concept is popular with many cable customers, and technology and other market forces appear headed in that direction, most observers doubt that even a senator with the national stature of McCain, a one-time presidential nominee, can bend the entrenched Washington lobbies of the cable industry, the broadcasters and the programmers to his will.

Cable lobbyists argue that a la carte pricing is not financially feasible, likely would mean the end of many channels that are not popular enough to survive without it, and probably wouldn't even save viewers much money, either. Hilary Shelton, director of the NAACP's Washington bureau, has blasted the a la carte cable idea on the grounds it would economically hurt minorities and ""kill diversity in programming.""

Industry leaders also argue that such issues might be better left to the free market to sort out, pointing to the ongoing revolution in video technology that gives consumers a variety of new viewing options — such as online video, Netflix, Hulu, iTunes and digital video recorders — and allows them to watch their favorite shows and movies on their schedules. A traditional TV set no longer is even necessary. Many young people are increasingly relying on their iPads, smartphones and laptop computers to watch video.

""These are big issues, but is anything going to happen? No,"" said A. Michael Noll, a University of Southern California professor emeritus and expert on telecommunications policy and TV technology. ""The cable companies have tremendous lobbying power — more power than John McCain.""

Long shot to become law

In a recent interview with The Arizona Republic, even McCain acknowledged that his bill is a long shot to become law this year.

""I'd be surprised (if it passes), because the cable companies and the satellite companies are such a powerful special interest,"" McCain said. ""But we'll keep trying.""

It's unclear whether the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, which has jurisdiction over telecommunications issues, even intends to return to the a la carte programming issue in a serious way.

But McCain, a longtime champion of a la carte cable, was allowed to make his case last Tuesday before its Subcommittee on Communications, Technology and the Internet during a hearing on the ""State of Video."" In his remarks, McCain compared the bundling of programming in cable and satellite packages to forcing customers to pay for the entire menu at a restaurant in order to get what they want to eat.

""Basically, I support a la carte, and I believe most Americans do, for the basic reason that consumers shouldn't have to pay for television channels they don't watch and have no interest in watching,"" said McCain, a former Commerce Committee chairman who no longer sits on the panel.

Savings questioned

Michael Powell, president and CEO of the National Cable and Telecommunications Association, countered that several independent studies have raised questions about whether shifting to an a la carte system would actually save customers money.

The audience size for each channel would shrink dramatically, and prices likely would increase ""quite substantially"" in order to make up for the revenue loss that would accompany a smaller advertising base, Powell said. Some of the less popular—but still culturally significant and diverse— channels might not survive a transition to a la carte pricing and would be lost to their viewers.

""It doesn't take long for consumers, putting those pieces together, to quickly get to a package that costs something very similar to what they were paying before, if not more,"" Powell, a former FCC chairman, told the subcommittee.

The cable industry also realizes that the market is changing and younger customers expect personalized options.

""As the video model evolves, expect to see channel lineups that are personalized and recommendation engines that modify content choices to your preferences,"" Powell said.

Gordon Smith, a former Republican senator from Oregon who now heads the National Association of Broadcasters, echoed that in response to a question about a la carte: ""There are tremendous market forces anyway that are creating kinds of adjustments.""

Despite expanding choices, some consumers who like the a la carte idea say they're discouraged by what they still view as a lack of real competition and options in pay TV, which frequently is packaged with phone and Internet service.

""When they bundle it, you've got to have this in order to get this, and if you drop this, then you lose out on the rest of the stuff,"" said David Blare, 48, a utility-company electrician in Mesa. ""I just don't think that's right.""

Supporters want to try it

Consumer groups have tended to appreciate McCain's willingness to tackle the pay-TV issues.

""A lot of people today feel like they're getting ripped off,"" said John Bergmayer, senior staff attorney with Public Knowledge, a Washington, D.C.-based public-interest organization that focuses on Internet and other technology issues. ""So I support Senator McCain's bill because it's aimed at giving consumers a lot more choice and flexibility.""

Online video is making encouraging progress, but so far seems to be providing more competition to the traditional video-rental store than to cable companies, which haven't yet had to respond with lower prices, Bergmayer told the subcommittee.

""For most users, it is a supplement to cable, not a replacement,"" he said."

The government-owned building was finally sold to a private developer for $19.5 million this month. But it sat there for 10 years -- off the market and vacant -- while taxpayers footed the bill for its upkeep.

A for-sale sign only went up the day before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform dragged General Services Administration officials into the musty structure for a hearing last summer. Rep. Jeff Denham, R-Calif., berated a bewildered GSA official at that hearing, saying: ""You can't get your job done! I don't care if it's a Republican or Democratic administration, the job is not getting done!""

Congressional frustration may be warranted. The federal government owns or leases between 55,000 and 77,000 vacant properties. But it's impossible to tell exactly how many. No precise inventory has been kept.

Selling them off, though, could save taxpayers between $3 billion and $8 billion a year, according to various analysts. That's nothing to scoff at as the government grapples with a mounting debt and sequester-tied spending cuts.

""These properties could be used first to consolidate agencies that now are in leased buildings,"" D.C. Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton told Fox News.

Tom Schatz, of Citizens Against Government Waste said: ""This is a problem that has been identified for years, and every time someone in the White House says 'let's sell property,' the red tape is simply too much for this process.""

In 1987, amid media coverage of the nation's persistent homeless problem, Congress passed a law that said unused government properties first had to be offered to other federal agencies, then to state agencies, and, as a last resort, for use as homeless shelters before they could be put on the market.

""We spend about 8 billion dollars a year maintaining properties that we have no use for. Now that 8 billion dollars is just thrown down the drain because we can't get past the homeless lobby to get a common-sense way to take care of their problems and also us to unload properties,"" Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., told Fox News.

Former Sen. Evan Bayh, D-Ind., notes that Congress is full of people who've never held private-sector jobs.""There is nothing wrong with that. But it means they have never really been in the position of running something, of making hard decisions, of having scarce resources and having to set priorities.""

Schatz echoes that sentiment -- noting the way the government handles the excess properties is counter to common sense. ""Rather than having the government get the first choice, the first choice should be to sell and then go back down the line. There are plenty of places for homeless shelters,"" he said.

Legislation to require the federal government to expedite the sale of underused properties died in the last Congress. It was resurrected this year in Republican Rep. Paul Ryan's proposed budget, which the Senate voted down this month.

But Norton has hopes Congress will begin to remedy the problem this year.""The Oversight and Government Reform committee has just passed again its bill which I think has a good chance of getting all the way to the Senate,"" she said.

Still, if Congress does pass a bill to sell excess properties, inventorying all of them would be a daunting undertaking given that they're spread across all government agencies."

They are among $25 billion of wasteful and duplicate spending targeted by the president's budget that will be released Wednesday, according to an administration official.

By cutting one of two catfish inspection programs at different federal agencies, for instance, the government could save some $14 million.

It's part of 215 proposals from Obama to save money by streamlining various federal programs. They include eliminating a redundant Air Force satellite system and also consolidating 220 science, technology, engineering and math programs across 13 agencies.

Separately, a report by the non-partisan Congressional watchdog, the U.S. Government Accountability Office, released Tuesday also identified 31 new areas of waste and duplication. The GAO said the government can save $82 million just by getting the different military departments to agree on one or two types of camouflage for their uniforms, instead of the current seven ""varying patterns and colors.""

Republicans, in particular, are interested in cutting waste, because they say it's key to buffering the $85 billion automatic, across-the-board budget cuts that kicked in on March 1.

The House Oversight Committee is holding a hearing Tuesday on the new GAO report. In recent years, the House has passed several bills that drastically slashes all kinds of spending. However, those bills have gone nowhere, because the Senate hasn't taken them up.

It's hard for Washington to cut waste, because every program has its own fan club.

In 2011, for instance, Obama suggested scrapping Voice of America's radio broadcast in China, because studies showed few people were listening. But House Republicans wanted to send the program an additional $14 million to keep it on air.

In 2012, GAO suggested $1.2 billion in savings by getting rid of federal crop insurance subsidies for rich farmers to reduce subsidies.

Rural lawmakers from both political parties said they were hesitant to limit such insurance, especially after a drought that ruined many crops in 2012. Last summer, the Senate took a symbolic step by passing a scaled back measure that trimmed crop insurance subsidies by 15% for farmers with $750,000 in total sales. But that too went nowhere,

The key reason why Washington has failed to slash spending for so long is the lack of an official budget. Congress hasn't worked together to pass an official budget in the past four years. Instead, Congress has resorted to passing short-term funding measures, often waiting until the very last minute. The government is currently operating on a budget measure that runs out on Sept. 30.

""Right now, we have budget-making by crisis, and it has to be a major crisis, like a debt ceiling or a government shutdown,"" said Patrick Lester, fiscal policy director for the Center for Effective Government, a watchdog group.

Traditionally that process starts in February, when the president proposes his budget to start Oct. 1. President Obama is nearly two months late in offering his budget, which doesn't give Congress a lot of time.

Despite the lack of an official budgetary process, some progress has been made to root out waste, GAO noted. The White House, executive agencies and Congress have adopted 21% of the 300 suggestions GAO has made in the past three years and ""made progress"" on about 51% of its recommendations."
