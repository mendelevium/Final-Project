The report by Iranian media recalled for many the early days of space flight, when both the United States and the Soviet Union launched animal-bearing spacecraft as a prelude to human space travel.

But State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland told reporters in Washington on Monday that the reported mission raises concerns about possible Iranian violations of a United Nations ban on development of ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons.

“If they have launched anything using ballistic missile technology, it’s of serious concern,” Nuland said.

There was no immediate comment from Tehran, which for some years has had a space exploration and satellite-launching program.

The West and Iran are at odds over Iran’s nuclear program, which Tehran says is strictly for peaceful uses, such as generation of energy and creation of cancer-treating isotopes. U.S. and Israeli officials suspect Iran wants to produce nuclear weapons.

Nuland said she could not confirm if the Iranian reports of successfully sending a primate into the atmosphere were true. “I saw the pictures of the poor little monkey preparing to go to space,” Nuland said.

[Updated 9:40 a.m. Jan. 29: Animal activists were also upset with the launch.

“We are appalled by photos of a visibly terrified monkey crudely strapped into a restraint device in which he was allegedly launched into space,” People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) said in a statement, calling Tehran’s action a throwback to the “cruelest days” of space exploration. “Monkeys are highly intelligent and sensitive animals who not only are traumatized by the violence and noise of a launch and landing but also suffer when caged in a laboratory before and — if they survive — after a flight.”]

Iran said its spacecraft — dubbed Pishgam, or Pioneer — was launched Sunday and took the primate-bearing capsule to a height of 72 miles, before the craft returned to Earth.

In a clip from Press TV, Iran’s English-language service, a helicopter is seen apparently bringing the space capsule back to a site in central Iran where cheering scientists awaited its return. In footage shown on Iranian television, ecstatic scientists hugged each other and shouted, “Long live Iran!”

The Iranian press carried several photos and video clips of the monkey. In one shot, it is seen in the arms of a glove-wearing scientist, apparently after returning to Earth. In another, it is seen strapped into a car seat-like contraption, evidently designed for the trip aloft. The animal is also seen swaddled in a green blanket and seemingly befuddled about all the attention.

Iranian officials lauded the flight as a bringing the nation closer to human space travel.

“Sending a spacecraft and returning it is a first step toward sending humans to space in later stages,” Iran’s defense minister, Brig. Gen. Ahmad Vahidi, told Press TV.

The space-bound monkey was placed in a sealed capsule equipped with machinery to produce oxygen and absorb carbon dioxide, Iranian Space Agency Director Hamid Fazeli told Press TV.

“This kind of monkey’s physiology is very similar to humans,” Fazeli noted, without identifying what species of money was recruited for the mission. “We are [using] this monkey to test life support systems and flight conditions.”

The animal’s vital signs were to be monitored and transmitted to Earth, the Iranian space chief said, while cameras inside the cabin recorded the event.

Almost two years ago, Iranian press reports noted, Iran sent a “bio-capsule” containing a turtle, a mouse, worms and live bacteria into the heavens and successfully returned the menagerie back to Earth alive.

For all the global attention, and controversy, the simian sojourn did not create a lot of buzz inside Iran, where the ongoing economic crisis is the nation’s major preoccupation.

“It is something to be proud of,” agreed Sohrab Ahmadi, a technology student, who voiced the hope that such projects could create more jobs in science. He said he was in favor of “any way we can get financial help in this field from government.”

Less impressed was Salar Mirzaei, a chemistry engineering student. “For me,” Mirzaei said, “economic achievement and ... increasing purchasing power is more important than sending monkeys into space.”

Although Mr. Obama claimed the power to attack Syria on his own, just as Mr. Clinton did with Iraq, he sought authorization from lawmakers anyway on the theory that a unified front would be stronger. Instead, he found that the more he argued for a strike, the more polls showed him losing public support and the more certain defeat on Capitol Hill became.

For the moment, aides say it is still Mr. Obama’s position to have Congress sign off on any military operation if the Russian-American disarmament agreement collapses. But senior lawmakers have told the White House that it cannot win such a vote, and some outside advisers said Mr. Obama should skip Congress if the Russian gambit fails.

“Plan B needs to be carrying out strikes” and “probably avoiding a vote on the Hill,” said Dennis B. Ross, a Middle East expert who has advised Mr. Obama. “To have the diplomatic initiative fail and not carry out strikes would certainly make it hard to convince anyone that our words mean anything.”

Colin Kahl, a former Pentagon official under Mr. Obama, said a “credible threat of military force needs to be left on the table” and suggested the president might seek a conditional measure authorizing action if Syria reneges. “If there was widespread support for that sort of contingent authorization, I think they would go ahead and move forward with it,” Mr. Kahl said. “But otherwise, I think there’s a possibility that they wouldn’t” go back to Congress.

Yet having asked Congress once to weigh in, Mr. Obama would be hard pressed to explain why he would now bypass it. The criteria he set for requesting a Congressional vote — a situation that was not an imminent or a direct threat to the United States — would still apply. Some allies believe that could leave him more politically isolated than if he had never asked in the first place.

Some Democrats said Mr. Obama might be bolstered in Congress if the Russian initiative did not work. “I would say that actually strengthens the president’s hand coming back to Congress because he’s able to say, ‘All right, I walked the extra mile you asked me to even though it was a little embarrassing. I did what you asked me to do,’ ” said Representative Gerald E. Connolly, a Virginia Democrat.

But lawmakers and aides in both parties said Mr. Obama has so little support for a strike that it might not make a difference. They said they saw no chance that Mr. Obama would prevail in the House, and he might even lose in the Senate, where Democrats have a majority. Yet it would be hard to “un-ring the bell,” as one Congressional aide put it, and act without Congress, having asked once."

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/09/04/Exclusive-Rep-Yoho-Obama-s-credibility-not-America-s-credibility-at-risk-in-Syrian-situation,2013-09-04 00:00:00,['Matthew Boyle'],"Exclusive — Rep. Yoho: Obama's Credibility, Not America's, at Risk in Syria","Rep. Ted Yoho (R-FL), a member of the House Foreign Relations Committee, told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview on Wednesday morning that it is President Barack Obama’s credibility that is at risk with regard the situation in Syria, not the credibility of America.

Yoho said America’s credibility does not lie solely with the president’s statements and actions. “You have the military’s credibility, and then you have the U.S. government’s credibility,” Yoho said. “I don’t think anybody in the world disputes our credibility of our military. When you go back to the Persian Gulf War, where for CNN it was the first time they broadcasted a war live, and Bernard Shaw was giving you play-by-play bombing descriptions and then you had the Iraq war, the shock and awe that we watched on TV. We hunted down Saddam Hussein, and then we hunted down Osama bin Laden. So I don’t think our credibility of our military is in question at all.”

Really, Yoho said, it is the credibility of the president that is in question. “It’s going back to the red line,” he said. “Not saying, first off, what was said shouldn’t have been said. You don’t make veiled threats, I’ve learned in life. I don’t make threats, I make promises. And you stand by your promises. Your word is your bond. Unfortunately, I think the president spoke out of turn here. Again, I think there’s a better [way] to handle this and it should be through diplomacy. I would wait until the U.N. report came out to verify 100 percent that it was Sarin gas because there is still controversy over that and there is still controversy over who launched it.”

Yoho points to the president’s comments on the world stage on Wednesday in Sweden where he says he did not draw a “red line” in Syria. “First of all, I didn’t set a red line,” Obama said on Wednesday. “The world set a red line. The world set a red line when governments representing 98 percent of the world’s population said the use of chemical weapons are [inaudble] and passed a treaty forbidding their use, even when countries are engaged in war. Congress set a red line when it ratified that treaty. Congress set a red line when it indicated that in a piece of legislation entitled the Syria Accountability Act that some of the horrendous things happening on the ground there need to be answered for. So, when I said in a press conference that my calculus about what’s happening in Syria would be altered by the use of chemical weapons, which the overwhelming consensus of humanity says is wrong, that wasn’t something I just kind of made up. I didn’t pluck it out of thin air. There’s a reason for it.”

That is a direct contradiction to what Obama said back over a year ago, in which he refers to a “red line” he was drawing in Syria. A backgrounder on the White House website includes several references to how President Obama did indeed “set a red line.”

Yoho said that President Obama’s foreign policies are in jeopardy because of his credibility issues on the world stage. “I think the lack of credibility you’re seeing in the U.S. foreign policy reflects right back to the unsuredness of the president’s word and the message coming out of our administration,” Yoho said. “He drew a red line. We all know he drew a red line. And now he’s saying he didn’t draw a red line.”

Yoho points to Egypt and to Benghazi as examples of where Obama’s foreign policy credibility is lacking.

“The military coup in Egypt, which I firmly believe it is–if you look at the definition of a coup, it’s relinquishing of your power without your approval by a military and then to be put under house arrest–and yet our president doesn’t call it a coup because of the ramifications of having cut off military aid?” Yoho said. “His message has been inconsistent. It usually comes out after the fact, what he meant to say. This hurts our credibility. This even goes back to Benghazi. When Ms. Clinton said what difference does it make, the difference is this: If we lie to the American people, about the cause of a terrorist act saying it was a video, when we know the facts and I think you’ll see in our hearings, how can you expect another country or ally to take you at your word?”

When asked if the only people in the country who really want to go to war with Syria are those in the political class in Washington, D.C., Yoho said “I think you’re probably about 100 percent right on that.”

“If we look at the phone calls and the letters we get and the personal contact, I’m going to say 90 to 95 percent are saying ‘stay out of Syria,'” he said. “I represent my constituents in North Central Florida, and I’m not going to support this.”

While he thinks that the Obama administration has taken its foreign policy too far into the realm of failure, Yoho thinks the problem has its roots in Washington as far back as a few decades ago. That said, though, Yoho thinks this is an opportunity for America to lead again.

“Our foreign policy has really been lost in this administration, but I’ll say this: our foreign policy in the Middle East over the last 30 to 35 years has really been off track,” Yoho said. “This is a perfect opportunity for us to lead and get people to the negotiation table. Of all the countries that signed the CWC [Chemical Weapons Convention] accord, there’s 189 of us, we need to have 189 at the table including all the Arab League countries and the U.N. on one side of the table, and Mr. Assad on the other side and we need to have a diplomatic solution to this. The thing I was encouraged with today was Russia’s president [Vladimir] Putin said that he would look at the evidence and if it was conclusive he would stand with us. I think that’s monumental because if he can do that, China can do it. And Iran also signed the CWC. With China and Russia putting pressure on them, it is possible that they could come to the table and tell Mr. Assad to stop. That would be diplomacy at its finest and I think it would reset our foreign policy and our way to handle it.”

Yoho said this situation reminds him somewhat of Iraq, where Colin Powell had sold everyone on how Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD’s) were definitely there. “We don’t want to make that mistake again,” he said. “If you go back to the CWC accords, it says any country that produces, stockpiles, transfers or sells or uses chemical weapons are in violation of that treaty. So does that mean now that if we know North Korea has it, we go in there? Or what about Iran that is supposedly developing a nuclear weapon? Where do you draw the line? Do you act in totality? Or do you just say we’re just going to go after Syria? I think it’s a very dangerous precedent to start because this could be a prelude to start saying ‘Well, North Korea has this and Iran has this, so we should attack them too.’ I know the American people won’t stand for that and I won’t stand for it and I think there’s a better way we can do this.”

Congress could step up and lead America out of this situation, Yoho added, but currently congressional leadership of both parties are jumping in to help the president. House Speaker John Boehner and Majority Leader Eric Cantor, as well Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, have all thrown their weight behind Obama. “Our country is starved for leadership and selling what’s best for America,” Yoho said. “If things are best for America, I think the world benefits from that. There’s no doubt in my mind. I know Americans will grow a stronger and bigger America. We’ll be more competitive. The middle class will grow. That’s the stuff we need to focus on, not focusing on another war. That is just absolutely crazy. Keep in mind, we’re broke. We don’t have the money to do this. If China gets involved because they said they don’t want us involved, and we’re running out of money, well, who are we going to borrow money from? China? I mean, we need to stay home and take care of our own. Let’s work through this diplomatically, which I don’t feel like we’ve done a strong enough job in that yet.”

Instead of getting involved in another country’s civil war where there has been no clear and present threat to America’s national security or the security of America’s allies presented thus far, Yoho thinks the U.S. government should focus more on solving domestic problems and taking care of Americans first. “I’ve only been here a little over seven or eight months,” he said. “What I saw was a broken system. I saw crisis management. They go from one frying pan into the next, instead of long-term planning. We’ve now taken the focus off immigration, we’ve taken the focus off our debt ceiling, we’ve taken the focus off Social Security and Medicare, and we have the Obama healthcare bill coming out that needs to be repealed 100 percent. That’s going to be a disaster. We’re at $17 trillion in debt and that bill will increase our spending $2 trillion to start with and that’s just the beginning. Social Security is going broke and Medicare is going broke and we’re talking about going to another war? I mean this is ludicrous.”"

(CNN) – Two of President Barack Obama's White House predecessors offered their views of his impending decision on Syria Friday as global support for strikes in the country faltered.

Former President George W. Bush, in an interview, said Obama has a ""touch choice to make"" on potential U.S. military action against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who is accused of using chemical weapons against civilians.



""If he decides to use our military, he'll have the greatest military ever backing him up,"" Bush said in an appearance on Fox News.

The United States and major allies are currently weighing major military action against Assad, though on Thursday British lawmakers voted against joining a global coalition. U.S. officials said after the vote that taking unilateral action against Syria was a possibility.

That option, former President Jimmy Carter said Friday, would be a grave mistake.

""A punitive military response without a U.N. Security Council mandate or broad support from NATO and the Arab League would be illegal under international law and unlikely to alter the course of the war,"" he wrote in a statement. ""It will only harden existing positions and postpone a sorely needed political process to put an end to the catastrophic violence.""

Carter, in his post-presidency, has engaged in global diplomacy in North Korea and the Middle East, and was a vocal critic of the Iraq War.

In his statement, Carter said the use of chemical weapons in Syria was a ""a grave breach of international law"" but that any U.S. action in the country should wait for ongoing investigations by United Nations inspectors to conclude.

""All should seek to leverage the consensus among the entire international community, including Russia and Iran, condemning the use of chemical weapons in Syria and bringing under U.N. oversight the country's stockpile of such weapons,"" he wrote.

Bush, in the Friday interview, was less forthcoming in his views on Syria. A Republican, he led the United States into two wars during his presidency: in Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003. Many say those wars, particularly in Iraq, have contributed to nationwide war fatigue. A poll released Friday showed half of Americans oppose potential U.S. military action in Syria, though support increased when possible action was limited to cruise missile strikes.

On Wednesday, Bush's Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said Obama had yet to fully justify any military action in Syria. Rumsfeld led the Pentagon during the invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq.

""There really hasn't been any indication from the administration as to what our national interest is with respect to this particular situation,"" he said. ""When you think about what's really important in that region – it's Iran's nuclear program and the relationship between Iran and Syria, the Assad regime, with respect to terrorists that go around killing innocent men, women and children, including Americans.""

Bush said Friday he was ""not a fan"" of Assad.

""He's an ally of Iran, he's made mischief,"" he said, declining to speculate any further about the decisions currently looming over the White House.

Bush, who earlier this month underwent a procedure to have a stent placed in his heart, appeared healthy during the interview and said he was feeling ""pretty good."" He was interviewed at the Dallas National Gold Club, where he was helping launch a gold tournament that raises money for veterans.

""I wish I was a teenager so I could be out on my mountain bike today,"" he said. ""But I'm slowly recovering."""

She Covered The Hillary Clinton Campaign']",U.S. official: Benghazi assault appeared to be ‘terrorist attack from the get-go’,"The deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Libya during a 2012 attack on a diplomatic outpost in Benghazi told investigators he thought it was a terrorist strike from the beginning, according to interview excerpts released Sunday on CBS News’s “Face the Nation.”

“I thought it was a terrorist attack from the get-go. I think everybody in the mission thought it was a terrorist attack from the beginning,” Gregory Hicks said in an interview with investigators shared with “Face the Nation.” The excerpt was one of several host Bob Schieffer revealed on the program.

Hicks is one of the witnesses called to testify this week before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform about the Sept. 11, 2012, attack that killed Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans.

Shortly after the attack, U.N. Ambassador Susan E. Rice characterized the assault as a spontaneous attack. The Obama administration later said it was an act of terrorism.

“Clearly, there was a political decision to say something different than what was reasonable to say,” House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) said on “Face the Nation.”

According to the excerpts of his interview with investigators, Hicks said that the morning after Rice’s Sunday show appearances he called Acting Assistant Secretary for Near Eastern Affairs Elizabeth Jones to ask why Rice had said that. Hicks said Jones told him she didn’t know.

This week’s hearing is expected to focus on claims in a Republican committee report that the State Department massaged public statements about the attack to eliminate or play down the likelihood of a terrorist connection.

That long-standing GOP claim may be better supported by documents the committee reviewed in recent months that chart the changes in language over several days following the attack.

Republicans are also focusing on the scope and mandate of an independent review of the attack by a panel appointed by the State Department amid accusations that potential witnesses were excluded from the review.

State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell said that the review was comprehensive and that decisions about whom to interview were made by the outside review board, not the department."

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Here’s what Obama said in remarks to a Belfast town hall meeting with Protestant and Catholic youngsters:

“Because issues like segregated schools and housing, lack of jobs and opportunity -- symbols of history that are a source of pride for some and pain for others -- these are not tangential to peace; they’re essential to it. If towns remain divided -- if Catholics have their schools and buildings, and Protestants have theirs -- if we can’t see ourselves in one another, if fear or resentment are allowed to harden, that encourages division. It discourages cooperation.”

On the TownHall.com website, Carol Platt Liebau complained that Obama “chose to analogize education by Catholics and Protestants to segregation” in his remarks at a Belfast meeting with youngsters.

Liebau continued: “Of course, it’s ironic that the most divisive president in American history should go to Ireland and condemn division. But it also raises questions: Does this signal hostility to Catholic education in America -- or hostility to religious education in general? It’s clear -- from his Obamacare abortifacient/contraceptive mandate to his efforts to cut charitable deductions -- that the president sees government as the only really legitimate actor in civil society. But his willingness to characterize education by religious orders as enabling division and discord is an unpleasant reminder of his hostility to any social force with potential to check the power of Big Government.”

Put aside the wing-nut notion that Obama is the “most divisive president in American history.” Was he disparaging Catholic schools in general or equating them with racially segregated schools (Liebau’s clear implication)?

I don’t think so.

Context matters here. Northern Ireland is not the United States. Even in my childhood, when Catholic kids were encouraged to attend Catholic schools and there was an arguably Protestant ethos in many public schools, Catholics and Protestants weren’t as isolated from (or as distrustful of) one another in this country as they continue to be in Northern Ireland.

Today, thanks to Vatican II and the relentless asssimilation of Catholics, it’s common for Catholics to attend public schools (where teachers no longer recite from the Protestant King James Bible). But it is also common for Protestants, Jews and others to attend Catholic schools. And a lot of children, Catholic and non-Catholic, will attend both public and Catholic schools over the course of their education.

Society in Northern Ireland is much more stratified, and the role of religiously defined schools more problematic. You can be perfectly comfortable with the role of Catholic schools in the American context and worry about their contribution to estrangement between Protestants and Catholics in Northern Ireland.

As for the notion that Obama is hostile to private schools with a religious character, that seems unlikely. His own children attend the Sidwell Friends School, a Quaker institution. Of course, Obama’s detractors will say that simply proves he’s a hypocrite.

Congressional conservatives and the right-wing media are blasting President Obama for going soft on the Syrians.

The president insists that there is a “game-changing” red line the Syrian government will have crossed if it is found to have used chemical weapons against its people, but he has bent the red line so far, the hawks say, that not only the Syrians, but the Iranians and North Koreans will conclude Obama is a man with a marshmallow spine whose warnings can be flouted with impunity.

The president has, indeed, added more caveats to his tough talk. In his news conference on Tuesday, the president said if rock-solid proof is found that a gas attack has taken place he would “rethink” what to do next, choosing from an unspecified range of punitive options that might not include military action.

His line got more elastic after last week’s ominous but rubbery announcement that U.S. intelligence agencies have found evidence of a possible use of the nerve gas sarin -- somewhere, sometime, against somebody in Syria, “with some degree of varying confidence” (in the words of Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel).

Though equivocal, that finding is evidence enough for the hawks who long for a much more resolute president in the mold of George W. Bush. Bush, under the sway of his very hawkish, neoconservative advisors, seized on a bushel of bad intelligence to justify the invasion of Iraq in 2003.

Obama wisely, and necessarily, is taking a much more cautious approach, clearly reluctant to go before the international community without unimpeachable evidence against the Syrian regime. He knows he is facing a skeptical world that has a vivid memory of the very impeachable evidence the Bush team used to sell a war to the United Nations. Syria’s chemical weapons need to be proved much more real than Saddam Hussein’s phantom weapons of mass destruction.

“If we end up rushing to judgment without hard, effective evidence, then we may find ourselves in the position where we can’t mobilize the international community to support what we do,” Obama told reporters.

Even if such evidence can be provided, there is still the hard question of what to do in response. Having spent a decade fighting two wars in the Middle East with dubious results, there are not many Americans beyond Senate hawks such as Lindsey Graham, Saxby Chambliss and John McCain who are itching to jump into one more tangled, vicious conflict in yet another Muslim country.

Sure, Syrian President Bashar Assad and his thuggish cronies are nasty people who have oppressed and killed thousands of their countrymen. And it is true the Syrian civil war has turned vast numbers of people into refugees. And, yes, there are probably true democrats and liberty lovers among the anti-Assad rebels who deserve help in their fight. But the rebels also include a disturbing number of Islamic militants who, if they gain power, would be as ruthless and undemocratic as Assad.

Graham, the South Carolina Republican who has been most vocal in calling Obama a foreign policy weakling, acknowledges that it’s a tricky situation. His solution to dealing with the rebels is to “give the right arms to the right people” and “to be ready to fight two wars” -- one against Assad and the other against the Islamist rebel faction. Lest that sound too much like a quagmire, Graham adds that it can be done without “boots on the ground.”

If that is what passes for a plan of action from the hawks, we can be grateful that the president is looking for other options. It is worth remembering that not too many years ago we armed a rebel army in Afghanistan to drive out the Soviets. After the Soviets were gone, a large share of those rebels became the Taliban.

We still have “boots on the ground” fighting them today."

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea on Thursday warned of an unspecified ""grave measure"" if North Korea rejects a call for talks on a jointly run factory park that has been closed for nearly a month.

In a televised briefing with reporters, Unification Ministry spokesman Kim Hyung-suk refused to describe what Seoul would do if Pyongyang doesn't respond by a deadline Friday to a demand for formal working-level talks on the industrial complex just over the heavily armed border in the North Korean town of Kaesong.

But Seoul may be signaling it will pull out its remaining workers from the factory across the border in Kaesong. That could lead to the end of a complex considered the last remaining symbol of inter-Korean cooperation.

As animosity rose between the Koreas early this month, North Korea barred South Koreans from crossing the border and entering the factory. It later suspended operations and withdrew the 53,000 North Korean workers who manned assembly lines there. Pyongyang hasn't forced South Koreans to leave and about 175 are still there.

The factory has operated with South Korean know-how and technology and cheap labor from North Korea since 2004. It is a hold-over from an era that saw the Koreas try to cooperate through various projects.

For several weeks, until recently, North Korea issued a steady stream of criticism and threats aimed at Seoul and Washington, expressing anger over ongoing U.S.-South Korean military drills that the North calls invasion preparations and U.N. sanctions over its February nuclear test. Pyongyang has recently eased its rhetoric, but tensions between the rivals are still high.

As Some South Korean businesses have been quietly mulling giving up on Kaesong altogether.

""Our people are suffering serious difficulties due to the shortage of food and medicines and our companies are suffering big damages and pains,"" Kim said.

To resolve deadlocked operations at Kaesong, Kim said North Korea should first allow some South Koreans to cross the border to hand over food and medicine to the remaining managers at Kaesong.

South Korea on Wednesday proposed talks between the head of a South Korean management office at Kaesong and the North's General Bureau for Central Guidance to the Development of the Special Zone, but the North rebuffed the offer, Kim said.

""It's very regrettable for North Korea to reject (taking) the minimum humanitarian measures for our workers at the Kaesong industrial complex,"" he said."

The U.S. servicemembers were killed on Saturday by a roadside bomb

It%27s the latest attack against NATO troops since Taliban announced spring offensive

The coalition did not disclose the location of the blast

KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — Seven U.S. service members were killed on Saturday in one of the deadliest days for Americans in Afghanistan in recent months, as the Taliban continued attacks against foreign troops as part of their spring offensive.

The renewed violence came as Afghan President Hamid Karzai acknowledged at a news conference that regular payments his government has received from the CIA for more than a decade would continue. Karzai also said that talks on a U.S.-Afghan bilateral security agreement to govern future American military presence in the country had been delayed because of conditions the Afghans were placing on the deal.

The U.S.-led coalition reported that five international troops were killed by a roadside bomb in southern Afghanistan, and coalition spokesman Capt. Luca Carniel confirmed that all five were American.

The coalition did not disclose the location of the roadside bombing. However, Javeed Faisal, a spokesman for the governor of Kandahar province, said the coalition patrol hit the bomb in the Maiwand district of the province, the spiritual birthplace of the Taliban.

Later, the coalition reported that a soldier with the Afghan National Army turned his weapon on coalition troops in the west, killing two in the most recent of so-called insider attacks. Such attacks by members of the Afghan security forces against their fellow colleagues or international troops have eroded confidence in the Afghan forces as they work to take over from foreign forces.

Both killed were American, according to two U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to disclose the nationalities ahead of an official announcement.

It was the fourth time since last summer that seven Americans have been killed on a single day in the war.

On March 12, a Black Hawk helicopter crashed outside Kandahar, killing five U.S. troops. Two more U.S. troops were killed that day by an insider attack.

And on April 6, Afghan militants killed six Americans, including a young female diplomat, and an Afghan doctor in a pair of attacks in southern Afghanistan. The three U.S. service members, two U.S. civilians and the doctor were killed when the group was struck by an explosion while traveling to donate books to a school. A seventh American, a civilian, was killed in a separate insurgent attack in the east.

On Aug. 16, 2012, seven American service members were killed in two attacks in Kandahar province. Six were killed when their helicopter was shot down by insurgents and one soldier died in a roadside bomb explosion.

At the news conference, Karzai said he had met earlier in the day with the Kabul station chief of the CIA and was reassured that the agency's payments to the Afghan government would continue. The New York Times had reported that for more than a decade, the CIA had given the Afghan National Security Council tens of millions of dollars in monthly payments delivered in suitcases, backpacks and plastic shopping bags.

Karzai said he told the station chief: ""'Because of all these rumors in the media, please do not cut all this money because we really need it. We want to continue this sort of assistance.' And he promised that they are not going to cut this money.""

Karzai described the payments as a form of ""government-to-government"" assistance, and while he wouldn't say how much the CIA gave to the National Directorate of Security, which is the Afghan intelligence service, he said the financial help was very useful. He claimed that much of the money was used to care for wounded employees of the NDS, Afghanistan's intelligence service, and operational expenses.

""We have spent it in different areas (and) solved lots of our problems,"" Karzai said.

He said the CIA payments were made in cash and that ""all the money which we have spent, receipts have been sent back to the intelligence service of the United States monthly.""

The CIA declined to comment on Saturday.

During the news conference at the presidential palace, Karzai also discussed ongoing negotiations on a U.S.-Afghan bilateral security agreement. He said talks had been delayed because of certain conditions that Afghanistan was insisting be included in the pact, which will govern a U.S. military presence after 2014 when nearly all foreign combat troops are to have finished their withdrawal from Afghanistan. The talks, which started in late 2012, are set to last up to a year.

President Barack Obama has not said how many troops will remain, although there have been estimates ranging from 8,000 to 12,000. It is unlikely such an announcement will be made until the security agreement is signed. Those troops would help train Afghan forces and also carry out operations against al-Qaida and other militant groups.

Karzai said Afghanistan was ready to sign a deal as long as the American government in exchange for being able to stay on bases in the country agrees to terms of Afghan security, funding assistance and help with training and equipping Afghan security forces. It is thought that the contentious issue of providing U.S. troops immunity from Afghan law is a low priority for the Afghan government in the negotiations.

The Afghan government has not said how much rent it would want for three or four U.S. bases, but it is believed to be in the billions. Afghanistan is also thought to be seeking security guarantees to protect its porous borders, including the frontier with Pakistan that is the main infiltration route for insurgents who retain sanctuary in Pakistan's lawless tribal areas.

It was unclear how Karzai expected the United States or any of its allies to guarantee Afghanistan's borders against attack."

""It's sort of a cartoonish impression of military capabilities and military forces,"" he said. ""The one thing that our forces are noted for is planning and preparation before we send people in harm's way, and there just wasn't time to do that.""

""Frankly, had I been in the job at the time, I think my decisions would have been just as theirs were.""

""We don't have a ready force standing by in the Middle East, and so getting somebody there in a timely way would have been very difficult, if not impossible.""

""I would not have approved sending an aircraft, a single aircraft, over Benghazi under those circumstances.""

""Send some small number of special forces or other troops in without knowing what the environment is, without knowing what the threat is, without having any intelligence in terms of what is actually going on on the ground, would have been very dangerous.""

""Why should it be us?"" Gates asked. If anything, he said, we could carefully select elements in Syria who align with American values and interests and ""provide them with intelligence, with basic military equipment."" ""But I think our direct involvement and particularly our direct military involvement would be a mistake.""

2. Regarding how he would have handled the attack if he was in charge:3. Regarding why we didn't send in some ready forces:4.

Story highlights NEW: Crowds and news crews stand outside the hospital overnight Mandela's family visits his bedside Officials say Mandela's condition has worsened in the past day Health won't affect President Obama's visit this week, South Africa's president says

(CNN) —

Throughout the night, crowds of people stood outside the hospital where former South African President Nelson Mandela is being treated, and among the balloons, posters and cards early Tuesday were dozens of news crews and broadcast vans.

More than 40 vehicles crowded the parking spaces outside the Medi-Clinic Heart Hospital in Pretoria, the South African Press Association reported. Generators hummed and the area was brightly lit for the news organizations doing regular live broadcasts.

Mandela’s daughter Makaziwe Mandela left the hospital Monday night, SAPA reported. Other family members, including ex-wife Winnie Madikizela-Mandela and daughters Zindzi Mandela-Motlhajwa and Zenani Mandela-Dlamini, left earlier in the day.

Government officials paid visits as well.

Mandela’s wife, Graca Machel, spends every night at the hospital, where the former president has been since June 8 for a recurring lung infection. Previously, authorities had described his condition as serious but stable.

But over the weekend, his health took a turn for the worse, with the South African president’s office saying he was in critical condition.

“The doctors are doing everything possible to ensure his well-being and comfort,” President Jacob Zuma told the nation Monday.

The former president’s health will not affect U.S. President Barack Obama’s planned visit to the country this week, Zuma said, according to the press association.

Mandela, 94, has become increasingly frail over the years and has not appeared in public since South Africa hosted the World Cup in 2010.

Outside the hospital Monday, a security wall was awash with get-well cards, balloons, flowers, cards and paintings, the press association reported.

Ready for the spiritual realm

For Mandela’s family, these are very personal times – times to be cherished as the end nears.

“I believe he is at peace,” said Makaziwe Mandela, who was born in 1953 to Mandela’s first wife, Evelyn.

“All we do every day is take one day at a time and pray to the good Lord,” Makaziwe told CNN’s Robyn Curnow.

“All I pray for as a daughter is that the transition is smooth. … He is at peace with himself. He has given so much to the world.”

In and out of hospital

The anti-apartheid hero has been in and out of the hospital in recent years.

His history of lung problems dates to when he was a political prisoner on Robben Island during the apartheid era, and he has battled respiratory infections since.

Considered the founding father of South Africa’s democracy, Mandela became an international figure while enduring 27 years in prison for fighting against apartheid, the country’s system of racial segregation.

South Africa’s governing African National Congress noted “with concern” Sunday the change in Mandela’s health.

“The African National Congress joins the presidency in calling upon all of us to keep President Mandela, his family and his medical team in our thoughts and prayers during this trying time,” it said.

A Nobel laureate

In 1993, Mandela and then-South African President F.W. de Klerk jointly won the Nobel Peace Prize.

The iconic leader was elected the nation’s first black president a year later, serving only one term, as he had promised.

Even as he has faded from the spotlight, he remains popular and is considered a hero of democracy in the nation. Last year, South Africa launched a new batch of banknotes with a picture of a smiling Mandela on the front.

His impact extends far beyond South Africa. After he left office, he mediated conflicts in Africa and the Middle East.

Word of his worsening health drew global expressions of concern.

“We have seen the latest reports from the South African government that former President Mandela is in critical condition,” Caitlin Hayden, a U.S. National Security Council spokeswoman, said in a statement Sunday. “Our thoughts and prayers are with him, his family and the people of South Africa.”

The unnamed shooter, profiled in a recent Esquire cover story that describes a post-military life without a pension or timely disability benefits, met with lawmakers Tuesday to discuss veteran’s care.

The SEAL, who didn’t qualify for a pension or health benefits for his family because he retired four years earlier than the Navy’s 20-year threshold, met with Sen. Bernard Sanders (I-Vt.), chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs.

The SEAL’s disability claim with the military is reportedly caught up in a backlog with about 900,000 veterans who have to wait, on average, more than nine months for a determination on their claims.

“The fellow who killed Osama bin Laden is one of many people who are having these problems. It helps spotlight these problems,” Sanders told the Los Angeles Times on Wednesday, declining to go into detail about the meeting with the shooter, who has been worried about retaliation from Al Qaeda.

“He is one of 900,000, and he deserves justice, and those 900,000 deserve justice too,” said Sanders, who plans to hold hearings about the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs backlog, which he called “my highest priority.”

The Center for Investigative Reporting, which co-published the story with Esquire and whose executive chairman, Phil Bronstein, wrote the piece, said on its website that the SEAL met with nine lawmakers from both parties Tuesday, along with a contingent that included Bronstein, representatives from Esquire and the SEAL’s former mentor.

“The Shooter is not as large as I expected,” Esquire editor David Granger wrote in a blog post. “He’s one of those guys who is sneaky big. He doesn’t stand out. In a suit, you can’t see his tattoos and you don’t realize how solid he is until you stand next to him.”

Granger reported that the SEAL told each legislator about “the lack of action” in providing protection for his family and that “the Shooter and the members of the group accompanying him presented the legislators with a three-part proposal for easing the transition out of the military for elite forces that would require no legislation.”

Those requests included a tiered pension plan that would begin after five years of duty, improved transition services for retiring veterans that include 18 months of total family healthcare, and departure pay based on length and type of service, according to Granger.

“It went really well,” the SEAL told Bronstein, who attended the meetings in his capacity as a journalist, according to the Center for Investigative Reporting. “I think we raised awareness. Now it’s just a question of acting.”

According to Bronstein’s original story, the SEAL had suffered from suicidal thoughts and a broken marriage, which were described as common among SEAL operatives. In an interview with “PBS NewsHour,” Bronstein described the SEAL’s financial situation as “not broke ... but insecure.”

Bronstein’s profile also initially claimed, falsely, that the SEAL got “nothing” from the government in retirement when all Iraq and Afghanistan veterans actually qualify for five years of health benefits. That claim drew private grumbles from officials in the Navy and the Department of Veterans Affairs.

Esquire also had to draw back an attack it made in a blog post against a Stars and Stripes reporter who had questioned the story’s healthcare claim -- a claim the magazine later was forced to correct.

Those initial waves of criticism may recede as attention turns to the government’s care of special forces operators, which the military has heavily relied upon for precise, dangerous fieldwork during years of unconventional warfare.

Gawker’s Tom Scocca, who criticized Esquire’s handling and framing of the story, wrote, “It does seem stupid and indefensible that this is our national policy -- that after years and years in the most dangerous combat zones, constantly risking physical and mental health, a SEAL should have to clock his full 20, same as a deskbound clerk.”

Eve Burton, a senior vice president of Hearst Corp., Esquire’s publisher, also attended the congressional meetings Tuesday, a Hearst spokesman said.

“The Navy SEAL in the Esquire article has come forward in an effort to assist all our special forces, who are American heroes often unknown to the public, to get the benefits and assistance they need to transition back to civilian life,” Burton told the Center for Investigative Reporting.

Perhaps in spite of military officials’ wishes -- and in spite of the Navy SEALs’ creed, which states, “I do not advertise the nature of my work, nor seek recognition for my actions” -- the as-yet-unnamed shooter joins a coterie of other special forces veterans who have refashioned their secret experiences for mass media.

Another SEAL Team 6 member on the mission to kill Bin Laden, Matt Bissonnette, saw his name go public just days after publishing a firsthand account of the attack in “No Easy Day” under a pen name.

SEAL veteran Chris Kyle was killed at a shooting range after publishing a memoir about his time as a spectacularly lethal sniper in Iraq, which also chronicled his psychological struggles after returning home from war. His accused killer, Eddie Ray Routh, a Marine reservist, had also been reportedly diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, and Kyle’s death has since become a rallying cry for PTSD awareness.

Press Secretary Jay Carney was asked at the daily briefing about Obama's repeated claim -- which he asserted most recently during a speech in Tennessee on Tuesday -- that Washington is getting distracted by phony scandals. Asked what the president was referring to, Carney listed the scandals over the IRS targeting of conservative groups and over Benghazi.

""What we've seen, as time has passed and more facts have become known, whether it's about the attacks in Benghazi and the talking points or revelations about conduct at the IRS, that attempts to turn this into a scandal have failed,"" Carney said.

Carney was specifically referring to claims by GOP lawmakers that the administration misled the public about the nature of the attack, by stressing the connection to an anti-Islam film. The administration denies this. But lawmakers continue to have concerns that extend far beyond the so-called Benghazi talking points.

Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., in an interview with Fox News, called the administration's latest comments unacceptable.

More On This...

""His recently calling these phony scandals, that, to me, is incredibly wrong. It's misleading to the American people,"" she said.

Specifically, lawmakers on Wednesday renewed their concerns -- in a letter to the newly confirmed FBI director -- about the status of the investigation into the attack.

Eight Republican lawmakers, voicing frustration about the seemingly slow pace of the investigation 10 months after the Sept. 11 attacks, were sending the letter to James Comey, demanding he make the Benghazi probe a priority. Comey was confirmed on Monday to replace Robert Mueller at the helm of the FBI.

Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, who started the letter along with Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told Fox News that the FBI is failing to interview key people connected with the militant group Ansar al-Sharia.

""Our FBI has never talked to these people, and that's just wholly unacceptable,"" Chaffetz said.

""This is a pathetic effort to bring people to justice,"" Graham said, in a separate interview with Fox News.

In the draft letter, the lawmakers ask for a status report within 30 days.

""Rumors continue to swirl about the whereabouts of suspects involved in the attack. The FBI continues to add pictures of potential assailants to its website and asks the Libyan people to assist with identifying the alleged perpetrators. We struggle to understand why we don't know more about those who attacked two U.S. compounds and murdered four brave Americans,"" they wrote.

""It has been more than 10 months since the attacks. We appear to be no closer to knowing who was responsible today than we were in the early weeks following the attack. This is simply unacceptable. We encourage you to be aggressive in your investigation to properly hold accountable those who attacked our compounds in Benghazi.""

Obama administration officials have tried to assuage lawmakers' lingering concerns and questions about the Benghazi attack, including over allegations that the administration misled the public about the nature of the assault last September. But lawmakers have also grown increasingly frustrated over the fact that nobody has been brought to justice since four Americans were killed in the attack on two U.S. posts in the eastern Libya city that was a home base for the anti-Qaddafi rebellion.

Lawmakers probed further on Wednesday, when they had a closed hearing with Col. George Bristol, who was the commander of a task force operating in northern and western Africa. He briefed members of the House Armed Services Committee."

Associated Press

U.S. had until Friday morning to resume funding

Dues halted to protest decision to make Palestine a member

UNESCO best known for protecting world heritage sites

PARIS (AP) — The United States has lost its voting rights at UNESCO after an official said it missed a crucial deadline, two years after halting its dues payments to protest the decision to make Palestine a member.

Under UNESCO rules, the U.S. had until Friday morning to resume funding or submit an explanation for its arrears. Neither happened and the U.S. was losing its vote automatically, according to a UNESCO official who was not authorized to speak publicly about the dispute.

The loss of the vote means the U.S. cannot participate in funding decisions for the agency, which may be best known for its program to protect the cultures of the world via its Heritage sites, which include the Statue of Liberty and Mali's Timbuktu.

The U.S. hasn't paid its dues to the Paris-based U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization in three years, in protest over the decision by world governments to make Palestine a UNESCO member in 2011.

The suspension of U.S. contributions, which account for $80 million a year — 22% of UNESCO's overall budget — brought the agency to the brink of a financial crisis and forced it to cut American-led initiatives such as Holocaust education and tsunami research over the past two years.

It has worried many in Washington that the U.S. is on track to becoming a toothless UNESCO member with a weakened voice in international programs fighting extremism through education, and promoting gender equality and press freedoms.

""We won't be able to have the same clout,"" said Phyllis Magrab, the Washington-based U.S. National Commissioner for UNESCO. ""In effect, we (now won't) have a full tool box. We're missing our hammer.""

The UNESCO tension has prompted new criticism of U.S. laws that force an automatic funding cutoff for any U.N. agency with Palestine as a member.

But its core mission, as conceived by the U.S., a co-founder of the agency in 1946, was to be an anti-extremist organization. In today's world, it tackles foreign policy issues such as access to clean water, teaches girls to read, works to eradicate poverty, promotes freedom of expression and gives people creative thinking skills to resist violent extremism.

Among UNESCO programs already slashed over funding shortages is one in Iraq that was intended to help restore proper water facilities. Another was a Holocaust and genocide awareness program in Africa to teach about non-violence, non-discrimination and ethnic tolerance, using the example of the mass killing of Jews during World War II.

This loss is a particular blow to the U.S., since Holocaust awareness was one of the areas the country aggressively promoted in the agency's agenda when it rejoined in 2002 after an 18-year hiatus, during which the U.S. had withdrawn from the organization over differences in vision.

The concern over UNESCO is resonating in the U.S. Congress.

""The United States must not voluntarily forfeit its leadership in the world community,"" Rep. Keith Ellison, a Democrat from Minnesota, told The Associated Press in an email.

With efforts by President Barack Obama to get the money restored having failed or stalled, Ellison plans to introduce legislation in Congress to overturn what he calls the ""antiquated"" laws that automatically halted the flow of funds to the agency from November 2011.

The Obama administration has proposed language to amend the legislation, but it remains on the table amid recent U.S. budget setbacks.

For some it's a question of sooner rather than later, with the U.S. racking up arrears to UNESCO of some $220,000 a day, which it will have to pay back if it ever wants to fill the empty chair and get back the vote.

""Paying off three years is manageable, but it indeed becomes much more difficult if you allow many years to pass and the bill gets larger and larger and larger,"" said Esther Brimmer, former U.S. assistant secretary of state for international organizations.

The Palestinian Ambassador to UNESCO, Elias Sanbar, said other countries are beginning to make up for the U.S. shortfall.

""Is this in the interest of the U.S., to be replaced?"" he asked.

UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokova lamented the changes that are not only seeing America silenced within her organization but also bringing UNESCO financially to its knees.

""I regret to say that I'm seeing, in these last two years . a declining American influence and American involvement,"" Bokova told The Associated Press.

""I can't imagine how we could disengage with the United States at UNESCO. We are so intertwined with our message. . What I regret is that this decision became so divisive and triggered this suspension of the funding,"" she added.

Bokova said she accepts political reality and would find ways for UNESCO to continue its work, despite a 2014 budget that's down by an estimated $150 million.

Some fear this debacle is just the tip of the iceberg, and worry about more serious consequences, if Palestine joins other agencies such as the World Health Organization."

Government is investigating the allegation

PRETORIA, South Africa -- The sign language interpreter used at Tuesday's memorial service for Nelson Mandela, and whose image was broadcast around the world as he shared a stage with world leaders including President Obama, was being called a ""fake"" by the Deaf Federation of South Africa.

Bruno Druchen, the national director of the federation, sent this tweet as the event was taking place at FNB Stadium on the outskirts of Johannesburg, South Africa:

Wilma Newhoudt, a deaf member of South Africa's parliament, tweeted this:

The Associated Press also reported the allegation Wednesday, saying that three sign language experts who watched the broadcast said the man was not signing in South African or American sign languages.

""It was horrible, an absolute circus, really really bad,"" Nicole Du Toit, an official sign language interpreter, told the AP. ""Only he can understand those gestures.""

USA TODAY was not able to independently confirm the allegations, which if proved true would be an enormous embarrassment to South African officials at a time when the nation is looking to celebrate the life and legacy of Nelson Mandela.

South Africa's government said it is preparing a statement.

Collins Chabane, one of South Africa's two presidency ministers, said the government is continuing to investigate the matter.

Many South Africans were unaware of the sign language controversy Wednesday. Rachel Kika, 47, a teacher from the northern cape was surprised.

""I would not think the government would put someone there who did not know what they were doing,"" she said. ""It would be very disappointing. I hope they got the facts wrong. I don't know how that would happen when sign language is an official language.""

Bronwen Wilson-Thomson, 50, was shocked such a thing would happen.

""It would be sad if true,"" she said. ""It's not like they can't find people who know sign language.""

She said a few years ago, a singer messed up the national anthem by singing it to a different tune during a cricket match. ""I guess if we can have someone mess up the national anthem, we can have someone mess up the sign language,"" she said.

In a memo to the Cabinet, a local medical rights group said it had received at least 50 reports in just three days from hospitals complaining about equipment failures because of the blackouts. The Egyptian Center to Protect the Right for Medicine appealed for a quick solution, noting the diesel-powered generators at most public hospitals are old and unreliable.

A patient at the state-run Medical Research Institute in the coastal city of Alexandria reportedly died when the power failed in the intensive care unit. In Kafr El Sheik, a governorate north of Cairo, residents gathered outside a local hospital to help transfer newborns to another facility when 10 incubators stopped working recently.

The power cuts have also been a problem for thousands of students across the country who are preparing for their end-of-year exams. Governors in Cairo and other cities have urged authorities to refrain from cutting the electricity when students are taking the exams, but many complain it’s hard to study when the lights go out and there is no electricity to run the air conditioning.

“It’s difficult to focus when you’re frustrated. That’s the toughest challenge,” said 17 year-old Ahmad Belal, who wants to be a heart surgeon and needs top grades to get into medical school. “Trying to concentrate on your studies but being interrupted every two minutes because the weather is hot or because you’re angry you don’t have electricity for most of the day just makes it impossible.”

Belal lives in the Nile Delta city of Mansoura, where he said the power cuts sometimes last more than four hours at a time. He studies by candlelight when the lights go out at home.

“Some of my friends go out to cafes, but it’s always very crowded and loud, and it’s also difficult to focus,” he said. “Plus, the lights go out in cafes too.”

Power disruptions are nothing new in Egypt, especially in the summer months, when consumption spikes. But this year’s blackouts are more frequent than in the past, often occurring several times a day and lasting for hours.

“God, I’m not asking you for a fancy villa, or the latest car model, or millions of pounds even … All I want is for the power not to go out,” wrote one frustrated Twitter user who goes by the handle @AmgdAboZeid.

The crisis is adding to the pressure on President Mohamed Morsi, who had promised to tackle the country’s ubiquitous power and fuel shortages, along with a host of other problems, in his first 100 days in office.

Hundreds of residents in Alexandria, Kafr El Sheikh, Aswan and other areas have taken to the streets in recent weeks to voice their displeasure, blocking roads and even railway lines while chanting anti-Morsi slogans, according to the independent daily Al Masry Al Youm. More demonstrations are planned June 30, to mark the first anniversary of Morsi’s presidency.

There have also been calls on social networking sites for Egyptians to refuse to pay their electricity bills until service improves, calls the electricity ministry said were “destructive.”

A popular meme doing the rounds on Facebook complains: “Egypt is the only country in the world that collects money for the garbage that is filling the streets and the electricity that is always out from the salaries of its unemployed citizens.”

Last week, the electricity ministry issued a rare apology, explaining in a statement that it had been forced to resort to load-shedding because consumption is outpacing production. It urged residents to ration their electricity use and said it was working with other departments to obtain the fuel needed to generate more power.

John McCain (R-Ariz.) on Sunday suggested that Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) has lost his credibility in fighting global terrorism.

McCain argued on CNN's ""State of the Union"" that the government's vast surveillance program is not ""necessarily wrong"" because it operates under court oversight. Paul, who appeared on ""Fox News Sunday,"" has taken the opposite position, calling the government's phone records monitoring program an ""extraordinary invasion of privacy.""

Asked to square the two positions by CNN host Candy Crowley, McCain said that Paul was wrong about the terrorism threat in the days before the Boston Marathon bombings. ""Just prior to the Boston bombing, he said the battlefield was no longer in America,"" McCain told Crowley.

McCain was referring to a Paul appearance on Fox News in April. ""It's different overseas than it will be here,"" Paul said in that appearance. ""Which gets precisely to the argument I have with some other Republicans who say, 'Well, the battlefield is everywhere, there is no limitation.' President Obama says this. Some members of my party say the battle has no geographic limitations and the laws of war apply. It's important to know that the law of war that they're talking about means no due process.""

McCain isn't the first to suggest that the Boston bombings should serve to chasten Paul. A post-bombings Wall Street Journal editorial also took issue with the Kentucky senator's April remarks.

""Boylston Street sure looked like a battlefield on Monday, and so did Watertown on Thursday night,"" The Journal wrote in its editorial. ""The artificial distinction is Mr. Paul's focus on geography. The vital distinction for public safety is between common criminals, who deserve due process protections, and enemy combatants at war with the U.S., wherever they are.""

McCain's disagreement with Paul on foreign policy and terrorism was previously highlighted by Paul's lengthy March filibuster of President Barack Obama's drone program, a move that McCain dismissed as ""wacko.""

""Americans' suspicions have been aroused by ... the IRS, Benghazi [scandals],"" McCain acknowledged on Sunday.

But in an apparent reference to Congress, he said, ""I don't think the government should be briefed on every program like this. That's why we have intelligence agencies. It's a balancing act."""

USA TODAY

About 500 Marines will be based at an air base in southern Spain

Army unit will be based in Djibouti in east Africa

Marines will fly Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft

WASHINGTON — The Marine Corps and Army have developed quick-reaction forces to respond to attacks such as the one in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador.

The Marines will base 500 troops at Moron Air Force Base in Spain, about 35 miles southeast of Seville, said Capt. Eric Flanagan, a Marine Corps spokesman. They can be flown on short notice to African crises aboard six Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft.

Those aircraft can take off and land like a helicopter and cruise at more than 300 mph. Two KC-130 tanker aircraft have been dedicated to refuel them in flight, which will expand their reach.

The unit is known as the Special Purpose Marine Air-Ground Task Force for Crisis Response. It will act as a first responder to U.S. embassies in the region on behalf of U.S. Africa Command, Flanagan said. It will be on standby to help evacuate Americans from hot spots and to provide disaster relief and humanitarian missions.

The Army has developed the East Africa Response Force, which operates under the Combined Joint Task Force — Horn of Africa. Its headquarters are at Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti. The company-size unit is equipped with aircraft to conduct evacuations and rescue missions in the region.

""Soldiers have been on the ground in Djibouti to support this mission since April and have the capabilities they need to conduct it,"" said. Brig. Gen. Kimberly Field, deputy director of strategy, plans and policy for the Army.

The soldiers for the force come from the 2nd Brigade Combat Team of the 1st Infantry Division based at Fort Riley, Kan.

The Benghazi attack on Sept. 11, 2012, exposed the vulnerability of U.S. outposts in dangerous countries. Although Pentagon officials knew of the attack as it was happening, they lacked forces in the region capable of responding fast enough to help. The consulate was overrun by Islamist militants, killing Ambassador Christopher Stephens. A nearby U.S. facility was also attacked.

The light, quick forces deployed by the Marines and Army are designed to fill that gap in north and east Africa.

""Benghazi really throttled things up,"" Flanagan said. ""Everybody has looked at the threat and decided this is the new normal. We need something more responsive in the North Africa area.""

Benghazi proved that the Pentagon needs to respond quickly to ""flare-ups,"" said Loren Thompson, a military analyst at the Lexington Institute and a defense industry consultant. The Marines are his choice for the job.

""This mission should be given to the Marines, because they have Osprey tilt-rotors that can get to fights fast and then land anywhere,"" he said. ""They also have amphibious warships that allow them to act without access to land bases. The Army doesn't have the right equipment for quick-reaction forces in the Mediterranean or Middle East.""

Peter Singer, director for the Center for 21st Century Security and Intelligence at the Brookings Institution, said there have been about two embassy emergencies or evacuations each year for the past decade, making the Marine and Army quick-reaction forces necessary into the foreseeable future.

They're a ""good idea,"" Singer said. ""The response time at Benghazi was unacceptable. Period."""

Kerry's speech made clear that the United States was preparing for strikes on Assad's government, even as the United Kingdom declined to join in the military effort.

""Its findings are as clear as they are compelling,"" Kerry said of the report. ""I'm not asking you to take my word for it, read for yourself.""

But while the report assessed with ""high confidence"" that the Syrian government had used a nerve agent in the Aug. 21 attack, which U.S. intelligence believes killed at least 1,429 people including 426 children, it stopped short of conclusively demonstrating that Syrian President Bashar Assad himself, as opposed to a more junior officer, had ordered it. Details on what led the intelligence community to its conclusion were slim in the unclassified version of the report released to the public.

""We know that for three days before the attack, the Syrian regime’s chemical weapons personnel were on the ground in the area, making preparations,"" Kerry said.

The preparations included, he said, putting on gas masks.

""This is what Assad did to his own people,"" Kerry said. If the US and world allowed ""a thug and a murderer like Bashar al-Assad"" to get away with gassing his own people, he added, ""there will be no end to the test of our resolve and the dangers that will flow from those others who believe that they can do as they will.""

“We do assess that [Assad] is the decision-maker, and that he's ultimately in charge of deployment,” a senior administration official said in a conference call with reporters on Friday afternoon.

The only question remaining in the aftermath of the chemical attack, Kerry said, was, ""what are we and the world going to do about it?"" Presumably referencing a ""red line"" that President Barack Obama drew last August on the use of chemical weapons in Syria, Kerry also said the United States had to act because its credibility and interests were on the line.

“Our intelligence community has carefully reviewed and re-reviewed the information regarding this attack,” Kerry said on Friday. “It has done so more than mindful of the Iraq experience, and we will not repeat that moment.”

Over the past week, a series of intelligence community leaks have indicated that the evidence behind the chemical attack -- and specifically the question of what role Assad himself played in ordering it -- remains relatively weak.

In an Associated Press report on Thursday, one government official was quoted as saying the data was “no slam dunk.”

""It's unclear where control lies,"" another U.S. intelligence official told Foreign Policy earlier in the week. ""Is there just some sort of general blessing to use these things? Or are there explicit orders for each attack?""

The release by the Obama administration on Friday sought to address those intelligence gaps, although it did not offer specific data on the link between Assad and the attack. Instead, it focused on circumstantial indications: the fact that the chemical-laden rockets were all fired from regime-held areas into rebel-held ones, and an intercepted communication from a senior regime official that apparently confirmed the use of the weapons.

The Syrian government's motivation for launching a massive chemical weapons strike that was sure to cross Obama's ""red line"" remained unclear.

The intelligence assessment said the regime's ""frustration"" with its inability to clear swaths of the Damascus suburbs home to opposition forces ""may have"" contributed to its decision. Independent analysts were puzzled by the Syrian move, with some suggesting it could have been a mistake by a lower-ranking official.

The Obama administration's findings closely mirror those in a similar brief released Thursday by British intelligence just before the U.K. parliament voted down Prime Minister David Cameron's bid to have the country take part in a strike against Syria, by a vote of 285-272.

It was a stunning defeat for Cameron, who acknowledged after the vote that ""the British Parliament, reflecting the views of the British people, does not want to see British military action"" and said that the government would ""act accordingly.""

The British assessment concluded that it was “highly likely” that the Syrian regime had been behind the attacks, and that there was “no credible intelligence or other evidence” to support allegations that other forces, such as the rebels themselves, might have carried them out. But it also acknowledged having limited insight into the regime's “precise motivation” for using chemical weapons, particularly at a moment when United Nations chemical-weapons inspectors were staying at a hotel just miles away.

The British parliament's rejection of military action in Syria sparked questions on whether the U.S. would ""fly solo"" in its operation, as German Chancellor Angela Merkel also refused her government's assistance for airstrikes in Syria. But French President Francois Hollande expressed his willingness Friday to proceed with plans to strike Syria over its use of chemical weapons.

""The chemical massacre of Damascus cannot and must not remain unpunished,"" Hollande said.

The administration's intelligence brief was designed to assuage the concerns of both the public and a deeply uneasy Congress. Polls indicate that the American public is highly skeptical of launching a strike on Syria without congressional backing.

Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have urged the president to hold more consultations with members of Congress and not act unilaterally. Many Republicans, joined by a growing number of Democrats, have demanded a vote in Congress to authorize the use of military force.

While the White House is unlikely to seek congressional approval, the administration stepped up its deliberations with lawmakers Thursday. Obama called House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), whose office followed up with a statement calling on the president to provide a more robust explanation to both members of Congress and the American public.

Top administration officials also held a 90-minute conference call Thursday evening with congressional leaders and the chairs and ranking members of national security committees. During the call, lawmakers were briefed on the administration's approach and rationale for military involvement by Kerry, national security advisor Susan Rice, defense secretary Chuck Hagel, director of national intelligence James Clapper, and Sandy Winnefeld, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), ranking member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said after the call that he would support ""surgical, proportional military strikes,"" but the administration ""would be far better off if they seek [congressional] authorization.""

Caitlin Hayden, a spokeswoman for the National Security Council, told The Huffington Post that members of Congress who sit on the relevant intelligence committees have ""been continually supplied with classified info.""

She added that they will receive the classified version of Friday's chemical weapons assessment ""at some point today,"" and that the administration will hold classified briefings for its staff this afternoon.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) issued a statement on the Thursday briefing in which she said Assad had acted ""outside the realm of basic human rights."" But she added that she agreed with Boehner and other members that the administration must engage in further consultation with Congress and provide greater transparency into the decision-making process and timing.

""The case needs to be made to the American people,"" Pelosi said. ""It is clear that the American people are weary of war.""

UPDATE: 2:50 p.m. -- Obama addressed reporters at the White House later on Friday, emphasizing that he had not made any decisions about what actions the U.S. will take against Syria but adding that he is considering a ""limited narrow act.""

""We're not considering any open ended commitment,"" Obama said. ""We're not considering any boots on the ground approach.""

""We are looking at the possibility of a limited, narrow act that would help make sure that not only Syria but others around the world understand that the international community cares about maintaining this chemical weapons ban,"" he said. ""I have not made a final decision about various actions that might be taken to help enforce that norm, but as I've already said, I have had my military and our team look at a wide range of options. We have consulted with allies. We've consulted with Congress.""

The president acknowledged that many people, including himself, are ""war weary.""

""There is a certain weariness, given Afghanistan. There is a certain suspicion of any military action post-Iraq,"" Obama said, adding that he appreciated the skepticism. ""It’s important for us to recognize that when over a thousand people are killed, including hundreds of innocent children, through the use of a weapon that 98 or 99 percent of humanity says should not be used even in war, and there is no action, then we’re sending a signal … that is a danger to our national security.""

Editor’s note: Lucian Kim is a journalist who was based in Russia for eight years and chronicled the Moscow protest movement on his blog at luciankim.com. The views expressed are his own.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry’s euphoria over securing Russia’s joint sponsorship of a Syrian peace conference didn’t last very long. Soon after Kerry’s triumphant visit to Moscow in May, reports surfaced that Russia had made another weapons shipment to beleaguered Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad.

Russia’s open support for the regime in Damascus didn’t stop Barack Obama from trying yet again to get President Vladimir Putin on board at the G8 summit in Northern Ireland this week. The Obama administration is being either naive or delusional in its belief that Russia will ever pull in the same direction over Syria. Putin will back al-Assad to the bitter end.

The Kremlin’s support can’t just be explained by Syria’s arms purchases or its hosting of the only Russian naval facility in the Mediterranean Sea. Putin’s rationale for propping up al-Assad is rooted in the past and goes to the core of how he views his own claim to power. By continuously misreading Russian intentions, the Obama administration is abdicating its leadership role – and granting al-Assad extra breathing room.

For one, Russia has been a guardian of the status quo at least since the 19th century. After revolutionary fervor swept Europe in 1848, Czar Nicholas I helped the Austrian monarchy crush a Hungarian uprising. Later, the Soviet Union was just as interested in keeping out the contaminating influence of western liberalism, putting down an anti-communist rebellion in Hungary and invading its satellite Czechoslovakia to quash a reform-minded government. Even the five-day war with Georgia in 2008 can be seen as a police action designed to punish an enemy and reestablish order on Russia’s southern border.

More from GPS: Why Russia won't cut Syria loose

A second motivation for Kremlin intransigence over Syria is the memory of the Mujahideen, the U.S.-armed Islamic fighters who turned the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan into an unwinnable guerilla war. Russians don’t forget that Osama bin Laden funded the Islamic resistance in Afghanistan, and that al Qaeda and the Taliban both grew out of the Mujahideen. Putin holds a deep-seated suspicion that the West still aids Islamic extremists to damage Russian interests, for example in Russia’s predominantly Muslim North Caucasus region. It should come as no surprise that Russia opposes arming religiously motivated rebels in Syria.

The third reason follows from the second: a continuing belief that the U.S. will use any means – be it a smart bomb, a pro-democracy grant or Twitter – to achieve global domination. Mention of a no-fly zone over Syria doesn’t just remind Russian leaders of Libya, but also of their own impotence to stop U.S.-led interventions in Iraq and the former Yugoslavia. At times it seems the Kremlin has become a victim of its own anti-American propaganda. In any case, thwarting the U.S. over Syria is a kind of late revenge and raises Putin’s stature at home as a lone, defiant leader.

Finally, the Kremlin has to insist that al-Assad is the only legitimate leader of Syria because anything else would imply that street protests and outright rebellion are valid ways to change a government. As a KGB agent in East Germany, Putin watched as people power knocked down the Soviet empire like a house of cards in 1989. Now, as Russia’s supreme leader, he cannot condone regime change abroad or countenance its possibility at home.

Never has Russia looked so out of place at a G8 summit as this year. The wording on Syria in the final communiqué expressed “strong support” for the proposed peace conference, hardly a cause for hope.

Any course of action is fraught with danger. But pretending that Putin’s mind can still be changed is beginning to look like an excuse for inaction. In the meantime, al-Assad is using the delays to consolidate his gains and create facts on the ground."

Story highlights A 2,700 year-old silver chalice may be a new token of friendship between the United States and Iran It had been in New York since 2003, when an art dealer smuggled it to New York Iran's cultural heritage chief hopes its return will mark a lively cultural exchange with the U.S. Mohammad-Ali Najafi says the ice between Washington and Tehran has thawed

(CNN) —

A 2,700 year-old silver chalice may be a new token of friendship between the United States and Iran, at least that’s the way Iran’s cultural heritage chief sees it.

Whatever the case, Mohammad-Ali Najafi was palpably delighted Friday to see the ancient Persian artifact return to its homeland. The ceremonial drinking vessel – or rhyton – had gotten snagged in a U.S. customs warehouse for years, held up by bad diplomatic relations.

It had been in New York since 2003, when an art dealer smuggled it into the country from Iran.

Customs officials have long wanted to return the rhyton to Iran, according to a New York Post report. But decades of frigid relations between Washington and Tehran kept it frozen in bureaucratic limbo.

Winning hearts

President Obama broke that ice Friday with a historic phone chat with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, as the Islamic republic’s leader was just about to leave the United States.

It was the first time a U.S. president has spoken to his Iranian counterpart since 1979.

The thaw may have been enough to free up the rhyton, which takes the shape of a mythical beast with the body of a lion and the head of a bird of prey. It was fashioned in the Achaemenid era, the early Persian Empire, around 700 BC.

The State Department announced in a tweet that the United States returned it this week. U.S. officials handed it off directly to Najafi’s delegation, he said.

“We are taking this as America’s souvenir to the Iranian people,” Najafi told CNN.

A souvenir from abroad is something Iranians don’t take as trivial. It has a special place of warmth in Persian culture.

He will present it Saturday to the nation after he lands in Tehran. “I believe this will have a very positive affect on the Iranians,” he said.

And what wins Najafi’s heart has a good chance of pleasing Iran’s new president. Hassan Rouhani recently appointed Najafi as one of a dozen vice presidents, making him the guardian of the country’s most important museums and cultural institutions.

Najafi, himself a progressive reform politician, who has run for office in the past, accompanied Rouhani to New York, where the Iranian president spoke at the United Nations General Assembly.

Cultural charm offensive

In their phone conversation, the two presidents spoke about Tehran’s nuclear program, Obama said.

“Resolving this issue, obviously, could also serve as a major step forward in a new relationship between the United States and the Islamic Republic of Iran.”

It will be a long path to restored relations, the president said, but it could lead to the end of crippling economic sanctions against Iran, which could help “the Iranian people fulfill their potential.”

If Najafi has his way that potential will include the exchange with the United States of a lot of art, artifacts and archeology – set to classical music.

“I adamantly believe in cultural diplomacy, and I believe the thing that could improve relations between US and Iran after the years and softens the harshness of this relationship is cultural diplomacy,” he said.

He appears to have already kicked off a cultural charm offensive towards the United States in his short time in office.

Najafi has met with officials from New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art about potential exhibitions of Iranian artifacts, he said. He has parlayed with academics from the near Eastern studies program of University of Chicago.

“We agreed to have a joint program in future studies and research on these artifacts.”

As far as Najafi is concerned, the times of extreme tension between the countries are over.

“Mr. Rouhani, in an event held for Iranians last night (Thursday) specifically said that ‘the ice between Iran and US has been melted,’ and I think if this is accurate, which I’m certain that it is, we will have no problems in the areas of education, sciences and culture in the next few months.”

Najafi is also interested in seeing the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra play next year in Tehran.

If they can pull it off, he said, the concert would mark the 50th anniversary of the last time the orchestra played there.

If the diplomatic tone makes the music, Najafi seems eager to strike up the orchestra.

In Tripoli, U.S. forces snatched a Libyan wanted over the bombings of the American embassy in Nairobi 15 years ago and whisked him out of the country, prompting Secretary of State John Kerry to declare that al Qaeda leaders ""can run but they can't hide"". But the capture of Nazih al-Ragye, better known as Abu Anas al-Liby, also provoked a complaint about the ""kidnap"" from the Western-backed Libyan prime minister; he faces a backlash from armed Islamists who have carved out a share of power since the West helped Libyan rebels oust Muammar Gaddafi two years ago. In Somalia, Navy SEALS stormed ashore into the al Shabaab stronghold of Barawe but, a U.S. official said, they failed to capture or kill the target among the Somali allies of al Qaeda. U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters the target was a Kenyan of Somali origin known by the name Ikrima, described as a foreign fighter commander for al Shabaab in Somalia. One of the officials said it was not known if Ikrima was connected to last month's attack on Westgate mall in Nairobi by al Shabaab gunmen in which at least 67 people were killed. Kerry, on a visit to Indonesia, said President Barack Obama's administration was ""pleased with the results"" of the combined assaults early on Saturday. ""We hope this makes clear that the United States of America will never stop in its effort to hold those accountable who conduct acts of terror,"" he said. Two years after Navy SEALs finally tracked down and killed al Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden in Pakistan, a decade after al Qaeda's September 11 attacks on the United States in 2001, the twin operation demonstrated the reach of U.S. military forces in Africa, where Islamist militancy has been in the ascendant. The forays also threw a spotlight on Somalia's status as a fragmented haven for al Qaeda allies more than 20 years after Washington intervened in vain in its civil war and Libya's descent into an anarchic battleground between rival bands on the Mediterranean that stretches deep south into the Sahara. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said they showed Washington would ""spare no effort to hold terrorists accountable"". Yet disrupting its most aggressive enemy, in an oil-rich state that is awash with arms and sits on Europe's doorstep, may have been more the priority in the Libya raid than putting on trial a little known suspect in the 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224 people. LIBYA RISKS Clearly aware of the risks to his government of complicity in the snatching of Liby as he returned to his suburban home from dawn prayers, Prime Minister Ali Zeidan said: ""The Libyan government is following the news of the kidnapping of a Libyan citizen who is wanted by U.S. authorities. ""The Libyan government has contacted U.S. authorities to ask them to provide an explanation."" State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf, without commenting on any specific communications, said, ""we consult regularly with the Libyan government on a range of security and counterterrorism issues."" Another U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters the Libyan government had been notified of the operation, but did not specify when Libya was informed. Liby's son, Abdullah al Ragye, 19, told reporters at the family home that men had pulled up in four cars, knocked him out with some kind of drug, dragged him from his vehicle and driven off with him in a Mercedes. ""They had a Libyan look and Libyan accents,"" he said. It was not clear, however, whether the men were connected to the Libyan state, which may either have sought to keep its distance or been sidelined by Washington for fear of leaks. Abdul Bassit Haroun, a former Islamist militia commander who works with the Libyan government on security, said the U.S. raid would show Libya was no refuge for ""international terrorists"". ""But it is also very bad that no state institutions had the slightest information about this process, nor do they have a force which was able to capture him,"" he told Reuters. ""This means the Libyan state simply does not exist."" He warned that Islamist militants, like those blamed for the deadly attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi a year ago, would hit back violently. ""This won't just pass,"" Haroun said. ""There will be a strong reaction in order to take revenge because this is one of the most important al Qaeda figures."" SOMALI CHAOS Somalia's Western-backed government said it did cooperate with Washington, though its control of much of the country, including the port of Barawe, 180 km (110 miles) south of the capital Mogadishu, is limited by powerful armed groups. ""We have collaboration with the world and with neighboring countries in the battle against al Shabaab,"" Prime Minister Abdi Farah Shirdon said when asked of Somalia's role in the raid. U.S. forces have used airborne drones to kill Somalis in the past and last year SEALs freed two kidnapped aid workers there. Somali police said seven people were killed in Barawe. U.S. officials said their forces took no casualties but had broken off the fighting to avoid harming civilians. They failed to capture or kill their target during fighting around dawn at a seaside villa that al Shabaab said was one of its bases. A Somali intelligence official said a Chechen commander, who might have been the Americans' target, was wounded. In Somalia, al Shabaab spokesman Sheikh Abdiasis Abu Musab told Reuters no senior figure was present when the Americans came ashore. ""Ordinary fighters lived in the house and they bravely counter attacked and chased off the attackers,"" he said. Al Shabaab said that in attacking the Nairobi mall it was hitting back at Kenyan intervention in Somalia, which has forced it from much of its territory. It also targeted Westerners out shopping. AFRICAN VIOLENCE From Nigeria in the west, through Mali, Algeria and Libya to Somalia and Kenya in the east, Africa has seen major attacks on its own people and on Western economic interests, including an Algerian desert gas plant in January and the Nairobi mall as well as the killing of the U.S. ambassador in Libya a year ago. The trend reflects a number of factors, including Western efforts to force al Qaeda from its former base in Afghanistan, the overthrow of anti-Islamist authoritarian rulers in the Arab Spring of 2011 and growing resentment among Africa's poor with governments they view as corrupt pawns of Western powers. Western intelligence experts say there is evidence of growing links among Islamist militants across North Africa, who share al Qaeda's goal of a strict Islamic state and the expulsion of Western interests from Muslim lands. Liby, who has been reported as having fled Gaddafi's police state to join bin Laden in Sudan in the 1990s before securing political asylum in Britain, may have been part of that bid to consolidate an operational base, analysts say. Wanted by the FBI, which gives his age as 49 and had offered a $5 million reward for help in capturing him, Liby was indicted in 2000 along with 20 other al Qaeda suspects including bin Laden and current global leader Ayman al-Zawahri. Charges relating to him personally accused him of discussing the bombing of the Nairobi embassy in retaliation for the U.S. intervention in the Somali civil war in 1992-1993 and of helping reconnoiter and plan the attack in the years before 1998. Obama, wrestling with the legal and political difficulties posed by prisoners at the U.S. military base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, has said he does not want to send more suspects there. But a spokeswoman for the White House National Security Council said it was still not decided where Liby would be tried. His indictment was filed in New York, making that a possible venue for a civilian, rather than military, trial. It was unclear where Liby was on Sunday. U.S. naval forces in the Mediterranean, as well as bases in Italy and Germany, would provide ample facilities within a short flight time.

(CNN) —

A former U.S. soldier has been arrested and charged with illegally using a weapon on behalf of an al Qaeda-affiliated group in Syria.

Eric Harroun, 30, of Phoenix was arrested Tuesday night by the FBI at a hotel near Washington Dulles International Airport in Virginia. A Justice Department official tells CNN that FBI agents questioned Harroun at the hotel, then took him into custody.

Harroun appeared Thursday in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, and was charged in connection with his alleged use of a rocket-propelled grenade in Syria.

The law used to charge him states, “Any national of the United States who, without lawful authority, uses or threatens, attempts, or conspires to use a weapon of mass destruction outside of the U.S. shall be imprisoned for any term of years or for life, or if death results, may be punished by death.”

Harroun served with the U.S. Army from 2000 to 2003. He is not charged with targeting U.S. troops in Iraq.

The organization he allegedly fought with, al-Nusra Front, is one of several aliases used by the al Qaeda in Iraq terrorist organization. The organization claims responsibility for nearly 600 terrorist attacks in Syria, the Justice Department said.

An FBI affidavit says Harroun crossed into Syria in January 2013 and fought against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s forces. He posted photos and videos of himself on the Internet handling RPGs and other weapons, it said.

The Pentagon declined to comment on Harroun’s arrest. However, “It’s always a concern when terrorist networks in that part of the world and elsewhere seek to recruit Americans, whether they’re in the military or not,” spokesman George Little told CNN’s Erin Burnett.

“I don’t think this is a widespread phenomenon, and most of our people in this country – and certainly most men and women in the military – would not consider joining a terrorist network,” Little added.

Military repels coup attempt in Congo

At least 40 people were killed in gunbattles at a military base%2C the airport and a TV station

Morning talk show host on the air when gunmen burst onto the set

DAKAR, Senegal (AP) — Assailants armed with machetes and automatic weapons attacked the state television station, the airport and the main military base in Congo's capital in what appeared to be a coup attempt early Monday, before being repelled by the country's military, officials and witnesses said.

Congo's government spokesman Lambert Mende confirmed the attack, saying around 40 people were killed in the exchange of fire Monday morning, including 16 at the military base, 16 at the airport and eight at the TV station. Another six were captured, he said. He also confirmed that shooting had broken out in Lubumbashi, the country's second-largest city located in southeastern Congo, though by afternoon calm had returned.

""These are terrorists, you can't call them anything else,"" Mende said.

Most residents of this sprawling African capital first realized the attack was under way while watching a morning talk show on Radio Television Nationale Congolaise, the state broadcaster. The presenter of ""Le Panier,"" or ""The Breadbasket"" show, was in mid-sentence, when the intruders burst in. They had time to identify themselves as being devotees of a local prophet, before the signal on state TV was cut, said Pascal Amisi, the deputy chief of staff of Congo's Minister of Communication.

Between 7 a.m. and 8 a.m. local time, gunmen also attacked the international airport and the military camp in the capital housing the country's senior army leaders, he said.

""They attacked three different targets at the same time,"" said Amisi. ""We don't know for sure who they are but the group that attac

At the state TV station, an employee who was inside the building when the attack began described a scene of confusion, and terror.ked the TV station said they were representing Prophet Mukungubila,"" he said, naming Gideon Mukungubila, an evangelical Christian leader in Congo, who has built-up a following and who broadcasts messages on local TV and radio. ""Around 30 men attacked the TV station while the 'Le Panier' show was in progress. They came in with knives and said they had a political message to share, before the signal was yanked.""

""There were around 30 armed men who burst into the headquarters of the television station. They started firing, and we hid,"" said the employee who refused to give his name out of fear for his safety. He said that before they were chased out, they had time to scream out, ""

has come to liberate Congo from the slavery imposed on us by Rwanda.""

With a population of nearly 66 million, Congo spans a territory as large as Western Europe. It has twice gone to war with its smaller neighbor to the east, Rwanda, which as recently as this year was accused of propping up a rebel group, ensconced in Congo's eastern forest.

President Joseph Kabila, who is himself from the east and is derided by his opponents as being ""Rwandan,"" came to power in 2001, after the assassination of his father, warlord Laurent Kabila. The elder Kabila marched his rebel army into Kinshasa in 1997, grabbing power in a coup.

Even in a place that has suffered numerous coups, and whose remote forests are still home to armed groups, the attack in the capital on Monday came out of left field, surprising many. International flights that were about to land in Congo made U-turns in the air, including one carrying more than 100 passengers including The Associated Press' local correspondent.

""We took off this morning for Kinshasa, and after one hour in the air, the pilot announced that the airport was under attack,"" said Saleh Mwanamilongo by email, after his flight returned to South Africa. ""The pilot went on the intercom to say, 'We have just learned that there is gunfire at the Ndjili Airport, and as we cannot land, we will need to return to Johannesburg.'""

In an emergency message, the American Embassy in Kinshasa said it had received reports of armed engagements and fighting throughout Kinshasa, as well as indications that numerous police and military checkpoints had been erected. ""The embassy urged all U.S. citizens to stay in place and not travel around the city until further notice,"" the statement said.

Gordon'],Aim of U.S. Attack: Restore a ‘Red Line’ That Became Blurred,"WASHINGTON — The goal of the cruise missile strikes the United States is planning to carry out in Syria is to restore the smudged “red line” that President Obama drew a year ago against the use of poison gas.

If carried out effectively, the strikes may also send a signal to Iran that the White House is prepared to back up its words, no small consideration for an administration that has proclaimed that the use of military force remains an option if the leadership in Iran insists on fielding a nuclear weapon.

But the military strategy that the Obama administration is considering is not linked to its larger diplomatic strategy of persuading President Bashar al-Assad of Syria to yield power and support negotiations that would end the bloody civil war.

Even if the American-led attack includes allied aircraft, the options that appear to be under consideration by Mr. Obama for Syria — one or two days of cruise missile strikes from at least four United States Navy Arleigh Burke-class destroyers in the Mediterranean Sea — would not amount to the sort of open-ended campaign that might compel Mr. Assad to negotiate a transfer to a transitional government."

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad.

But as President Obama travels across the continent next week, so will his predecessor, George W. Bush.

Mr. Bush, who made fighting AIDS in Africa a top goal of his administration, will take a trip there — his third since leaving office — as part of a program to combat cervical cancer. He will leave late next week for Zambia, where he will help refurbish a clinic, and then head to Tanzania, where his wife, Laura Bush, is organizing a forum for African first ladies.

Mr. Bush will overlap briefly on July 2 with Mr. Obama in Tanzania, the last stop on the current president’s itinerary after Senegal and South Africa. There are no plans for the two to see each other, but Michelle Obama has agreed to attend the first ladies’ forum with Mrs. Bush in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania’s largest city, to promote women’s education, health and economic empowerment.

“It’s coincidental that we have two American presidents on the continent at the same time – in the same country at the same time – but it’s indicative of a continued commitment, which is great news,” said Hannah Abney, communications director for the George W. Bush Presidential Center. “It wasn’t planned. It really was coincidental. But we’re really excited about it.”

Africa was a personal priority for Mr. Bush during his presidency, overshadowed by Iraq, terrorism and other issues but one of the few areas where he drew praise across party lines. His Millennium Challenge program steered billions of dollars in development aid to countries that committed to reform. His President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or Pepfar, directed lifesaving drugs and other care to millions with H.I.V. and was called the largest humanitarian health effort ever undertaken by any country.

As a result, Mr. Bush remains more popular in Africa than at home, and he has taken pride in his efforts there. He devoted a substantial part of his newly opened presidential museum, outside Dallas at Southern Methodist University, to an exhibit about Pepfar. And global health has been a top focus of the former president’s public policy institute.

Teaming up with Pepfar, the United Nations, Susan G. Komen for the Cure and pharmaceutical companies, Mr. Bush helped form Pink Ribbon Red Ribbon, which is devoted to curbing cervical cancer and breast cancer. It started in Zambia in 2011 and expanded to Botswana in 2012.

Last year, Mr. and Mrs. Bush helped refurbish a clinic in Kabwe, Zambia, where nearly 30,000 women have been treated since, according to his presidential center. They will help renovate and reopen another clinic on July 1, this time in Livingstone, Zambia; a team of four Southern Methodist University students left Friday to work on the reconstruction.

Mr. Bush’s interest in Africa coincides with that of his own predecessor, Bill Clinton, who has spent much of his own time since office on programs to provide help there. “It was a critical part of his administration,” Ms. Abney said of Mr. Bush. “It’s also something he and Mrs. Bush feel personally about. They feel a commitment to the people there.”"

http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/05/opinion/egypt-needs-to-act.html,2013-03-05 00:00:00,[],Egypt Needs to Act - The New York Times,"President Obama’s decision to provide $250 million in aid to Egypt is a vote of confidence in a country that is critical to stability in the region but is also teetering on the edge of economic disaster. It is now up to Egypt’s government — and its opponents — to create the political and economic consensus that can leverage the American money to turn around their failing state.

Secretary of State John Kerry, who announced the aid in Cairo on Sunday, made clear that the responsibility for finding common ground falls first on President Mohamed Morsi. Mr. Morsi’s job is to persuade the political opposition to join him in a suite of economic reforms that would raise taxes, trim energy subsidies and pave the way for a much larger $4.8 billion loan package from the International Monetary Fund. The I.M.F. loan, in turn, would open the door to even more aid and investment from financial institutions and other countries.

Cooperation is also required of the opposition. Egypt desperately needs strong democratic institutions and a more robust economy to right itself and move toward a better future. Instead, the various combatants have settled into a pattern of recurring political and economic crises, betraying the revolution that overthrew the dictator Hosni Mubarak. The latest setback occurred last week when the main opposition group, the National Salvation Front, warned that it would boycott parliamentary elections scheduled for late April because Mr. Morsi’s Islamist-led government had failed to guarantee that the vote would be free and fair.

Their concerns are legitimate. Instead of working toward an inclusive government, Mr. Morsi and his party have consolidated power, rushed through a flawed, bitterly contested Constitution, failed to reform a corrupt police force, and proposed a new law that will severely limit the right to peaceful assembly and encourage further police abuse. Yet the opposition itself has not offered a coherent alternative that could challenge the Muslim Brotherhood at the ballot box. And boycotting the parliamentary elections seems self-defeating."

Last week, Mr. Greenwald concluded a deal with the eBay founder Pierre Omidyar to build a new media platform that aims in part to publicize other revelations from the data Mr. Greenwald now possesses.

The damage to core American relationships continues to mount. Last month, President Dilma Rousseff of Brazil postponed a state visit to the United States after Brazilian news media reports — fed by material from Mr. Greenwald — that the N.S.A. had intercepted messages from Ms. Rousseff, her aides and the state oil company, Petrobras. Recently, the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel, which has said it has a stack of Snowden documents, suggested that United States intelligence had gained access to communications to and from President Felipe Calderón of Mexico while he was still in office.

Secretary of State John Kerry had barely landed in France on Monday when the newspaper Le Monde disclosed what it said was the mass surveillance of French citizens, as well as spying on French diplomats. Furious, the French summoned the United States ambassador, Charles H. Rivkin, and Mr. Hollande expressed “extreme reprobation” for the reported collection of 70 million digital communications from Dec. 10, 2012, to Jan. 8, 2013.

In a statement published online, James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, disputed some aspects of Le Monde’s reporting, calling it misleading and inaccurate in unspecified ways.

He did not address another report by Le Monde that monitoring by the United States had extended to “French diplomatic interests” at the United Nations and in Washington. Information garnered by the N.S.A. played a significant part in a United Nations vote on June 9, 2010, in favor of sanctions against Iran, Le Monde said.

Two senior administration officials — from the State Department and the National Security Council — had arrived in Berlin only hours before the German government disclosed on Wednesday that it had received unspecified information that Ms. Merkel’s cellphone was under surveillance.

If confirmed, that is “completely unacceptable,” said her spokesman, Steffen Seibert. The accusations followed Der Spiegel’s disclosures in June of widespread American surveillance of German communications, which struck an especially unsettling chord in a country scarred by the surveillance undertaken by Nazi and Communist governments in its past."

Obama is considering how to respond to Syrian chemical attack

Official: Obama could be presented with options within days

A U.S. strike ""can't just be one and done,"" a Middle East analyst says

Few question that there was a major chemical attack in Syria last week, and the United States has made clear that it blames the government of President Bashar al-Assad.

Now, the question is how President Barack Obama will respond.

For almost two years, Obama has avoided direct military involvement in Syria's civil war, only escalating aid to rebel fighters in June after suspected smaller-scale chemical weapons attacks by Syrian government forces.

However, last week's attack on a Damascus suburb that reportedly killed and wounded more than 3,000 people obliterated the ""red line"" Obama set just over a year ago against the use of Syria's chemical weapons stocks.

At the White House, spokesman Jay Carney told reporters Monday that Obama was evaluating ""a response to the clear use on a mass scale with repugnant results of chemical weapons,"" adding that ""there is very little doubt that the Syrian regime ... used those weapons.""

Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called the attack ""inexcusable"" and ""undeniable,"" and said there was ""a clear reason that the world has banned entirely chemical weapons.""

He said that evidence ""strongly indicates"" chemical weapons were used in Syria and that ""we know the Syrian regime maintains custody"" of such weapons and has the rockets to use them.

Obama ""will be making an informed decision about how to respond to this indiscriminate use"" of chemical weapons, Kerry added, saying the president ""believes there must be accountability"" for those who use them.

Options available to Obama range from ordering limited missile strikes to continued diplomatic efforts labeled by critics as a ""do-nothing"" approach.

Obama will be presented with final options regarding actions against Syria in the next few days, a senior administration official said Monday. Assuming the president decides to go ahead with a military response, any action could come as early as mid-week, though it could be later, the official cautioned.

Factors weighing into the timing of any action include a desire to get it done before the president leaves for Russia next week and before the administration has to make a decision on whether to suspend aid to Egypt because of the ongoing political turmoil there, the official explained. The administration also wants it to be a quick response to the use of chemical weapons, the senior administration official said.

American officials are consulting with allies to ensure they are supportive of any U.S. action, which the senior administration official said would be very limited in scope and a direct reaction to the use of chemical weapons. And three representatives of allied governments involved in those top-level consultations said the goal is to reach a consensus as soon as possible.

""No one is talking about a long process,"" one European diplomat told CNN.

Marie Harf, a State Department spokeswoman, said any U.S. response would be ""a determination on how to respond to a blatant use of chemical weapons, and it's not necessarily to change the entire situation on the ground in Syria.""

That might be a mistake, said Michael Doran, an analyst at the Brookings Institution's Saban Center for Middle East Policy. A U.S. strike ""can't just be one and done,"" but should be part of a plan to remove al-Assad, he told CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360.""

""The president has been very reulctant to get involved. Public opinion has been against it. There's not a lot of support on the Hill,"" Doran said. ""And yet, here we are again. Time and time again, we get dragged further and further in."" The result could be ""a Vietnam-type problem, where we kind of back our way into this, if we don't come up with a plan about how to win.""

Kerry spoke with his British, Jordanian, Qatari and Saudi counterparts Monday and with the secretary-general of the Arab League, Harf said.

""Obviously, the intelligence assessment is ongoing,"" she said. ""But he reiterated that the president is studying the facts and will be making an informed decision about how to respond going forward.""

The Obama administration is expected to declassify the intelligence assessment backing up its assertion that the Syrian regime was responsible for last week's chemical weapons attack, another senior administration official said. The declassification would happen before any U.S. military action would take place.

A senior administration official familiar with the intelligence told CNN that the evidence ""includes but is not limited to"" satellite images of activity at Syrian military installations identified as including chemical weapons depots.

Earlier Monday, a White House official ruled out sending ground troops to Syria or implementing a no-fly zone to blunt al-Assad's aerial superiority over rebels fighting to oust his regime. The official insisted that all other options were under consideration by Obama but put no time frame on a decision.

Meanwhile, a senior Defense Department official told CNN's Chris Lawrence Monday that four U.S. Navy destroyers ""maintain readiness and, if required, could execute a mission within hours"" of being ordered to do so.

But the official added that the U.S. military remained ""in a holding pattern"" as Obama considers both military and nonmilitary options.

Also, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said while visiting Indonesia that any U.S. action ""will be in concert with the international community and within the framework of legal justification.""

While U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Monday that the use of chemical weapons was a crime against humanity and must be punished, certain opposition by Syrian ally Russia and possibly China undermined the possibility that the Security Council would support a military mission.

Instead, a limited coalition of NATO partners such as Germany, France and Britain -- all of which have called for action against Syria -- and some Arab League members appeared more likely to provide the political backing needed by Obama to order U.S. missile strikes.

A senior administration official told CNN on Monday that the goals of any coalition military action would be to punish al-Assad and show him that there was a cost for using chemical weapons while preventing him from doing so again.

In addition, a military strike would seek to degrade the Syrian regime's capabilities enough to weaken it without causing it to fall to an opposition considered unprepared to assume power, the official said.

Possible coalition partners include NATO allies Britain, France, Germany and Canada, as well as regional powers Qatar, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

Last month, Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey provided Congress with a list of declassified U.S. military options for Syria that emphasized the high costs and risks of what he said would amount to ""an act of war"" at a time of deep budget cuts.

Dempsey's letter, dated July 19, listed U.S. assets in the region including Patriot missile defense batteries in Turkey and Jordan, as well as F-16 jet fighters positioned to defend Jordan from possible cross-border trouble. In addition, the Pentagon has sent four warships armed with cruise missiles to the region.

According to U.S. officials, updated options offered the president in recent days included:

• Cruise missiles fired from one of four Navy destroyers deployed in the Mediterranean Sea. The missiles would be used to strike ""command and control"" facilities such as command bunkers, or the Syrian regime's means of delivering chemical weapons: artillery batteries and launchers. There is no indication that the missiles would strike at actual chemical weapons stockpiles.

• Military jets firings weapons from outside Syrian airspace. This option carries additional risks and is considered less likely.

""They have to be careful to do this in concert with our allies,"" Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, told CNN on Sunday, adding that ""I don't think the White House is going to want to risk American lives by sending pilots over Syria, so that really limits our options to cruise strikes and think that's probably where the White House is going to go.""

Cruise missile strikes could be ""very punishing"" on al-Assad's missile supplies and aircraft without going after the chemical weapons stockpiles to risk dispersing them, Schiff said.

To Aaron David Miller, a vice president at the Woodrow Wilson International Center, the situation is forcing Obama to shift from being an ""avoider-in-chief"" regarding military involvement in Syria.

""It's almost inevitable that the president will authorize some form of military action,"" Miller told National Public Radio in an interview broadcast Monday.

He said he expected a significant response that amounts to ""a warning that lays down this time a red line that the president intends to enforce, not one that turns pink.""

""It cannot simply be a couple of cruise missiles into a storage shed somewhere,"" Miller said, adding that the goal was to deter al-Assad rather than topple him or radically shift the balance in Syria at this time. ""The president's not on the verge of becoming the cavalry to rescue the country.""

Schiff agreed that Obama has little choice but to respond strongly.

""In terms of the credibility of the White House,"" he said, ""the cost of not acting now, I think, exceeds the cost of acting."""

But don’t think for a moment that Vladimir Putin has lost his edge. In a bluntly worded commentary published in Thursday’s New York Times, the Russian president castigated the idea of American “exceptionalism,” essentially called the United States an international bully and said he “carefully studied” President Obama’s speech Tuesday to the nation on Syria, and determined that he disagreed with it.

Still, Putin said his “working and personal relationship with President Obama is marked by growing trust,” and he welcomed Obama’s willingness to work with Russia on a plan to place Syria’s chemical weapons under international control.

“If we can avoid force against Syria, this will improve the atmosphere in international affairs and strengthen mutual trust,” he wrote. “It will be our shared success and open the door to cooperation on other critical issues.”

TRANSCRIPT: Obama makes his case to the nation

It is unusual, but not unheard of, for a foreign leader to publish commentary in an American newspaper as a way of influencing U.S. public opinion. Putin began his piece by saying that the furor over Syrian chemical weapons “prompted me to speak directly to the American people and their political leaders.” He added, “It is important to do so at a time of insufficient communication between our societies.”

Putin warned that a unilateral U.S. military response to Syria’s alleged use of chemical weapons would undermine the United Nations and violate international law. “The law is still the law, and we must follow it whether we like it or not,” he said -- words that will no doubt be parsed by human rights campaigners in Russia who have accused Putin’s government of bending the law and court system to its own purposes.

In some of the most stinging criticism of the United States, Putin wrote that it was “alarming that military intervention in internal conflicts in foreign countries has become commonplace for the United States.” He added that “millions around the world increasingly see America not as a model of democracy but as relying solely on brute force.”

The Russian president ended with a critical discussion of Obama’s speech, in which the American president laid out the reasons for intervention in Syria but said he wanted to explore Russia’s idea for a peaceful resolution to the crisis. Obama also explained why the United States was uniquely equipped to act, and talked about its history of leadership in international crises.

“That’s what makes America different,” the president said. “That’s what makes us exceptional.”

Seizing on that, Putin said: “I would rather disagree with a case he made on American exceptionalism. ... It is extremely dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional, whatever the motivation. ... We are all different, but when we ask for the Lord’s blessings, we must not forget that God created us equal.”

Words seldom, if ever, heard before from a Russian head of state.

Special for USA TODAY

Politicians want answers from Obama administration

Two political parties staged separate protests at the U.S. Consulate

Most in Hong Kong assumed that China was to blame for any hacking episodes

HONG KONG — Politicians were asking for answers from the Obama administration on Thursday about allegations from an American computer analyst that a U.S. secret surveillance program hacked into Hong Kong computer systems.

Two political parties staged separate protests at the U.S. Consulate on Thursday, with the New Forum demonstrating against the alleged U.S. hacking in Hong Kong and China and the League of Social Democrats voicing support for Edward Snowden.

About a dozen people showed up for the protests; a larger one is planned for Saturday.

Civil Party leader Alan Leong Kah-kit said Snowden has raised a serious allegation and that Hong Kong should take the issue up with President Obama.

""The Hong Kong government should take the issue up and ask Obama whether it has been the case. It is the least it should do at the moment,"" he told the South China Morning Post newspaper.

Snowden, 29, fled to Hong Kong with a trove of classified material he allegedly stole from his job for a consulting firm doing work for the U.S. National Security Agency. He revealed to the news media details of an NSA program that sweeps up data on phone calls and e-mails in the United States to identify patterns of possible communications between terrorists.

Until Snowden divulged the secret program most in Hong Kong assumed that China was to blame for any hacking episodes, according to Simon Shen, co-director of the International Affairs Research Center at Chinese University of Hong Kong.

Snowden named Shen's university as one of hundreds of NSA targets in Hong Kong and mainland China in an interview published in Thursday's edition of the Post, but it was the only one he specifically identified.

Meanwhile, Leung Chun-ying, who heads Hong Kong's government as chief executive, repeatedly told an interviewer in New York with Bloomberg Television that he ""cannot comment on individual cases"" when asked about Snowden.

Asked specifically if the city would comply with a U.S. extradition request, he said, ""I can only say that we follow existing laws and policies.""

The Obama administration has not announced whether it has made such a request. Members of Congress, such as Peter King, R-N.Y., have been demanding to know why such a request has not been made, accusing Snowden of theft, violation of his security clearance oath and treason.

The White House has said it will not comment while an investigation is ongoing.

Hong Kong legislator James To told a local newspaper he was considering inviting Snowden to testify to the Legislative Council on cybersecurity and U.S. hacking activities.

""I am interested to know how vulnerable our cybersystems are, and I want to ask Mr Snowden questions and verify his claims,"" he said.

At Chinese University, Shen said he wasn't sure why the NSA might target his school but added, ""There are a few strategically important points in the Chinese University of Hong Kong.""

The school hosts the Hong Kong Internet eXchange, a service for routing Internet traffic within Hong Kong to avoid the need to use overseas servers.

In a statement, the school said, ""The university has not detected any form of hacking to the network"" and added that the exchange and the school's backbone network ""are closely monitored round-the-clock to ensure normal operation and defend against network threats.""

A government spokesman similarly said, ""the government has no reported hacking incidents involving data leakage on its computer systems,"" but added that agencies have put in place defenses to protect their systems. ""The government strives to combat all kinds of technology crime.""

Chinese University may have been of interest to the NSA beyond its infrastructure. University researchers are engaged in research projects with government counterparts in mainland China and elsewhere. Shen cited the example of the Dragon Programme, which is a joint project of the National Remote Sensing Center of China and the European Space Agency for Earth observation research and application development.

Chinese University also runs a joint program with the Chinese Academy of Sciences in ""advanced integration technology,"" a brain research project with China's Academy of Military Medical Sciences, a research center for ""radar remote sensing"" with the China Center for Resources Satellite Data and Applications and the Joint Center for Intelligent Sensing and Systems with the National University of Defense Technology, among others.

Historically, Shen noted, the university was a key research base for the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency when Hong Kong was under British rule and China was closed to most Western visitors. It remains one of the leading research centers for scholars coming to study China.

In China, which the USA has said is involved in cyberattacks, officials said the revelations showed that it is America and not China that is committing such acts.

""I have always said, the United States' accusations about Chinese hacking attacks have always been a case of a thief crying for another thief to be caught,"" said Air Force Col. Dai Xu on his microblog site."

President Barack Obama is due to arrive in South Africa on Friday and will speak in Cape Town on Sunday. The protest was linked to a series of ongoing demonstration in the so-called “toilet wars” over sanitation policy in the city. It was not aimed at Obama, but took place against a backdrop of demonstrations and internal battles surrounding Obama’s visit.

Local news sources report that the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu), which is technically a governing partner with the ANC, plans to “disrupt” Obama’s visit to the country by staging demonstrations involving thousands of protestors. Cosatu specifically objects to Obama’s foreign policy, which it describes as imperialist and militaristic. Local Muslim groups are joining the protest, too, with the local Muslim Lawyers Association calling on the government to arrest President Obama on his arrival for war crimes.

Several left-wing academics are vowing to boycott Obama’s a ceremony at the University of Johannesburg in which Obama is to receive an honorary doctorate. The centrist Democratic Alliance, meanwhile, has come under fire for attempting to bestow an award on the President and First Lady Michelle Obama.

Obama’s visit has also affected growing debates around the country’s ailing former president, Nelson Mandela, who is said to be on life support. Mandela’s relatives are engaged in a very public round of infighting over where he should be buried when he dies. There is some speculation that Mandela is being kept on life support until Obama’s visit, though the two are not scheduled to meet. NBC, citing one of Mandela’s daughters, reported Tuesday that Mandela had opened his eyes and smiled when being told of Obama’s imminent arrival in the country, but that report was not confirmed by other sources."

The country is expected to go to the polls in early May, on a date yet to be decided by President Asif Ali Zardari. More than 85 million registered voters, less than half of the 180 million population, are eligible to vote to elect a new parliament - the first time in the country's history transitioning from one democratically elected government to another since it gained independence from British Raj in 1947.

“Direction set by the present parliament will go a long way in the legislative history of the country,"" Yasmeen Rashid, member of the ruling Pakistan People’s Party, told Fox News.

""The parliament promoted the democratic process and the coming governments will get guidelines from this system.""

The nuclear-armed nation has had three eras of military rule derailing democracy, which damaged the country’s ability to politically handle domestic issues and diplomatically address international community concerns.

""The [military] dictators in the past badly deteriorated the economic and social skeleton of the country and the people were expecting much more from the democratic parliament,"" Sardar Mehtab Ahmed Khan, leader of the opposition Pakistan Muslim League-N said.

The people of Pakistan had high expectations from the democrat government after General Pervaiz Musharraf, former president of the country, who came to power through a bloodless military coup in 1999, resigned in 2008. But all they received was higher taxes, power cuts, shortage of gas, price hike, and no hope of a relief package for the common man.

Khan told Fox News that the parliament, treasury and opposition has failed to meet the expectations of the masses, but expressed hope the public would continue to contribute strengthening the democratic system in the next elections.

Pakistan continues to battle militancy, the majority of it home-grown terrorism, which has left thousands of civilians and soldiers dead. Sectarian violence targeting the minority Shi’ite Muslim community, a chronic energy crisis, a poverty rate over 40 percent, lack of jobs, a crippled economy and rising corruption are just some of many challenges it faces.

Failures of the government overshadow much of its achievements, says Ahmed Bilal, of the Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency. Though the outgoing regime is marred by poor governance and rampant corruption, it leaves behind “political and electoral reforms making the prime minister and the parliament stronger, giving autonomy to provinces and by giving [a right to] say to opposition parties in the formation of the Election Commission”, he says.

Zardari’s ruling PPP and its coalition partners passed at least 138 legislations and 81 resolutions including more representation and rights to women through parliament.

The government did mend its difficult relations with India, opening trade between countries, increasing cooperation and intelligence-sharing with Afghanistan, and in good faith released several Taliban prisoners from Pakistan prisons. It also revived the defunct Gwadar Port by handing it to China, and even risked U.S. sanctions by signing a deal with Iran to build a gas pipeline and oil refinery to overcome the country’s power crisis.

Pakistan has a very vital and complicated relations with the U.S., and the next elected government may be comprised of politicians who have towed an anti-U.S. line to gain support.

All provincial assemblies are expected to be dissolved by March 19, and a caretaker government headed by a new prime minister acceptable to all major political stakeholders will take charge in coming days if a consensus is reached."

Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) introduced a resolution Friday calling on President Barack Obama to recommend an alternative location for the upcoming September G-20 summit in St. Petersburg, should Russia continue to provide shelter for National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden.

The resolution also states that Russia is damaging its relations with the United States and should immediately hand Snowden over to American authorities so he can stand trial. Snowden faces charges of espionage for releasing classified information on the NSA's broad surveillance programs to The Guardian and The Washington Post in June.

After initially hiding out in Hong Kong, Snowden headed for Moscow where he has been stuck in the transit zone of Sheremetyevo International Airport since June 23. He applied for temporary asylum in Russia on Tuesday, though President Vladimir Putin has said the whistle-blower is expected to leave the country as soon as he can.

Graham has been at the forefront of lawmakers urging the Russian government to extradite Snowden, going so far as to suggest the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi should be boycotted if Russia grants Snowden asylum. The White House declined to speculate on Graham's idea; House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) said the South Carolina senator was ""dead wrong.""

Graham and Schumer recently strengthened their bipartisan relationship while working together on comprehensive immigration reform. The duo has also introduced a media shield law to protect reporters from leak investigations by the Justice Department. Whether they have support for their latest measure on Snowden remains unclear, but the senators issued a statement Friday citing the Russian government's recent actions in Iran and Syria as additional reason to penalize it.

""On multiple fronts, Russia is becoming one of the bad actors in the world,"" said Graham. ""Russia continues to provide cover to the Iranian nuclear program and sell sophisticated weapons to the Assad regime in Syria to butcher tens of thousands of its own citizens. For Russia to grant temporary asylum to Mr. Snowden on top of all this would do serious damage to our relationship. It is past time we send a strong message to President Putin about Russia's actions and this resolution will help accomplish that goal.""

""Time and time again. President Putin is too eager to stick a finger in the eye of the United States -- whether it is arming the murderous Assad regime in Syria, supporting Iran's nuclear development or now providing shelter and Russian state protection to Edward Snowden,"" said Schumer. ""Enough is enough. It's time to send a crystal clear message to President Putin about Russia's deplorable behavior, and this resolution will do just that."""

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

http://news.yahoo.com/look-north-koreas-military-capabilities-083923209.html,,[],A look at North Korea's military capabilities,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea's military, founded 81 years ago Thursday, is older than the country itself. It began as an anti-Japanese militia and is now the heart of the nation's ""military first"" policy.

Late leader Kim Jong Il elevated the military's role during his 17-year rule; South Korea estimates he boosted troop levels to 1.2 million soldiers. The military's new supreme commander, Kim Jong Un, gave the Korean People's Army a sharpened focus this year by instructing troops to build a ""nuclear arms force."" Yet the army is believed to be running on outdated equipment and short supplies.

The secretive army divulges few details about its operations, but here is an assessment from foreign experts of its strengths and weaknesses:

___

ARTILLERY

North Korea provided a chilling reminder of what its artillery is capable of when it showered a front-line South Korean island with shells, killing four people in November 2010 and underscoring the threat that its artillery troops pose at the disputed sea border.

South Korea says North Korea has more than 13,000 artillery guns, and its long-range batteries are capable of hitting the capital Seoul, a city of more than 10 million people just 30 miles (50 kilometers) from the border.

""North Korea's greatest advantage is that its artillery could initially deliver a heavy bombardment on the South Korean capital,"" Mark Fitzpatrick, a former U.S. State Department official now with the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said in an email.

South Korea's defense minister estimates that 70 percent of North Korean artillery batteries along the border could be ""neutralized"" in five days if war broke out. But Sohn Yong-woo, a professor at the Graduate School of National Defense Strategy of Hannam University in South Korea, said that would be too late to prevent millions of civilian casualties and avert a disastrous blow to Asia's fourth-largest economy.

___

SPECIAL FORCES

Experts believe guerrilla warfare would be the North's most viable strategy in the event of conflict, since its conventional army suffers from aging equipment and a shortage of firepower.

Story continues

Seoul estimates North Korea has about 200,000 special forces, and Pyongyang has used them before.

In 1968, 31 North Korean commandos stormed Seoul's presidential Blue House in a failed assassination attempt against then-President Park Chung-hee. That same year, more than 120 North Korean commandos sneaked into eastern South Korea and killed some 20 South Korean civilians, soldiers and police officers.

In 1996, 26 North Korean agents infiltrated South Korea's northeastern mountains after their submarine broke down, sparking a manhunt that left all but two of them dead, along with 13 South Korean soldiers and civilians.

""The special forces' goal is to discourage both the United States and South Korea from fighting with North Korea at the earliest stage of war by putting major infrastructure, such as nuclear plants, and their citizens at risk,"" said Kim Yeon-su, a professor at Korea National Defense University in Seoul. ""The North's special forces are a key component of its asymmetric capabilities along with nuclear bombs, missiles and artillery. Their job is to create as many battlefronts as possible to put their enemies in disarray.""

___

ON LAND, BY SEA AND IN THE AIR

In March 2010, 46 South Korean sailors died in a Yellow Sea attack on their warship that Seoul blamed on a North Korean submarine. Pyongyang denies involvement. Separately, since 1999, North and South Korean navies have fought three bloody skirmishes near their disputed western maritime border. Experts say those battles show while the South has an edge in naval firepower and technology, the North relies on the element of surprise.

North Korea has 70 submarines while South Korea has 10, according to Seoul's Defense Ministry. The most menacing threats from the North's navy are small submarines that would deposit commando raiders along the South Korean coast, said John Pike, head of the Globalsecurity.org think tank.

North Korea also has 820 warplanes, more than South Korea, though Seoul is backed up by American air power. The South says most of the North's aircraft are obsolete. North Korea also suffers chronic fuel shortages that have forced its air force to cut sorties, experts say.

""North Korea would not be able to prosecute a full-fledged war for very long,"" Fitzpatrick said. ""Its biggest problem is that North Korea would quickly lose control of the skies because of the vastly superior (South Korean) and U.S. air forces. The reported number of North Korean aircraft is meaningless, because many of them cannot fly, and North Korean pilots have little training in the air.""

The U.S. stations 28,500 U.S. troops in South Korea and has recently flown nuclear-capable stealth B-2 bombers and F-22 fighter jets during joint drills in a show of force aimed at deterring North Korea.

Logistics and supplies are another issue. Heavy equipment deployed by naval and air forces requires extensive repairs, especially on rugged terrain like the Korean Peninsula. South Korea's Defense Ministry estimates North Korea's wartime resources, mostly stored underground, would last only two to three months.

""North Korea's only chance of winning any war depends on how quickly it can end one,"" Sohn said.

North Korea could try to compensate for its lack of effective equipment with sheer manpower. North Korea, a country of about 25 million, has an estimated 7.7 million reserves.

___

MISSILES AND NUCLEAR WEAPONS

North Korea says it needs to develop nuclear weapons as a deterrent against U.S. aggression. It has conducted three underground nuclear tests since 2006, the most recent in February.

Pyongyang is believed to have enough weaponized plutonium for four to eight nuclear bombs, according to Siegfried Hecker, a nuclear expert with Stanford University's Center for International Security and Cooperation.

But he doubts Pyongyang has mastered the technology to tip a missile with a nuclear warhead. ""I don't believe North Korea has the capacity to attack the United States with nuclear weapons mounted on missiles and won't for many years,"" he said on the website of Stanford University's Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies this month.

Bruce Bennett, a Rand Corp. expert, said earlier this month that it's very unlikely the North has a nuclear missile capable of hitting the U.S. but said there is a ""reasonable chance"" that Pyongyang has short-range nuclear missile capability.

___

CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS

North Korea denies it runs any chemical and biological weapons programs. South Korea claims that Pyongyang has up to 5,000 tons of chemical weapons.

The IISS says that although the figures are ""highly speculative,"" the North probably does possess chemical and biological arms programs.

""Whatever the actual status of North Korea's chemical and biological capabilities, the perception that it has, or likely has, chemical and biological weapons contributes to Pyongyang's interest in creating uncertainties in Washington, Seoul and Tokyo and raises the stakes to deter or intimidate potential enemies,"" it said on its website. North Korea is not a signatory to the Chemical Weapons Convention, but it has acceded to the non-binding Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention.

(CNN) – Republicans continued to put Hillary Clinton at the center of their inquest into last September's attack in Benghazi, claiming Sunday the former secretary of state wasn't assigned enough blame in an independent probe of the incident.

But in singling out the top Democratic presidential prospect for 2016, Republicans find themselves balancing their quest for answers with charges of being overly aggressive in a bid for political gain.



Speaking Sunday, the Republican lawmaker leading the charge in Congress to investigate the Benghazi attack said his goal was not to tarnish Clinton's presidential chances.

""Hillary Clinton's not a target. President Obama is not a target. The target is how did we fail three different ways,"" Rep. Darrell Issa, the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said on NBC's ""Meet the Press.""

His remarks came after week of renewed interest in the Benghazi saga, and fresh charges of politicization from Democrats. On Wednesday, Issa's oversight panel heard an account of the Benghazi siege from a former top diplomat in Libya, who described a harrowing night that resulted in the deaths of four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador to the country.

The hearing, which lasted five hours, drew loud protests from the White House and Congressional Democrats, who accused Republicans of rehashing a case that has already been investigated by an independent review board.

Witnesses in Wednesday's hearing, including the former Deputy Chief of Mission in Libya Gregory Hicks, questioned the legitimacy of that board's report on the Benghazi attack, suggesting it did not include accounts from key witnesses to the assault who were on the ground as it happened.

On Sunday, critics also questioned why Clinton herself wasn't assigned more blame in the report.

""Obviously she was the decision maker at the State Department,"" Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-New Hampshire, said on CBS ""Face the Nation,"" adding she was ""surprised"" Clinton wasn't probed further.

The co-chair of the review board, former Ambassador Thomas Pickering, defended his work on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" arguing his panel was charged specifically with investigating security decisions, which he said were not made at Clinton's level.

""She has already made clear the buck stopped with her,"" former Ambassador Thomas Pickering said. ""But we were interested in where the decisions were made. And she did not make the security decisions.""

Pickering's report, released late last year, found ""systemic failures and leadership and management deficiencies"" at the State Department in the lead-up to the attack in Benghazi, which left four Americans dead. As a result, four State Department officials were disciplined immediately after the report's release. One resigned, while three others were placed on administrative leave and relieved of their duties.

Those actions were deemed insufficient by some Republicans, including Sen. Rand Paul, who told Clinton during a hearing in January he would have ""relieved you of your post"" had he been president.

He made similar remarks on Friday, telling a crowd of Iowa Republicans that Clinton's actions were ""inexcusable"" and should ""preclude her from holding higher office."" Paul is openly considering a bid for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination.

His remarks in front of potential Iowa caucus-goers only fueled Democratic accusations Sunday that the Benghazi focus is a veiled bid to discredit Clinton.

""Unfortunately, this has been caught up in the 2016 presidential campaign-this effort to go after Hillary Clinton,"" Sen. Dick Durbin said on CBS' ""Face the Nation."" He called Republican scrutiny of Clinton a ""witch hunt.""

""When Hillary Clinton's name is mentioned 32 times in a hearing…a point of the hearing is to discredit the secretary of state who has very high popularity and may well be a candidate for president,"" Sen. Dianne Feinstein added on NBC's ""Meet the Press.""

On Sunday, Sen. John McCain also linked Clinton to a bungled administration response to the Benghazi attack, which he amounted to a ""cover-up"" of information designed to protect the White House.

His accusations were fueled a set of internal e-mails from September that were released this week, which showed top administration officials changing a set of talking points used to describe the Benghazi attack. The talking points were meant for members of Congress, and for U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice during appearances on Sunday talk shows.

McCain and other Republicans allege the changes to the talking points – which eliminated references to al Qaeda being involved in the attack, which came less than two months before the presidential election – were politically motivated, since President Barack Obama had campaigned using his administration's handling of national security issues.

Clinton herself isn't shown receiving or sending any of the e-mails herself. But McCain alleged it was impossible for her not to have been involved.

""I think that the secretary of state has played a role in this,"" the Arizona Republican said on ABC's ""This Week.""

""She had to have been in the loop some way,"" he continued. ""But, we don't know for sure."""

(CNN) —

All Americans who presented themselves at the United Nations camp in Bor, South Sudan, were evacuated safely Sunday amid deadly violence in the country, the State Department said. A State Department official said about 15 Americans were flown out.

U.S. personnel are working to confirm that no other U.S. citizens remain in Bor in need of evacuation, a State Department official said.

“This morning, the United States – in coordination with the United Nations and in consultation with the South Sudanese government – safely evacuated American citizens from Bor, South Sudan,” State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement. “U.S. citizens and citizens from our partner nations were flown from Bor to Juba on U.N. and U.S. civilian helicopters. The United States and the United Nations, which has the lead for securing Bor airport in South Sudan, took steps to ensure fighting factions were aware these flights were a humanitarian mission.”

“The U.S. government is doing everything possible to ensure the safety and security of United States citizens in South Sudan. We are working with our allies around the world to connect with and evacuate U.S. citizens as quickly and safely as possible,” Psaki said.

The United Nations moved noncritical staff out of South Sudan’s capital, Juba, across the border into Uganda on Sunday, as the violence spread inside the world’s newest country.

U.N. civilian staff were moved from a compound in the flashpoint town of Bor to Juba on Saturday, the same day a U.S. mission to airlift Americans out was aborted when the aircraft came under fire.

U.S. President Barack Obama said in a letter to congressional leaders Sunday that 46 U.S. service members took part in the mission, and he noted he “may take further action to support the security of U.S. citizens, personnel and property, including our Embassy, in South Sudan.”

Four U.S. troops were wounded in the attack in Bor and were expected to be moved to the U.S. military hospital at Landstuhl, Germany, a senior U.S. official told CNN earlier Sunday.

One of the injured “went through some pretty serious surgery” after being taken to Nairobi, Kenya, for wounds from the gunshots fired at the aircraft. All four have been able to speak to their families.

Thousands displaced

Hundreds of people have been killed in a week of fighting, which has spread from Juba to oil fields farther north.

South Sudanese President Salva Kiir blamed soldiers loyal to his former vice president, Riek Machar, for starting the violence.

Up to 40,000 civilians have taken refuge in United Nations bases in the country, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Sunday.

“There are many more thousands of people who are very much in fear and vulnerable, and at this time, the priority of the United Nations is to (protect) the lives of civilians,” Ban told a news conference in the Philippines.

The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimates some 62,000 people have been displaced in total, with five of South Sudan’s ten states affected by the violence.

The U.N. has said some 20 people were killed during an attack Thursday by about 2,000 armed youths on a U.N. peacekeeping base in Jonglei state. Two Indian peacekeepers were also killed.

After the attack, the assailants fled with arms, ammunition and other supplies, the U.N. said.

’We will not be intimidated’

In a statement Sunday, the U.N. said it had made the decision to relocate noncritical staff from Juba to Entebbe, Uganda, as “a precautionary measure to reduce pressures on its limited resources,” while still providing assistance and shelter to more than 20,000 civilians who have gathered at its compounds in the capital.

The U.N. Mission in South Sudan is planning to reinforce its military presence in Bor and Pariang, the organization said. Plans are also under way to relocate all noncritical staff from the U.N. compound near Bentiu in Unity state, and reinforcements will also be sent in.

“We are not abandoning South Sudan. We are here to stay, and will carry on in our collective resolve to work with and for the people of South Sudan,” U.N. envoy Hilde F. Johnson said in the statement. “To anyone who wants to threaten us, attack us or put obstacles in our way, our message remains loud and clear: we will not be intimidated.”

Ban said the U.N. would “transfer our assets from other peacekeeping missions,” such as the one in the Democratic Republic of Congo and other areas, to the troubled country.

“We also seeking support from other key countries who can provide the necessary assets,” he said. “We are in shortage of capacity. When the United Nations compound was overrun by 2,000 armed elements, we were having difficulties.”

Echoing calls from Western governments, Ban urged an end to the violence and called on Kiir and Machar “to come to the table and find a political way out of this crisis.”

“They are responsible to the people of South Sudan to end the crisis and find the political means of addressing their differences,” he said.

Ban said he had dispatched a special representative to Juba to work with the U.N. envoy in the city. Washington is also sending an envoy.

Tensions have been high in South Sudan since July, when Kiir dismissed Machar and the rest of the Cabinet. The move inflamed tensions between Kiir’s Dinka community and Machar’s Nuer community.

South Sudan formally split from Sudan in 2011 after a referendum, following decades of conflict. Numerous armed groups remain active in the oil-rich country.

Scrapping equipment key to Afghan drawdown

Facing a tight withdrawal deadline and tough terrain, the U.S. military has destroyed more than 170 million pounds worth of vehicles and other military equipment as it rushes to wind down its role in the Afghanistan war by the end of 2014.

The massive disposal effort, which U.S. military officials call unprecedented, has unfolded largely out of sight amid an ongoing debate inside the Pentagon about what to do with the heaps of equipment that won’t be returning home. Military planners have determined that they will not ship back more than $7 billion worth of equipment — about 20 percent of what the U.S. military has in Afghanistan — because it is no longer needed or would be too costly to ship back home.

That has left the Pentagon in a quandary about what to do with the items. Bequeathing a large share to the Afghan government would be challenging because of complicated rules governing equipment donations to other countries, and there is concern that Afghanistan’s fledgling forces would be unable to maintain it. Some gear may be sold or donated to allied nations, but few are likely to be able to retrieve it from the war zone.

Therefore, much of it will continue to be shredded, cut and crushed to be sold for pennies per pound on the Afghan scrap market — a process that reflects a presumptive end to an era of protracted ground wars. The destruction of tons of equipment is all but certain to raise sharp questions in Afghanistan and the United States about whether the Pentagon’s approach is fiscally responsible and whether it should find ways to leave a greater share to the Afghans.

“We’re making history doing what we’re doing here,” said Maj. Gen. Kurt J. Stein, head of the 1st Sustainment Command, who is overseeing the drawdown in Afghanistan. “This is the largest retrograde mission in history.”

The most contentious and closely watched part of the effort involves the disposal of Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles, the hulking beige personnel carriers that the Pentagon raced to build starting in 2007 to counter the threat of roadside bombs in Iraq and Afghanistan. The massive trucks, known as MRAPs, came to symbolize the bloody evolution of wars that were meant to be short conflicts but turned into quagmires.

The Pentagon has determined that it will no longer have use for about 12,300 of its 25,500 MRAPs scattered at bases worldwide, officials said. In Afghanistan, the military has labeled about 2,000 of its roughly 11,000 MRAPs “excess.” About 9,000 will be shipped to the United States and U.S. military bases in Kuwait and elsewhere, but the majority of the unwanted vehicles — which cost about $1 million each — will probably be shredded, officials said, because they are unlikely to find clients willing to come pick them up.

“MRAPs have served us well in the current war, but we will not need all that we bought for Iraq and Afghanistan in the future,” Alan Estevez, the assistant secretary of defense for logistics and materiel readiness, said in a statement. “It is cost prohibitive to retrograde and reset MRAPs that we do not need for the future.”

‘Gold dust’

Those MRAPs that the Pentagon has deemed unnecessary have been arriving by the dozen at scrap yards at four U.S. military bases in Afghanistan in recent months. Toiling under the searing sun last week at this vast base in southern Kandahar province, contract workers from Nepal and other countries in the region wore fireproof suits and masks as they used special blowtorches to dismantle vehicles built to withstand deadly blasts. It takes about 12 hours to tear apart each MRAP.

In another section of the scrap yard, a massive grinder gobbled slabs of steel, turning them into small scraps. The debris is packed into U.S.-owned shipping containers that also have been deemed unfit to return home.

Last month, the Kandahar yard produced 11 million pounds of scrap that was sold to Afghan contractors for a few cents per pound, said Morgan Gunn, a Defense Logistics Agency employee who runs the site. Afghans use the scrap mainly for construction and as makeshift spare parts.

“Gold dust is what they call it,” Gunn said.

Military officials have drawn little attention to the scrapping operations, mindful that the endeavor might appear wasteful in an era of contracting defense budgets and misguided at a time when Afghan troops are being killed at a record rate. But officials argue that the effort is part of a withdrawal operation that is being carried out in a fiscally responsible, carefully planned manner.

“One might ask: Why not give it to the Afghans?” Stein said as he toured the Kandahar yard. “It’s such a fast-paced operation, and most of it is trash. We don’t want to leave this in the battlefield.”

As they have debated how much excess equipment to shred or sell, officials have considered whether the defense industry would suffer if the Pentagon unloaded tons of used equipment on the market at vastly reduced prices. Additionally, Pentagon policy requires that allied nations seeking to take ownership of excess U.S. equipment travel to Afghanistan to pick it up — an onerous task that few nations are likely to take on.

When the U.S. military withdrew from Iraq, it donated much of its equipment to the Iraqis, who had access to cheap fuel, a robust defense budget and more sophisticated mechanics. The Pentagon also shipped a significant share to Afghanistan, where a troop surge was underway. But donating MRAPs to the Afghans would be more complicated and potentially counterproductive, military officials said.

“Frankly, in a lot of ways, the Afghan economy and military can’t absorb some of the things the Iraqis did,” said Lt. Gen. Raymond V. Mason, the Army deputy chief of staff for logistics. “We don’t want to give [the Afghans] a lot of equipment that they can’t handle and could compound their challenges.”

Military officials said they have spent billions of dollars equipping and building up Afghanistan’s security forces over the past decade, outfitting them with lighter tactical vehicles that are a better fit for the country’s rudimentary road networks.

A situation unlike in Iraq

The U.S. Army owns the lion’s share of the military equipment currently in Afghanistan. As of May, Mason said, $25 billion worth of equipment was deployed with Army personnel. After an analysis of needs and costs, it has decided to ship back no more than 76 percent. Transporting that much will cost $2 billion to $3 billion, the Army estimates. And repairing the gear that comes back will cost $8 billion to $9 billion.

Stein, the general overseeing the Afghanistan drawdown, headed the same process in Iraq, which turned out to be a far easier mission. For starters, the U.S. military had a relatively well-

organized system in place to hand over bases and equipment to the Iraqi government 21 / 2 years before American troops pulled out entirely. Security was more permissive. And, crucially, the U.S. military could use its large bases in next-door Kuwait as a staging ground for items driven out of Iraq.

“Kuwait was a lifesaver,” Stein said, noting that there are no neighboring U.S. bases where equipment leaving Afghanistan could be easily stored. “It’s very hard to get our stuff out of Afghanistan. In Iraq, we could drive it out to Kuwait, and it sat there for a year or two until the Army decided its disposition.”

As the U.S. military reduces its footprint in Afghanistan from 150 bases to 50 by February, Stein’s teams are ramping up their efforts, finding more efficient ways of sorting through equipment to be shipped and drawing from lessons learned in Iraq.

Until a few months ago, the military flew out the vast majority of the equipment it was sending back to the United States.

In recent months, after Pakistan, a neighbor of landlocked Afghanistan, agreed to let the U.S. military use its roads to ship materiel out through its ports, most containers that don’t include sensitive materials or weapons are being trucked out by land. Shipping through Pakistan is by no means trouble-free — and officials recognize that the route could get shut down in the event of a new spat between Islamabad and Washington.

“We continue to get delays. There’s still corruption, taxes, tariffs,” Stein said. “But our equipment is getting through.”"

“The Iranian aircraft departed after a verbal warning,” the statement said.

The incident, which was not disclosed for two days, is at least the third time U.S. and Iranian military forces have faced off over American spy drones in the last 15 months, and it inevitably raised concerns of a more serious confrontation.

The Obama administration has stepped up military and intelligence surveillance flights near Iranian airspace and moved warships and other military assets to the Middle East in connection with the increasing Western pressure on Iran to suspend its nuclear development program.

The Pentagon said Thursday that the Predator drone was on a “routine classified surveillance flight over international waters” and was being escorted by two U.S. Air Force jets when an Iranian F-4 fighter was detected more than 16 miles away.

One of the U.S. jets flew within two miles of the Iranian warplane and made radio contact, a Defense official said.

After the incident, the Pentagon said, “the United States communicated to the Iranians that we will continue to conduct surveillance flights over international waters consistent with long-standing practice and our commitment to the security of the region.”

“We reserve the right to protect our military assets as well as our forces,” the statement added.

The Pentagon initially said that the Iranian fighter jet had fled after the U.S. jet had dropped a warning flare, but that account was later corrected. “Updated reporting indicates that no flare was discharged,” the revised statement said.

In December 2011, a secret U.S. spy drone crashed inside Iran after what U.S. officials privately said was a malfunction. Iranian officials claimed they brought down the craft by jamming its guidance system. They later put out video footage of the captured aircraft, as well as aerial video they said they had taken from it.

Last November, the Pentagon said that an Iranian fighter fired multiple times at another Predator drone that U.S. officials said was over international waters but the slow-moving drone was not hit.

Story highlights The move comes less than a week after legislation was introduced in the U.S. Senate U.S., others believe Iran is attempting to build a bomb through uranium enrichment Tehran says its nuclear intentions are peaceful

(CNN) —

Iranian lawmakers have drafted a bill that would force the government to enrich uranium up to 60% if new sanctions are imposed, state media reported Wednesday.

The move comes less than a week after bipartisan legislation was introduced in the U.S. Senate that would authorize new economic sanctions on Iran if it breaches an interim agreement to limit its nuclear program or fails to strike a final accord terminating those ambitions.

“If the bill is approved, the government will be obliged to complete nuclear infrastructure at Fordo and Natanz (facilities) if sanctions (against Iran) are ratcheted up, new sanctions are imposed, the country’s nuclear rights are violated and the Islamic Republic of Iran’s peaceful nuclear rights are ignored by members of P5+1,” state-run Press TV reported lawmaker Seyyed Mehdi Mousavinejad said. The so-called P5+1 is the United States, Britain, China, Russia, France and Germany.

The draft bill was signed by 100 legislators, Press TV said.

A six-month agreement struck in November among the United States, other world powers and Iran calls for Tehran to start limiting its nuclear activities in return for a relaxation of sanctions that have crippled its economy.

Talks are under way on a permanent agreement, and the outcome is uncertain.

The Senate proposal emerged despite Obama administration appeals for Congress to defer pursuing new sanctions with diplomatic efforts ongoing.

The White House said new sanctions would undermine those delicate efforts on the global stage and President Barack Obama would veto the legislation if Congress were to approve it now.

The proposal would give Obama more than a year to engage in further diplomacy before any new sanctions would kick in against Iran’s oil exports and other key areas of its economy.

Sanctions would hit sooner if Iran cheats on the interim deal or fails to reach a final accord.

The Obama administration has said the centerpiece of its policy is for Iran to not achieve a nuclear weapon.

The United States and other western powers believe Iran is attempting to build a bomb through uranium enrichment. But Tehran says its nuclear intentions are peaceful.

He Is An Editorial Writer Specializing In Foreign Affairs', 'Writes A Biweekly Column That Appears In Print On Mondays.']",Jackson Diehl: Wading into the Middle East morass,"On his second day in office in 2009, Barack Obama launched an ambitious effort to broker peace in the Middle East, ignoring warnings that neither Israelis nor Palestinians were ready for a deal. He was badly burned. Despite the appointment of former senator George Mitchell as an envoy and plenty of direct presidential involvement, the initiative flopped. Israelis and Palestinians never began substantial negotiations, and Obama’s first term ended with another mini-war in the Gaza Strip.

Four years later, the diplomatic landscape looks even more forbidding. Gaza remains firmly in the possession of the Hamas movement, which has not budged from its refusal to recognize Israel. The Palestinian Authority of Mahmoud Abbas appears to be crumbling, with Abbas himself contemplating retirement. An election this month in Israel appears likely to create one of most nationalist governments in the country’s history, one in which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — regarded in the White House as a serious obstacle to any peace process — may represent the dovish left wing.

Yet if Obama were to listen to his European counterparts, Arab leaders and even his incoming secretary of state, he would, once again, make the “peace process” a top priority in his second term. The puzzling but persistent illogic behind this is worth deconstructing.

In Washington, some of the loudest calls for Obama’s reengagement come from the “realist” foreign policy camp, populated by figures such as former national security advisers Zbigniew Brzezinski and Brent Scowcroft — and former senator Chuck Hagel, whom Obama is considering for defense secretary. These folks opposed the war in Iraq, and they reject U.S. intervention in Syria or military action against Iran’s nuclear program. They have been arguing for years that it is time for the United States to recognize limits to its power.

When it comes to Israel, however, the realists assume boundless U.S. strength. If only he chooses to do so, they argue, Obama could join with U.S. allies or the U.N Security Council in imposing a two-state solution on the Israelis and Palestinians, like it or not. The supposition seems to be that a United States too weak to force Bashar al-Assad out of Syria can compel Israel’s advanced democracy and the leaderless Palestinians to accept compromises they have resisted for decades.

There’s nothing wrong with the realists’ goal. Though often accused of being anti-Israel, Brzezinski and Scowcroft have proposed parameters for a Palestinian state close to those embraced by previous Israeli governments. Their solution is eminently logical; it’s the means of getting there that beggar belief. Obama’s first term was proof: The president proved unable even to force Israel to freeze settlements, or oblige the Palestinian Authority to negotiate — much less dictate a deal.

European governments mostly realized long ago that no U.S. administration would or could strong-arm the two sides. Yet they cling to another dogma, one that I suspect is shared by Secretary of State-to-be John Kerry: that an Israeli-Palestinian settlement is the key to stabilizing the broader Middle East, from Morocco to Iraq. It’s an idea nourished by old and new Arab rulers across the region, from Egypt’s new Islamist president to the kings of Saudi Arabia and Jordan, who are eager to divert U.S. attention from their own troubles.

If Palestinian statehood is so crucial, then it must be at the center of U.S. foreign policy, regardless of whether the time is ripe. But is it? As Egypt polarizes between secular and Islamist camps, and Syria’s vicious war pits Sunni Muslims against Alawites and their Shiite allies, it seems clear that the region’s biggest conflicts are those of Arabs against Arabs. But Western governments are at a loss over what to do about these battles. For the Israelis and Palestinians there is, at least, a well-known formula: conferences to be arranged, shuttles between capitals, dickering over conditions and pre-conditions.

All this is not to argue that Obama should ignore the Israelis and Palestinians or abandon the cause of Palestinian statehood, which in the long run will be a building block of a modernized Middle East. U.S. neglect could be taken as license by Israeli nationalists to take steps to obstruct that future state; it could also prompt Palestinians to embrace more provocative measures, from firing more missiles from Gaza at Israeli cities to inciting a new uprising in the West Bank.

But what’s needed is a concerted but low-key policy, one that aims at creating conditions for a long-term solution but does not pretend that it can be delivered in the next year or two. Obama should encourage Israel’s new government to take palliative steps to ease movement and promote development in the West Bank; he should press Egypt’s ruling Islamists to exert a moderating influence over Hamas. Above all, he should accept the lesson of his first term: that making Middle East peace a presidential priority will not make it happen.

It's John Kerry to the rescue! Secretary Kerry! In the middle of presenting Kerry's slam dunk case for why we absolutely, positively, must attack Syria, he inadvertently may have found an internationally acceptable peaceful resolution.



9/9/2013: REPORTER: Is there anything at this point that his government could do or offer that would stop an attack? JOHN KERRY: Uh, sure. He could turn over every single bit of his chemical weapons to the international community in the next week, turn it over. All of it. Without delay. And allow a full and total accounting for that. But he isn't about to do it, and it can't be done, obviously.

BRET BAIER (9/9/2013): The State Department quickly called that a rhetorical argument and not a real proposal from Kerry.

Well, guess which Middle Eastern despot doesn't appear to understand rhetorical devices.



BROOKE BALDWIN (9/9/2013): Syria's foreign minister says the country ""welcomes"" a proposal to put its chemical weapons under international control.

(video of Mr. Magoo unknowingly escaping death from a tiger)

Holy shit! Syria is taking him up on his dickish offer! Syria, through the auspices of Vladimir Putin's Russia, would like to take the international community and Secretary Kerry's generous offer to hold their weapons for them. No war, no costs, no blowback! How could any patriot view this as anything but a fantastic development?



STUART VARNEY (9/10/2013): President Obama has just led us into a humiliating defeat.

Who cares how we avoided a war and got a dictator to give up his chemical weapons, if we avoided a war and got a dictator to give up his chemical weapons?



TUCKER CARLSON (9/9/2013): This strengthens Russia and humiliates the United States. SEAN HANNITY (9/9/2013): Now Vladimir Putin has filled the leadership gap. CNBC ANCHOR (9/10/2013): I think Lindsey Graham's on the tape saying that the Russians have played us like a fiddle. FOX BUSINESS ANALYST (9/9/2013): They are now the new cop of the world, and we're not. It's despicable. GRETCHEN CARLSON (9/10/2013): Now have we handed the power back over to the shirtless Putin?

I don't really understand financial news. And #2, ohh, Putin gets the credit. If we caught Charlie Manson, who gives a shit who gets the collar?

And I get that Fox opposes a Syria peace plan because its modus operandi is to foment dissent in the form of a relentless and irrational contrarianism to Barack Obama on all things democratic, to advance its ultimate objective of creating a deliberately misinformed body politic whose fear, anger, mistrust, and discontent is the manna upon which it sustains its parasitic succubus-like existence. (MASSIVE audience cheering and applause)

And uh, but.... Sorry, I blacked out for a second, was I saying something?

But for some reason, even CNN's Chris Cuomo seemed disappointed with the turn of events.



CHRIS CUOMO (9/10/2013): A Russian proposal to have Syria hand over its chemical weapons could change what the President has to say, could change the entire debate. But should it?

Look, cuz isn't that the problem now? News networks aren't invested in right or wrong, they're invested in momentum. Ah, you can take us to war on false intelligence and pretense, but God forbid you rev us up for war, and you don't deliver. The one thing we won't tolerate in this country is a little war foreplay without the payoff. You can make disastrous foreign policy decisions, but you will not give this country a case of blue bombs. We'll be right back."

[Note this is a report issued by House Republicans including Howard McKeon chairman of Committee on Armed Services, Ed Royce chairman of Committee on Foreign Affairs, Bob Goodlatte chairman of Committee on the Judiciary, Darrell Issa chairman of Committee on Oversight & Government Reform and Mike Rogers Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]:

Before the Attacks:

After the U.S.-backed Libyan revolution ended the Gadhafi regime, the U.S. government did not deploy sufficient U.S. security elements to protect U.S. interests and personnel that remained on the ground.

Senior State Department officials knew that the threat environment in Benghazi was high and that the Benghazi compound was vulnerable and unable to withstand an attack, yet the Department continued to systematically withdraw security personnel.

Repeated requests for additional security were denied at the highest levels of the State Department. For example, an April 2012 State Department cable bearing Secretary Hillary Clinton’s signature acknowledged then-Ambassador Cretz’s formal request for additional security assets but ordered the withdrawal of security elements to proceed as planned.

For example, an April 2012 State Department cable bearing Secretary Hillary Clinton’s signature acknowledged then-Ambassador Cretz’s formal request for additional security assets but ordered the withdrawal of security elements to proceed as planned. The attacks were not the result of a failure by the Intelligence Community (IC) to recognize or communicate the threat. The IC collected considerable information about the threats in the region, and disseminated regular assessments to senior U.S. officials warning of the deteriorating security environment in Benghazi, which included threats to American interests, facilities, and personnel.

The IC collected considerable information about the threats in the region, and disseminated regular assessments to senior U.S. officials warning of the deteriorating security environment in Benghazi, which included threats to American interests, facilities, and personnel. The President, as Commander-in-Chief, failed to proactively anticipate the significance of September 11 and provide the Department of Defense with the authority to launch offensive operations beyond self-defense. Defense Department assets were correctly positioned for the general threat across the region, but the assets were not authorized at an alert posture to launch offensive operations beyond self-defense, and were provided no notice to defend diplomatic facilities.

During the Attacks:

On the evening of September 11, 2012, U.S. security teams on the ground in Benghazi exhibited extreme bravery responding the attacks by al-Qa’ida-affiliated groups against the U.S. mission.

responding the attacks by al-Qa’ida-affiliated groups against the U.S. mission. Department of Defense officials and military personnel reacted quickly to the attacks in Benghazi. The effectiveness of their response was hindered on account of U.S. military forces not being properly postured to address the growing threats in northern Africa or to respond to a brief, high-intensity attack on U.S. personnel or interests across much of Africa.

After the Attacks:

The Administration willfully perpetuated a deliberately misleading and incomplete narrative that the attacks evolved from a political demonstration caused by a YouTube video. U.S. officials on the ground reported – and video evidence confirms – that demonstrations outside the Benghazi Mission did not occur and that the incident began with an armed attack on the facility. Senior Administration officials knowingly minimized the role played by al-Qa’ida-affiliated entities and other associated groups in the attacks, and decided to exclude from the discussion the previous attempts by extremists to attack U.S. persons or facilities in Libya.

Senior Administration officials knowingly minimized the role played by al-Qa’ida-affiliated entities and other associated groups in the attacks, and decided to exclude from the discussion the previous attempts by extremists to attack U.S. persons or facilities in Libya. Administration officials crafted and continued to rely on incomplete and misleading talking points. Specifically, after a White House Deputies Meeting on Saturday, September 15, 2012, the Administration altered the talking points to remove references to the likely participation of Islamic extremists in the attacks. The Administration also removed references to the threat of extremists linked to al-Qa’ida in Benghazi and eastern Libya, including information about at least five other attacks against foreign interests in Benghazi. Senior State Department officials requested – and the White House approved – that the details of the threats, specifics of the previous attacks, and previous warnings be removed to insulate the Department from criticism that it ignored the threat environment in Benghazi.

Email exchanges during the interagency process do not reveal any concern with protecting classified information. Additionally, the Bureau itself approved a version of the talking points with significantly more information about the attacks and previous threats than the version that the State Department requested. Thus, the claim that the State Department’s edits were made solely to protect that investigation is not credible.

The Administration’s decision to respond to the Benghazi attacks with an FBI investigation, rather than military or other intelligence resources, contributed to the government’s lack of candor about the nature of the attack.

Responding to the attacks with an FBI investigation significantly delayed U.S. access to key witnesses and evidence and undermined the government’s ability to bring those responsible for the attacks to justice in a timely manner.

Story highlights NEW: UK withdraws staff from British embassy in Yemen, follows U.S. lead Sources: Members of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula are planning an attack The United States has heightened its security stance across the Mideast and Africa Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri tells operatives in Yemen to ""do something""

(CNN) —

A pair of suspected U.S. drone strikes killed four al Qaeda militants in Yemen as the United States maintained a heightened security alert in the country and urged all Americans to leave immediately.

Security sources told CNN about the strikes but didn’t offer additional details. A Yemeni official said four drone strikes have been carried out in the past 10 days.

None of those killed on Tuesday were among the 25 names on the country’s most-wanted list, security officials said.

It is unclear whether the strikes were related to the added security alert in the country after U.S. officials intercepted a message from al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri to operatives in Yemen telling them to “do something.” The message was sent to Nasir al-Wuhayshi, the leader of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the terror group’s Yemeni affiliate. U.S. intelligence believes al-Wuhayshi has recently been appointed the overall terror organization’s No. 2 leader.

Also Tuesday, the State Department urged Americans in Yemen to leave immediately, citing terrorist activities and civil unrest. All non-emergency U.S. government personnel were also told to leave.

Two U.S. military transport aircraft landed in Yemen on Tuesday to evacuate American citizens.

“In response to a request from the U.S. State Department, early this morning the U.S. Air Force transported personnel out of Sana’a, Yemen, as part of a reduction in emergency personnel,” Pentagon press secretary George Little said in a statement.

Little also said, “The U.S. Department of Defense continues to have personnel on the ground in Yemen to support the U.S. State Department and monitor the security situation.”

The UK Foreign Office also announced it had temporarily withdrawn all staff from the British embassy and would keep the facility shut until employees are able to return.

Washington takes precautions

Acting on the intelligence information, the United States heightened its security stance, issuing a worldwide travel alert and closing a number of embassies and consulates over large areas of the Middle East and Africa this week.

List of U.S. embassies and consulates closed this week

The State Department said the substantial security steps reflect an “abundance of caution” over intelligence information that indicated final planning by al Qaeda in Yemen for possible terrorist attacks on Western targets to coincide with the end of Ramadan this week.

Three sources told CNN that the United States has information that members of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula are in the final stages of planning for an unspecified attack. Recent jailbreaks in Pakistan, Iraq and Libya all have the fingerprints of al Qaeda operations.

Prison breaks are among reasons for heightened security

On Monday, White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters that U.S. anti-terrorism efforts had decimated al Qaeda’s global leadership and greatly diminished its core in Afghanistan and Pakistan, saying the threat had “shifted to some of these affiliates, in particular AQAP.”

Separately, American special forces units overseas have been on alert for the past several days awaiting a mission to attack potential al Qaeda targets if those behind the most recent terror threats against U.S. interests can be identified, a senior Obama administration official told CNN.

The official declined to identify the units or their locations because of the sensitive nature of the information. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel put the units on alert last week, the official said.

The person resided at Pavillon Beau-Lieu, a special care home in Grand Falls, where there's an outbreak involving the variant first reported in South Africa. Health Minister Dorothy Shephard said she is saddened by the news. ""I join all New Brunswickers in sharing sincere condolences with this person's loved ones during this difficult time,"" she said in a statement. On Sunday, Public Health announced another resident of the special care home, someone in their 80s, had died in hospital ""as a result of COVID-19."" With the 15 new cases, there are now 142 active cases of respiratory disease in the province. Six people are in hospital, including two in intensive care. The breakdown of the new cases is as follows: Moncton region, Zone 1: one case: A person 30 to 39 This case is a contact of a previously confirmed case. Saint John region, Zone 2: three cases: A person 30 to 39 A person 40 to 49 A person 50 to 59 One case is under investigation, one case is travel-related and the other is a contact of a previously confirmed case.

New Brunswick has had 1,954 confirmed cases of COVID-19 since the pandemic started just over a year ago. There have been 1,773 recoveries so far. A total of 295,822 tests have been conducted, including 1,339 on Sunday. UNB residence elevator eyed as possible source Public Health is investigating whether an elevator could be the source of transmission in the University of New Brunswick's Fredericton campus residence COVID-19 outbreak that still stands at 12 positive cases, as of Monday. Last week, Public Health and UNB looked into the ventilation system at Magee House and determined ""the risk is minimal,"" said Department of Health spokesperson Bruce Macfarlane. ""Public Health officials are now focusing their efforts to determine surface contacts within the elevator as the potential source of transmission,"" he said in an email. UNB's Magee House residence has about 180 adults and children living in the 101 apartment-style units, according to resident Martin Kutnowski.(Ed Hunter/CBC) According to the Public Health Agency of Canada, COVID-19 spreads from an infected person to others through respiratory droplets and aerosols (smaller droplets) created when an infected person talks, sings, shouts, coughs or sneezes. COVID-19 can also spread by touching something that has the virus on it, then touching your mouth, nose or eyes with unwashed hands, the agency's website states. The outbreak at Magee House involves the variant first reported in India, which has two mutations that make it ""more concerning than all the others,"" Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Jennifer Russell has said. It is ""very, very, very aggressive in terms of being contagious and causing more severe symptoms."" Magee House is a seven-storey apartment-style residence designed for mature students, some of whom have families. The residents remain in isolation as Public Health deals with the outbreak. Paul Mazerolle, president and vice-chancellor of the University of New Brunswick, says isolation needs to happen at Magee House to prevent the spread of COVID-19.(Ed Hunter/CBC) Meanwhile, the UNB campus reopened Monday, as did the adjacent St Thomas University campus and nearby New Brunswick Community College campus, more than a week after they moved to essential services only in response to the outbreak. Faculty, staff and students can now go on campus as long as they follow relevant operational guidelines. ""COVID is difficult,"" said Paul Mazerolle, president of the University of New Brunswick. ""The uncertainty creates concern and we're not through this."" Monday marks day nine of the Magee House lockdown, and a third round of mass testing was scheduled for residents and staff on Sunday. As of Monday afternoon, Public Health was still awaiting the results. Alex Hill-Stosky, who lives with his family in Magee House, said many people in the building are either anxious or angry because of the lockdown. ""A lot of people feel we are test subjects rather than people,"" said the engineering student. Residents of Magee House at the University of New Brunswick in Fredericton are in quarantine after at least 12 people tested positive for COVID-19. (Maria Jose Burgos/CBC) Mazerolle said he understands people are concerned and worried about their personal freedoms, but it's important to limit the spread of the virus. ""To minimize the potential spread, unfortunately people's movements need to be restricted for a limited period of time. … If we didn't restrict movement, we could be in a much worse situation."" Students have also expressed concerns over the residence's ventilation system. Mazerolle said the ventilation system has been checked twice and deemed safe by engineers with Public Health and the Department of Environment. ""From what I've been told by the experts, there's no evidence to suggest that the ventilation system is putting people at risk for COVID-19. Mazerolle expects Magee House to reopen on Saturday. ""We're looking forward to this coming to an end,"" he said. Public Health said the isolation period for Magee House individuals who have tested negative throughout the process could end Saturday. Meanwhile, the isolation for residents and staff of UNB's Elizabeth Parr-Johnston residence could be lifted as early as Wednesday, depending on the results of retests taking place Monday, said Public Health. So far, all test results have been negative. George Street Middle School reopens George Street Middle School in Fredericton reopened Monday, six days after students, staff and their families were urged by Public Health to self-isolate last week following a confirmed case of COVID-19. In a letter to parents on Sunday, Public Health said students and staff can return to school, and their families can return to work, with the exception of those who have been told by Public Health to self-isolate for 14 days. New Brunswick Public Health confirmed a case of COVID-19 at George Street Middle School in Fredericton last week.(Elizabeth Fraser/CBC) ""Custodial services have been through the school disinfecting high touch areas,"" said Dr. Jennifer Russell, New Brunswick's chief medical officer of health. ""Everyone who has not been identified as a close contact should feel confident to return to normal activities."" The George Street and UNB cases are linked, Public Health said earlier. Voting in self-isolation Elections New Brunswick is encouraging people who are under COVID-19 isolation and haven't voted in the May 10 municipal election yet but wish to do so to contact their local returning office to find out what options are available. With election day less than a week away, the options available are starting to decrease, said Kim Poffenroth, municipal election officer. Municipal election officer Kim Poffenroth asks everyone to be patient as election officials, who are all temporary workers hired for just a few days of work, do their best to deliver these elections during the 'unusual and challenging circumstances of this pandemic.'(Screenshot/ParlVu) ""Our municipal returning officers will gladly work with these individuals to determine the best way to arrange for them to vote, based on their current situation,"" she said in a statement. Options may include voting by mail, if time permits, curbside voting, and other forms of contactless voting. ""We will do our utmost to make sure every New Brunswicker is provided with the opportunity to vote, while at the same time respecting public health rules and protecting the thousands of people working for us during these elections,"" Poffenroth said.

They were so effective that she didn't even make it to hearings, she withdrew her name because everyone knew that her confirmation would be an uphill battle and she would probably not get the job, which would spend much of Obama's political capital.

Their agenda was to get Rice out of the picture and get John Kerry the job.

But why would the GOP want John Kerry?

Because that means that Kerry has to leave the Senate and a special off-year election has to be held, that's why.

Since off-year elections are more favorable to Republicans, all they have to do is run Scott Brown (MA's most famous Republican) and get a Senate seat.

The problem is that Scott Brown just recently announced that he's not running, which gives us a great shot of keeping the seat blue. No other MA Republican has the name rec or fundraising capability that Brown does. He is the only real hope of the GOP taking Kerry's seat. This dream of their's is now ruined.

But that's not all...

Susan Rice supported Keystone XL and I've read a few places that she even had investments in the project and would personally profit.

If Susan Rice was confirmed, I imagine Keystone XL would have been as well.

John Kerry is firmly opposed to Keystone XL and will most likely (hopefully) put the brakes on this disaster waiting to happen.

So overall, the GOP's plan to get Scott Brown back in the Senate has failed and now their plan to build a dangerous pipeline across America looks like it might fail as well.

They'll never say it in public, but I bet if they knew then what they know now, they would just go ahead and confirm Rice.

I believe in karma and that what goes around comes around.

The GOP tried to obstruct and play politics to gain political power and it blew up in their faces.

I jut wanted to point this out. :)"

(CNN) —

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani made his case Thursday to the American people and the world for “a constructive approach” to contentious issues including his nation’s nuclear program, arguing that failing to engage “leads to everyone’s loss.”

“We must work together to end the unhealthy rivalries and interferences that fuel violence and drive us apart,” Rouhani said in an op-ed published Thursday evening on the Washington Post’s website.

It’s not the first time a leader from a country often at odds with the United States has used its newspapers to convey his or her views. Just last week, for instance, Russian President Vladimir Putin argued against international military intervention in Syria and jabbed his U.S. counterpart for saying Americans should consider themselves “exceptional” – a remark that quickly elicited derision from across the U.S. political spectrum.

But Rouhani’s tone differed from Putin’s, echoing the theme of “prudence and hope” and the promise of more positive engagement with the rest of the world that helped propel him to an election win in June.

“To move beyond impasses, … we need to aim higher,” he said. “Rather than focusing on how to prevent things from getting worse, we need to think – and talk – about how to make things better.”

Contending “the age of blood feuds” and the idea of diplomacy as a “zero-sum game” no longer apply in a “changed” world, Rouhani said leaders should engage each other “on the basis of equal footing and mutual respect.”

“My approach to foreign policy seeks to resolve … issues by addressing their underlying causes,” he said. “We must work together to end the unhealthy rivalries and interferences that fuel violence and drive us apart.”

Chief among those issues, for Iran, is its nuclear program. Iranian officials have insisted its aim is peaceful and for energy purposes only, but skeptical U.S., Israeli and other officials accuse Tehran of working to develop nuclear weapons. Iran’s lack of openness on the issue and its perceived lack of cooperation with international nuclear authorities, have led to stringent international sanctions and increased tensions in the region.

In his opinion column Thursday, Rouhani sought to frame the debate over what he called “our peaceful nuclear energy program.” This program, he said, is tied into not only addressing Iran’s energy needs but also into establishing its place in the world.

“To us, mastering the atomic fuel cycle and generating nuclear power is as much about diversifying our energy resources as it is about who Iranians are as a nation, our demand for dignity and respect, and our consequent place in the world,” he said.

The Washington Post column appears to be part of a U.S.-targeted public relations initiative by Rouhani, coming a day after he talked with NBC News.

In that interview, Rouhani said, “We have never pursued or sought a nuclear bomb and we are not going to do so.”

Iran’s Rouhani: Diplomat’s touch, no pushover

There’s little dispute Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is Iran’s most powerful figure. Still, Rouhani said Thursday that he and his delegation will head to New York with the “full power and has complete authority” to make a deal with others on nuclear matters.

The Iranian president also talked about trading letters with Obama this summer, an exchange he called “positive and constructive.”

“It could be subtle and tiny steps for a very important future,” Rouhani told NBC, according to video on the network’s website. “I believe the leaders in all countries could think in their national interests and that they should not be under the influence of (interest) groups.”

Rouhani’s Washington Post op-ed published a few hours after U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry – also speaking in Washington – characterized some of the new Iranian president’s remarks as “very positive.”

Yet he offered his compliment with a caveat: “Everything needs to be put to the test, and we’ll see where we go.”

Iranian human rights activist freed

Kerry punted on a question of whether Rouhani and U.S. President Barack Obama will meet next week when both attend the U.N. General Assembly in New York.

Asked the same question Wednesday, White House spokesman Jay Carney said “there are currently no plans” for such a face-to-face meeting though he also didn’t rule it out.

And Carney did hint the United States is open to talks with Iran – with whom it has feuded regarding Iran’s nuclear program, a dispute that’s led to harsh international sanctions and raised the specter of war in the region – to “test” whether Tehran is sincere in its hope to improve its international standing.

“I think it’s fair to say that (Obama) believes there is an opportunity for diplomacy when it comes to the issues that have presented challenges to the United States and our allies with regards to Iran,” Carney said. “And we hope that the Iranian government takes advantage of this opportunity.”

In fact, there were high-level talks Thursday – involving Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.

Zarif called the meeting “constructive,” saying it involved “satisfactory negotiations” on various issues such as Iran’s nuclear program, according to the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency.

Ban’s office also issued a positive statement on the meeting, saying the two “discussed Iran’s growing cooperation with the international community on a host of issues, including the nuclear file, as well the role Iran could play in promoting a political solution to the conflict in Syria.”

This cooperation has been spearheaded by Rouhani, himself a former nuclear negotiator who vowed during his campaign to try to reduce tensions between Iran and the outside world.

That includes expressing openness in talks on its nuclear program. The 64-year-old cleric, who is considered a moderate, said last month that as long as there are “negotiations without threats, the way for interaction is open.”

The American government has already spent about $107 million — double the initial estimate — on the five-story Defense Ministry headquarters, which will include state-of-the-art bunkers and the second-largest auditorium in Kabul.

But now, four years after the groundbreaking, construction crews have had to effectively halt their work. The reason: The U.S. government has run out of money for the project.

For years, audits and inspector general’s reports have documented waste and mismanagement in American aid projects in Afghanistan. But the Defense Ministry building is a dramatic example of how poor oversight continues to plague the massive U.S. investment here.

“Nobody was watching it like they should, and it’s just been an open checkbook,” said an American official involved in the management of the project, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the news media. “We failed, big time.”

The Afghan National Army sustained heavy casualties in the recent fighting season. But Post Kabul bureau chief Kevin Sieff says there's cautious optimism about the ANA's performance as the U.S. accelerates its troop reduction. (The Washington Post)

The 516,000-square-foot building is part of a multi-year, $9.3 billion construction spree aimed at providing hundreds of bases, outposts and hospitals for the Afghan military. Nearly all of it is financed by the U.S. government.

But even though most American troops are scheduled to withdraw from the country by late next year, 291 projects remain in the planning stages or under construction; 835 are complete.

The American-led military coalition is appealing to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel to authorize an additional $24 million for the Afghan defense headquarters, already one of the costliest U.S-financed buildings in the country.

While awaiting the extra funding, officials have dispatched a skeleton crew to install windows to protect the building from the harsh Kabul winter.

“We have gotten ourselves into a position that we need to get out of, and we definitely need to fix it,” said Brig. Gen. Michael E. Wehr, the deputy chief of staff engineers for the U.S.-led coalition. “It’s an important building. It’s a Ministry of Defense headquarters. It’s in Kabul. We’ve got to get this done right.”

A pattern of setbacks

Since 2005, Congress has allocated about $53 billion to help equip, train, house and feed the 348,000 members of Afghanistan’s army and police force. But as that money has poured into Afghanistan, American military leaders have struggled to contain cost overruns and construction delays and to deal with ill-trained or corrupt contractors.

U.S. military officials say they have no evidence that the Afghan Defense Ministry project has been set back by missing or stolen funds. But military commanders have requested a U.S. Defense Department audit of the project.

They say the project was hampered by unrealistic cost projections, a poorly trained Afghan workforce, heavy snow in Kabul during the 2011-2012 winter and delays in getting materials into Afghanistan.

The project hit a snag before it even broke ground, said U.S. Col. Butch Graham, command engineer for Combined Security Transition Command-Afghanistan, the lead agency for distributing and overseeing coalition funds to the Afghan military.

Contractors had to clear the site by tearing down a dining hall for Afghan troops and rebuilding it elsewhere. But the contractor defaulted and had to be terminated, Graham said.

When construction finally began, security officials decided that work crews could not be housed on the site and had to stay at a camp miles away. That meant they had to spend time daily traveling to and from the construction site, located inside Kabul’s heavily fortified “green zone.”

A larger obstacle, however, was the delay in importing steel and other materials for the building, which is being constructed to withstand an 8.0-magnitude earthquake and will include space for 2,200 Afghan military officials and commanders.

Wehr said convoys were frequently idled at Afghanistan’s border with Pakistan. Truckers have to pay hefty customs fees, and border crossings are frequently closed because of security concerns, officials said.

Last year, The Washington Post reported that Afghan commanders were requesting features for the building that Pentagon officials viewed as too costly or unrealistic. Graham says U.S. officials have fended off most such requests but did agree to a 1,000-seat auditorium for large gatherings of military officials.

John F. Sopko, the special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction, said the project’s woes fit a pattern of “poor planning, poor recordkeeping, poor oversight and poor security” amid a “rush to spend” U.S. tax dollars on the Afghan military.

Of particular concern, Sopko said, is that U.S. military commanders frequently rotate in and out of Afghanistan. U.S. officials familiar with the project say such turnover is partially to blame for the problems. Contractors repeatedly requested additional funds but did not receive a thorough vetting of their bills or performance, the officials said.

“That is a recipe for disaster,” Sopko said.

Projections and predictions

U.S. officials hope that the Defense Ministry headquarters will be completed late next year with the additional funds requested.

But Sopko’s office estimates that 47 planned Afghan military projects worth about $1.1 billion won’t be finished until at least 2015, leaving them vulnerable to rising tensions between the Obama administration and Afghan President Hamid Karzai.

Karzai recently stunned U.S. officials by announcing that he would delay signing a long-term bilateral security accord. If the agreement is not signed quickly, the administration has warned, President Obama may not keep up to 10,000 troops in Afghanistan after the formal U.S. combat mission ends late next year.

The pullout could mean that the Air Force Civil Engineer Center, which is overseeing the Defense Ministry headquarters, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers won’t be around to manage uncompleted projects.

If the accord isn’t completed, the Afghan military could lose $4.1 billion in annual direct assistance that the United States and its coalition partners have pledged through 2018.

During a meeting between Karzai and his national security council on Sunday, military leaders questioned whether the Defense Ministry headquarters and other U.S.-funded projects were being deliberately slowed to exert pressure on the Afghan president to sign the agreement, according to a senior Afghan official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Coalition officials strongly deny that assertion, and government documents show that the Defense Ministry project has been troubled for years.

When work began in 2009, the headquarters was scheduled to be completed in October 2010. That deadline was quickly extended, and the cost of the project had risen to $67 million by spring 2012. By earlier this year, it had ballooned to $108 million, with a Dec. 31 completion date.

In September, however, the project hit “funds exhaustion,” Graham said.

A spokesman for the prime contractor, Rhode Island-based Innovative Technical Solutions/Gilbane, declined to comment. But Mohammad Rafi, owner of a Kabul-based construction company, said he and other subcontractors were abruptly sent home in September and are still not clear why.

“We were just told, ‘They have to stop it,’ ” Rafi said, adding that he is still awaiting payment for a few invoices."

Most of the Americans were working as Arabic translators for Global Linguist Solutions, which ended a lucrative deal with its sponsoring Kuwaiti subcontractor, Al Shora International General Trading & Contracting and signed on with another company. Sources told FoxNews.com Al Shora's managing director is the sister-in-law of the Kuwaiti prime minister.

When the contract ended Feb. 17, Al Shora refused to transfer the employees' visas to the new Kuwaiti subcontractor and falsely accused the Americans of being ""runaways and absconders,"" according to Charles Tolleson, president of Global Linguist Solutions. His company has barred workers from leaving the bases since May 31 to protect them from arrest and imprisonment.

[pullquote]

""My biggest concern is the safety and security of my employees in Kuwait,"" he said.

One of the employees, who contacted FoxNews.com Tuesday morning from Camp Buehring, said, ""If we leave the base, we could be arrested by the Kuwaiti authorities, jailed or deported.""

""We cannot see the doctor even for an emergency,"" said the woman, who asked that her name not be used. ""Everybody here is under stress because a lot of us here need to go home. Our families are worried about us. We need to see our kids... We don’t see any hope. We’re dealing with a corrupt company in Kuwait that has fabricated charges against us.""

She said the Al Shora's managing director ""cancelled all of our visas here, so we became illegal.""

Camp Buehring is in the Kuwaiti desert, about 25 miles south of the Iraqi border. Other employees of Global Linguistics are similarly stuck at Camp Arifjan, another U.S. Army base inside Kuwait.

Al Shora is demanding $22 million from Global Linguistics in order to transfer the employees' visas to the new company, Kuwaiti Resources House, sources said. Under Kuwaiti law, foreigners cannot work in the country unless they are under the sponsorship of a private Kuwaiti company.

After his company re-bid its contract several months ago and opted to chose the new Kuwaiti company, ""Al Shora basically embarked on a campaign to destroy my company,"" Tolleson said.

""There’s no contract dispute. I don’t even have a contract with them anymore,"" he said of Al Shora. ""If a sponsor is no longer a sponsor, they are required to simply transfer [the visas] to the new sponsor. This happens all the time. They won’t do that, and that violates the terms of their former contract.""

A representative from the Kuwaiti prime minister's office said he was not aware of the situation.

""This is the first time I heard about this,"" the representative, who declined to give his name, told FoxNews.com. ""This kind of behavior has never happened.""

He had no comment when asked if the Al Shora's managing director was related to Kuwaiti Prime Minister Jaber Al-Mubarak Al-Hamad Al-Sabah

Tolleson said that when he approached the U.S. military about the situation, ""I was told this is my problem.""

The office for the U.S. Ambassador to Kuwait referred all inquiries on the matter to the U.S. State Department.

“The U.S. Embassy in Kuwait is aware of the commercial dispute involving a Department of Defense contractor and a local Kuwaiti company,"" Beth Gosselin, as a State Department spokeswoman, told FoxNews.com. ""That dispute has had an impact on a number of private U.S. citizens working in Kuwait.

""The protection of U.S. citizens overseas is one of our highest priorities,"" Gosselin added. ""The U.S. Embassy is working with the private U.S. citizens and is providing them with appropriate consular assistance. The Embassy continues to monitor the situation closely and is encouraging an immediate resolution to this difficult issue.""

At least three of the linguists reportedly spent seven days in a crowded, filthy jail after being caught outside their base. Majdi Abdulghani was detained by police May 9, as he prepared to board a plane on an approved trip to Jordan to visit his sick mother, the military newspaper Stars and Stripes reported. He spent seven days in jail before being flown back to the U.S., according to the newspaper."
http://globalpublicsquare.blogs.cnn.com/2013/04/08/why-iran-isnt-the-soviet-union/,2013-04-08 00:00:00,[],Why Iran isn’t the Soviet Union,"By Jonathan Adelman, Special to CNN

Editor’s note: Jonathan Adelman is a professor at the Josef Korbel School of International Studies at the University of Denver. The views expressed are his own.

Despite the rhetoric of the Obama administration and tougher sanctions, hard realities suggest a likely American policy of not attacking Iran but seeking to contain it.

For Iran, the benefits of nuclear weapons are significant: becoming the ninth member of the world’s exclusive nuclear club, spurring nationalist ardor at home, potentially dominating the Middle East, enhancing its leadership of the world’s neutralist bloc, offsetting the likely loss of their main Arab ally Syria and deterring an American attack. America’s desire to stop Iran, meanwhile, is constrained by many factors: withdrawal of an aircraft carrier battle fleet from the Persian Gulf, $80 billion in Iranian hard currency reserves, opposition from Russia and China, foreign efforts to help Iran evade international sanctions, American war weariness, economic malaise, Congressional hyper partisanship and the Obama policy of leading from behind.

Trying to contain a nuclear Iran avoids an unpopular military strike, regional war and harsher sanctions. And most appealing of all, containment succeeded for 40 years with the Soviet Union, culminating in its dissolution in 1991.

There is only one critical problem with the alluring temptation of containment —the Islamic Republic of Iran is no Soviet Union. The Soviet Union was a global superpower, with a vast military-industrial complex and Red Army whose World War II victories helped defeat Nazi Germany. During the Cold War the Soviet Union had several thousand strategic nuclear weapons capable of destroying the United States. The Red Army dominated Eastern and much of Central Europe and threatened Western Europe.

More from CNN: Two sides remain far apart

By contrast, Iran is a second rate military and economic power. It reactivated its nuclear program in 1984 and has still not exploded its first atomic bomb. In the 1980s, even after eight years, it could not defeat Iraq, a task that the United States accomplished in three weeks in 2003. With only several hundred atomic scientists, Iran relies heavily on foreign help for its nuclear project. It possesses a modest missile force, weak army and no modern navy. Iran lags far behind Israel, with its strong air force and 100 to 200 atomic bombs, and NATO stalwart Turkey. Iran’s $13,000 GNP/capita lags far behind the United States ($49,000), United Arab Emirates ($49,000) and Israel ($32,000).

Second, Iran lacks Soviet global political influence and ideological clout. Moscow was the center of international communism that embraced one third of the world’s population. Iran’s Islamic fundamentalism resonates only among 2 percent of the world’s population (mostly 100+ million Shiites). It has few state allies (Syria, North Korea, Venezuela, Iraq?) and only two non-state actors (Hezbollah and Hamas).

Third, the Soviet Union was largely rational in its foreign policy. When the Berlin Blockade (1948), Cuban missile crisis (1962) and invasion of Afghanistan (1979) failed, it withdrew its forces. It maintained embassies in enemy countries and a hot line with Washington after 1962. Moscow conducted prolonged negotiations with the West that resulted in several treaties. Iran does not have embassies or hot lines with its “enemies,” supports international terrorism, conducts cyber attacks on Western targets and often talks recklessly of destroying Israel.

Fourth, the Soviet nuclear threat was remote, many thousands of miles away, and slowed by liquid fueled rockets that took hours to fire. Iranian rockets, on the other hand, are solid fuel and only hundreds of miles from their targets.

Finally, there is the nature of leadership. The Soviet elite were dominated by secular college graduates, heavily engineers, who had a rational international perspective. The Iranian elite are dominated by radical mullahs with a limited world view.

Containment of a nuclear power under any circumstances is a risky business. Containment even of the relatively rational Soviet Union almost led to a nuclear war over Cuba in 1962. Imagine what could happen in trying to contain an Iran lacking many of the rational aspects of the Soviet Union.

A rogue state operating outside the normal international boundaries is more likely to take radical gambles. A militarily, economically and politically weak regime, led by radical mullahs with an eschatological world view on the coming of the Mahdi, may take chances for great goals that no other state would ever take. The danger of accidental launch under presumed attack is far higher for the amateurish Iranian Revolutionary Guards than the professional officers and KGB Border Guards in charge of Soviet nuclear weapons.

As in Greek mythology, the siren song of containing a nuclear Iran is hugely tempting and alluring – but in the end may lead to shipwreck and disaster."

When President Barack Obama recently addressed the United Nations General Assembly this week, the speech ran to more than 5,000 words, most of them focused on turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa. Yet the president never mentioned the continuing genocide conducted in several parts of Sudan by President Omar al-Bashir.



There was a time when Mr. Obama expressed outrage over the mass murder and aerial bombardment of civilians in the Darfur region of western Sudan. In 2007, the then-presidential hopeful said the Western world's silence regarding the slaughter in Sudan would leave ""a stain on our souls.""



Now President Obama has joined that silence. These days, to learn about what is transpiring in Sudan, one must turn to Radio Dabanga, broadcasting from Denmark. A recent report described the bombardment of a Darfur village called Abu Tega, which was ""completely burned and the population fled in all directions.""



President Obama's critics have denounced his foreign-policy choices, which they believe have weakened the global credibility of the U.S. But Mr. Obama has managed to avoid scrutiny about his most tragic foreign failure: standing by as Sudan's Islamic regime perpetrates a slaughter against its own citizens who belong to non-Arab ethnic groups. Bashir continues a 10-year annihilation, slaughtering many tens of thousands, and very likely more.



Previous American presidents have betrayed a similar callous disregard for the taking of human life. Most notably Bill Clinton, who did nothing to stop genocidal assaults in Rwanda, where the Hutus slaughtered 800,000 Tutsis in 1994. Mr. Clinton has come to see this inaction as his most historic dereliction of duty. He has since admitted that the international community was complicit in mass murder abroad when the U.S. could have acted to save a few hundred thousand lives.



""We did not act quickly enough after the killing began,"" Mr. Clinton said on a reconciliation tour in Rwanda in 1998. ""We did not immediately call these crimes by their rightful name: genocide. ... We owe to all the people in the world our best efforts to organize ourselves so that we can maximize the chances of preventing these events.""



Mr. Clinton's regrets offer a cautionary tale. President Obama and his current National Security Adviser Susan Rice would agree -- or at least they did when in 2007, they separately condemned the Bush administration for its inaction in Sudan, specifically citing the Clinton administration's failure in Rwanda. Both proclaimed that the U.S. should never again fail to intervene when innocents are being slaughtered.



Mr. Obama has cited humanitarian reasons to intervene in a crisis when politically convenient. He entered Libya ""to prevent a bloodbath,"" despite no mass slaughter of civilians in the country. This disingenuous explanation only damaged his credibility as a humanitarian, though it did placate the international human-rights community.



So why does Sudan not deserve the same consideration? An enormous number of civilian lives are at stake in Darfur. Bashir's assaults against the people of Sudan have escalated in intensity. Some three million people are living -- if you can even call it that -- in refugee camps with wretched conditions. They lack even food, water, sanitation and basic medical attention. Hundreds of thousands of children are growing up malnourished with stunted growth and damaged cognitive abilities. If they survive, they are left without an education to a lifetime of suffering, with many likely eventually succumbing to disease.



And the camps are hardly safe. Bashir's henchmen continue to attack them, and torch villages and fields, indiscriminately murder roughly 10,000 people per month. Still more Darfuris continue to die from disease and other causes at alarming rates, with the dead no longer even counted. The world is unaware of the carnage because the region is closed to the international community and media. Even many key U.N. and humanitarian personnel have been expelled recently.



There is a moral imperative to help the people of Darfur, which President Obama once articulated well. In 2007 he said, ""Today we know what is right, and today we know what is wrong. The slaughter of innocents is wrong. Two million people driven from their homes is wrong. Women gang raped while gathering firewood is wrong. And silence, acquiescence and paralysis in the face of genocide is wrong."" He made his solution clear: ""We've got to have a protective force on the ground.""



Yet those suffering in Darfur can expect no such ""protective force."" For reasons that are unclear, Sudan doesn't meet Mr. Obama's threshold for action. His words at the U.N., including generic rhetoric ""that it is in our interest to see a Middle East and North Africa that is peaceful and prosperous,"" offer little hope if any. Mr. Obama has abandoned his own moral standards and left the people of Darfur to perish.

(CNN) —

Hours before the top diplomats from his nation and the United States begin a high-stakes meeting, Russian President Vladimir Putin took to The New York Times to argue against military intervention in Syria and jab his U.S. counterpart.

Using an op-ed “to speak directly to the American people and their political leaders … at a time of insufficient communication between our societies,” Putin made a case much like U.S. President Barack Obama did Tuesday night – although their arguments could hardly have been more different.

Striking Syria would have many negative ramifications, Putin argued in a piece that went online Wednesday night, including the killing of innocent people, spreading violence around the Middle East, clouding diplomatic efforts to address Iran’s nuclear crisis and resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and “unleash(ing) a new wave of terrorism.”

Moreover, the Russian leader said such action without the U.N. Security Council’s approval “would constitute an act of aggression.”

“It could throw the entire system of international law and order out of balance,” Putin said.

Contrast this to Obama’s assertion that failing to act in Syria opens the door to more chemical weapons attacks in Syria and in other nations – as well as among terrorist groups – by giving the impression that the international community won’t act in the face of blatant violations on bans of their use.

READ: Putin comments cause a stir

And whereas the U.S. president blamed the August 21 sarin gas attack that U.S. officials estimate killed 1,400 people squarely on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Putin wrote “there is every reason to believe it was used not by the Syrian army, but by opposition forces to provoke intervention by their powerful foreign patrons, who would be siding with the fundamentalists.”

READ: Syria’s weapons: Mission impossible?

Calling Syria’s ongoing civil war an “internal conflict, fueled by foreign weapons supplied to the opposition,” Putin cautioned against siding with an opposition in Syria he says includes “more than enough (al) Qaeda fighters and extremists of all stripes.” (He did not mention the fact Russia has long supplied arms to Syria’s government, or that U.S. officials have said they are funneling aid only to members of what they call the “moderate opposition.”)

The Russian president ended his op-ed – just after mentioning a “growing trust” between him and his U.S. counterpart – with a swipe at a remark Obama made Tuesday contending that “with modest effort and risk, we can stop children from being gassed to death and thereby make our own children safer over the long run.”

“I believe we should act,” Obama said then. “That’s what makes America different. That’s what makes us exceptional. With humility, but with resolve, let us never lose sight of that essential truth.”

Putin challenged the statement, saying, “It is extremely dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional, whatever the motivation.”

“We are all different,” the Russian leader concluded, “but when we ask for the Lord’s blessings, we must not forget that God created us equal.”

Reacting to that remark and Putin’s op-ed generally, a senior White House official said Wednesday night “that’s all irrelevant.”

“He’s fully invested in Syria’s (chemical weapons) disarmament and that’s potentially better than a military strike, which would deter and degrade but wouldn’t get rid of all the chemical weapons,” the official said.

“(Putin) now owns this,” the official added of the Russian plan to have Syria’s leadership give up its chemical weapons. “He has fully asserted ownership of it, and he needs to deliver.”

All eyes turn to U.S.-Russia talks in Geneva

It is extremely dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional, whatever the motivation. Russian President Vladimir Putin

Putin’s piece went online around the time U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry headed to Geneva, Switzerland, to meet with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.

Their two days of talks will revolve around a Moscow proposal to avert a U.S.-led strike in Syria by having the Syrian government put its chemical weapons stockpile under international control.

In his speech Tuesday, Obama said he was willing to test the seriousness and feasibility of the initiative before resuming his push for congressional authorization for military action, which at the moment appears unlikely to succeed.

Kerry is taking the lead in dealing with the Russians. That includes regular conversations with Lavrov, including Wednesday when the two talked by phone about “their shared objective of having a substantive discussion about the mechanics of identifying, verifying and ultimately destroying Assad’s chemical weapons,” said a senior State Department official.

“It’s too early to tell whether this offer will succeed, and any agreement must verify that the Assad regime keeps its commitments,” Obama said in his prime-time address to a war-weary public skeptical of another military venture in the Middle East.

“But this initiative has the potential to remove the threat of chemical weapons without the use of force, particularly because Russia is one of Assad’s strongest allies.”

Russian officials have submitted a plan to the United States, Russia’s Itar-Tass news agency reported Wednesday, citing a Russian diplomatic source.

Yet White House spokesman Jay Carney said that while conversations have taken place, he was unaware of a full, formal proposal.

“I think we’re not at the stage of putting down public pieces of paper,” he said.

Vladimir Chizhov, Russia’s emissary to the European Union, said the plan calls for Syria’s chemical weapons to be placed under international supervision – inside that country initially, at least.

“The ultimate aim is to have these weapons destroyed,” Chizhov told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour.

He acknowledged the task of gaining control of the weapons and destroying them with a civil war raging in Syria won’t be easy, voicing worries about what rebel fighters might do.

Separately, the United States, France, and Britain discussed a U.N. Security Council draft resolution, according to a spokesman for British Prime Minister David Cameron.

How long will window be open?

Ambassadors from the U.N. Security Council’s five permanent members – the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France – met the same day for less than an hour, a diplomat with knowledge of the meeting said.

While the focus now is on Switzerland, U.N. headquarters in New York is expected to become the focal point early next week when U.N. chemical weapons inspectors deliver their report to the Security Council – as early as Monday or Tuesday, sources say – on the August 21 attack in Syria.

In Washington, the debate about what the United States should do in Syria is not over. While Obama has said he wants to give the diplomatic process a chance, he hasn’t said how long he’ll wait before possibly pushing again for military action.

After his meeting earlier this week with Senate Democrats, Sen. Dick Durbin said the president asked lawmakers “for some time to work things out – a matter of days into next week.” Another Senate Democrat, though, said it could take weeks to determine if diplomatic efforts will pan out.

Members of Congress will watch Kerry’s trip closely for a sense of Obama’s next move after weeks of beating the drum for military action against Syria.

“If diplomacy fails, he’s painted himself into a corner,” Sen. Lindsey Graham said after Obama’s speech. “The leader of the free world can’t say all these things at the end of the day and do nothing.”

Senior State Department officials have cautioned that negotiations over the proposed deal may not conclude after the scheduled round of talks in Geneva. The plan would be to take any final deal to the U.N. Security Council to be formalized in a resolution.

Outcome far from certain

While that process unfolds – if it does successfully – Obama continued to keep the door open for military action, despite exhortations from Putin that he drop any hint of a threat.

The U.S. president has said any military operation in Syria would be targeted, limited and not involve U.S. ground forces. Its goal would be to degrade al-Assad’s ability to use chemical weapons.

Obama has also said any strike would be effective – saying Tuesday that “the United States military doesn’t do pinpricks” – and he has ordered armed forces to be poised in the region “to keep the pressure on Assad.”

U.S.-funded (if not U.S.-made) weapons began flowing to Syrian rebels about two weeks ago, a U.S. official said. Coordinated by the CIA, the supplies include light weapons, ammunition and anti-tank weapons in addition to nonlethal aid the United States has long been providing.

A big question looming over the diplomatic talks is whether any U.N. resolution includes a potential for military action should al-Assad not cooperate. That’s something the United States and its allies have favored, while Putin has said his country could veto any measure there that contains such a threat.

CNN Poll: Part of Syria strike opposition is the messenger’s fault

Analysts say Kerry, as leader of the U.S. diplomatic efforts, has his work cut out for him.

“I think it’s unlikely the Russian government is going to relent on this issue of whether or not it would support the use of force in a security council resolution,” said Nicholas Burns, a former senior State Department official now at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government.

“They’ve been consistent since day one of the Syrian crisis that they did not want to see the United States or anyone else use force. I think that’s one of the ambitions the Russians have going into this negotiation in Geneva,” he added.

Obama makes case: opinion

Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said in an exclusive interview on CNN’s “The Lead with Jake Tapper” that Kerry must not take the threat of force off the table in his talks with the Russians even if they insist he drop it.

“This is the way that diplomacy works. You use the threat of the use of force to get some action in diplomacy, and then diplomacy just to figure out what you do about the threat of the use of force,” said Albright, who served as America’s top diplomat under President Bill Clinton.

“One of the things I know from trying to get Security Council resolutions is that they take a while,” said Albright. “But my personal feeling here is that it is that threat of the use of force, and the president made very clear that our ships would stay in the area, and that the use of force would stay on the table.”

On Sunday, Mr. Obama stood in that same tiny prison cell — now a monument to Mr. Mandela, South Africa’s first black president — and showed his wife and two daughters the place where Mr. Mandela spent 18 of his 27 years behind bars during his long campaign to end his country’s policies of racial apartheid and oppression.

Later, Mr. Obama again invoked the legacy of Mr. Mandela, 94, who remained in critical condition at a Pretoria, South Africa, hospital, during a speech to the African people he delivered from the University of Cape Town.

In the speech, he called Mr. Mandela the ultimate testament to the process of peaceful change and said his daughters better understood his legacy now. “Seeing them stand within the walls that once surrounded Nelson Mandela, I knew this was an experience they would never forget,” Mr. Obama said."

The opposing events led the group to focus on a question asked on Friday by many in Syria’s beleaguered opposition: Would the promised aid come in time, or would be it be too little, too late?

An older rebel who leads a few dozen fighters on one of the front lines in Aleppo was skeptical. “I’ll believe that America is helping us when I see American arms in my group’s hands, not statements and food baskets,” said the 40-year-old fighter, who calls himself Abu Zaki. “We will accept all support even from Satan to finish the Assad regime, then we will not forget those who stand and support us and who stand and support the regime.”

At the same time, he said, he did not understand American fears that arms would go to Al Nusra Front, a rebel group linked to Al Qaeda, since it had never attacked Western targets."

As midlife sets in, maintaining a healthy weight often becomes harder. Tricks that worked in the past, like cutting down on wine or sugar, no longer seem to work, either. Even slender Samantha Cameron, now 50, has apparently been affected. In her 30s and early 40s, staying in shape was easy, she said this weekend, “but then I hit 43, I just put on three-quarters of a stone. Suddenly you don’t quite fit any of your things and I got really bloated.” At first she tried doing the 5:2 diet – eating normally five days a week, then having just 500 calories on the other two – but “I just couldn’t do it, I literally couldn’t speak in the evening, I had to go to bed at 7pm.” She has recently found a solution: the 5:2 principles, but with 800 calories on the “fast” days, and says she’s “loving it” and “the bloating’s gone”. Alongside three weekly workouts, she says it’s helping to keep her trim: her goal is “to hit my 50s in almost as good shape as I hit my 40s.” If you’re struggling to maintain your weight and fitness post-50, here’s why – and what to do about it: Muscle mass Every decade after the age of 30, we on average lose three to eight per cent of our muscle mass. At first, this might not be noticeable, but by 50 or 60, will make a considerable difference. This is bad news if you want to lose weight, because muscle burns on average three times more calories than fat per day, even at rest. What to do: Incorporate resistance training into your weekly routine to reduce muscle loss. The NHS recommends two sessions of strength training a week, which could include activities as varied as gardening or lifting weights. Don’t underestimate the good that exercise can do: a 2018 study shows that regular exercisers over the age of 55 kept up their muscle mass considerably more than inactive people. Staying active In England, half of 16 to 24-year-olds are doing the recommended amount of weekly exercise, but only one in 10 people aged 65 to 74 are doing so. If injuries have accrued, and your work and social life is less busy than it once was, you may be leading a more sedentary lifestyle than you realise. The role of exercise in weight loss is much-debated, but it can be crucial in maintaining your weight. A famous 2016 study followed participants in American weight loss competition The Biggest Loser during and after filming, and found that most regained a lot of weight after the cameras stopped rolling due to a higher appetite and slower metabolism. However, a follow-up study in 2017 found that the contestants who kept the most weight off were those who had remained committed to a fitness regimen. This was particularly interesting given that more exercise didn’t equal more weight loss during the show, when those who lost the most focused on diet over working out. What to do: Try to stick to the NHS guidelines on exercise, which recommend 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week, or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise, or a mixture of both. Make sure you are doing something appropriate for your body, too. As we get older, high-impact workouts like running may place unwanted stress on your joints, so think about lower impact options like swimming or cycling. Hormones Menopause changes where fat is stored on the body. Higher oestrogen levels in the fertile years cause fat to be stored on your legs, hips and behind, but after oestrogen drops, fat can move to your middle, even if you remain exactly the same weight. This can be an issue, as fat around your trunk is more likely to contribute to Type 2 diabetes, hypertension and heart issues than fat on your hips and legs. Men are affected by hormone changes as they age, too: after the age of 40 they lose roughly one per cent of their testosterone a year. This matters for weight, as testosterone is linked to the amount of muscle you have and where you store fat. What to do: For women, several studies suggest that HRT can help to stop the shift of fat from your bottom half to around your middle as you go through menopause. An Italian study followed two groups of equal weight post-menopausal women for a year, putting half of them on HRT, with the rest going hormone-free. At the end of the year, the HRT group stayed almost the same weight, and hadn’t put on any extra fat around their middles or arms. In the untreated group, things were different: they had put on three and a half pounds, and had increased the amount of fat around their waists and arms. HRT isn’t suitable for everyone, so make sure you consider your options and discuss with your doctor first. In men, hormones are linked to a variety of lifestyle factors, including body fat and waist size, which can increase the amount of oestrogen in your body. Keeping active is also vital for men’s hormones: a 2018 study found that regular cyclists aged 55 to 74 kept their testosterone levels up compared with inactive men. Your sleep is also a partial predictor of your testosterone levels: most of the hormone is released while we doze, so if you’re not getting enough hours in bed, your body has less chance of boosting its stores. Getting enough sleep is key for maintaining your weight for other reasons, too: not getting enough is shown to make you gravitate towards sweet foods, and muscle growth occurs largely while we’re resting at night. More stress For many, juggling looking after children and caring for parents with work can mean life post-50 requires navigating a huge amount of stress. Even if you eat exactly as you did before, stress can cause weight gain. In 2015, American researchers found that after eating a large meal, women who reported more stress in the previous day burned 104 fewer calories than women who weren’t stressed. Stressed women also had higher levels of insulin, which is linked to gaining fat. This may not sound significant, but burning 100 fewer calories a day could lead to a loss of 10lbs of fat over a year. What to do: Reducing stress is often one of the hardest lifestyle changes to make, as you may have little control over the issues at work or home. However, you can change how you react, which can reduce your stress levels even without anything changing in your external environment. Exercise is an incredibly effective way of lowering cortisol levels, as well as burning calories, which could lead to a double effect on your weight. There is also robust evidence that simply slowing your breathing can dramatically reduce stress in both the short and long term, as well as giving a range of other benefits like better sleep. “Slow” counts as anything less than 10 breaths a minute, and six breaths is even better. The NHS recommends inhaling for up to a count of five, then exhaling for the same length of time."

http://in.news.yahoo.com/saffron-shining-in-four-states-090040878.html,,[],Saffron shining in four states,"By Mail Today Bureau



NEW DELHI: ITS THE semifinal before next years big fight and the BJP is cruising to a 4- 0 knockout of the Congress, an India Today Group- ORG poll says. The India Today Group- ORG poll in four of the five states that will have elections this winter projects the saffron party coming to power in all it has surveyed.



In other words, the BJP gets to keep Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh and will eject the Congress from power in Delhi and Rajasthan. Mizoram, the fifth state to have elections this winter, was not included in the poll.



The 4- 0 verdict should serve as the perfect platform for the BJP to launch its national effort to take back Delhi, fuelled by the growing popularity of their prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi.



The details of the opinion poll, however, suggest Decembers verdict will have less to do with Modi and Rahul than the successes and failures of satraps.



Madhya Pradeshs Shivraj Singh Chouhan is all set to become the BJPs model regional leader with a massive mandate in his third term at the helm, effectively becoming the partys next Modi without the political baggage the Gujarat chief minister comes with. The poll projects his tally at 143 seats, the same number the BJP currently has, but sees the saffron voteshare going up from 38 per cent in 2008 to 43 per cent this time, placing the welfareoriented BJP leader on firm ground.



Modi can breathe easy, at least for now. Madhya Pradesh respondents arent in favour of Chouhan going national just yet. When asked whether they would prefer Narendra Modi or their own chief minister as the next Prime Minister, only 31 per c ent pick Chouhan over the Gujarat leader.



Tight race



Chouhan's Chhattisgarh counterpart has more to worry about.



Although Raman Singh is more popular than his Congress challenger - 57 per cent of respondents prefer him to Ajit Jogi - the BJP doesn't seem to be reaping the benefits of his popularity.



The poll suggests a tight race with almost no change in vote shares from 2008, though it leaves the saffron party with 46 seats over the Congress 42. With only 90 seats in the Assembly, the balance could yet be tipped by the vagaries of candidate selection by either party.



Despite the neck- and- neck race of Rajasthan's grimy poll campaign, the poll finds Vasundhara Raje likely to snatch her throne back from Ashok Gehlot's scandal- ridden government.



It'll be deja vu all over again for Rajasthan's residents.



Five years after her 120- seat majority turned into a 78- seat Opposition, Raje is now projected to bag at least 105 seats over the Congress 76.



Rajasthan is staying true to see- saw politics, but the Capital could well see the end of the 15- year reign of Sheila Dikshit. The poll - slightly inconclusive, it may be argued, because the BJP announced a surprise chief ministerial candidate midway through the survey exercise - hands 36 seats in the 70- strong Assembly to the BJP, giving the Congress 22 and Arvind Kejriwals Aam Aadmi Party eight. Dikshit remains the most popular chief ministerial candidate with 28 per cent preferring her to Arvind Kejriwals 22 per cent. With the Congress party having alienated labourers - 80 per cent want a change of government - Dikshit won't get a chance to leverage her personal popularity. The poll projects a BJP government with only one seat over the 35- strong threshold, meaning the selection of candidates could still throw a spanner in the works.



In a sign that should gladden the hearts of those helming Team Modi, more than 58 per cent of voters in all four states say they would choose to vote out the Manmohan Singh government in a Lok Sabha election, though the numbers change substantially when asked whether they would prefer the NDA to take over. The writing is on the wall: right now its more anti- Congress than pro- Modi.



The India Today Group- ORG poll in four of the five states that will have elections this winter projects the saffron party coming to power in all



TAKING its opposition to the opinion polls to a new level, the Congress has decided to pull out its spokespersons from television debates on pre- election surveys.



The Congress spokespersons stayed away from the Headlines Today panel discussion on the India Today- ORG opinion poll results. The poll has projected the Congress rout in Delhi, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.



The party has instructed all its spokespersons not to participate in discussions on opinion polls.



Senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh had termed pre- poll surveys a ""farce"". The BJP, meanwhile, claimed that any ban on opinion polls would be unconstitutional.

(CNN) —

Montreal’s interim mayor, Michael Applebaum, was arrested and charged early Monday with 14 criminal counts including fraud, breach of trust and conspiracy.

Quebec police said the charges involve at least two Montreal real estate transactions from 2006 to 2011 and hundreds of thousands of dollars traded hands.

“These allegations rest essentially on obtaining permission and political support on two real estate projects,” said Capt. Andre Boulanger of the Surete du Quebec, the province’s police force. He would not confirm or deny if the charges involve bribes or ties to gangsters and organized crime.

Applebaum took over the mayor’s job in November after Gerald Tremblay resigned amid corruption allegations. At the time, Applebaum vowed to “end an era of sleaze” at Montreal City Hall.

From 2006 to 2011, Applebaum served as the borough mayor of a large suburb of Montreal. During this time he also served on the city council.

Commenting at a police news conference Monday, the head of Quebec’s anti-corruption squad, Cmdr. Robert LaFreniere, said, “We can no longer tolerate these reprehensible acts committed towards the management of our public institutions. The values of ethics and integrity must remain at the heart of the actions taken by our elected officials.”

Officers said the investigation began in March after they received what they described as “solid” evidence from members of the public. Quebec police say the investigation continues and they are not ruling out more arrests.

This is the most recent explosive allegation to rock the city of Montreal as the details of an insidious corruption scandal have been laid bare at a province-wide inquiry. Testimony at that inquiry has outlined widespread corruption allegations and close relationships between elected officials, city employees, contractors and even organized crime.

Applebaum denies all charges."

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu moved to distance himself from the comments by his deputy defense minister, Danny Danon.

In a TV interview, Danon said ""there is certainly no majority"" in the Likud for establishing a Palestinian state based on Israel's borders before the 1967 Mideast war.

The Palestinians seek an independent state in the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, areas captured by Israel in 1967. The Palestinians say final borders between Israel and a future Palestine must be based on the 1967 lines. Israeli hard-liners oppose a broad withdrawal from the West Bank on both security and religious grounds.

""A Palestinian state on the 1967 lines is something dangerous for Israel, and therefore I oppose that idea,"" Danon told Channel 2 TV. He said it was possible that the broader coalition government, which includes other hard-line parties, also opposes a return to the 1967 lines.

The international community, including the U.S., has endorsed the 1967 lines as the basis for border talks. While Netanyahu says he supports Palestinian independence, he has refused to commit to any borders, saying only that all issues of disagreement should be resolved in negotiations.

Officials in Netanyahu's office said that Danon had stated a personal opinion, and his comments did not reflect government policy.

In a veiled reference to Danon, Netanyahu told his Cabinet on Sunday ""the government must function as one unit"" in order to confront the many challenges facing the country.

Netanyahu linked the recent troubles along Israel's front with Syria to the Palestinian issue, telling his Cabinet that the planned withdrawal of Austrian peacekeepers from the Golan Heights shows that Israel cannot rely on others to protect its security. Austria announced the pullout from a U.N. peacekeeping force along the Israeli-Syrian frontier after rebels briefly overran a border crossing.

The incident ""underscores the fact that Israel cannot depend on international forces for its security,"" Netanyahu said. ""they can be part of the arrangements. They cannot be the basic foundation of Israel's security.""

Netanyahu said he would raise this concern with Kerry. Netanyahu has previously rejected suggestions that international forces patrol areas that Israel relinquishes as part of a peace agreement with the Palestinians. The Palestinians have said they would accept international forces but would never allow the Israeli military to remain in their territory.

Kerry has been shuttling between the sides in recent months in hopes of finding a formula to restart negotiations. He is expected in the region this week on what would be his fifth visit since becoming Secretary of State early this year.

Netanyahu told the Cabinet that he will discuss the impasse with Kerry.

""Together we will try to advance a way to find an opening for negotiations with the Palestinians with the goal of reaching an agreement. This agreement will be based on a demilitarized Palestinian state that recognizes the Jewish state, and on solid security arrangements based on the Israeli military,"" he said.

Talks have been stalled since late 2008. The Palestinians have refused to return to the negotiations until Israel ends construction in territory it wants for a future state. Israel says that settlements, along with other core issues like security, should be resolved through talks and have frequently called for negotiations to resume immediately without preconditions.

Kerry has been searching for a formula that would curtail most settlement construction, provide security guarantees to Israel and economic incentives to the Palestinians. So far, there have been no signs of progress.

Israel's chief negotiator with the Palestinians, Tzipi Livni, said Sunday that she is working with the U.S to restart talks, despite those within the government that oppose it.

""It is true that within the Likud there are radical elements and within the government there are those that oppose an agreement,"" Livni told Israel Radio. ""The prime minister is the one who will have to decide whether he surrenders to radical elements or will promote his policy that he declared,"" she said.

Livni said Danon's comments ""look bad.""

The top Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, said Danon's remarks reflect Israel's policy. ""I believe that a government that continues to tender settlements and rejects the two state solution will not go for peace,"" he said."

Videos show people suffering from muscle spasms%2C foaming from the mouth and with decreased pupil size

Report pinpoints 10 sites of chemical attacks

USA TODAY could not verify the videos independently

ISTANBUL — Groups representing Syrian rebels told USA TODAY on Thursday that they have amassed evidence over months that proves President Bashar Assad is using deadly chemical nerve agents despite President Obama's ""red line"" threat.

Several groups including the Syrian Network for Human Rights say Assad has been using weapons like sarin gas far more frequently than has been reported. Early this week, an intelligence chief for the Israeli Defense Forces said Israel concluded Assad used them last month.

In a report released exclusively to USA TODAY, the network said Syrian human rights observers such as itself have concluded that Assad's forces have used chemical weapons on ""10 separate locations in Syria"" in four provinces over the span of several months starting in December.

""Beginning at Homs, and then in the suburbs of Damascus, and then at two attacks inside Damascus in Jobar neighborhood,"" Damascus-based activist Sami Ibrahim, of the Syrian Network for Human Rights, told USA TODAY.

Ibrahim says his group — a Syrian group of human rights activists that collects victims' accounts of the conflict — can back up its claims of chemical weapons use by Assad. Its report says Assad has been using ""different types"" of chemical weapons, including sarin gas, on at least two separate occasions in suburban Damascus and Aleppo.

""We have videos of those killed, we have photos, we have testimony from the eyewitnesses, from the doctors inside the hospitals; they are speaking inside the video,"" Ibrahim said of his report's findings.

President Obama has said the use of chemical weapons would be a ""game-changer"" in deciding whether the United States would intervene in the 2-year-old civil war. The United Nations estimates that up to 80,000 civilians have been killed by Assad's forces.

Videos contained in the network's report show victims of attacks suffering from muscle spasms, people foaming from the mouth and decreased pupil size. USA TODAY could not verify the videos independently.

The videos also included an alleged chemical weapons attack in Aleppo, activists close to rebel fighters in Turkey say.

""You could see (in video), there was foam coming out of the mouth, the eyes were closed or at least the pupils were so small,"" said Syrian opposition activist Hozan Ibrahim, who is based in Berlin.

Some of the survivors of the attack — in which Ibrahim states two people died — were taken to Turkey. This allowed opposition forces there to verify that chemical weapons were used, Ibrahim added.

The Syrian Network for Human Rights says its findings should be all that is needed to get the West to grant the rebels the military assistance they have been asking for to defeat Assad. The rebels want heavy weapons that will allow them to compete with Assad's artillery, and a Western-military-enforced no-fly zone, such as was used in Libya to oust Moammar Gadhafi.

""We heard hundreds of statements (from the West) against Bashar al-Assad, that he's a criminal and he should leave,"" Ibrahim said. ""But give me the real action against him!""

""We have to expect action, otherwise the other dictatorships will learn from Bashar al-Assad that the international community is unable to do anything for this criminal,"" Ibrahim said.

Analysts say that, having conceded it believes the Syrian government has used chemical weapons, the Obama administration will now be under ""overwhelming"" pressure to take military action.

""It's a matter of time, I would argue, before the administration retaliates against the Assad regime,"" said Fawaz Gerges, the director of the Middle East Center at the London School for Economics. ""If and when the U.S. responds, I think it's going to be a huge response. I don't think it's going to be a tiny limited action."""

(CNN) - Vice President Joe Biden re-emphasized on Monday the United States' commitment to Israel and forcefully admonished any attempts by Iran to develop nuclear weapons.

""Big nations can't bluff. And presidents of the United States cannot and do not bluff and President Barack Obama is not bluffing,"" Biden said at a gathering in Washington for the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC).



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

The vice president insisted ""we are not looking for war"" but added ""all options, including military force, are on the table.""

Biden's remarks also seemed to preview President Barack Obama's trip to Israel next week, his first trip to the Jewish state since he became president. Biden, however, wouldn't go into too much detail about Obama's itinerary, saying he ""learned that's it's never a good idea to steal the president's thunder.""

""It's never a good idea to say what he's going to say the next day,"" Biden quipped, possibly a veiled reference to his decision to announce support for same-sex marriage last year, shortly before Obama did so.

Biden pledged not to upstage the president, but added Obama plans to address many of the issues associated with the Arab Spring when he travels to the Middle East.

""I am a little jealous that he gets to be the one to say `This year in Jerusalem.' But I am the Vice President. I am not the president,"" Biden said, drawing laughs. ""When I told him that I am not sure he thought I was serious or not but anyway.""

Also on Monday, the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations nuclear watchdog, announced that Iran was still not cooperating, rendering it difficult for the IAEA to provide ""credible assurance"" that the country does not possess undeclared nuclear material.

The Islamic Republic still faces sanctions from the United Nations Security Council for violating a U.N. resolution that forbids Iran from enriching uranium. But Iran says since it signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, it should be able to enrich uranium for peaceful energy needs.

Of the shared commitments between the U.S. and Israel, Biden focused on one in particular.

""We have a shared strategic commitment. Let me make clear what that commitment is. It is to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. Period. Period. End of discussion. Period. Prevent not contain. Prevent,"" he said.

Recalling stories from his childhood, Biden said he learned at the dinner table from his ""righteous Christian"" father that the nation of Israel deserved its own statehood and sovereignty. Any threats to their survival, he added, would be met with the United States' ""deep commitment to the security of the state of Israel.""

""That (commitment) has not changed. That will not change as long as I and he are president and vice president of the United States,"" he said.

""We especially understand that if we make a mistake it's not a threat to our existence,"" Biden said. ""But if Israel makes a mistake, it could be a threat to its very existence.""

The main objective, he reiterated, is to obtain peace through diplomatic means. He said the U.S. is in ""constant dialogue"" and sharing information with Israeli military, intelligence and political establishment.

""If God forbid the need to act occurs, it is critically important for the whole world to know we did everything in our power…to avoid any confrontation,"" he said. ""Because God forbid if we have to act, it is important that the rest of the world is with us.""

Yet Kerry also served notice that the Obama administration will keep close watch on how Morsi, who came to power in June as Egypt's first freely elected president, honors his commitment and that additional U.S. assistance would depend on it.

""The path to that future has clearly been difficult and much work remains,"" Kerry said in a statement after wrapping up two days of meetings in Egypt, a deeply divided country in the wake of the revolution that ousted longtime President Hosni Mubarak.

Egypt is trying to meet conditions to close on a $4.8 billion loan package from the International Monetary Fund. An agreement would unlock more of the $1 billion in U.S. assistance promised by President Barack Obama last year and set to begin flowing with Kerry's announcement.

Kerry cited Egypt's ""extreme needs"" and Morsi's ""assurances that he plans to complete the IMF process"" when he told the president that the U.S. would provide $190 million of a long-term $450 million pledge ""in a good-faith effort to spur reform and help the Egyptian people at this difficult time."" The release of the rest of the $450 million and the other $550 million tranche of the $1 billion that Obama announced will be tied to successful reforms, officials said.

Separately, the top U.S. diplomat announced $60 million for a new fund for ""direct support of key engines of democratic change,"" including Egypt's entrepreneurs and its young people. Kerry held out the prospect of U.S. assistance to this fund climbing to $300 million over time.

Story continues

Recapping his meetings with political figures, business leaders and representatives of outside groups, Kerry said he heard of their ""deep concern about the political course of their country, the need to strengthen human rights protections, justice and the rule of law, and their fundamental anxiety about the economic future of Egypt.""

Those issues came up in ""a very candid and constructive manner"" during Kerry's talks with Morsi.

""It is clear that more hard work and compromise will be required to restore unity, political stability and economic health to Egypt,"" Kerry said.

Syria and Iran were topics of discussion, according to officials.

With parliamentary elections in April approaching and liberal and secular opponents of Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood saying they will boycott, Kerry called the vote ""a particularly critical step"" in Egypt's democratic transition.

Violent clashes between protesters and security forces have created an environment of insecurity, complicating Egyptian efforts to secure vital international aid.

Officials in the Egyptian presidency said Kerry stressed the need for consensus with the opposition in order to restore confidence in Egypt that it can ride out the crisis. Morsi was reported to have expressed the importance of Egypt's relationship with United States, which is based on ""mutual respect,"" and focused on the importance of the democratic process in building a strong and stable nation.

Kerry made clear that in all his meetings, he conveyed the message that Egyptians who rose up and overthrew Mubarak ""did not risk their lives to see that opportunity for a brighter future squandered.""

On Saturday, he told the country's bickering politicians that they must overcome differences to get Egypt's faltering economy back on track and maintain its leadership role in the volatile Middle East.

The U.S. is deeply concerned that continued instability in Egypt will have broader consequences in a region already rocked by unrest.

U.S. officials said Kerry planned to stress the importance of upholding Egypt's peace agreement with Israel, cracking down on weapons smuggling to extremists in the Gaza Strip and policing the increasingly lawless Sinai Peninsula while continuing to play a positive role in Syria's civil war.

The impact of Kerry's message of unity to the opposition coalition seemingly was blunted when only six of the 11 guests invited by the U.S. Embassy turned up for a Saturday session with him and three of those six said they still intended to boycott the April parliamentary election, according to participants.

Kerry said that the U.S. would not pick sides in Egypt, and he appealed to all sides to come together around human rights, freedom and speech and religious tolerance.

In an apparent nod to the current stalemate in Washington over the U.S. federal budget, Kerry acknowledged after meeting Foreign Minister Kamel Amr that compromise is difficult yet imperative.

""I say with both humility and with a great deal of respect that getting there requires a genuine give-and-take among Egypt's political leaders and civil society groups just as we are continuing to struggle with that in our own country,"" he said. 'There must be a willingness on all sides to make meaningful compromises on the issues that matter most to all of the Egyptian people.""

The opposition accuses Morsi and the Brotherhood of following in the footsteps of Mubarak, failing to carry out reforms and trying to install a more religiously conservative system.

Morsi's administration and the Brotherhood say their foes, who have trailed significantly behind Islamists in all elections since the uprising against Mubarak, are running away from the challenge of the ballot box and are trying to overturn democratic gains.

After meeting Morsi and his defense and intelligence chiefs on Sunday, Kerry flew to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and planned later stops in the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, where his focus is expected to be the crisis in Syria and Iran.

Kerry is set to return to Washington on Wednesday.

Most of the Americans were working as Arabic translators for Global Linguist Solutions, which ended a lucrative deal with its sponsoring Kuwaiti subcontractor, Al Shora International General Trading & Contracting and signed on with another company. Sources told FoxNews.com Al Shora's managing director is the sister-in-law of the Kuwaiti prime minister.

When the contract ended Feb. 17, Al Shora refused to transfer the employees' visas to the new Kuwaiti subcontractor and falsely accused the Americans of being ""runaways and absconders,"" according to Charles Tolleson, president of Global Linguist Solutions. His company has barred workers from leaving the bases since May 31 to protect them from arrest and imprisonment.

[pullquote]

""My biggest concern is the safety and security of my employees in Kuwait,"" he said.

One of the employees, who contacted FoxNews.com Tuesday morning from Camp Buehring, said, ""If we leave the base, we could be arrested by the Kuwaiti authorities, jailed or deported.""

""We cannot see the doctor even for an emergency,"" said the woman, who asked that her name not be used. ""Everybody here is under stress because a lot of us here need to go home. Our families are worried about us. We need to see our kids... We don’t see any hope. We’re dealing with a corrupt company in Kuwait that has fabricated charges against us.""

She said the Al Shora's managing director ""cancelled all of our visas here, so we became illegal.""

Camp Buehring is in the Kuwaiti desert, about 25 miles south of the Iraqi border. Other employees of Global Linguistics are similarly stuck at Camp Arifjan, another U.S. Army base inside Kuwait.

Al Shora is demanding $22 million from Global Linguistics in order to transfer the employees' visas to the new company, Kuwaiti Resources House, sources said. Under Kuwaiti law, foreigners cannot work in the country unless they are under the sponsorship of a private Kuwaiti company.

After his company re-bid its contract several months ago and opted to chose the new Kuwaiti company, ""Al Shora basically embarked on a campaign to destroy my company,"" Tolleson said.

""There’s no contract dispute. I don’t even have a contract with them anymore,"" he said of Al Shora. ""If a sponsor is no longer a sponsor, they are required to simply transfer [the visas] to the new sponsor. This happens all the time. They won’t do that, and that violates the terms of their former contract.""

A representative from the Kuwaiti prime minister's office said he was not aware of the situation.

""This is the first time I heard about this,"" the representative, who declined to give his name, told FoxNews.com. ""This kind of behavior has never happened.""

He had no comment when asked if the Al Shora's managing director was related to Kuwaiti Prime Minister Jaber Al-Mubarak Al-Hamad Al-Sabah

Tolleson said that when he approached the U.S. military about the situation, ""I was told this is my problem.""

The office for the U.S. Ambassador to Kuwait referred all inquiries on the matter to the U.S. State Department.

“The U.S. Embassy in Kuwait is aware of the commercial dispute involving a Department of Defense contractor and a local Kuwaiti company,"" Beth Gosselin, as a State Department spokeswoman, told FoxNews.com. ""That dispute has had an impact on a number of private U.S. citizens working in Kuwait.

""The protection of U.S. citizens overseas is one of our highest priorities,"" Gosselin added. ""The U.S. Embassy is working with the private U.S. citizens and is providing them with appropriate consular assistance. The Embassy continues to monitor the situation closely and is encouraging an immediate resolution to this difficult issue.""

At least three of the linguists reportedly spent seven days in a crowded, filthy jail after being caught outside their base. Majdi Abdulghani was detained by police May 9, as he prepared to board a plane on an approved trip to Jordan to visit his sick mother, the military newspaper Stars and Stripes reported. He spent seven days in jail before being flown back to the U.S., according to the newspaper."

President Obama wants %27a definitive judgement%27 on whether Syria has used chemical weapons

Intelligence agencies believe with varying degrees of confidence that Syria has used sarin gas

Obama has said chemical weapons would be a %27red line%27 for U.S. action

President Obama said Friday that Syria's potential use of chemical weapons would be a ""game changer,"" but the U.S. and its global partners must thoroughly investigate suspicions raised by intelligence agencies.

That probe will seek ""more direct evidence and confirmation"" of chemical weapons use and could take a long time, Obama said before meeting with King Abdullah II of Jordan.

""This is not an on or off switch,"" Obama said. ""This is going to be a long-tern proposition.""

Obama spoke as White House aides continued to strike a cautious note on claims that Syria has used chemical weapons against rebels, saying President Obama wants all the facts before deciding how to proceed.

Intelligence agencies believe ""with varying degrees of confidence"" that Bashar Assad's government has used small amounts of sarin gas in clashes with Syria rebels, officials said.

Said Obama: ""These are preliminary assessments; they're based on our intelligence gathering. We have varying degrees of confidence about the actual use, but there are a range of questions around how, when, where these weapons may have been used.""

White House spokesman Jay Carney declined to put a timeline on the investigation. ""The facts need to be what drives this investigation, not a deadline,"" he said.

Carney said the administration is now backing a United Nations investigation into the issue to make ""a definitive judgment"" in the use of chemical weapons.

Also from Carney: ""This is not an airtight case. We do have some evidence, but we need to build on that.""

In August, President Obama said any Syrian use of chemical weapons would cross a ""red line"" that would prompt a U.S. response. Obama has not specified what that response might be, and neither did Carney on Friday.

""All options remain on the table,"" Carney said.

Other aides have warned against a rush to judgment, citing flawed intelligence about non-existent weapons of mass destruction in Iraq before the 2003 invasion of that country."

Berlusconi also defended Mussolini for allying himself with Hitler, saying he likely reasoned that it would be better to be on the winning side.

The media mogul, whose conservative forces are polling second in voter surveys ahead of next month's election, spoke to reporters on the sidelines of a ceremony in Milan to commemorate the Holocaust.

In 1938, before the outbreak of World War II, Mussolini's regime passed the so-called ""racial laws,"" barring Jews from Italy's universities and many professions, among other bans. When Germany's Nazi regime occupied Italy during the war, thousands from the tiny Italian Jewish community were deported to death camps.

""It is difficult now to put oneself in the shoes of who was making decisions back then,"" Berlusconi said of Mussolini's support for Hitler. ""Certainly the (Italian) government then, fearing that German power would turn into a general victory, preferred to be allied with Hitler's Germany rather that oppose it.""

Berlusconi added that ""within this alliance came the imposition of the fight against, and extermination of, the Jews. Thus, the racial laws are the worst fault of Mussolini, who, in so many other aspects, did good.""

More than 7,000 Jews were deported under Mussolini's regime, and nearly 6,000 of them were killed.

Reactions of outrage, along with a demand that Berlusconi be prosecuted for promoting Fascism, quickly followed his words.

Berlusconi's praise of Mussolini constitutes ""an insult to the democratic conscience of Italy,"" said Rosy Bindi, a center-left leader. ""Only Berlusconi's political cynicism, combined with the worst historic revisionism, could separate the shame of the racist laws from the Fascist dictatorship.""

Italian laws enacted following the country's disastrous experience in the war forbid the encouragement of Fascism. A candidate for local elections, Gianfranco Mascia, pledged that he and his supporters will present a formal complaint on Monday to Italian prosecutors, seeking to have Berlusconi prosecuted.

Advocating aggressive nationalism, Mussolini used brutish force and populist appeal evoking ancient Rome's glories to achieve and keep his dictatorial grip on power, starting in the early '20s and lasting well into World War II. His Fascist ""blackshirt"" loyalists cracked down on dissidents, through beatings and jailings.

He encouraged big families to propagate the Italian population, established a sprawling state economy and erected monumental buildings and statues to evoke ancient Rome. Mussolini sought to impose order on a generally individualistic-minded people, and Italians sometimes note trains ran on time during Fascism.

With dreams of an empire, he sent Italian troops on missions to attack or occupy foreign lands, including Ethiopia and Albania. Eventually, Italian military failures in Africa and in Greece fostered rebellion among Fascist officials, and in 1943 he was placed under arrest by orders of the Italian king. His end came at the vengeful hands of partisan fighters, who shot him and his mistress, and left their bodies to hang in a Milan square in April 1945.

Berlusconi's former government allies have included political heirs to neo-fascist movements admiring Mussolini.

In 2010, he told world leaders at a Paris conference that he had been reading Mussolini's journals, and years earlier Berlusconi had claimed that Mussolini ""never killed anyone.""

Berlusconi is running in Feb. 24-25 Parliamentary elections and has repeatedly changed his mind on whether he is seeking a fourth term as premier. Monti is also running, but polls put him far behind front-runner Pier Luigi Bersani, a center-left leader who supported Monti's austerity measures to save Italy from the Eurozone debt crisis.

Polls show about one-third of eligible voters are undecided."

President Obama first told his advisers that he would seek congressional approval

Obama was advised last week by aides not to seek congressional authorization

In making his decision%2C Obama stressed to aides the desire to take America off permanent war footing

WASHINGTON — The president's decision to seek congressional approval for a military strike against Syria came out of the blue — none of his national security team saw it coming, according to three senior administration officials.

Obama told some of his senior advisers during a National Security Council meeting last weekend that he was leaning toward taking action against Syria, but had not made a final decision, said the officials, who spoke on the condition they not to be identified discussing internal deliberations. As Obama mulled his next steps, the aides advised him not to seek congressional authorization for a military strike, they said.

But when Obama convened his senior advisers Friday night to tell them he had settled on launching a narrowly focused strike against the Bashar Assad regime, he also told them something stunning: He would ask Congress to authorize it first.

The president raised this idea to his national security team for the first time Friday night after a one-on-one chat with White House chief of staff Denis McDonough. In discussions Friday night and again Saturday morning in the Situation Room, Obama laid out his reasoning to his aides, some of whom were opposed to seeking congressional approval, according to the officials who declined to name the skeptics.

""Many people have advised against taking this decision to Congress, and undoubtedly, they were impacted by what we saw happen in the United Kingdom this week when the Parliament of our closest ally failed to pass a resolution with a similar goal, even as the prime minister supported taking action,"" Obama told the nation Saturday. ""Yet, while I believe I have the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization, I know that the country will be stronger if we take this course, and our actions will be even more effective.""

In the months leading up to Saturday's announcement, Obama made clear his desire to have broad support for any potential action against Syria — crystallizing his long-held view that the credibility of military action comes with numbers. But Russia, Syria's most powerful patron, would block any United Nations Security Council resolution against Syria. After the British Parliament rejected Prime Minister David Cameron's call for military action last week, it became clear to Obama that a groundswell of international was not coming.

Notably, Obama called President Francois Hollande of France — the one major U.S. ally that has endorsed a military strike — before he publicly announced his decision to seek backing from Congress.

Still, as Obama edged toward calling for a limited military strike against the Assad regime following Syrian forces' alleged killing of more than 1,400 in a chemical attack in rebel stronghold outside of Damascus Aug. 21, White House officials maintained their view that the president did not need to seek congressional approval.

But aides said Obama, who as a candidate for the White House criticized President George W. Bush's for rushing to war in Iraq, saw formal consultation with Congress as a central part of his desired legacy to take the United States off a permanent war footing.The president was further convinced that this was the best course of action after the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin Dempsey, told him a Syria operation was not time-sensitive, and there was no negative impact for waiting, the officials said.

Congress is set to return from its summer recess Sept. 9 and is expected to debate and vote on an authorization that week. Obama would not rule out taking action immediately if Assad deploys chemical weapons before Congress is set to vote, the officials said.

The officials also stressed that the president changed his own mind, and no congressional leaders directly asked him to seek authorization, even though about a third of rank-and-file House members have called for it. They won't speculate what Obama would do if Congress does not approve use of force, while maintaining that Obama retains the authority to go it alone.

Obama made clear in his remarks on Saturday that a ""no"" vote would send the wrong message to Assad and America's enemies. ""Here's my question for every member of Congress and every member of the global community: What message will we send if a dictator can gas hundreds of children to death in plain sight and pay no price?"" Obama said.

""What's the purpose of the international system that we've built if a prohibition on the use of chemical weapons that has been agreed to by the governments of 98% of the world's people and approved overwhelmingly by the Congress of the United States is not enforced?"""

She Joined The Paper In']",Kerry steadfast on Iran talks despite Khamenei’s harsh words for Israel,"The Obama administration brushed off harsh criticism of Israel from Iran’s supreme leader Wednesday and insisted a proposed deal to curb Iran’s disputed nuclear program is not the trap Israel fears.

“We have the best chance we’ve had in a decade, we believe, to halt progress and roll back Iran’s program,” Secretary of State John F. Kerry said in Washington as U.S. and other negotiators began a new round of talks meant to clinch an interim agreement with Iran.

“We will not allow this agreement, should it be reached — and I say should it be reached — to buy time” for Iran or fall short of “our core fundamental concerns,” Kerry said.

He spoke hours after Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, referred to Israel as the warmongering “rabid dog” of the Middle East during a speech to military commanders in Tehran.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has waged a public lobbying effort against the draft deal, calling it a sham that rewards Iran without preventing it from producing a nuclear weapon.

Unable to persuade Washington to delay the latest round of talks, Netanyahu went to Russia on Wednesday seeking stronger limits on Iran.

Talks in Geneva convened with a senior U.S. negotiator telling reporters it will be difficult but not impossible to reach a deal.

“Whether we will, we will have to see, because it is hard,” the official said. “If it was easy to do, it would have been done a long time ago.”

Western governments suspect Iran has pursued a covert goal of enriching enough uranium to produce weapons on demand. Iran denies any weapons ambitions and claims it must continue to enrich uranium for peaceful energy uses.

A deal to satisfy international doubts about Iran’s program will turn largely on whether it can limit Iranian uranium enrichment to levels far below those used to make weapons. Negotiators are also seeking new controls on an Iranian plutonium reactor.

In return, world powers would first loosen and eventually lift some economic sanctions imposed over the decade Iran has defied international demands to roll back its program and provide more information.

Although Iran has long insisted on its right to enrich uranium on its own soil, the proposed deal is expected to fudge that point while stressing Iran’s right to peaceful nuclear energy.

“Whatever a country decides or doesn’t decide to do or is allowed to do and permitted under the rules depends on a negotiation,” Kerry said at a news conference with Australian officials.

“I’m not going to predetermine its outcome except to say to you that no right is recognized or granted within anything that I’ve seen in the early discussions,” he said.

The United States and other world powers had hoped to seal a deal earlier this month. Those talks broke up after disagreement first among the powers talking to Iran and then with Iran accusing France of torpedoing the deal.

Khamenei criticized France on Wednesday and vowed that Iran will not give up what he called its nuclear rights. He said he had set ""red lines” for his negotiators and blamed Israel for stoking animosity around the talks.

“The real threats to the world are evil powers including the Zionist regime and its supporters,” Khamenei said.

“The Zionist regime is doomed to destruction, because this despicable regime was formed by power and imposed on the world, and nothing which is imposed will last,” he said.

The strong anti-Israel language may have been chiefly intended to reassure hard-liners at home, but it contrasts with the friendlier face presented by President Hassan Rouhani and Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif as they sought direct negotiations and a rollback of stringent international economic sanctions.

Netanyahu says Israel will not be bound by the agreement

Says %22Israel will not let Iran develop nuclear military capability%22

Cabinet official says deal allows Iran to continue enriching uranium

JERUSALEM — The Israeli government called the deal reached with Iran over its nuclear program a ""historic mistake,"" saying it only slows a nuclear program that will still be capable of producing a bomb.

Speaking to his Cabinet on Sunday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the agreement endangered Israel, adding the nation is not bound by the international community's nuclear deal and reserves the right to defend itself.

""What was reached last night in Geneva is not a historic agreement, it is a historic mistake,"" Netanyahu said. ""Today the world became a much more dangerous place because the most dangerous regime in the world made a significant step in obtaining the most dangerous weapons in the world.""

""We're worried about the agreement but our job is to keep up the warnings,"" said Yair Lapid, Israel's Minister of Finance and part of Netanyahu's coalition government. ""We're not comfortable but this warning needs to be done. We have six months until there is (hopefully) a better agreement.Voicing what he called Israel's right to self-defense, he said, ""I want to clarify that Israel will not let Iran develop nuclear military capability.""

""We may be the only child in the room saying the king has no clothes but that's what we must do.""

An official in the Prime Minister's office said the agreement ""gives Iran exactly what it wants: a significant easing of sanctions and allows Iran to keep the most significant parts of its nuclear program. The agreement allows Iran to continue enriching uranium and leaves it the centrifuges that enables it create (fissile) material to create nuclear weapons. Likewise, the agreement doesn't lead to dismantling the Arak reactor. The economic pressure on Iran would have led to a much better agreement that would have dismantled Iran's nuclear capability.""

The White House said the interim deal limits Iran's existing stockpiles of enriched uranium, which can be turned into the fissile core of nuclear arms. The accord curbs the number and capabilities of the centrifuges used to enrich and limits Iran's ability to ""produce weapons-grade plutonium"" from a reactor in the advanced stages of construction.

FIRST TAKE:Obama takes historic shot with Iran deal

Iran's nuclear program will also be subject to ""increased transparency and intrusive monitoring."" In return, the White House said economic sanctions on Iran imposed to get it to curtail its nuclear activity will be eased.

Uri Savir, a former Israeli ambassador and president of the The Peres Center for Peace, called the deal an ""historic agreement,"" saying it will go a long way to limit Iran's nuclear program for six months and could also jump start progress on Syria and the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. He lauded Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry, ""who despite opposition advanced global peace diplomacy.""

Nafatali Bennett, the Minister of Economy and Commerce, said on Army Radio that world powers could have used the talks in Geneva that led to the deal to force Iran to give up its nuclear program rather than freeze it at a point where it can resume work at any time.

""Iran was on the mat because of the sanctions, but then the West picked it up and gave it something to drink. Israel does not have to be a party to this agreement and has the right to defend its security,"" he said, alluding to possible military action. ""The whole Middle East is affected but the danger to Israel is unique.""

In early-morning Facebook posts, Israelis compared the deal to the one made by former British prime minister Neville Chamberlain, who brokered an agreement with Nazi Germany in 1938 that did nothing to prevent a world war as promised.

Josh Hasten, who hosts a political radio show, told USA TODAY that, ""There is no doubt that the leaders in Iran are smiling this morning as they have been given a pass by the world community to maintain the option of building a nuclear weapon.""

He described the deal as an appeasement that will leave the entire world and not just Israel at risk of a nuclear Iran.

""It's truly a major step in the wrong direction,"" he said.

The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

http://ph.news.yahoo.com/estrada-back-power-165517786.html,,[],Estrada back in power,"epa03767404 Former Philippine president Joseph Estrada (C) is surrounded by his family as he takes the oath as the new city mayor of Manila, Philippines 30 June 2013. Estrada, who was ousted from the presidency in 2001 and convicted of large-scale corruption in 2007, returns to the political scene as the new mayor of Manila after winning the position in 13 May national elections. EPA/ROLEX DELA PENA

New Manila Mayor Joseph Estrada, joined by other elected local officials, was formally sworn into office yesterday noon at the city hall, with the former president calling himself an ''ex-convict'' and promising to revive the old glory of the country's capital city.

Estrada took his oath before former Senate President Juan Ponce Enrile, marking his return to public office since his ouster from the presidency in 2001. Estrada began his first day in office as Manila Mayor five days after the Supreme Court asked his reply to a petition for intervention filed by outgoing Mayor Alfredo Lim in a disqualification case filed against him.

Estrada began his speech by thanking his supporters and appealing to those who did not vote for him to give him their trust and assistance as he works to improve the city's image.

''For the first time, Manila will have an ex-convict as your city mayor,'' he said as he related the events leading to the so-called EDSA II.

''I was convicted, and the justices who convicted me were immediately promoted to the Supreme Court. Kung ako man ay ex-convict, ito ay dahil sa prinsipyo,'' Estrada said.

''And I feel I am in good company with Nelson Mandela of South Africa, Anwar Ibrahim of Malaysia, Aung San Suu Kyi of Myanmar and our own Senator Ninoy Aquino who was convicted by a military court. We were all convicted. That is why we are now all men of conviction,'' he added.

Vice President Jejomar Binay and daughter Nancy Binay also attended the ceremony while Sen. Jinggoy Estrada administered the oath taking of the elected city council officials.

The 76-year old former president said Manila needs to be revived as it is the ''gateway to the Philippines and the face and image of the Philippines.''

He cited reports of Manila policemen linked to crimes such as extortion, kidnapping, and robbery ''from Divisoria up to the Port Area.''

Story continues

Estrada also noted that last year, the Philippine National Police Highway Patrol Group tagged the Manila as the new ''carnap capital of the country,'' replacing Quezon City.

As if to add salt to the injury, American novelist Dan Brown called the city of Manila as the ''gates of hell'' in his new book ''Inferno'' released last May.

But for Estrada, Brown's book should serve as a wake-up call for city officials to be aggressive in restoring the city's former beauty and grandeur.

To achieve this, he said peace and order must be prioritized.

''Hindi lang basura ang wawalisin namin, pati corrupt officials...I promise you: The fight against corruption will be the centerpiece of our administration,'' he said.

''This is a warning and a wake-up call to police officers engaged in criminal activities from kotong to drug-dealing, from extortion to protection rackets and other abuses. I ask you to reform because we will go after you. Ang advice ko sa inyo, magbago na kayo! We will apply the full force of the law so that we may become a model city insofar as peace and order is concerned,'' the mayor said.

Estrada also vowed to improve the condition of the six hospitals in the city and to address the problem of illegal vendors lining the streets of Manila.

The new mayor said his first 100 days will be devoted to clearing the streets of vendors that cause traffic jams, which also create a ''conducive environment for petty crimes like snatching.''

'' Ang panukala ko dito ay maglunsad tayo ng mga night market kung saan puwede nang mag-okupa ng kalye ang mga vendor para magkaroon pa rin sila ng hanapbuhay na hindi sagabal sa traffic,'' he said.

Business owners will also be required to install closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras to deter and solve crimes easily.

To solve the issue of flooding, he said the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority and the Department of Public Works and Highways have already began the cleaning and dredging of creeks.

Estrada also vowed to institute an efficient and systematic tax collection system as he assured full transparency on all revenue collections, disbursements and expenditures of the city.

At the end of his speech, Estrada appealed to the public ''for a little patience and a little sacrifice,'' admitting that his three-year term faces insurmountable challenges.

''Pero hindi po ako si Superman at alam kong hindi ko kayang bigyan lahat ng ito ng madaling solusyon. Hindi minamadyik ang mga problemang nag-uugat sa maraming taon at dekada ng kapabayaan.''

For his part, Vice Mayor Francisco ''Isko Moreno'' Domagoso disclosed that they have already passed an ordinance that orders the fuel companies operating at the Pandacan oil depot to vacate the area by January 2016. He made the statement during the press conference following the oath-taking rites."

There are those who believe that the settlers have eliminated any chance of establishing a Palestinian state, because no one would be able to evacuate these politically motivated people from their homes, which is a necessary condition for any agreement with the Palestinians.

The settlers have not eliminated the chance for the establishment of a Palestinian state. The settlements today cover 2 percent of the entire area. The Palestinians have already accepted the Clinton parameters, which include leaving three blocs of Jewish settlements and exchanging other territory for them. In my opinion, many of the rest will leave of their own free will. The difficulty with us is similar to that of the man with a hammer who thinks every problem is a nail. Problems are not nails. If there is good will, they can all be overcome. This applies, for example, to the issue of water. Soon there will be a surplus of water in Israel, thanks to seawater desalination, and we will be able to make up the Palestinians’ shortage of potable water. Look, the whole world is in turmoil. The Palestinian problem isn’t the main problem in the Middle East. But there are a billion and a half Muslims. The Palestinian problem affects our entire relationship with them. If the Palestinian problem were to be solved, the Islamist extremists would be robbed of their pretext for their actions against us. Of course, this requires concessions. The problem in this case is not only the prime minister but also his coalition. I am not claiming that peace with the Palestinians will solve all the problems. People who think in sweeping terms are being superficial. There are two things that cannot be made without closing your eyes — love and peace. If you try to make them with open eyes, you won’t get anywhere. Peace is not an exciting thing, and it entails accepting many compromises and tedious details. A woman, too, can sometimes be exciting and sometimes less so. There’s no perfection. Making peace is complicated.

But what kind of peace are we talking about? Look how President Mohamed Morsi of Egypt sent you a personal letter in July and then denied writing it.

Why does that matter? President Morsi has to answer a great many questions inside his own party. I was surprised not by his denial but rather by the fact that he sent me the letter. The whole matter shows me that Morsi, like any leader taking office, faces tough dilemmas. It is very easy to play the role of the abiding Muslim when you are not in power, but things get complicated when you are. Take, for example, the Egyptian economy, which relies heavily on tourism. If they don’t allow tourists to come and spend their vacations the way they like, they won’t come. No bikini, no tourism.

What attitude should Israel adopt toward the Arab Spring?

You ask foolish questions. Israel is an island in an ocean. And when I ask myself, “What has a greater impact, the ocean on the island, or the island on the ocean?” I have to maintain a certain degree of humility. The important thing isn’t how we relate to it, but what is happening, why there is an Arab Spring. It isn’t a soccer match that we are refereeing. The young generation of the Arab world is suppressed and unemployed. That is what brought about the revolution and uprooted the dictatorships, not me and not you. The storm that has hit the Middle East obliges each state to choose whether to enter the scientific age or not. If it does not, it will have no growth. The great and intriguing debate in Egypt today is about the constitution, in effect about whether to give women freedom or not. It is here that the Arab Spring will be judged. President Obama asked me who I think is preventing democracy in the Middle East. I told him, “The husbands.” The husband does not want his wife to have equal rights. Without equal rights, it will be impossible to save Egypt, because if women are not educated, the children are not educated. People who cannot read and write can’t make a living. They are finished.

In Syria, the end of the Assad regime inches closer. Are you concerned about their arsenal of chemical weapons?

Assad knows that using chemical weapons will immediately invite an attack by outside elements. The whole world would mobilize against him. It would be a suicidal act. On the other hand, it’s obvious that his days are numbered. A situation in which, let’s say, his palace comes under fire, could put him in an irrational state and lead him to act out of despair. If the Syrians dare to touch their chemical weapons and aim them at us or at innocent civilians, I have no doubt that the world as well as Israel will take decisive and immediate action. No less important, Assad is liable to transfer the chemical weapons to Hezbollah, which from our point of view will constitute crossing a red line. It is incumbent upon Israel to prevent such a thing from happening, and it will take firm military action to do so.

During the several months

over which Peres and I spoke, the conflict between Israel and Hamas intensified. In response to rocket fire from Hamas forces in the Gaza Strip, Israel assassinated Hamas’s military commander and launched a bombing campaign that resulted in widespread international censure and ended in a cease-fire engineered by the United States and Morsi. In some cases in the past, Peres expressed opposition to Israel’s use of assassination as a weapon to achieve its goals. He opposed the killing of Khalil al-Wazir, the deputy of the P.L.O. leader Yasir Arafat, in Tunis in 1988, and the targeted elimination of the spiritual founder of Hamas, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, in Gaza in 2004. He also protected Arafat from plots to kill or deport him. This time, Peres expressed strong support for the Israeli operation. “This wasn’t a war or a military operation, but rather an educational lesson for Hamas,” he told me. “We acted in order to explain to Hamas that it has to decide on one or the other. You want to build houses? No problem. You want to build missile bases inside those houses? Then we’ll relate to those houses as targets for our aircraft.

But during the campaign, civilians were killed on both sides, many more in Gaza.

We made a supreme effort not to harm civilians in Gaza, although it was very difficult to distinguish between Hamas militiamen and innocent civilians. We have no desire to spill blood, not ours and not that of others. The operation was short, and the moment the lesson was conveyed and deterrence was established, it was stopped.

What lesson do you think Hamas learned?

Hamas will now start taking care. Even there, the understanding must penetrate that there’s no such thing as a cocktail of gunfire and peace."

(CNN) —

If you’re a tourist arriving in Israel, you might be asked to give authorities a look at your personal e-mail, in addition to your travel documents.

Israel’s attorney general said Wednesday that Shin Bet, the country’s internal security force, can search a foreign traveler’s e-mail, but only in exceptional cases in which “relevant suspicious signs” are observed. Israel says the practice is another way to fight terrorism.

The threat of using foreign citizens for terrorist purposes is a growing trend, the Israeli Attorney General’s Office said in a written response to an inquiry filed by an Israeli human rights group.

Yigal Palmor, a spokesman for Israel’s Foreign Ministry, told CNN: “Security may under the law demand this, but no one is forced to open their accounts to anyone they don’t want to.”

However, the attorney general’s decision said that if the traveler declined to give consent, it would be made clear that a refusal would be taken into consideration, along with other relevant factors, in deciding whether to allow entry into Israel.

The Association for Civil Rights in Israel received the information from the Attorney General’s Office after it asked whether Israel’s security forces could demand travelers’ e-mail and social media passwords. The association said the question was a reaction to media reports last year that several Palestinian-American travelers were asked to open their e-mail accounts and show airport security before being denied entry. The group received an answer this week.

“To be clear, this is a process whose execution is conditioned on the receipt of the passenger’s agreement, and that the latter is not required to give the investigating representative his password, as your letter suggests, but rather that the passenger himself executes entry to the e-mail account … ” The Attorney General’s Office wrote.

Lila Margalit, an attorney for the Association for Civil Rights, said the practice is a violation of privacy rights:

“A tourist who has just spent thousands of dollars to travel to Israel, only to be interrogated at the airport by Shin Bet agents and told to grant access to their e-mail account, is in no position to give free and informed consent,” she said Wednesday. “Such ‘consent,’ given under threat of deportation, cannot serve as a basis for such a drastic invasion of privacy. In today’s world, access to a person’s e-mail account is akin to access to their innermost thoughts and personal lives. Allowing security agents to take such invasive measures at their own discretion and on the basis of such flimsy ‘consent’ is not befitting of a democracy.”

Security checks at Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion Airport are known around the world as some of the most exhaustive and thorough, and this is one more layer that travelers should be aware of.

Jerusalem Travel Agency owner Margo Tarazi said she had heard of the practice but her clients had not experienced it:

“None of our clients have faced this problem yet. They come with official groups with their vouchers, and no one asks them about these things. However, if we do receive any groups with some people who are originally from Iran or from Syria, they are detained for several hours and asked to sign a paper not to cause any harm to the state of Israel during their visit.”

Critics of the practice worry it will be used to target Arabs or Muslims who communicate with Palestinian activists or organizations."

Congressional conservatives and the right-wing media are blasting President Obama for going soft on the Syrians.

The president insists that there is a “game-changing” red line the Syrian government will have crossed if it is found to have used chemical weapons against its people, but he has bent the red line so far, the hawks say, that not only the Syrians, but the Iranians and North Koreans will conclude Obama is a man with a marshmallow spine whose warnings can be flouted with impunity.

The president has, indeed, added more caveats to his tough talk. In his news conference on Tuesday, the president said if rock-solid proof is found that a gas attack has taken place he would “rethink” what to do next, choosing from an unspecified range of punitive options that might not include military action.

His line got more elastic after last week’s ominous but rubbery announcement that U.S. intelligence agencies have found evidence of a possible use of the nerve gas sarin -- somewhere, sometime, against somebody in Syria, “with some degree of varying confidence” (in the words of Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel).

Though equivocal, that finding is evidence enough for the hawks who long for a much more resolute president in the mold of George W. Bush. Bush, under the sway of his very hawkish, neoconservative advisors, seized on a bushel of bad intelligence to justify the invasion of Iraq in 2003.

Obama wisely, and necessarily, is taking a much more cautious approach, clearly reluctant to go before the international community without unimpeachable evidence against the Syrian regime. He knows he is facing a skeptical world that has a vivid memory of the very impeachable evidence the Bush team used to sell a war to the United Nations. Syria’s chemical weapons need to be proved much more real than Saddam Hussein’s phantom weapons of mass destruction.

“If we end up rushing to judgment without hard, effective evidence, then we may find ourselves in the position where we can’t mobilize the international community to support what we do,” Obama told reporters.

Even if such evidence can be provided, there is still the hard question of what to do in response. Having spent a decade fighting two wars in the Middle East with dubious results, there are not many Americans beyond Senate hawks such as Lindsey Graham, Saxby Chambliss and John McCain who are itching to jump into one more tangled, vicious conflict in yet another Muslim country.

Sure, Syrian President Bashar Assad and his thuggish cronies are nasty people who have oppressed and killed thousands of their countrymen. And it is true the Syrian civil war has turned vast numbers of people into refugees. And, yes, there are probably true democrats and liberty lovers among the anti-Assad rebels who deserve help in their fight. But the rebels also include a disturbing number of Islamic militants who, if they gain power, would be as ruthless and undemocratic as Assad.

Graham, the South Carolina Republican who has been most vocal in calling Obama a foreign policy weakling, acknowledges that it’s a tricky situation. His solution to dealing with the rebels is to “give the right arms to the right people” and “to be ready to fight two wars” -- one against Assad and the other against the Islamist rebel faction. Lest that sound too much like a quagmire, Graham adds that it can be done without “boots on the ground.”

If that is what passes for a plan of action from the hawks, we can be grateful that the president is looking for other options. It is worth remembering that not too many years ago we armed a rebel army in Afghanistan to drive out the Soviets. After the Soviets were gone, a large share of those rebels became the Taliban.

We still have “boots on the ground” fighting them today."

A group called the Katibat Moulathamine, or the Masked Brigade, called a Mauritanian news outlet to say one of its subsidiaries had carried out the operation on the Ain Amenas gas field, taking 41 hostages from nine or 10 different nationalities. They claim they are holding seven Americans.

The group's claim could not be independently substantiated and typically there would be fewer than 20 foreign staff members on site on a typical day, along with hundreds of Algerian employees.

The group said the attack was in revenge for Algeria's support of France's operation against Al Qaeda-linked Malian rebels groups far to the southeast.

The caller to the Nouakchott Information Agency, which often carries announcements from extremist groups, did not give any further details, except to say that the kidnapping was carried out by ""Those Who Signed in Blood,"" a group created to attack the countries participating in the ongoing offensive in Mali. The group is demanding an end to the offensive, Reuters reports, citing Mauritanian media.

Algeria's Interior Minister, Daho Ould Kablia said on television that ""Algeria will not respond to terrorist demands and rejects all negotiations."" He denied that the militants were from Mali or Libya, possibly suggesting they were from Algeria itself.

In a statement BP said the site was ""attacked and occupied by a group of unidentified armed people,"" and some of its personnel are believed to be ""held by the occupiers.""

The number and identities of the hostages was still unclear, but Ireland announced that a 36-year-old married Irish man was among them, while Japan and Britain said their citizens were involved as well. A Norwegian woman said her husband called her saying he had been taken hostage.

Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stotlenberg said in a news conference that 13 of the hostages are Norwegian employees of the energy firm Statoil, Reuters reported.

""We've asked the Algerian authorities to put the life and health of the hostages above all,"" Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said.

In addition to two foreigners being killed -- one of them a Briton -- six others were wounded in the attack, including two foreigners, two police officers and two security agents, Algeria's state news agency reported.

The Masked Brigade was formed by Al Qaeda's longtime strongman in the Sahara region, Moktar Belmoktar, a one-eyed Algerian who recently declared he was leaving the terror network's Algerian branch, Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb for his own group.

He said at the time he would still maintain ties with the central organization based out of Afghanistan and Pakistan.

In Mali, French President Francois Hollande launched the surprise operation in its former West African colony on Friday, with hopes of stopping Al Qaeda-linked and other Islamist extremists he believes pose a danger to the world.

Wednesday's attack began with the ambush of a bus carrying employees from the gas plant to the nearby airport but the attackers were driven off, according to the Algerian government, which said three vehicles of heavily armed men were involved.

""After their failed attempt, the terrorist group headed to the complex's living quarters and took a number of workers with foreign nationalities hostage,"" said the statement, adding that authorities were following the situation very closely.

Attacks on oil-rich Algeria's hydrocarbon facilities are very rare, despite decades of fighting an Islamist insurgency, mostly in the north of the country.

In the last several years, however, Al Qaeda's influence in the poorly patrolled desert wastes of southern Algeria and northern Mali and Niger has grown and it operates smuggling and kidnapping networks throughout the area. Militant groups that seized control of northern Mali already hold seven French hostages as well as four Algerian diplomats.

The natural gas field where the attack occurred, however, is more than 600 miles from the Mali border, though it is just 60 miles from Libya's deserts.

BP, together with Norwegian company Statoil and the Algerian state oil company, Sonatrach, operate the gas field. A Japanese company, JGC Corp, provides services for the facility as well.

Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said the kidnapped foreigners possibly include Japanese employees of JGC.

""We are certain that JGC is the one affected,"" Suga said, adding that the government is now negotiating with local officials through diplomatic channels, asking for safety first to protect the lives of the Japanese nationals.

Japan's Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida told Algerian counterpart, Mourad Medelci, during telephone talks late Wednesday that he was gravely concerned about the development, and called the abductions ""unacceptable.""

""I asked (Algeria) to place top priority on the lives of the Japanese and others who have been captured,"" he said.

Statoil said that it has 20 employees in the facility. The Norwegian Foreign Ministry said it could not confirm that any Norwegian citizens had been abducted. The Norwegian Newspaper Bergens Tidende, however, said a 55-year-old Norwegian working on the site called his wife to say he had been abducted.

Algeria had long warned against military intervention against the rebels in northern Mali, fearing the violence could spill over its own long and porous border. Though its position softened slightly after Hollande visited Algiers in December, Algerian authorities remain skeptical about the operation and worried about its consequences on the region.

Algeria is Africa's biggest country, and has been an ally of the U.S. and France in fighting terrorism for years. But its relationship with France has been fraught with lingering resentment over colonialism and the bloody war for independence that left Algeria a free country 50 years ago.

Algeria's strong security forces have struggled for years against Islamist extremists, and have in recent years managed to nearly snuff out violence by Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb around its home base in northern Algeria. In the meantime, AQIM moved its focus southward.

AQIM has made tens of millions of dollars off kidnapping in the region, abducting Algerian businessmen or political figures for ransom and sometimes foreigners.

A Brief Look At Who Pulls The Political Strings,"As North Korea intensifies its belligerent rhetoric against Washington and Seoul, the world has turned its eyes on Kim Jong Un -- the country's enigmatic leader.

The young Kim rose to power after the death of his father, Kim Jong Il, in December 2011. But is the 30-year-old ""Dear Leader"" the only one pulling North Korea's political strings? HuffPost World investigates.

THE INSTITUTIONS

The International Crisis Group explains that the Korean Workers Party (KWP) is North Korea's main political organ. The 124 members of the party's Central Committee select a General Secretary, the 10-member Secretariat, a 14-member Politbureau, a Presidium and the members of the powerful Central Military Commission (CMC).

As the ICC notes, the party structure fully support the dictatorship. Deceased leader Kim Jong Il is the party's ""Eternal Secretary,"" while Kim Jong Un is First Secretary. Kim Jong Un also heads the powerful National Defense Commission (NDC), a position that gives him control over the armed forces.

Powerful figures in the regime can take up different mandates within the party or the security apparatus over time and can even combine several positions.

THE FIGURES

Kim Kyong Hui Since the death of her brother Kim Jong Il, Kim Kyong Hui has become one of North Korea's most powerful officials. The Dear Leader's 66-year-old aunt was appointed the most important member of the KWP's Politburo and first among members of the Secretariat. In addition, she was made a general in the army.

Jang Song Thaek Kim Kyong Hui's husband, Jang Song Thaek, is deputy chairman of the powerful National Defense Commission and an alternate member of the Politburo, Reuters explains. The Soviet-trained technocrat was first spotted in a general's uniform in the wake of Kim Jong Il's death.

Kim Jong Un's aunt and uncle were crucial figures in the transition of power after Kim Jong Il's death in December 2011. John Park of the U.S. Institute for Peace told the Associated Press after the former leader's passing that the powerful couple are ""key pillars"" of the young Kim's reign.

While analysts speculated the duo's power would gradually decline as young Kim gained ruling experience, thus far, the duo's influence has not waned -- as evidenced by their frequent appearances flanking their nephew on official events. ABC points out that the leader's aunt and uncle were present on stage when Kim reaffirmed his country's commitment to nuclear weapons during a speech on March 31.

This power couple appears to occasionally live through its version of drama, too. According to ABC, Jang did not support North Korea's long-range missile launch last December, ""but was overruled by his wife.""

Pak Pong Ju On Monday, North Korea appointed Pak Pong Ju as its new prime minister. The 70-year-old Pak has been a confidant to the Kim family and earlier served as prime minister from 2003 until 2007. He was tasked with implementing economic reforms to lift the country out of poverty, but was dismissed when the measures appeared to fail.

Pak is closely associated with Jang Song Thaek and Kim Kyong Hui, Reuters notes, and while his reappointment is meant to strengthen Kim's grip on power, it makes the young leader ""dangerously dependent"" on the power duo.

Ri Yong Ho Ri Yong Ho appeared to be one of the main beneficiaries of the political appointments in the wake of his Kim Jong Il's death. Ri became the head of the North Korean army, was a member of the Politburo and Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC).

Although Ri was initially considered close to the new leader, the army chief was dismissed from all official posts in July 2012. The BBC's Seoul correspondent Lucy Williamson noted at the time that while Ri's resignation was officially attributed to ""illness,"" a health crisis was unlikely the real reason for the purge. As the Crisis Group explains: ""Senior officials normally remain in office despite poor health, even terminal illness."" Kim Jong Un solidified his control of the army following Ri's removal.

Kim Kyok Sik Current Defense Minister Kim Kyok Sik, who succeeded Kim Jong Gak in 2012, has been described as a hardliner. The Chosun Ilbo writes that Kim previously had served as North Korea's army chief but was demoted in February 2009. He became corps commander at the Northern Limit Line and was reportedly involved in the attack on a South Korean submarine in 2010.

""As a country, as a society, we live and breathe the idea of religious freedom and religious tolerance, whatever the religion, and political freedom and political tolerance, whatever the point of view,"" Kerry told the students in Berlin, the second stop on his inaugural trip as secretary of state.

""People have sometimes wondered about why our Supreme Court allows one group or another to march in a parade even though it's the most provocative thing in the world and they carry signs that are an insult to one group or another,"" he added.

""The reason is, that's freedom, freedom of speech. In American you have a right to be stupid - if you want to be,"" he said, prompting laughter. ""And you have a right to be disconnected to somebody else if you want to be.

""And we tolerate it. We somehow make it through that. Now, I think that's a virtue. I think that's something worth fighting for,"" he added. ""The important thing is to have the tolerance to say, you know, you can have a different point of view.""

Kerry made the comments on his first foreign trip since becoming secretary of state on Feb. 1. After one-night stops in London and Berlin, he visits Paris, Rome, Ankara, Cairo, Riyadh, Abu Dhabi and Doha before returning to Washington on March 6.

While speaking to the students and earlier to U.S. diplomats, Kerry reminisced about the time he spent in Berlin in the 1950s as the intrepid son of an American diplomat and retold a story of sneaking across to East Berlin with his bike.

""I used to have great adventures. My bicycle and I were best friends. And I biked all around this city. I remember biking down Kurfuerstendamm and seeing nothing but rubble. This was in 1954 ... the war was very much still on people's minds,"" he told the diplomats, referring to West Berlin's main shopping avenue.

""One day, using my diplomatic passport, I biked through the checkpoint right into the east sector and noticed very quickly how dark and unpopulated (it was) and sort of unhappy people looked,"" he added, saying it left an impression ""that hit this 12-year-old kid.""

""I kind of felt a foreboding about it and I didn't spend much time. I kind of skedaddled and got back out of there and went home and proudly announced to my parents what I had done and was promptly grounded and had my passport pulled,"" he added.

""As a 12-year-old, I saw the difference between East and West,"" he later told the students. ""I never made another trip like that. But I have never forgotten it. And now, it's vanished, vanished."" (Reporting by Arshad Mohammed; Editing by Jon Hemming)"
http://security.blogs.cnn.com/2013/12/09/first-on-cnn-sources-diplomatic-fraud-ring-also-spied/,2013-12-09 00:00:00,[],First on CNN: Sources: Diplomatic fraud ring also spied,"By Evan Perez

This is a Russian spy ring that would embarrass Anna Chapman.

Justice Department prosecutors last week filed charges against what they say is a group of current and former Russian diplomats who allegedly ran a nine-year scheme that bilked $1.5 million from Medicaid, the U.S. health benefits program for the poor.

But CNN has learned that there's a spy angle to this case. Federal counterintelligence investigators say they believe some of the alleged participants in the fraud scheme were also engaged in espionage, sources tell CNN. Federal Bureau of Investigation agents were on the trail of the alleged spies for some time, sources say. But in the end, the Justice Department decided to bring only the fraud charges.



There are 49 people charged in the case - 25 current and former Russian diplomats and 24 of their spouses. But only 11 of them remain in the U.S. and all have diplomatic immunity. So unless the Russian government waives their immunity - which is unlikely - they can't be arrested. Instead, the State Department is expected to seek to have them sent home.

The case comes amid some tensions in U.S.-Russian relations over a variety of issues, from Syria and Iran to the Russian asylum granted to former National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden. Counterintelligence officials say Russian spying activity in the U.S. is back to near Cold War levels.

In 2010, the FBI rounded up a group of Russian sleeper agents who were part of what the U.S. called the Illegals Program. Ten people who posed as academics and business people were arrested, including Anna Chapman, now 31 years old. She posed as an entrepreneur and socialite, and garnered the most attention for her glamorous looks. Vice President Joe Biden joked on a talk show that he wouldn't have sent her back to Russia.

The U.S. and Russia conducted a spy swap to resolve the issue, after the 10 spies pleaded guilty. Another alleged Russian spy in the group fled after being arrested in Cyprus. And a 12th was deported.

While the Illegals used sophisticated communications methods to avoid detection, the latest group charged is portrayed in court documents more as common fraudsters.

It couldn't be learned how many of the 49 charged last week are suspected of spying and what type of activity the FBI investigators in New York and Washington believe they were involved in. But Manhattan federal prosecutors believed they didn't have enough evidence to bring espionage charges, one source said. In any case, U.S. officials view the fraud charges as more embarrassing to the Russian government.

Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara accused the 49 charged in the fraud case of ""picking pockets"" in the U.S. ""Here, as alleged, a multitude of Russian diplomats and their spouses ran a scam on a health care system designed to help Americans in need,"" Bharara said.

The accused work as mission, consulate and trade representatives in New York, although one also once worked at the embassy in Washington. The Russian government normally pays for medical costs of their employees, and those employees' children aren't generally eligible for U.S. citizenship at birth.

According to prosecutors, the diplomats falsified Medicaid benefits applications, under-reporting incomes or reporting no income to qualify. While they got benefits, they had a taste for high-end shopping, spending thousands at stores such as Tiffany and Bloomingdale's.

One former Russian diplomat charged is named Timur Salomatin, who with his wife, Nailya Babaeva, applied for Medicaid pregnancy benefits in November 2010 and represented Salomatin's salary to be $3,000 a month, and later $4,400 a month. The family got almost $31,000 in fraudulent Medicaid benefits, prosecutors say. While getting Medicaid benefits last year, the couple spent $50,000 on purchases from retailers such as Apple, Prada and Bloomingdale's, prosecutors allege."

At least that's what happened in Australia when 65-year-old Bruce Dusting proposed to 42-year-old single mom Marie Lacombe and she shot him down. After the rejection, Dusting sent Lacombe a $200,000 bill accounting for every dime he spent on her during their alleged four-year courtship, as reported by A Current Affair in Australia.

The enormous bill includes money for Zumba classes, dental appointments, cash for Lacombe's kid's birthday party, a tummy tuck and even breast implants. Apparently Dusting expected to be paid back, telling ACA, ""She will not get away with this.""

But Lacombe tells ACA a different story, saying, ""He's a shark.""

In fact, the single mom claims the two were never romantically involved, explaining she was his dance teacher and they became friends. She says any money Dusting gave her was his choice and the bill is an act of revenge.

Of course, Dusting isn't the first to look for revenge post-breakup.

Sanger'],"A Step, if Modest, Toward Slowing Iran’s Weapons Capability","Mr. Steinitz was referring to a 2003 agreement in which Libya gave up all of its nuclear equipment and was left with no ability to make nuclear fuel. But Libya had barely managed to unpack its equipment, purchased from Pakistan; it had invested far less than Iran and was nowhere near enriching nuclear fuel. In reality, no one imagines the Iranians will give up everything. The question is, how much is enough?

The complexity of the task ahead is evident from a glance at the main measurements of Iran’s progress since Mr. Obama took office in 2009, promising a new opening to the Iranians — an opening they had largely rejected until this summer, when the mounting toll of economic sanctions helped Mr. Rouhani win the presidential election.

At the beginning of Mr. Obama’s presidency, Iran had roughly 2,000 kilograms of low-enriched uranium, barely enough for a bomb. It now has about 9,000 kilograms, by the estimates of the International Atomic Energy Agency. A few thousand centrifuges were spinning in 2009; today there are 18,000, including new models that are far more efficient and can produce bomb-grade uranium faster. A new heavy water reactor outside the city of Arak promises a new pathway to a bomb, using plutonium, if it goes online next year as Iran says it will.

True rollback would mean dismantling many of those centrifuges, shipping much of the fuel out of the country or converting it into a state that could not be easily adapted to bomb use, and allowing inspections of many underground sites where the C.I.A., Europe and Israel believe hidden enrichment facilities may exist. There is no evidence of those facilities now, but, as a former senior Obama administration official said recently, speaking anonymously to discuss intelligence, “there has never been a time in the past 15 years or so when Iran didn’t have a hidden facility in construction.”

There is also the problem of forcing Iran to reveal what kind of progress it has made toward designing a weapon. For years, its leaders have refused to answer questions about documents, slipped out of the country by a renegade scientist nearly eight years ago, that strongly suggest work on a nuclear warhead. Inspectors have never been able to interview Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, the academic believed to be in charge of a series of weapons development projects.

The good news for the American negotiators is that if there are no hidden facilities, it will take Iran several months to produce weapons-grade fuel from its current stocks, and perhaps a year or more to fashion that fuel into a usable weapon and shrink it to fit atop one of the country’s Shahab missiles.

Even then, a single weapon would do Iran little good next to Israel’s 100 or more and the United States’ thousands, as Mr. Zarif, the foreign minister, often points out. But the mere knowledge that Iran was on the cusp of a weapon would affect the perception of its power around the world, and that may be all its leaders seek."

Friedman'],This Ain’t Yogurt - The New York Times,"AN Arab friend remarked to me that watching the United States debate how much to get involved in Syria reminded him of an Arab proverb: “If you burn your tongue once eating soup, for the rest of your life you’ll blow on your yogurt.”

After burning our tongues in Iraq and Afghanistan, and watching with increasing distress the aftermath of the revolutions in Libya, Tunisia and Egypt, President Obama is right to be cautious about getting burned in Damascus. We’ve now seen enough of these Arab transitions from autocracy to draw some crucial lessons about what it takes to sustain positive change in these countries. We ignore the lessons at our peril — especially the lesson of Iraq, which everyone just wants to forget but is hugely relevant.

Syria is Iraq’s twin: an artificial state that was also born after World War I inside lines drawn by imperial powers. Like Iraq, Syria’s constituent communities — Sunnis, Alawite/Shiites, Kurds, Druze, Christians — never volunteered to live together under agreed rules. So, like Iraq, Syria has been ruled for much of its modern history by either a colonial power or an iron-fisted autocrat. In Iraq, the hope was that once the iron-fisted dictator was removed by us it would steadily transition to a multisectarian, multiparty democracy. Ditto for Egypt, Libya, Tunisia and Yemen.

But we now see the huge difference between Eastern Europe in 1989 and the Arab world in 2013. In most of Eastern Europe, the heavy lid of communist authoritarian rule was suppressing broad and deeply rooted aspirations for democracy. So when that lid was removed, most of these countries relatively quickly moved to freely elected governments — helped and inspired by the European Union."

Updated 10:25 a.m. ET, 11/24/14

(CNN) – Secretary of State John Kerry insisted Sunday that the interim agreement to halt Iran’s nuclear program makes Israel safer - though Israel says the agreement has exactly the opposite effect.

“We believe very strongly that because the Iranian nuclear program is actually set backwards and is actually locked into place in critical places, that that is better for Israel than if you were just continuing to go down the road and they rush towards a nuclear weapon,” Kerry said in an interview that aired Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union” - just hours after world powers and Iran reached the historic agreement.

Nuclear deal with Iran breaks 3-decade gridlock

Kerry cautioned that strong verification tactics will be needed in order to hold Iran accountable to the deal.

“When you're dealing with nuclear weapons, it's not an issue of trust,” Kerry said. “Verification is the key.”

20 questions about the Iran nuclear deal: What it says, what's at stake, what's next

The initial six-month deal slows Iran’s nuclear development program in exchange for lifting some sanctions, while a more formal agreement is worked out.

More specifically, Iran will be required to dilute its stockpile of uranium that had been enriched to 20%. Its stockpiles should be diluted below 5%, the level needed for nuclear power plants. Iran will also have to cut back on constructing new centrifuges and enrichment facilities, and freeze essential work on its heavy-water reactor under development at Arak.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told reporters that the agreement is far from acceptable, citing the easing of sanctions as major point of contention.

""What was concluded in Geneva last night is not a historic agreement, it's a historic mistake,"" Netanyahu said. ""It's not made the world a safer place. Like the agreement with North Korea in 2005, this agreement has made the world a much more dangerous place.""

Israeli PM Netanyahu: Iran nuclear deal 'historic mistake'

But Kerry argued the sanctions part of the agreement is hardly a boost for Iran. The deal says that the U.S. will provide $6 billion to $7 billion in sanction relief — just a drop in the bucket compared to the roughly $100 billion in foreign exchange holdings that are inaccessible to Iran because of sanctions, the White House says.

“The basic architecture of the sanctions is staying in place. There is very little relief. We are convinced over the next few months, we will really be able to put to the test what Iran's intentions are,” Kerry told CNN chief political correspondent Candy Crowley.

White House issues synopsis on Iran nuclear deal

In a separate interview with ABC's ""This Week,"" Kerry acknowledged that the agreement doesn't dismantle Iran's nuclear program. But he said that strategy is ""the next step"" in negotiations. He also hit back against criticism that the agreement failed to completely tear down Iran's nuclear program.

""While we go through these next six months, we will be negotiating the dismantling,"" he said. ""But you can't always start where you want to wind up.""

""You cannot sit there and pretend that you're just going to get the thing you want, while they (Iran) continue to move towards the program that they've been chasing,"" he said.

Asked whether the agreement signals a new relationship between the U.S. and Iran, Kerry said it marks a step forward, but Iran still has a long way to go.

""We have no illusions. This is not going to change in one fell swoop overnight. We have a long building process to engage in here. We need to put to test Iran's words and intentions without any cobwebs, without any false assumptions, without any illusions. This is a hard road,"" he said. And, he added, ""We will stand by Israel 100%.""

Several Republican lawmakers in Congress have already come out against the agreement, siding with Israel. But Kerry said on ABC he feels confident ""Congress will recognize that this deal actually has a great deal of benefit in it.""

""And of course, (Obama) always has every other option available to him as commander in chief,"" Kerry said, answering a question about whether the President would veto a congressional vote for new sanctions or whether he would bypass Congress altogether.

It noted arrests in Saudi Arabia, which prohibits all faiths except Islam, and in Iran, where adherents of Bahaism faced arbitrary arrests and imprisonment. In Pakistan, blasphemy laws “have been abused to settle personal disputes and silence legitimate political discourse,” the report said. It cited the widely publicized case of Rimsha Masih, a Christian girl who faced blasphemy charges last year that were dropped only after national and international protests.

Another troubling new trend the report cited was growing religious intolerance in countries that have experienced at least nominally democratic transitions. Egypt, Tunisia and Libya — all countries that have overthrown autocratic governments with American support since 2011 — adopted restrictive new laws or carried out prosecutions against minority faiths.

Egypt’s new Constitution prohibits “undermining or subjecting to prejudice all messengers and prophets,” but does not extend explicit protections to Christianity or Judaism. Defamation against all three major faiths – Islam, Christianity and Judaism — was explicitly prohibited by statute under the rule of Hosni Mubarak. The constitution declares Islam the official state religion, and it recognizes Christianity and Judaism in personal and religious matters. Egypt’s new government, dominated by members of the Muslim Brotherhood, also has done little to prosecute those involved in religious violence against Christians, creating an atmosphere of impunity that the report noted in many countries facing strife among different believers.

The report is an annual exercise to highlight the priority of religious freedom in American foreign policy. Freedom of religion is not “an American invention,” Mr. Kerry said, but rather a “universal value.”

“And when necessary, yes, it does directly call out some of our close friends, as well as some countries with whom we seek stronger ties, and it does so in order to try to make progress, even though we know it may cause some discomfort,” Mr. Kerry said, referring to the report. “But when countries undermine or attack religious freedom, they not only unjustly threaten those whom they target. They also threaten their countries’ own stability.”"

It escalated into a major diplomatic scramble in which the Bolivian president’s plane was rerouted on Tuesday, apparently because of suspicions that Mr. Snowden was aboard.

By day’s end, outraged Bolivian officials, insisting that Mr. Snowden was not on the plane, were accusing France and Portugal of acting under American pressure to rescind permission for President Evo Morales’s plane to traverse their airspace on the way back to Bolivia. Low on fuel, the plane’s crew won permission to land in Vienna.

“They say it was due to technical issues, but after getting explanations from some authorities we found that there appeared to be some unfounded suspicions that Mr. Snowden was on the plane,” the Bolivian foreign minister, David Choquehuanca, told reporters after the plane touched down in Vienna, where Mr. Morales was spending the night.

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Sanger', 'Jodi Rudoren']","Syria Has Used Chemical Weapons, Israel Says","TEL AVIV — Israel declared Tuesday that it had found evidence that the Syrian government repeatedly used chemical weapons last month, arguing that President Bashar al-Assad was testing how the United States and others would react and that it was time for Washington to overcome its deep reluctance to intervene in the Syrian civil war.

In making the declaration — which went somewhat beyond recent suspicions expressed by Britain and France — Israeli officials argued that President Assad had repeatedly crossed what President Obama said last summer would be a “red line.” But Obama administration officials pushed back, saying they would not leap into the conflict on what they viewed as inconclusive evidence, even while working with allies on plans to secure the weapons if it appeared they were about to be used or handed to Hezbollah.

The declaration from Israel’s senior military intelligence analyst was immediately questioned in Washington. Officials said an investigation was necessary, but added that American intelligence agencies had yet to uncover convincing evidence that an attack on March 19, and smaller subsequent attacks, used sarin gas, a deadly agent that Syria is believed to hold in huge stockpiles.

“We are looking for conclusive evidence, if it exists, if there was use of chemical weapons,” Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, said when pressed on the Israeli assessment."

A full 52% “strongly agree” that Benghazi is a “serious issue that needs to be investigated,” while 17% “agree.” That’s a total of 69%.

Because the mainstream media has conspired (it must be noted that there are a number of notable individual exceptions) with the White House over the last eight months to downplay Libya, you might think that particular scandal would generate less interest than the IRS scandal — which the media have taken much more seriously. Surprisingly, though, the numbers aren’t all that different. When asked the same question about the IRS, 56% “strongly agree” and 18% “agree;” for a total of 74% — which is only 5 points higher than Libya.

The numbers for Libya create a real dilemma for the White House and its lapdog media. The no there “there” Narrative they have spent eight months manufacturing obviously isn’t working. Moreover, the motive behind this Narrative is a sinister one: neither Obama nor his media want the truth to get out, and both know that the more the people learn about the administration’s handling of Libya, the worse it will be for the administration.

For instance, with the release of the 94 emails earlier this week, we now know for a fact that the White House repeatedly lied with their claim that the administration played no role in shaping the CIA talking points. The media, though, refuse to hold the White House accountable for that lie and prefer to pretend the emails actually do back the administration’s claim.

The main reason the media have smothered the damning revelations found in the emails, though, is to protect Hillary Clinton. It was the State Department that demanded what amounted to almost a total rewrite of the completed talking points, and won them. But the media see Hillary as the best chance they have for keeping the White House out of Republican hands in 2016, and so they are circling the wagons for her, just like they have for Obama for the last five years.

Plus, even though the media isn’t demanding more, we still don’t have all the information regarding the shaping of the talking points. These information gaps are critical, and to say we should take the White House’s word for anything at this point is a joke.

The media are also ignoring and smothering the effort to find out who gave the order to “stand down” when it came to sending help to Americans under attack that night. And when it comes to finding out what exactly the President was doing during those horrific hours during which the attack took place, the media is laughably uncurious.

To protect the White House from having to reveal the truth, the President and his media have developed a strategy that smears as partisan witch-hunters anyone searching for the truth. This includes any Republican in Congress pushing for investigations and, naturally, Fox News.

But from the looks of this poll, the witch-hunters have the will of the people on their side–a whopping 69% of them. That’s a huge number, but if you think about, not really a surprising one. When Americans die, decent people believe everything should be fully investigated and made public.

The American people are, by and large, decent.

This White House and its media, however, are not.

Hopefully this poll will only further embolden the GOP and Fox News and the exceptions in the media to continue to do the decent thing: Find and tell the complete truth about what led to the deaths of an ambassador and three other Americans.

He went on to acknowledge that this was unlikely to happen.

“If he wants to go somewhere and they accept him, please, be my guest,” Mr. Putin said. “If he wants to stay here, there is one condition: He must cease his work aimed at inflicting damage to our American partners, as strange as it may sound from my lips.”

He added, “Because he sees himself as a human-rights activist and a freedom fighter for people’s rights, apparently he is not intending to cease this work. So he must choose for himself a country to go to, and where to move. When that will happen, I unfortunately don’t know.”

Mr. Putin’s comments reflected an increasingly sober view of the outcome if Mr. Snowden remains in Russia. For the second time, he took pains to say that Mr. Snowden had not been recruited by Russian intelligence — an impression that could corrode Mr. Snowden’s image as a truth-teller and drive away some supporters.

“He sees himself not as a former agent of a special service but as a fighter for human rights, a sort of a new dissident, someone similar to Sakharov, on a different scale, though,” Mr. Putin said. “But nevertheless, at his core he is a fighter for human rights, for democracy.” The reference was to the Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov."

As midlife sets in, maintaining a healthy weight often becomes harder. Tricks that worked in the past, like cutting down on wine or sugar, no longer seem to work, either. Even slender Samantha Cameron, now 50, has apparently been affected. In her 30s and early 40s, staying in shape was easy, she said this weekend, “but then I hit 43, I just put on three-quarters of a stone. Suddenly you don’t quite fit any of your things and I got really bloated.” At first she tried doing the 5:2 diet – eating normally five days a week, then having just 500 calories on the other two – but “I just couldn’t do it, I literally couldn’t speak in the evening, I had to go to bed at 7pm.” She has recently found a solution: the 5:2 principles, but with 800 calories on the “fast” days, and says she’s “loving it” and “the bloating’s gone”. Alongside three weekly workouts, she says it’s helping to keep her trim: her goal is “to hit my 50s in almost as good shape as I hit my 40s.” If you’re struggling to maintain your weight and fitness post-50, here’s why – and what to do about it: Muscle mass Every decade after the age of 30, we on average lose three to eight per cent of our muscle mass. At first, this might not be noticeable, but by 50 or 60, will make a considerable difference. This is bad news if you want to lose weight, because muscle burns on average three times more calories than fat per day, even at rest. What to do: Incorporate resistance training into your weekly routine to reduce muscle loss. The NHS recommends two sessions of strength training a week, which could include activities as varied as gardening or lifting weights. Don’t underestimate the good that exercise can do: a 2018 study shows that regular exercisers over the age of 55 kept up their muscle mass considerably more than inactive people. Staying active In England, half of 16 to 24-year-olds are doing the recommended amount of weekly exercise, but only one in 10 people aged 65 to 74 are doing so. If injuries have accrued, and your work and social life is less busy than it once was, you may be leading a more sedentary lifestyle than you realise. The role of exercise in weight loss is much-debated, but it can be crucial in maintaining your weight. A famous 2016 study followed participants in American weight loss competition The Biggest Loser during and after filming, and found that most regained a lot of weight after the cameras stopped rolling due to a higher appetite and slower metabolism. However, a follow-up study in 2017 found that the contestants who kept the most weight off were those who had remained committed to a fitness regimen. This was particularly interesting given that more exercise didn’t equal more weight loss during the show, when those who lost the most focused on diet over working out. What to do: Try to stick to the NHS guidelines on exercise, which recommend 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week, or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise, or a mixture of both. Make sure you are doing something appropriate for your body, too. As we get older, high-impact workouts like running may place unwanted stress on your joints, so think about lower impact options like swimming or cycling. Hormones Menopause changes where fat is stored on the body. Higher oestrogen levels in the fertile years cause fat to be stored on your legs, hips and behind, but after oestrogen drops, fat can move to your middle, even if you remain exactly the same weight. This can be an issue, as fat around your trunk is more likely to contribute to Type 2 diabetes, hypertension and heart issues than fat on your hips and legs. Men are affected by hormone changes as they age, too: after the age of 40 they lose roughly one per cent of their testosterone a year. This matters for weight, as testosterone is linked to the amount of muscle you have and where you store fat. What to do: For women, several studies suggest that HRT can help to stop the shift of fat from your bottom half to around your middle as you go through menopause. An Italian study followed two groups of equal weight post-menopausal women for a year, putting half of them on HRT, with the rest going hormone-free. At the end of the year, the HRT group stayed almost the same weight, and hadn’t put on any extra fat around their middles or arms. In the untreated group, things were different: they had put on three and a half pounds, and had increased the amount of fat around their waists and arms. HRT isn’t suitable for everyone, so make sure you consider your options and discuss with your doctor first. In men, hormones are linked to a variety of lifestyle factors, including body fat and waist size, which can increase the amount of oestrogen in your body. Keeping active is also vital for men’s hormones: a 2018 study found that regular cyclists aged 55 to 74 kept their testosterone levels up compared with inactive men. Your sleep is also a partial predictor of your testosterone levels: most of the hormone is released while we doze, so if you’re not getting enough hours in bed, your body has less chance of boosting its stores. Getting enough sleep is key for maintaining your weight for other reasons, too: not getting enough is shown to make you gravitate towards sweet foods, and muscle growth occurs largely while we’re resting at night. More stress For many, juggling looking after children and caring for parents with work can mean life post-50 requires navigating a huge amount of stress. Even if you eat exactly as you did before, stress can cause weight gain. In 2015, American researchers found that after eating a large meal, women who reported more stress in the previous day burned 104 fewer calories than women who weren’t stressed. Stressed women also had higher levels of insulin, which is linked to gaining fat. This may not sound significant, but burning 100 fewer calories a day could lead to a loss of 10lbs of fat over a year. What to do: Reducing stress is often one of the hardest lifestyle changes to make, as you may have little control over the issues at work or home. However, you can change how you react, which can reduce your stress levels even without anything changing in your external environment. Exercise is an incredibly effective way of lowering cortisol levels, as well as burning calories, which could lead to a double effect on your weight. There is also robust evidence that simply slowing your breathing can dramatically reduce stress in both the short and long term, as well as giving a range of other benefits like better sleep. “Slow” counts as anything less than 10 breaths a minute, and six breaths is even better. The NHS recommends inhaling for up to a count of five, then exhaling for the same length of time."

Chụp lại hình ảnh, Ông Obama sẽ không gặp ông Putin dù vẫn tới St Petersburg.

Tổng thống Hoa Kỳ Barack Obama đã hủy cuộc gặp lên lịch từ trước với Tổng thống Nga Vladimir Putin sau khi Nga cho người lộ tin tình báo Edward Snowden tị nạn, theo tin từ Nhà Trắng.

Nhưng ông Obama sẽ vẫn tới St Petersburg để dự hội nghị của các nước G20 bàn về kinh tế từ 5-6 tháng Chín.

Một trợ lý Nhà Trắng nói việc ông Snowden được tị nạn ở Nga đã làm sâu sắc thêm quan hệ vốn đã căng thẳng giữa hai nước.

Cựu nhân viên làm hợp đồng cho ngành tình báo của Hoa Kỳ đã thừa nhận tiết lộ thông tin về các chương trình do thám của Hoa Kỳ cho truyền thông đại chúng.

Quyết định hủy hội đàm, được công bố trong chuyến đi của ông Obama tới Los Angeles, được đưa ra sau khi ông Obama nói ông ""thất vọng"" với quyết định của Nga cho ông Snowden tị nạn trong một năm.

Sau phát biểu của trợ lý Nhà Trắng Ben Rhodes, bản thân Nhà Trắng cũng ra tuyên bố nói:

""Chúng tôi tin rằng hoãn cuộc họp thượng đỉnh cho tới khi hai bên có thêm kết quả từ chương trình nghị sự chung là có tính xây dựng hơn.""

Lần cuối cùng hai ông Obama và Putin gặp nhau là bên lề Hội nghị Thượng đỉnh G8 ở Bắc Ireland.

'Vẫn hợp tác'

Nhân vật được cho là khiến hội đàm song phương bị hoãn, ông Snowden, từng làm việc cho Cơ quan An ninh Quốc gia (NSA) của Hoa Kỳ trong vai trò kỹ thuật viên và cũng từng là nhân viên của CIA.

Hồi tháng Sáu cựu nhân viên tình báo này để lộ các tài liệu liên quan tới những chương trình thu thập dữ liệu qua điện thoại và thư điện tử của NSA cho báo Guardian và Washington Post.

Sau đó ông Snowden đã trốn khỏi nhà ở Hawaii,nơi ông làm việc tại một đơn vị nhỏ của NSA, và tới Hong Kong và sau đó là Nga.

Ông Snowden đã trú tạm tại khu quá cảnh ở sân bay của Nga trong vòng một tháng trong khi Hoa Kỳ gây sức ép để các nước khác từ chối chấp nhận ông này tới tị nạn.

Ông Snowden rời sân bay hôm 1/8 sau khi chính quyền Nga nói họ cho ông tị nạn trong một năm.

Nói chuyện với người dẫn chương trình có tiếng của Hoa Kỳ Jay Leno trong đêm thứ Ba, ông Obama khẳng định cam kết tham gia đàm phán với Nga nhân tham dự G20.

Nhưng Phó cố vấn an ninh quốc gia Ben Rhodes nói hôm thứ Tư rằng ông Obama sẽ không tham gia đàm phán tay đôi với ông ở Moscow hay bên lề hội nghị thượng đỉnh G20.

Ông Rhodes nói: ""Chúng tôi sẽ vẫn hợp tác với Nga trong những vấn đề chúng tôi có thể tìm được những điểm chung, nhưng cả tổng thống và ban an ninh quốc gia đều thấy cuộc gặp thượng đỉnh không hợp lý trong môi trường hiện nay,"" ông Rhodes được hãng tin Hoa Kỳ Associated Press dẫn lời nói."

Video given to reporters by someone claiming they gave Rob Ford the drugs

Ford calls allegations ""ridiculous"" and ""untrue""

Toronto's mayor has purportedly been filmed on cellphone video smoking crack cocaine, the Toronto Star reported.

The footage appears to show Rob Ford ""sitting in a chair, wearing a white shirt, top buttons open, inhaling from what appears to be a glass crack pipe,"" the newspaper says.

Two of the newspaper's reporters were shown the footage May 3 by someone who claims to have supplied the crack and shot the video. This person told the Star that they have previously given the mayor crack. The reporters watched the video three times.

The newspaper reports that the 90-second video allegedly shot last winter shows Ford ""incoherent, trading jibes with an off-camera speaker who goads the clearly impaired mayor by raising topics including Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau and the high school football team Ford coaches.""

""I'm f---ing right wing,"" Ford seems to mutter, the report says. ""Everyone expects me to be right wing. I'm just supposed to be this great ... ""

The newspaper says that the mayor appears to refer to the players on the football team as ""just f---ing minorities.""

The Star claims the video ends when the smartphone rings and the mayor says, ""That phone better not be on.""

The video is being shopped around by a group of men involved in the drug trade, the Star reported Thursday.

The newspaper says that it has no way to verify the authenticity of the tape, and reports that its attempts to get comment from the mayor or his staff Thursday about the video were unsuccessful.

Thursday night, Ford's chief of staff, Mark Towhey, would not listen to questions by the Star and hung up on a reporter, the newspaper reports.

CNN cannot confirm the video's authenticity.

Ford spoke Friday morning to reporters, but did not answer questions. He denied allegations, calling them ""ridiculous"" and ""not true.""

CNN has calls into the mayor and the mayor's lawyer, Dennis Morris.

Also Thursday, the news site Gawker also ran a story about the video. A Gawker journalist says he was contacted by a tipster who described the tape, and the Gawker reporter flew to Canada to see the video in person. The journalist met with two men, one of whom showed the video -- still on the phone -- to the journalist, and then demanded money for the tape. The Gawker reporter did not pay for it and the man with the phone took off.

Morris called Gawker's report ""false and defamatory,"" the Star reported.

Morris told the Star that it's impossible to know from watching a video what a person is actually smoking or drinking.

By Friday morning, reporters swarmed Toronto's City Hall hoping to interview the mayor, but instead interviewed deputy mayor Doug Holyday about the allegations. Holyday, the mayor's closest political ally, said he had not heard from the mayor Friday and didn't know where he was.

A reporter asked Holyday whether he believes the allegations are false.

""I hope so,"" he replied. The mayor should address the accusations ""sooner than later,"" he said. ""I would advise the mayor to speak to the media but I think he has to do it in a prepared way.""

Another reporter asked whether the scandal makes it possible Ford to continue to govern.

Holyday said he still has confidence in Ford, but said that he is willing to step up and replace the mayor if that becomes necessary.

Regardless, the scandal is hurting the city's reputation as the Star and Gawker's coverage is reposted around the world, the deputy mayor said.

""Whether you can blame the mayor or not blame the mayor depends on whether the story is true,"" Holyday said. ""I don't know that and I don't know that any of you do.""

He added: ""Certainly we all know that videos can be altered and we certainly know that drug dealers can't be trusted.""

CNN has been trying to interview the mayor for several months regarding the recommendation that Toronto create supervised injection centers for drug addicts. The mayor has declined all of CNN's requests."

Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Pollak'],Mandela's Funeral Is Hillary Clinton's Moment,"President Barack Obama will be visiting South Africa for the second time this year to attend Nelson Mandela’s memorial services. So, too will all other living past U.S. presidents–including Jimmy Carter, who worked with Mandela after the latter retired from politics, and George W. Bush, who did more for Africa than any other but is probably appreciated least. And then there is Bill Clinton, who remains South Africa’s favorite U.S. president–more so even than Obama, who is viewed as a disappointment. Politically, crudely, this is Hillary’s moment.

South Africans love Clinton partly because he happened to be in power when their country made its historic transition. He was there to welcome South Africa back into the international community, and he was there to welcome President Mandela as a fellow world leader. Clinton was also, back then, the “first black president,” and charmed the South African public with the same folksy manner he used to build his political coalition. He was different, too, from other Democrats, seeing potential in globalization, looking for friends rather than foes.

Clinton matched the Mandela mood. Obama, by contrast, has much more in common with Mandela’s successor, Thabo Mbeki, whose top-down leadership, aloof manner, and cronyism made him distinctly unpopular. Like Obama, Mbeki was thin-skinned and divisive, arrogant and jealous of sharing power with the other branches of government.A man who brooked no dissent within the ruling party, and who shunned the opposition, Mbeki left office before finishing his second term after being ousted as party leader by the populist Jacob Zuma.

Zuma has been sour on Obama ever since the Libya war. The South African government had maintained close ties with Muammar Gadhafi, dating back to the anti-apartheid struggle, and saw him as one of the continent’s few unifying figures, comical though he often was. Gadhafi had backed one of South Africa’s most important diplomatic projects, the African Union. His ouster was seen by the South African government as more of the same interventionism it had decried when Bush invaded Iraq. Obama, then, was seen as something of a sellout.

South Africans still like Obama and his family. They vastly prefer him to any of his Republican opponents, the more so as American conservatives get extremely bad press in South Africa (as they do in much of the social democratic world). But they also know a failure when they see one, and Obama’s failure in nearly every aspect of his presidency has not failed to make an impression. Clinton, by contrast, is remembered, mostly correctly, as having been a success. His America was a confident one, buoyed by prosperity and a post-Cold War glow.

I was once in the audience at a speech by Bill Clinton at the University of the Western Cape. I wore an American flag in my baseball cap, attracting hostile stares from some in the academic audience, for whom skepticism of the U.S. is fundamental intellectual principle. And yet as soon as Clinton reached the stage–looking tired and haggard, thin from months of dieting–the same people leapt to their feet in rapt applause. In his flaws, South Africans see their own failures. In his successes, they somehow see their hopes. He is the America they love.

Obama is the America of the South African elites, envious of America’s success and eager to see it more humble on the world stage. He says the right things about the need for government. He comes bearing gifts. But most South Africans are tired of Obama’s exhortations about transformation. They have heard the same from their own leaders for years. Bill Clinton knows how to bypass the dogma and go straight to the heart. He won over Israelis at Yitzchak Rabin’s funeral with: “Shalom, chaver. Goodbye, friend.” Expect something of an encore.

And expect Hillary Clinton to make the most of the moment. This is her chance, finally, to eclipse the man who beat her to the top with the help of a fawning media and disloyal superdelegates. This is her chance to overcome the spurious but effective charges of racism that the Obama campaign used against her to undermine her among black voters. She will know how to place herself in the media spotlight without seeming to have done so, and will make the best use of her husband’s popularity, the better to cast herself as his true American successor."

The Executive Office for Immigration Review’s Statisical Yearbook for 2012 says that number is up sharply, with 66% more no-shows than in 2008.

The asylum system appears to be a magnet for abuse by those who make a claim to get into the country and then vanish. As Breitbart News reported, last week one border crossing near San Diego saw a sudden flood of asylum requests that resulted in the checkpoint being shut down.

The numbers from the DoJ indicate a growing crisis in the system the United States uses to grant asylum to international refugees, as the immigration courts are overwhelmed by cases from Mexican immigrants that rarely result in asylum being granted.

In raw numbers, Mexican immigrants made 9,206 asylum claims in 2012 but were only found by the immigration courts to have 126 claims worthy of being granted. Compare those numbers to immigrants from a country like China–often accused of human rights violations–11,197 asylum claims were made, 4,705 of which were granted.

There is no breakdown in the report by nationality for the people who make an asylum claim but don’t bother to show up in court, but in 2012, 29% of all asylum applicants released on bond or their own recognizance were “failure to appears.”

The cost in court time for frivolous claims is also staggering. For the past five years, cases involving Mexican immigrants rank #1 in the amount of immigration court cases completed in terms of both normal decisions and appeals. However, in terms of the number of actual asylums that were granted, Mexico has never ranked higher than #17 and didn’t even make the list of the top 25 grantees from 2008-2010.

Over 65% of the asylum cases completed in the immigration courts in 2012 involved nationals from Mexico, Honduras, El Salvador, or Guatemala, with Mexicans being the vast majority of all cases completed at 42%. Additionally, 67% of all immigration court proceeding are completed in Spanish.

In a statement issued after his two-hour meeting with President Mohamed Morsi, Mr. Kerry said the aid decision reflected Egypt’s “extreme needs” and Mr. Morsi’s assurance that Egypt would reach an agreement with the I.M.F. after more than a year of talks over a $4.8 billion loan package.

The statement issued by Mr. Kerry noted that he and Mr. Morsi had discussed the need to ensure the fairness of Egypt’s coming elections, but it did not mention any specific political commitments the Egyptian president had made to receive the aid.

Parliamentary elections are scheduled for April. Some opposition groups have said they will boycott the vote because of what they see as an effort by Mr. Morsi and his Muslim Brotherhood movement to dominate Egyptian politics."

Story highlights Al Qaeda affiliate in Yemen confirms death of a key leader Peter Bergen says it amounts to a concession that the group is in deep trouble Militants in Yemen were riding high in 2011, but drone campaign has set them back, he says Bergen: Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is struggling to survive

(CNN) —

On Wednesday, al Qaeda’s virulent Yemeni affiliate which is known as al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) confirmed the death of the group’s deputy leader and co-founder, Saeed al-Shihri, in a video message posted to jihadist websites.

It was a confirmation of what was long suspected: that Shihri was killed in a U.S. drone strike several months ago. And it also amounted to a concession that the al Qaeda affiliate is under an enormous amount of pressure.

In the past three years more than 30 al Qaeda leaders and other senior operatives in Yemen have been killed by U.S. drone strikes, according to a count by the New America Foundation.

Tim Hetherington for CNN Peter Bergen

The militants killed by those drone strikes included Anwar al-Awlaki, the fiery Yemeni-American preacher who served as a key ideologue for the group and has been an inspiration for a wide range of militants living in the West, including the Tsarnaev brothers who are accused of bombing the Boston Marathon in April.

Not all of the drone strikes in Yemen have found their targets. New America Foundation’s review of reliable media reporting of those strikes found that somewhere between 38 and 71 of the casualties were civilians, which included Awlaki’s 16-year-old son.

A Yemeni tribal leader close to AQAP says the drone strikes have sown mistrust within the group, where there is “a feeling that the Americans have infiltrated its ranks, especially with the killing of several of its leaders.”

Al-Shihri, a Saudi who spent six years at the Guantanamo Bay detention facility, was first reported killed in January. The Yemeni government quickly confirmed Shihri’s death, but until now AQAP had denied it.

AQAP’s video message confirming Shihri’s death was delivered by Ibrahim al-Rubaish, another Saudi who was also formerly held at Guantanamo Bay.

In the 11½-minute video, which we have reviewed, Rubaish gushes about Shihri’s devotion to al Qaeda’s cause. Rubaish says Shihri was “searching for martyrdom,” trumpeting his combat against U.S. forces in Afghanistan where he suffered serious injuries to his hands and legs, and lost an eye.

Shihri was released from Guantanamo in November 2007, and entered a Saudi rehabilitation program and was then released. Rubaish says Shihri subsequently planned an attack on the U.S. Embassy in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, which killed 10 Yemeni policemen and civilians.

But Shihri grew complacent. “Lax security measures during his telephone calls enabled the enemy to identify and kill him,” Rubaish declared in his eulogy.

Shihri’s death in the U.S. drone strike is part of larger story of AQAP decline over the past two years. In 2011, AQAP had gained significant territory in Yemen as it exploited the popular uprising against longtime Yemeni president Ali Abdullah Saleh. Its core membership grew from approximately 300 members in 2009 to around 1,000 three years later, according to Gregory Johnsen, the author of the authoritative book “The Last Refuge: Yemen, al-Qaeda, and America’s War in Arabia”.

But the jihadist group lost all of these gains within about a year. An offensive by the Yemeni army that was supported by U.S. intelligence last year pushed AQAP out of the central Yemeni province of Abyan, forcing AQAP’s fighters to flee to the remote desert province of Hadramaut.

The group has since been reduced to carrying out much smaller attacks; nothing compared to the massive suicide bombing it was able to conduct in the heart of the Yemeni capital in May 2012, which killed upwards of 100 soldiers as they rehearsed for a military parade.

And despite its focus on attacking U.S. targets, AQAP has not tried to attack one since its October 2010 attempt to plant bombs hidden in printer cartridges on cargo planes destined for the United States. (Last year AQAP plotted to send an operative with explosives in his underwear aboard a plane bound for the United States, but that operative was actually secretly working for the British and Saudi intelligence services, so the plot was never a real threat.)

Despite all the losses AQAP has suffered its capable chief bomb maker, Ibrahim al-Asiri, remains at large. Al-Asiri was the brains behind AQAP’s failed “underwear bomb” attempt to bring down a Detroit-bound U.S. airliner on Christmas Day 2009.

AQAP’s overall leader, Nasser al-Wuhayshi also remains at large, Wuhayshi is AQAP’s founder and his continued survival is surely important for the organization.

AQAP could regenerate, particularly if Yemen sees more upheaval, but for now, the group is on the run from the Yemeni army and U.S. drone strikes, fearful of spies in its midst, is unable to launch large-scale attacks, and boasts a dwindling cadre of leaders. AQAP, in short, is struggling to survive.

(CNN) —

Could Israel be considering a momentous concession that would change the course of 46 years of history with the Palestinians?

A news report, a show of goodwill and diplomatic murmurs by the United States and its Arab partners are stoking hopes that a glacial budge in Israel’s position could lead Israelis and Palestinians to talk seriously about peace again.

Reuters news agency quoted an Israeli official last week who said Israel agreed to a plan for peace talks based on pre-1967 borders and land swaps.

It is something the United Nations demanded in a resolution in 1967 and has been the gold standard of yearnings for Middle East peace ever since. It requires Israel to withdraw from occupied territories completely and the Palestinians to recognize the existence of an Israeli state.

Israel to free Palestinian prisoners as deal to resume peace talks emerges

Israel denies report

Israel’s public relations apparatus immediately denied the report. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s spokesman Mark Regev told CNN on Saturday he could not imagine who in the government would say something like that.

But on the same day, Israel announced it would unilaterally release a number of Palestinian prisoners in a gesture of goodwill, given the prospects for new talks.

“As the negotiations proceed, Israel agrees to free, as a goodwill gesture, a limited number of prisoners during the period of the negotiations,” said Yuval Steinitz, Israel’s minister of strategic affairs. It is not yet clear how many prisoners will be released and who they will be.

Whatever the magic ingredient is that could be drawing Israel and the Palestinians to the negotiating table, all parties involved are holding their tongues about it.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry wants people to stop guessing what it is.

“Any speculation or reports you may read in the media … are conjecture … because the people who know the facts are not talking about them,” he said.

He said he will say something when the time is right – side by side with the appropriate leaders.

Those will likely be Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas.

Kerry praised their “courageous leadership,” saying they had chosen to make difficult decisions.

It “establishes a basis for resuming direct final status negotiations between” Palestinians and Israel, Kerry said Friday from Jordan.

And they could happen fast. The two sides will join him in Washington “for initial talks within the next week or so” if things keep working out, Kerry said.

New city offers vision of better life in West Bank

Palestinian officials surprised

Developments have come so rapidly that they have caught Palestinian leaders around Abbas off guard, said a senior Palestinian official who did not want to be named due to the sensitivity of the situation.

The officials are asking for guarantees and have lots of questions.

For some, hope is mixed with pessimism built up through decades of futile negotiations and bloody relations between Israelis and Palestinians.

Talks “are bound to fail sooner than later” if there is no commitment to clear terms, such as a freeze on Israeli settlements in occupied territory, said Mustafa Barghouti, a prominent Palestinian legislator and head of a political party.

A sporting push for peace in Israeli-Palestinian relations

Israeli reaction

On Sunday, Netanyahu spoke as though peace talks were definite.

“These will not be easy negotiations,” he said as he opened a Cabinet meeting. “We will enter into them with integrity, sincerity and the hope that this process will be conducted responsibly.”

Israel’s defense minister said Saturday that his government wants to waste no time getting started with the peace talks.

“We are getting to the negotiations with clean hands and great desire to get to an arrangement that will end the conflict,” Moshe Ya’alon said.

Israeli Justice Minister Tzipi Livni lauded the prospect of peace in a statement.

“Four years of political stagnation are coming to an end,” she said.

Understanding 1967

To understand the excitement over the rumored concessions – if they are indeed a possibility – one needs to go back to the dawn of the Six-Day War.

In June 1967, Egypt, Syria and Jordan massed their troops on Israel’s borders in preparation for an all-out attack.

Israel launched a pre-emptive strike on June 5, targeting Arab airfields and destroying the Egyptian air force on the ground.

Mideast 101: The Six-Day War

Egypt had set up a sea blockade against Israel the day before, according to the U.S. State Department Office of the Historian.

Military skirmishes and bellicose gestures between Israel and many of its Arab neighbors had reached a crescendo. Syria threatened to push Israel into the sea. Egypt allied with the Syrians.

Israel captured lands from its enemies and occupied them.

Maps, land and history: Why 1967 still matters

The United Nations demanded in Security Council Resolution 242 that Israeli troops withdraw and give the lands back. The resolution required all states involved to recognize each other’s existence.

At first, Arab countries refused to recognize Israel as a state, and Israel retained the captured territory.

Over time, things changed. Egypt and Israel made peace in a deal brokered by U.S. President Jimmy Carter at Camp David in 1978, and Israel handed the largest captured chunk, the Sinai Peninsula, back to Egypt.

Jordan and Israel mended relations.

Israel withdrew from Gaza, bulldozing its former settlements on its way out.

But it has hung on to the West Bank, and the Palestinians have refused to recognize Israel as a state.

After decades of waiting, many hold out hope that new negotiations could ultimately bring about a resolution.

It was a cloak-and-dagger affair. Mr. Snowden wore a cap and sunglasses and insisted that the assembled lawyers hide their cellphones in the refrigerator of the home where he was staying, to block any eavesdropping. Then began a two-hour conversation during which Mr. Snowden was deeply dismayed to learn that he could spend years in prison without access to a computer during litigation over whether he would be granted asylum here or surrendered to the United States.

Staying cooped up in the cramped Hong Kong home of a local supporter was less bothersome to Mr. Snowden than the prospect of losing his computer.

“He didn’t go out, he spent all his time inside a tiny space, but he said it was O.K. because he had his computer,” said Albert Ho, one of Mr. Snowden’s lawyers. “If you were to deprive him of his computer, that would be totally intolerable.”"

Washington (CNN) - One day before President Barack Obama gives a prime time speech to make his case against Syria, a new national poll indicates the president's approval rating on foreign policy has hit an all-time low. And only three in ten approve of how he is handling Syria.

But according to a CNN/ORC International survey, the number of Americans who approve of how Obama is handling his job in general remains steady.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

Only four in ten approve of the job Obama is doing on foreign policy, with 57% of those questioned giving the president a thumbs down. The 40% approval rating on foreign policy is Obama's lowest level ever on that issue in CNN polling.

The CNN poll's Monday release comes as the president sits down for interviews with the country's major broadcast and cable news networks, including CNN, to push for congressional authorization for U.S. military action to punish the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for allegedly using chemical weapons against its own citizens.

""President Obama's approval rating on foreign affairs has continued its steady decline - from 54% in January to 49% in April, 44% in June, and just 40% now,"" says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. ""This may be a troubling sign for a president who in past polls had always scored his highest ratings for his handling of foreign affairs.""

Specifically on Syria, only 31% of the public approves of the president's policies and actions, with 63% giving him a thumbs down. Four in ten Democrats say they disapprove of the job Obama's doing on Syria, with 54% saying they approve.

There is a wide partisan divide on this question, with only 26% of independents and just nine percent of Republicans approving of how Obama is handling the situation in Syria, which is suffering through two years of a bloody civil war between government forces and various rebel factions.

""The number of Democrats who disapprove of how the president's handling Syria may cause problems for the White House,"" adds Holland. ""Given his low approval scores on Syria among independents and Republicans, the 40% of Democrats who disapprove may mean there is no base to rally on this key issue.""

The president's overall approval rating stands at 45%, with 52% saying they disapprove of the job he's doing in the White House. The 45% approval rating is unchanged from CNN's previous poll, which was conducted in June.

""An unchanged overall approval rating perhaps comes as a surprise to some observers, but arguably the unpopularity of military action against Syria is balanced by the fact that the public wanted the president to consult with Congress before taking action on Syria, and that's exactly what he did,"" adds Holland.

The 45% approval rating is not Obama's lowest mark in CNN polling. His all-time low was a 43% approval rating in September of 2011.

The poll also indicates the president's approval rating on the economy stands at 43% on the economy, 42% on health care, and 36% on the budget deficit, all basically unchanged from earlier this year.

While the president's overall approval rating is nothing to brag about, it's still soars above Congress. According to the CNN poll, only one in five give federal lawmakers a thumbs up on the job they're doing on Capitol Hill, with 78% saying they disapprove.

The CNN poll was conducted by ORC International September 6-8, with 1,022 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points."

Castro, closing a year-end meeting of the parliament, said that recently the two countries, bitter foes for more than half a century, had been able ""to hold conversations on topics of mutual interest."" ""We think we can resolve other matters of interest,"" he said, without elaborating. Castro said that ""a civilized relationship between both countries"" was something ""our people and the immense majority of U.S. citizens and Cuban immigrants desire."" Castro's speech came just two weeks after he and U.S. President Barack Obama shook hands at a memorial for the late Nelson Mandela. The White House played down the handshake, saying it was unplanned and went no further than pleasantries. Still, the meeting had resonance because of the surprise warming in recent months with several instances of cooperation. U.S. and Cuban officials overcame a series of potentially divisive incidents this summer, including the interception of a shipment of Cuban weapons headed for North Korea, with mutual displays of prudent diplomacy rarely seen since the 1959 revolution that brought Fidel Castro to power. At a fund-raising dinner in Miami last month, Obama said that it may be time for the United States to revise its policies toward Cuba, against which a trade embargo has been in place for more than half a century. Obama questioned whether the policy that was put in place in 1961 remains an effective way of dealing with U.S. differences with the Communist-ruled island nation. While Castro on Saturday seemed to be holding out an olive branch, at the same time he reiterated Cuba's position, held since the 1959 revolution, that neither Cuba's one-party rule, nor its economic system, were on the table. ""We do not demand that the United States change its political and social system, nor do we accept negotiating ours,"" he said. ""If we really want to move forward in our bilateral relations, we have to learn to mutually respect our differences and become accustomed to peacefully living with them,"" he said to applause from the parliament deputies. A significant breakthrough in relations remains unlikely while Cuba continues to detain a U.S. government contractor, Alan Gross, who was arrested 4 years ago for what Cuba saw as a subversive effort to promote political change. Gross said he was in Cuba to set up communications equipment to give unrestricted Internet access to Jewish groups. A Cuban judge said that activity was a crime against the state and sentenced Gross to 15 years. It remains unclear what steps the Obama administration can take to obtain Gross's release. Cuba has hinted it would release him in return for four Cubans jailed on espionage charges in the United States, but Washington has flatly ruled that out. (Editing by David Adams and Gunna Dickson)"

Hundreds of pages of court documents in Kansas City and New York illustrate how Khalid Ouazzani -- a Kansas City used auto parts salesman and failed real estate investor -- and two other naturalized American citizens were fleeced out of tens of thousands of dollars by Al Qaeda leaders who exploited their zeal to wage holy war, The Kansas City Star reported.

In a recent letter to a New York federal judge, a lawyer representing cell member Sabirhan Hasanoff -- a Brooklyn accountant at PricewaterhouseCoopers who moved to Dubai in 2007 -- acknowledged that Hasanoff once dreamed about jihad glory but instead got taken by a Yemeni con man.

""The defendants never had any authentic access to terrorism networks or Islamic extremists, and were victims of a rudimentary fraud,"" the lawyer wrote.

Federal prosecutors responded that while Hasanoff couldn't control how his contributions would be used, he intended them to support Al Qaeda's terrorist goals.

Ouazzani, Hanoff and Wesam El-Hanafi, who was an information security specialist in Brooklyn with Lehman Brothers before moving to Dubai around 2005, all aspired to ""support violent extremist Islamic causes,"" prosecutors have said. They are awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty in Kansas City and New York to various federal crimes.

All three also are married, have children and didn't care much for the idea of blowing themselves up for the cause.

Court records show that El-Hanafi connected with two experienced terrorists in Yemen in mid-2007. One of the men, referred to in court records as ""Suffian,"" had recently left prison and was eager to resume his work for Al Qaeda.

The other man, referred to as ""The Doctor,"" was an experienced jihadi who claimed to have fought the Soviets in Afghanistan and pledged his support in the 1990s to an organization that later merged with Al Qaeda. He also ran an automobile business in Yemen.

The three Americans began sending $300 a month to their new friends in Yemen to prove they were serious. Ouazzani also offered a $6,500 commitment to the cause, which he couldn't afford most likely because of real estate losses in Kansas City. Hasanoff covered Ouazzani's contribution and later badgered him with emails demanding repayment.

The three also sent watches, cold-weather gear, Garmin GPS units and a remote-control car to the terrorist leaders.

After being arrested by Yemeni authorities, Suffian and The Doctor told FBI agents the Americans believed the money and equipment were being set aside for their military training that eventually would land them in Somalia, Iraq or Afghanistan.

Instead, The Doctor admitted he and Suffian divided the material loot between themselves, gave some of the money to the families of Islamic martyrs and bought a couple of automobiles.

The three Americans also had planned to send a $45,000 contribution in late 2008, which The Doctor had earmarked for a personal investment.

""(The Doctor's) plan was to take the Americans' money,"" Suffian is quoted as saying in one FBI interview. ""For example, (The Doctor) was planning on using the $45,000 to open an appliance store.""

Eventually the Americans became impatient and pressed The Doctor and Suffian for word about when they would travel for jihad. The Yemenis urged patience, saying the three were better suited for an operation in the U.S. than fighting in foreign countries.

The process would be sped up dramatically, though, if they consented to a ""martyrdom"" operation, one of Suffian's terror contacts told him.

""The Americans . advised (Suffian) that they did not want to do a martyrdom operation, but still wanted to travel for jihad,"" the FBI reported."

As midlife sets in, maintaining a healthy weight often becomes harder. Tricks that worked in the past, like cutting down on wine or sugar, no longer seem to work, either. Even slender Samantha Cameron, now 50, has apparently been affected. In her 30s and early 40s, staying in shape was easy, she said this weekend, “but then I hit 43, I just put on three-quarters of a stone. Suddenly you don’t quite fit any of your things and I got really bloated.” At first she tried doing the 5:2 diet – eating normally five days a week, then having just 500 calories on the other two – but “I just couldn’t do it, I literally couldn’t speak in the evening, I had to go to bed at 7pm.” She has recently found a solution: the 5:2 principles, but with 800 calories on the “fast” days, and says she’s “loving it” and “the bloating’s gone”. Alongside three weekly workouts, she says it’s helping to keep her trim: her goal is “to hit my 50s in almost as good shape as I hit my 40s.” If you’re struggling to maintain your weight and fitness post-50, here’s why – and what to do about it: Muscle mass Every decade after the age of 30, we on average lose three to eight per cent of our muscle mass. At first, this might not be noticeable, but by 50 or 60, will make a considerable difference. This is bad news if you want to lose weight, because muscle burns on average three times more calories than fat per day, even at rest. What to do: Incorporate resistance training into your weekly routine to reduce muscle loss. The NHS recommends two sessions of strength training a week, which could include activities as varied as gardening or lifting weights. Don’t underestimate the good that exercise can do: a 2018 study shows that regular exercisers over the age of 55 kept up their muscle mass considerably more than inactive people. Staying active In England, half of 16 to 24-year-olds are doing the recommended amount of weekly exercise, but only one in 10 people aged 65 to 74 are doing so. If injuries have accrued, and your work and social life is less busy than it once was, you may be leading a more sedentary lifestyle than you realise. The role of exercise in weight loss is much-debated, but it can be crucial in maintaining your weight. A famous 2016 study followed participants in American weight loss competition The Biggest Loser during and after filming, and found that most regained a lot of weight after the cameras stopped rolling due to a higher appetite and slower metabolism. However, a follow-up study in 2017 found that the contestants who kept the most weight off were those who had remained committed to a fitness regimen. This was particularly interesting given that more exercise didn’t equal more weight loss during the show, when those who lost the most focused on diet over working out. What to do: Try to stick to the NHS guidelines on exercise, which recommend 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week, or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise, or a mixture of both. Make sure you are doing something appropriate for your body, too. As we get older, high-impact workouts like running may place unwanted stress on your joints, so think about lower impact options like swimming or cycling. Hormones Menopause changes where fat is stored on the body. Higher oestrogen levels in the fertile years cause fat to be stored on your legs, hips and behind, but after oestrogen drops, fat can move to your middle, even if you remain exactly the same weight. This can be an issue, as fat around your trunk is more likely to contribute to Type 2 diabetes, hypertension and heart issues than fat on your hips and legs. Men are affected by hormone changes as they age, too: after the age of 40 they lose roughly one per cent of their testosterone a year. This matters for weight, as testosterone is linked to the amount of muscle you have and where you store fat. What to do: For women, several studies suggest that HRT can help to stop the shift of fat from your bottom half to around your middle as you go through menopause. An Italian study followed two groups of equal weight post-menopausal women for a year, putting half of them on HRT, with the rest going hormone-free. At the end of the year, the HRT group stayed almost the same weight, and hadn’t put on any extra fat around their middles or arms. In the untreated group, things were different: they had put on three and a half pounds, and had increased the amount of fat around their waists and arms. HRT isn’t suitable for everyone, so make sure you consider your options and discuss with your doctor first. In men, hormones are linked to a variety of lifestyle factors, including body fat and waist size, which can increase the amount of oestrogen in your body. Keeping active is also vital for men’s hormones: a 2018 study found that regular cyclists aged 55 to 74 kept their testosterone levels up compared with inactive men. Your sleep is also a partial predictor of your testosterone levels: most of the hormone is released while we doze, so if you’re not getting enough hours in bed, your body has less chance of boosting its stores. Getting enough sleep is key for maintaining your weight for other reasons, too: not getting enough is shown to make you gravitate towards sweet foods, and muscle growth occurs largely while we’re resting at night. More stress For many, juggling looking after children and caring for parents with work can mean life post-50 requires navigating a huge amount of stress. Even if you eat exactly as you did before, stress can cause weight gain. In 2015, American researchers found that after eating a large meal, women who reported more stress in the previous day burned 104 fewer calories than women who weren’t stressed. Stressed women also had higher levels of insulin, which is linked to gaining fat. This may not sound significant, but burning 100 fewer calories a day could lead to a loss of 10lbs of fat over a year. What to do: Reducing stress is often one of the hardest lifestyle changes to make, as you may have little control over the issues at work or home. However, you can change how you react, which can reduce your stress levels even without anything changing in your external environment. Exercise is an incredibly effective way of lowering cortisol levels, as well as burning calories, which could lead to a double effect on your weight. There is also robust evidence that simply slowing your breathing can dramatically reduce stress in both the short and long term, as well as giving a range of other benefits like better sleep. “Slow” counts as anything less than 10 breaths a minute, and six breaths is even better. The NHS recommends inhaling for up to a count of five, then exhaling for the same length of time."
http://news.yahoo.com/libya-somalia-raids-show-u-threat-al-qaeda-084651085.html,,[],"Libya, Somalia raids show U.S. reach, problems","By Ghaith Shennib and Abdi Sheikh TRIPOLI/MOGADISHU (Reuters) - Two U.S. raids in Africa show the United States is pressuring al Qaeda, officials said on Sunday, though a failure in Somalia and an angry response in Libya also highlighted Washington's problems. In Tripoli, U.S. forces snatched a Libyan wanted over the bombings of the American embassy in Nairobi 15 years ago and whisked him out of the country, prompting Secretary of State John Kerry to declare that al Qaeda leaders ""can run but they can't hide"". But the capture of Nazih al-Ragye, better known as Abu Anas al-Liby, also provoked a complaint about the ""kidnap"" from the Western-backed Libyan prime minister; he faces a backlash from armed Islamists who have carved out a share of power since the West helped Libyan rebels oust Muammar Gaddafi two years ago. In Somalia, Navy SEALS stormed ashore into the al Shabaab stronghold of Barawe but, a U.S. official said, they failed to capture or kill the target among the Somali allies of al Qaeda. U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters the target was a Kenyan of Somali origin known by the name Ikrima, described as a foreign fighter commander for al Shabaab in Somalia. One of the officials said it was not known if Ikrima was connected to last month's attack on Westgate mall in Nairobi by al Shabaab gunmen in which at least 67 people were killed. Kerry, on a visit to Indonesia, said President Barack Obama's administration was ""pleased with the results"" of the combined assaults early on Saturday. ""We hope this makes clear that the United States of America will never stop in its effort to hold those accountable who conduct acts of terror,"" he said. Two years after Navy SEALs finally tracked down and killed al Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden in Pakistan, a decade after al Qaeda's September 11 attacks on the United States in 2001, the twin operation demonstrated the reach of U.S. military forces in Africa, where Islamist militancy has been in the ascendant. The forays also threw a spotlight on Somalia's status as a fragmented haven for al Qaeda allies more than 20 years after Washington intervened in vain in its civil war and Libya's descent into an anarchic battleground between rival bands on the Mediterranean that stretches deep south into the Sahara. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said they showed Washington would ""spare no effort to hold terrorists accountable"". Yet disrupting its most aggressive enemy, in an oil-rich state that is awash with arms and sits on Europe's doorstep, may have been more the priority in the Libya raid than putting on trial a little known suspect in the 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224 people. LIBYA RISKS Clearly aware of the risks to his government of complicity in the snatching of Liby as he returned to his suburban home from dawn prayers, Prime Minister Ali Zeidan said: ""The Libyan government is following the news of the kidnapping of a Libyan citizen who is wanted by U.S. authorities. ""The Libyan government has contacted U.S. authorities to ask them to provide an explanation."" State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf, without commenting on any specific communications, said, ""we consult regularly with the Libyan government on a range of security and counterterrorism issues."" Another U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters the Libyan government had been notified of the operation, but did not specify when Libya was informed. Liby's son, Abdullah al Ragye, 19, told reporters at the family home that men had pulled up in four cars, knocked him out with some kind of drug, dragged him from his vehicle and driven off with him in a Mercedes. ""They had a Libyan look and Libyan accents,"" he said. It was not clear, however, whether the men were connected to the Libyan state, which may either have sought to keep its distance or been sidelined by Washington for fear of leaks. Abdul Bassit Haroun, a former Islamist militia commander who works with the Libyan government on security, said the U.S. raid would show Libya was no refuge for ""international terrorists"". ""But it is also very bad that no state institutions had the slightest information about this process, nor do they have a force which was able to capture him,"" he told Reuters. ""This means the Libyan state simply does not exist."" He warned that Islamist militants, like those blamed for the deadly attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi a year ago, would hit back violently. ""This won't just pass,"" Haroun said. ""There will be a strong reaction in order to take revenge because this is one of the most important al Qaeda figures."" SOMALI CHAOS Somalia's Western-backed government said it did cooperate with Washington, though its control of much of the country, including the port of Barawe, 180 km (110 miles) south of the capital Mogadishu, is limited by powerful armed groups. ""We have collaboration with the world and with neighboring countries in the battle against al Shabaab,"" Prime Minister Abdi Farah Shirdon said when asked of Somalia's role in the raid. U.S. forces have used airborne drones to kill Somalis in the past and last year SEALs freed two kidnapped aid workers there. Somali police said seven people were killed in Barawe. U.S. officials said their forces took no casualties but had broken off the fighting to avoid harming civilians. They failed to capture or kill their target during fighting around dawn at a seaside villa that al Shabaab said was one of its bases. A Somali intelligence official said a Chechen commander, who might have been the Americans' target, was wounded. In Somalia, al Shabaab spokesman Sheikh Abdiasis Abu Musab told Reuters no senior figure was present when the Americans came ashore. ""Ordinary fighters lived in the house and they bravely counter attacked and chased off the attackers,"" he said. Al Shabaab said that in attacking the Nairobi mall it was hitting back at Kenyan intervention in Somalia, which has forced it from much of its territory. It also targeted Westerners out shopping. AFRICAN VIOLENCE From Nigeria in the west, through Mali, Algeria and Libya to Somalia and Kenya in the east, Africa has seen major attacks on its own people and on Western economic interests, including an Algerian desert gas plant in January and the Nairobi mall as well as the killing of the U.S. ambassador in Libya a year ago. The trend reflects a number of factors, including Western efforts to force al Qaeda from its former base in Afghanistan, the overthrow of anti-Islamist authoritarian rulers in the Arab Spring of 2011 and growing resentment among Africa's poor with governments they view as corrupt pawns of Western powers. Western intelligence experts say there is evidence of growing links among Islamist militants across North Africa, who share al Qaeda's goal of a strict Islamic state and the expulsion of Western interests from Muslim lands. Liby, who has been reported as having fled Gaddafi's police state to join bin Laden in Sudan in the 1990s before securing political asylum in Britain, may have been part of that bid to consolidate an operational base, analysts say. Wanted by the FBI, which gives his age as 49 and had offered a $5 million reward for help in capturing him, Liby was indicted in 2000 along with 20 other al Qaeda suspects including bin Laden and current global leader Ayman al-Zawahri. Charges relating to him personally accused him of discussing the bombing of the Nairobi embassy in retaliation for the U.S. intervention in the Somali civil war in 1992-1993 and of helping reconnoiter and plan the attack in the years before 1998. Obama, wrestling with the legal and political difficulties posed by prisoners at the U.S. military base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, has said he does not want to send more suspects there. But a spokeswoman for the White House National Security Council said it was still not decided where Liby would be tried. His indictment was filed in New York, making that a possible venue for a civilian, rather than military, trial. It was unclear where Liby was on Sunday. U.S. naval forces in the Mediterranean, as well as bases in Italy and Germany, would provide ample facilities within a short flight time.

The paper, released by the Ministry of Defense, did not declare that the United States was responsible, but the message was clear.

Strongly alluding to the Obama administration’s policy to “pivot” toward a greater focus on the Asia-Pacific region, the paper said, “Some country has strengthened its Asia-Pacific military alliances, expanded its military presence in the region, and frequently makes the situation tenser.” Thus, China has an “arduous task to safeguard its national unification, territorial integrity and development interests.”

Presented at a news briefing in Beijing on Tuesday, the paper has mostly a symbolic significance, defense analysts say. It is useful as a way of understanding the way the Communist Party thinks defense issues should be presented to the public, they say. But it is scarcely looked at by China’s military officers.

Over all, the paper suggested that China should be satisfied with its strategic position and offered a congratulatory note, saying that China “has seized and made the most of this important period of strategic opportunities for its development, and its modernization achievements have captured world attention.” In particular, it singled out a better situation with Taiwan, saying, “Cross-straits relations are sustaining a momentum of peaceful development.”"

Ontario Superior Court Justice Charles Hackland rendered a decision nearly a year ago ordering Ford to abdicate in light of his violation of the Toronto Municipal Conflict of Interest Act and related actions that followed.

“I declare the seat of the respondent, Robert Ford, on Toronto City Council, vacant,” Hackland concluded in a Nov. 26, 2012 decision that garnered much press in Toronto, but has been little cited in the U.S.

According to court papers published in the Toronto Star, the story centers upon a lawsuit filed by Paul Magder, a Toronto voter, related to an August 25, 2010 report by the city’s Integrity Commissioner, in which she found Ford, “used the City of Toronto logo, his status as a City Councillor, and City of Toronto resources to solicit funds for a private football foundation he created in his name.""

Specifically, lobbyists, clients of lobbyists and a corporation that does work for the city donated $3,150 to the Rob Ford Football Foundation. In the report, the Integrity Commissioner recommended the City Council order Ford pay the money back.

More On This... Toronto Mayor Ford once left debate early to coach football — then reportedly had buses pulled off route to shuttle team

The City Council initially approved the report the same day it was filed. But it then reconsidered the matter and held a fateful second vote.

Council Speaker Sandra Bussin asked Ford prior to the vote, according to Hackland’s decision, “This matter deals with an issue regarding your conduct. Do you intend to declare a conflict? You are voting? Okay.”

Ford then voted against his having to make restitution, but the matter carried the council, anyway. Ford not only never paid the money back to the donors, but he also ignored letters the integrity commissioner sent him on Aug. 31, 2010, Sept. 15, 2010, May 10, 2011, June 7, 2011 and July 4, 2011 reminding him to do so.

The Council revisited it all on Feb. 7, 2012, at which time Ford said, “To ask that I pay it out of my own pocket personally, there is just, there is no sense to this. The money is gone; the money has been spent on football equipment.”

After Ford’s explanation, the council took up a motion to nix its earlier order he repay the money. Again, Ford voted on the measure, even though he had financial interest in its result. The motion carried 22-to-12 in his favor.

Magder then filed suit.

Ford – in foreshadowing a pattern re-emerging in 2013 – told the court that not only was the donation so small as to be unworthy of discussion, but he had run afoul of the city conflict of interest regulations accidentally.

Hackland didn’t buy any of it, and wrote in his decision, “In view of the (Ford’s) leadership role in ensuring integrity in municipal government, it is difficult to accept an error in judgment (defense) based essentially on a stubborn sense of entitlement (concerning his football foundation) and a dismissive and confrontational attitude to the Integrity Commissioner and the Code of Conduct.” He then ordered him removed from office.

But Ford lived to fight another day, taking the matter up with an appellate court. Then – and in January – the court ruled in Ford’s favor, not so much saying he was justified in any of his actions, but that the City Council had overstepped its jurisdiction in voting to force him to repay the $3,150. Since the vote should never have occurred, the appellate court ruled the fact that Ford had voted on the motion didn’t matter.

“The court let Rob Ford off on a technicality,” Clayton Ruby, the lawyer who filed the case for Magder, reportedly said after the decision, while Ford, for his part, addressed the media and referred to it all as, “very humbling.”

E. coli outbreaks. Millions of dollars in economic losses.

These are among the scenarios the Obama administration warned about last month as it claimed the sequester would force the U.S. Department of Agriculture to furlough meat inspectors.

But while the administration prepares to take that step, it continues to pursue a ""partnership"" with the Mexican government to ""raise awareness"" about food stamps among immigrants from that country. When a top Senate Republican proposed cutting off funds for that program last week -- in the form of an amendment to a budget resolution -- Democrats on the Budget Committee shot it down.

It's hard to put a firm price on the cost of the partnership, which was launched under the George W. Bush administration. But an aide to Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., who has railed against the partnership for months, said it could easily be in the millions. Since 2004, the program has blossomed to include dozens of meetings and conferences and health fairs with Mexican officials -- all of which cost money, not to mention the cost to the food stamp program of new enrollees brought in as a result of this partnership.

Sessions, in a statement to FoxNews.com, said he believes the public will eventually demand an end to the program, though the Senate Budget Committee allowed it to continue in the vote last week.

More On This...

""We have uncovered extensive evidence that federal authorities have -- during the Bush and Obama administrations -- aggressively undermined a core legal tenet of immigration policy: that those granted admission should be self-sufficient and contribute to the economic health of the nation,"" Sessions said. ""It is amazing that Budget Committee Democrats would unanimously vote to continue funding these costly promotions, especially when our debt is causing such profound economic harm.""

According to a letter from Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack to Sessions last September, the ""partnership"" since 2004 has included roughly 91 meetings between U.S. and Mexico embassy and consulate staff; 29 health fair events; and 31 roundtable discussions, conferences and forums in 20 cities.

Twenty percent of the meetings and activities occurred since 2008, according to Vilsack's letter. Sessions is concerned the collaboration amounts to a vehicle for the USDA to pressure people onto the food-stamp rolls -- in this case, noncitizen immigrants from Mexico.

The USDA denies this. In his letter last year, Vilsack said the purpose is ""to help eligible people in need make informed decisions about whether or not to seek assistance.""

The initiative is one of several the agency has ""to promote awareness of nutrition assistance among those who need benefits and meet all program requirements under current law,"" Vilsack told Sessions in the 24-page letter.

However, his letter indicates the number of legal, noncitizens participating in the program -- now called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program -- has increased from 425,000 to 1.23 million between 2001 and 2010.

Meanwhile, the USDA continues to press forward with plans to furlough meat inspectors, describing it as a necessity of the sequester -- though the department has eased off a bit on warnings that this could lead to more foodborne illness, since all meat and poultry will still have to be inspected."

USA TODAY

Interpol has issued a global security alert calling for increased vigilance for terrorist activity after suspected al-Qaeda involvement in prison escapes including those in Iraq, Libya and Pakistan.

The international police organization says prison breakouts have occurred in nine Interpol member countries in the past month alone and requests the agency's 190 member countries' assistance to figure out whether such events are linked, the group said in a statement on its website Saturday.

Interpol's alert comes a day after the State Department issued a global travel alert because of an al-Qaeda terrorist threat, saying the potential for terrorism is particularly strong in the Middle East and North Africa. That travel alert goes through Aug. 31.

The U.S. also announced this week that it would close more than a dozen embassies and consulates throughout the Muslim world on Sunday, and possible longer.

The full statement from Interpol's alert reads:

Following a series of prison escapes across nine INTERPOL member countries in the past month alone, including in Iraq, Libya and Pakistan, the INTERPOL General Secretariat headquarters has issued a global security alert advising increased vigilance.

With suspected Al Qaeda involvement in several of the breakouts which led to the escape of hundreds of terrorists and other criminals, the INTERPOL alert requests the Organization's 190 member countries' assistance in order to determine whether any of these recent events are coordinated or linked.

INTERPOL is asking its member countries to closely follow and swiftly process any information linked to these events and the escaped prisoners. They are also requested to alert the relevant member country and INTERPOL General Secretariat headquarters if any escaped terrorist is located or intelligence developed which could help prevent another terrorist attack.

Staff at INTERPOL's 24-hour Command and Coordination Centre and other specialized units are also prioritizing all information and intelligence in relation to the breakouts or terrorist plots in order to immediately inform relevant member countries of any updates.

August is the anniversary of violent terrorist incidents in Mumbai, India and Gluboky, Russia as well as in Jakarta, Indonesia. This week also marks the 15th anniversary of the US Embassy bombings in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania in which more than 200 mostly African citizens were killed and 4,000 others injured.

In recent years, terrorist attacks focusing on diplomatic facilities in Afghanistan, Greece, India, Kenya, Libya, Pakistan, Peru, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Tanzania, Turkey and Yemen have also resulted in hundreds of casualties of all nationalities.

The US State Department has also issued a global travel alert in response to credible intelligence suggesting that Al-Qaeda and affiliated organizations continue to plan terrorist attacks between now and 31 August, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa. In addition to the US authorities announcing the one-day closure of more than 20 diplomatic missions on Sunday 4 August, the UK Foreign Office has also confirmed the closure of the British embassy in Yemen on 4 and 5 August.

Sainsbury's says it welcomes the debate about etiquette sparked by one of its checkout workers refusing to serve a customer who was talking on her phone.

In a letter seen by the BBC, it says it is ""pleased the story is leading to a wider debate on politeness"".

The incident happened at a branch in Crayford, south-east London.

Sainsbury's apologised to customer Jo Clarke and offered her a £10 voucher, but many observers have said it should have backed its worker.

Those adding their voice to the debate include Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who said on his weekly Thursday radio phone-in that he had ""sneaking sympathy"" with the checkout worker, although he also understood why Sainsbury's had to apologise to its customer.

However, Sainsbury's is privately offering the worker involved its full support.

The company said in the letter setting out its policy: ""It is clear this story has touched a nerve as the weight of comment shows.

""However, we are also pleased that this specific story is leading to a wider debate on politeness.""

'Never wrong'

The Sainsbury's worker told Ms Clarke that it was company policy not to serve people who were occupied with their mobile phones, but that was denied at the time by the company.

But Sainsbury's said in its letter that it hoped ""the discussion this has created leads us all to think twice before reaching for our mobile phones and to recognise the great job the many thousands of sales assistants working across retail do"".

A number of retail experts said the company's original stance had been wrong.

One of them, Bryan Roberts, from the marketing experts Kantar, said: ""A lot of retailers are really annoyed with Sainsbury's over this. The customer is not always right - the customer is often wrong.""

The expression ""the customer is always right"" is generally attributed to the retail pioneer, Harry Selfridge, whose choice of site for his department store put Oxford Street on the map as a prime retail site.

He pressed it on customers and staff as a counterpoint to the legal term in common use at the time of ""buyer beware"", and not necessarily to put the customer solely in the driving seat.

Perhaps, to be assured of excellent service, shoppers should head for those companies employing the motto adopted by the founder of the Ritz: ""The customer is never wrong.""

Despite the apology and the voucher from Sainsbury's, Ms Clarke has said she will be transferring her custom to a nearby branch of the rival supermarket Waitrose."

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

As it is, the country is on the brink. We know that Lebanon's fractious sect-based political system has been strained by the Syrian war. Some Lebanese have crossed into Syria to support the warring sides and that, as an extension of this, there have been retaliatory attacks within Lebanon. But more than the violence or the fear of renewed civil war, what has put Lebanon on the brink is the flood of Syrian refugees who are overwhelming the country, threatening it with economic collapse and its capacity to survive as a state. It is only right that the world has focused attention on the terrible plight of Syria's refugees. But the enormity of this human tidal wave that has hit Lebanon must also be considered. According to the United Nations High Commission on Refugees (UNHRC) there are currently 790,000 Syrian refugees in Lebanon, with an estimated 75,000 coming each month. This number does not include the more than 250,000 Syrians living in Lebanon as migrant workers. Given current projections, the UN agency estimates that if the Syrian war continues apace, by the end of this calendar year, Syrian refugees will constitute about one-quarter of Lebanon's total population. The refugee crisis has affected Lebanon on many levels. Because Lebanon has not built refugee camps, the Syrian exiles have moved into communities across the entire country. Many have crowded into low income apartments, resulting in a housing shortage and a spike in rental rates -- as much as 44 percent in some areas. This in turn has pushed poorer Lebanese out of the housing market -- forcing them to become internally displaced in their own country. Other Syrians have formed informal ""tent cities"" in towns and villages throughout Lebanon creating additional stress on host communities. The UNHRC estimates that there are 1,400 of these settlements. Because the Syrian refugees have flooded the job market, often willing to work for less, official statistics now report that average wages have plummeted and 20 percent of Lebanese are now unemployed. There are additional strains on the economy. The World Bank projects that Lebanon's GDP will decline by 2.9 percent each year from 2012 to 2014. Government revenues will decrease by $1.5 billion annually, while government expenditures are expected to rise by over $1 billion each year, owing to the increased demand for services. As a result, it is projected that an additional 170,000 Lebanese will be forced into poverty this year. The problems don't end there. The 90,000 Syrian children registered in local schools have created a serious over-crowding problem in the educational system -- with additional strains reported in the health care, public and social service sectors. Water, gas and electricity rates have all increased by 7.4 percent in the last year. Some medicines are now in short supply and with winter fast approaching the stress on the food supply, housing, health care, and other services will only grow. In this context, it is important to recall that last winter; there were only about 150,000 Syrian refugees in Lebanon -- while this winter the number will be at least eight times that number! It should be expected that this situation might lead to social tensions within Lebanon. Polling data establishes that many Lebanese have become resentful. Many Lebanese poor see their country being overrun, resulting in: their inability to find work; having to settle for lower wages; and forcing them to face increased costs for food and services. They resent the fact that the Syrian refugees receive international assistance, while they must do without. All of this has created a new level of communal tensions. Since Lebanon has had a long and conflicted history with its neighbor, and since Lebanon's internal relationships remain unresolved, the added dimension of over one million Syrian refugees has only compounded an already fragile situation. The UNHRC's representative in Lebanon has written that given all these strains, which no country should be expected to bear, Lebanon has so far held up quite well. She writes ""Lebanon stands as an example of generosity in the face of crisis. Despite misunderstandings and tensions, everyday acts of kindness are commonplace."" But she warns, ""Without more international support, the patience and hospitality of host communities may wear thin. Continuing neglect will stoke rising tensions and raise the risk that the...Syrian civil war will become a regional war."" This said, Lebanon demands immediate attention. I cannot disagree with the push to rid Syria of chemical weapons, convene a Geneva II Summit to find a way to end that country's long war, and provide more assistance to alleviate the humanitarian crisis created by the massive population displacement created by the war. But Lebanon can no longer be ignored. The country need urgent support. It needs support to strengthen its capacity to deal with this crisis: the army needs assistance to help control the border and provide internal security; and the government and relief agencies need assistance to provide support to Lebanon's poor and those who have been displaced in their own country by the influx of refugees. Our concern for what is happening to Syria and Syrians, cannot and must not drown out our concern for Lebanon and its people. If we continue to ignore Lebanon, in short order, that country might collapse under the weight of the pressures to which it has been subjected. Lebanon requires attention."

A decision to supply weapons would mark a reversal for the Obama administration, which has resisted repeated proposals to deepen its involvement in Syria’s 2-year-old conflict, which, according to the United Nations, has killed more than 70,000 people, mostly civilians.

The contradictory signals reflect the growing dilemma for Obama. His administration is struggling to show resolve and build pressure on Syrian President Bashar Assad and Syria’s Russian and Iranian allies, even as the White House seeks to avoid getting drawn into another war in the Muslim world.

The administration also is considering supplying nonlethal military equipment such as armor, communications gear, night-vision goggles and vehicles to Syrian insurgent groups, officials said.

“We continue to consider all other possible options that would accomplish our objective of hastening a political transition,” said Caitlin Hayden, spokeswoman for the National Security Council.

Another senior U.S. official, who declined to be identified when speaking on a sensitive issue, said arming the rebels was “on the table — and has been for some time — but there’s a ways to go before any decision is made.”

At a White House news conference, Obama appeared to raise the bar for U.S. military involvement. If evidence conclusively shows that Syrian forces used poison gas, he said, he “would rethink a range” of retaliatory options that might not include military action. He also suggested that he would require international collaboration for any military operation, saying the burden of a response is not America’s alone.

“What’s happening in Syria is a blemish on the international community generally,” he said. Confirmed use of poison gas by Syrian forces would be “a game changer not simply for the United States, but for the international community.”

Obama was asked directly if that meant his administration would take military action.

“By ‘game changer’ I mean that we would have to rethink the range of options that are available to us,” he said. If the White House obtains conclusive proof of poison gas use, “that means that there’s some options that we might not otherwise exercise that we would ... strongly consider.”

The president’s comments came after a huge bomb exploded Tuesday in a busy central square in Damascus, the Syrian capital. The official Syrian news agency reported that at least 13 people had been killed and more than 70 injured. There was no immediate claim of responsibility.

The explosion occurred a day after an apparent car bomb targeted the convoy of Syrian Prime Minister Wael Halqi in Mezzeh, a district of Damascus. Halqi was unharmed, the government said, but reports indicated that several people were killed.

The two bombings, after a relative lull in attacks in the capital, have rattled nerves on the eve of a six-day holiday that begins Wednesday. Several mortar strikes also were reported Tuesday in Damascus.

“I guess all these days were only the calm before the storm,” said a retired lawyer in Damascus. “God help us with what’s coming tomorrow.”

Rebels seeking to overthrow the government frequently use car bombs and have fired mortar rounds into civilian areas of the capital. Government artillery and warplanes also have targeted civilian districts where rebel presence is suspected.

Obama first warned Assad in August that use of chemical weapons, or transfer of such stockpiles to terrorist groups, would cross a “red line.” He left ambiguous what kind of response he might take, although it seemed to imply U.S. military action.

But since the White House last week announced that U.S. intelligence agencies had concluded with varying degrees of confidence that sarin, a nerve gas, had been released in Syria, Obama has made it gradually clearer that he is far from embracing a military option.

Obama emphasized Tuesday that investigators had yet to determine if Syrian government forces intentionally used the gas, if it was accidentally released or if insurgents or other groups fired the weapons. The president said conclusive proof was necessary to win international support for action.

“If we end up rushing to judgment without hard, effective evidence, then we may find ourselves in the position where we can’t mobilize the international community to support what we do,” he said. “There may be objections even among some people in the region who are sympathetic with the opposition if we take action.”

Obama is dispatching Secretary of State John F. Kerry to Moscow in the next few days to try to convince the Kremlin to end its support of the Assad regime.

Each side in the Syrian conflict has accused the other of deploying chemical weapons in a series of disputed incidents. On Tuesday, Syria’s ambassador to the United Nations, Bashar Jaafari, told reporters that rebels used “chemical material” in Idlib province on Monday to make it appear that the government had deployed chemical weapons.

A U.N. investigation of the alleged use of chemical weapons has stalled amid a disagreement with Damascus about access in Syria.

Advertisement

Some members of Congress and other advocates have urged the administration to begin arming the rebels, to create no-fly zones to protect refugees, or to use military force to destroy or seize Syria’s huge stockpile of chemical weapons.

But White House and senior Pentagon officials fear that U.S. weapons shipments could end up in the hands of Islamic militants, who are playing a growing role in the revolt, or could increase the suffering in Syria without resulting in Assad’s ouster.

Conservative lawmakers and their allies say Obama has raised the bar so high that it is unlikely he will take action. They argue that Iran and North Korea will view his response as a signal that U.S. threats can be ignored.

He was a relatively obscure army officer when he took part in a successful but bloody coup against Ethiopia's Haile Selassie in September 1974.

The emperor had failed to come to grips with a poor harvest, and the situation escalated into a devastating famine.

The young officers formed the Dergue, which Mengistu took control of three years later, after a power struggle. Mengistu showed a ruthless streak, shooting a fellow officer who wanted to make peace with the province of Eritrea, which was seeking independence.

The president's dream was to turn Ethiopia into a Soviet-style workers' state.

Thousands of intellectuals, professionals and other perceived opponents of socialism and the regime were killed during the ""Red Terror"" years.

Soviet alliance

At the time, the country was embroiled in a war with Somalia, which was armed and backed by the Soviet Union. Mengistu encouraged Moscow to switch sides.

An alliance was formed, which saw the Soviet Union pour more than $10bn of military aid into the country during the 1980s.

For years, Mengistu relied on the Soviet Union for his economic thinking.

He saw himself as a Third World champion of communism. Alongside portraits of Lenin, Engels and Marx, he hung huge portraits of himself leading the masses to victory.

He spent much of his leisure time reading Marxist-Leninist tracts and wore Soviet-cut military jackets and caps.

Sent to the US

Mengistu was born in 1937 in Walayitta, Ethiopia.

He joined the army and graduated from military academy in 1966.

He was sent for advanced training to the United States. There, he became anti-American, sympathising with the American black nationalist movement. It was also in the US that his Stalinist philosophy took shape.

In 1971, he returned to Ethiopia. Six years later, he was in charge of the country.

Initially, he made social and economic changes in the country, replacing the ancient feudal society with a socialist one-party state.

But his ruling Workers' Party became extremely unpopular for harsh social policies as well as the forced wholesale transfer of population.

The drought of 1984-5 brought the country to economic ruin and he was forced to reassess his Marxist rhetoric. An estimated 1m people starved to death during the famine.

In 1990, Moscow cut its military aid and Mengistu began abandoning his Marxist policies.

The Dergue was overthrown in 1991, and Mengistu fled as the combined Eritrean and Tigrayan forces were on the outskirts of Addis Ababa.

He found a safe haven in Zimbabwe, with help from American officials who hoped his departure might stop the fighting.

He has lived a lavish but reclusive life in exile in Zimbabwe ever since. His only trip abroad was in 1999 when he visited South Africa for medical treatment. There was pressure on the government to extradite him - but he returned quickly to Zimbabwe."

http://news.yahoo.com/palestinians-unenthusiastic-obama-visit-185949028.html,,[],Palestinians unenthusiastic about Obama visit,"RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) — President Barack Obama will find a disillusioned Palestinian public, skeptical about his commitment to promoting Mideast peace, when he visits the region.

Obama's trip, beginning Wednesday, appears aimed primarily at resetting the sometimes troubled relationship with Israel. But winning the trust of the Palestinians, who accuse him of unfairly favoring Israel, could be a far more difficult task.

After suffering disappointments during the first Obama administration, Palestinians see little reason for optimism in his new term. The White House announcement that Obama will not present any new peace initiatives strengthened their conviction that the U.S. leader isn't prepared to put the pressure on Israel that they think is necessary to end four years of deadlock in negotiations.

""Obama is coming for Israel, not for us,"" said Mohammed Albouz, a 55-year-old Palestinian farmer. ""Obama will come and go as his predecessors did, without doing anything.""

While Israel is preparing to give Obama the red-carpet treatment, there are few signs of excitement in the West Bank. Large posters of Obama hung in Ramallah last week were quickly defaced, and a small group of activists called ""The Campaign for Dignity"" plans on releasing black balloons into the air in a sign of mourning when Obama arrives.

Obama himself played a role in reaching the current deadlock, which stems in large part from disagreements over Israeli settlement construction in the West Bank and east Jerusalem. The Palestinians claim both areas, captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war, as parts of a future state, a position that is widely backed internationally.

When Obama first took office, he strongly and publicly criticized the Israeli settlements, saying the construction undermines hopes for peace. ""It is time for these settlements to stop,"" Obama said in a high-profile address to the Muslim world delivered in Cairo just months after taking office.

Story continues

When Benjamin Netanyahu was elected Israeli prime minister in early 2009, the Palestinians said they would not negotiate unless settlement construction was frozen. They were further emboldened by Obama's tough stance.

Obama persuaded Netanyahu to impose a 10-month slowdown, but Palestinians did not agree to restart talks until the period was nearly over. When the Israeli moratorium expired several weeks later, Netanyahu rejected American appeals to extend the slowdown, and the negotiations collapsed.

Obama stopped pushing the matter, and talks have never resumed, and the Palestinians, viewing Obama as afraid to take on Israel's allies in Washington, have few expectations now.

""What we are going to tell him behind closed doors is what we are saying in public. There is no secret that a successful peace process needs a complete settlement freeze,"" said Nabil Shaath, a top adviser to President Mahmoud Abbas. ""The Israelis are building on our land and claiming they want to negotiate with us about this land.""

More than 500,000 Israelis now live in settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem. The Palestinians say the ever-growing settlements are a sign of bad faith and make it increasingly difficult to partition the land between two peoples.

Netanyahu maintains that negotiations must resume without preconditions, and the fate of the settlements should be one of the issues on the table. He notes that previous rounds of negotiations have gone forward without a construction freeze.

Obama will get a firsthand glimpse of settlements when he heads to the Palestinian city of Ramallah on Thursday. The 20-minute drive from Jerusalem passes by sprawling settlements that are home to tens of thousands of Israelis.

Obama is scheduled to meet with Palestinian leaders and visit a youth center. He plans to head to the West Bank town of Bethlehem the next day to see the Church of the Nativity, built on the site where Christian tradition says Jesus was born.

Netanyahu, who was re-elected in January, has said he will make a renewed push for peace in his new term. His new government, which takes office this week, is sending mixed signals.

On one hand, he has named former Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni, a political centrist who has good working relations with the Palestinians, as his chief negotiator. The biggest partner in his coalition, the centrist Yesh Atid Party, has demanded the new government make a serious attempt to restart talks.

At the same time, Netanyahu's own Likud-Yisrael Beitenu bloc is dominated by hard-liners who oppose major concessions to the Palestinians. Another partner, the Jewish Home Party, is linked to the settler movement and would reject any attempts to freeze construction, much less hand over West Bank territory to the Palestinians.

Saeb Erekat, the chief Palestinian negotiator, said getting talks back on track will require a deeper and long-standing effort by the president and his new secretary of state, John Kerry, who is expected back in the region in April.

""We really hope that President Obama and Secretary Kerry can succeed in reviving a meaningful peace process, succeed in having Netanyahu saying the sentence that he accepts the two states in the 1967 borders,"" Erekat said. ""We don't need new plans. We need commitment.""

The gaps between Israel and the Palestinians are just one of many obstacles. The Palestinians are also deeply divided between Abbas' government in the West Bank, which favors a negotiated agreement with Israel, and the rival Hamas government in the Gaza Strip, which rejects peace with Israel. Hamas has controlled Gaza since expelling Abbas' forces in 2007.

Yehia Moussa, a senior Hamas official in Gaza, told the pro-Hamas ""Felesteen"" newspaper the Obama visit was meant to ""cool down"" the Palestinians ""by giving empty promises that will assist with continuing the (Israeli) occupation.""

Hani Masri, a prominent Palestinian commentator in the West Bank, said the visit might lead to some movement.

""Most likely we are going to see some life in the negotiations,"" perhaps a limited settlement freeze that forces Abbas to resume talks. ""But such a process won't lead to a peaceful settlement."""

The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast.

According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active.

President al-Assad vowed to defend his country against any outside attack. ""The threats of launching an aggression against Syria will increase its commitments,"" and ""Syria will defend itself against any aggression,"" he said, according to Syrian state TV.

Syrian President Bashar al-Assad speaks with the Russian newspaper Izvestia in Damascus, Syria, on Monday, August 26. He told the newspaper that Western accusations that the Syrian government used chemical weapons are an insult to common sense.

A young woman holds a Syrian revolution flag and a candle during a protest of President Bashar al-Assad in front of the U.N. headquarters in Gaza City on Friday, August 23. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon intends to conduct a ""thorough, impartial and prompt investigation"" into the alleged chemical weapons attack in Syria.

Victims of the attack are laid in the back of a truck in the Hamoria area of Damascus on August 21.

People attend to the victims of the attack on August 21 in Damascus. British intelligence said at least 350 people died, while rebel leaders have put the death toll at more than 1,300.

A man mourns over the bodies of those killed in a suspected chemical weapon attack in a suburb of Damascus, Syria, on Wednesday, August 21. Syrian rebels said poisonous gas rained down from rockets, but authorities have denied the allegations that they used chemical weapons and accused the opposition of staging the attacks. U.S. officials, however, said there were ""strong indications"" that there was a chemical weapons attack by the government.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the world community was imposing a binding obligation on the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to get rid of its chemical weapons stockpile.

The U.N. Security Council votes to approve a resolution that will require Syria to give up its chemical weapons during a meeting on Friday, September 27. The vote came after assertions by the United States and other Western nations that the Syrian government used chemical weapons in an August 21 attack outside Damascus that U.S. officials estimate killed 1,400 people.

A convoy of inspectors from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons prepares to cross into Syria at the Lebanese border crossing point of Masnaa on Tuesday, October 1. Inspectors from the Netherlands-based watchdog arrived in Syria to begin their complex mission of finding, dismantling and ultimately destroying Syria's chemical weapons arsenal.

(CNN) —

Facing the threat of U.S. military action, Syria said Monday that it welcomes a Russian proposal to hand over its stockpiles of chemical weapons.

The United States has accused Syria’s government of using those weapons in an August 21 attack outside Damascus, a strike Washington says killed more than 1,400 people. Syria denies the accusation and says its own troops have faced poison gas attacks by rebel forces in the civil war that began in 2011.

Here’s a quick look at what Syria is believed to have and what may be involved in its elimination.

What’s in Syria’s arsenal?

• International observers believe that Syria has both blister agents such as mustard gas, which inflicted horrific casualties in World War I, and the nerve gases sarin and VX, which cause convulsions, paralysis and respiratory failure.

• Syria confirmed its possession of some unconventional weapons capability in 2012 but provided no details.

• U.S. intelligence believes that Syria has about 1,000 metric tons of chemical weapons, most of it sarin and VX stored as unmixed components, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Tuesday. But it also includes finished mustard gas, rockets and shells filled with sarin and “other things I can’t go into here,” Kerry told the House Armed Services Committee.

What do those weapons do?

• Mustard gas, also known as sulfur mustard, inflicts chemical burns on the skin, eyes and lungs. While mustard gas can be fatal, it also can disable victims and can cause cancer or permanent blindness. It can also remain in the environment for days or even weeks, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

• Sarin, which is suspected in the August 21 attack that triggered the current crisis, evaporates quickly, mixes easily with water and can contaminate food, water and clothing, according to the CDC.

• VX is considered the most toxic nerve agent and poisons more easily through skin contact than sarin, the CDC says. It evaporates very slowly, at about the same rate as motor oil. Like sarin, it can be emitted from clothing for up to half an hour after exposure.

How much does Syria have?

• Before the war began in 2011, Syria had research and production facilities near Damascus, Aleppo, Homs, Latakia and Hama that turned out hundreds of tons of chemical agents a year, according to the U.S.-based James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies and the Nuclear Threat Initiative, which catalogs the world’s arsenals of weapons of mass destruction.

• Syria could deliver chemical agents through a variety of ammunition, such as bombs dropped from aircraft, Scud surface-to-surface missiles, artillery shells or rockets, according to Jeffrey White of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.

Didn’t everyone ban this stuff?

• Syria has never signed the Chemical Weapons Convention, the current international treaty against the use of poison gas. But it did sign the 1925 Geneva Protocol, which banned the use of chemical and bacteriological warfare, according to the international Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. That pact forbids both the first use and retaliatory use of chemical or biological weapons against other countries.

• The organization, which monitors compliance with the Chemical Weapons Convention, says Syria has ignored several attempts to get it to sign the current treaty. Experts from the agency were part of the U.N. team that collected evidence from the site of the August 21 attack.

How would a weapons transfer work?

• The Russian proposal is in its infancy, and Washington immediately expressed skepticism about the idea. But when Libya renounced its chemical weapons program in 2004, it declared what it had to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons; the agency sent its own inspectors to Libya to verify the declaration, and then Libya’s production plants were dismantled and its stockpiles began to be destroyed.

• Two weapons plants were torn down and a third was turned into a pharmaceutical factory before the revolution that toppled longtime Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi in 2011. More than half of its 24 tons of mustard gas and about 40% of its precursor chemicals had been destroyed before the revolution halted that work, which remains incomplete.

• But the process could be far more dangerous in the middle of an armed conflict like Syria’s, former U.N. and U.S. weapons inspector David Kay said. “Doing this in peacetime is difficult. Doing this in the middle of a war may be impossible,” he said.

• Moving stocks of chemical weapons is dangerous, and other countries may not be willing to take in the agents, Kay added. After the 1991 Persian Gulf War, Iraq’s chemical weapons stockpiles had to be destroyed there because no company wanted to receive them: “I suspect that’s what you would have to do in Syria,” he said.

• “Dissuade yourself from the idea that you’re going to move these chemical weapons to someplace outside of Syria. That’s probably the least safe thing to do. And where would you move them?” Kay asked.

• And there’s still the question of whether any disclosure is complete. After Gadhafi’s fall, Libya’s new government reported finding more mustard gas and artillery shells capable of launching it, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons says.

A week of critical diplomacy is set to begin in Washington, Beijing and Pyongyang. But the sides are so far apart, at least in public declarations, it is impossible to predict where any diplomatic efforts will lead.

North Korea continues to hold fast to the position that its nuclear and ballistic missile programs are non-negotiable. Pyongyang's official news agency says the North wants U.N. Security Council sanctions lifted. The sanctions were put in place after North Korea launched a three-stage rocket last December that put a satellite in orbit. More sanctions were added when the North conducted its third underground nuclear test in February.

The U.S. and South Korea insist that a verifiable path to dismantling those programs must be on the table for any negotiating process to begin.

South Koreans are increasingly saying they may need a nuclear deterrent to counter Pyongyang's threats. China, of course, detests the possibility the U.S. would reintroduce strategic nuclear weapons there. (They were removed in 1991.) Everyone is heaping pressure on China to rein in the North Koreans.

Looking at the North's rapidly growing nuclear threat, some South Koreans admit that after years of dismissing all the bombastic rhetoric from Pyongyang, real fears are emerging.

""It really is a game changer,"" said Hahm Chaibong, president of the ASAN Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul. ""We really don't know what to do with it because these are political weapons, these are psychological weapons.""

Wanted: Bold diplomatic moves (by the other guy)

Hahm says the six-party talks don't evoke confidence anymore. In his view, what is needed is a bold, new strategy comparable to President Richard Nixon's historic 1972 visit to Beijing credited with not only laying the groundwork for rapprochement with the U.S., but opening up China to the world.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is no Zhou Enlai. But Beijing may be hoping Washington will overlook that.

""The Chinese are very keen to just get back to any kind of talks,"" Stephanie Kleine-Ahlbrandt told CNN. The International Crisis Group's Northeast Asia project director says more than one Chinese source has suggested a repeat of the Nixon-Zhou scenario.

""The Chinese regularly tell me, if (President) Obama would just pick up the phone and talk to Kim Jong Un, we could solve this whole thing!""

Don't hold your breath. Obama is in lockstep with his regional allies vowing not to reward Pyongyang's bad behavior.

China is feeling more wanted than ever. The North Koreans have signaled their readiness to meet with anyone from Beijing. The U.S., Japan and South Korea have repeatedly and publicly declared that China holds the key to reining in the North. While Beijing raised its hand in the vote in favor of sanctions on Pyongyang, many believe it is staying that hand when it comes to enforcing them.

""If China is not active and China is not fully committed, I don't think this is an issue that can be resolved,"" says professor Lee Jung-Hoon of Seoul's Yonsei University.

China has shown disdain for Kim's recent outbursts. But Beijing's No. 1 priority is keeping his regime from collapse and millions of hungry North Koreans on his side of the border. China is arguably sympathetic to young Kim's predicament. That's the reason, says Kleine-Albrandt and others, that China will not go as far as the U.S. and its partners in Asia would like.

Understanding Kim Jong Un's predicament

""We think they're blackmailing us right now, we think they want money from us,"" said John Delury, a professor of Northeast Asian studies at Yonsei University in Seoul. ""What we fail to understand is their profound insecurity.""

Delury recalled the six-party talks, when U.S. diplomats were trying to persuade the North Koreans to denuclearize. ""We said, look, you'll be safe without your nuclear weapons, look at Libya!""

While almost no one inside North Korea has access to the real Internet, we can safely assume that Kim is the exception. We should also assume that the young leader has watched the grisly videos of Moammar Gadhafi being lynched by a mob of his own people. Kim may see his own face in that video.

South Koreans are hardly sympathetic. ""There's growing public sentiment,"" says Lee Jung-Hoon, that ""we have to be very firm with this regime. It's good to have dialogue and, yes, we want to talk with North Korea. But it's a fading hope that somehow we could convince North Korea, through dialogue, to give up its nuclear weapons program.

""If that's the case, what's the point in engaging in dialogue? Shouldn't we now be focusing on beefing up our security so our deterrence, especially nuclear deterrence, is firm so we will not be vulnerable to these threats?""

Diplomacy to deal with North Korea is gathering momentum. But the vast difference in the positions of all the parties raises doubts about the outcome.

If it fails, many predict Pyongyang will immediately subscribe to another round of missile or nuclear tests and the familiar, and destabilizing, sequence will begin anew."

Story highlights NEW: A State Department official says the plane was approved to clear U.S. airspace Venezuelan officials say the U.S. denied airspace permission to their presidential plane Venezuela's president says the U.S. also denied U.N. delegation visas Maduro calls the move a ""serious offense""

(CNN) —

Venezuela accused the United States on Thursday of denying President Nicolas Maduro’s plane permission to enter U.S. airspace – a claim that a State Department official denied.

Foreign Minister Elias Jaua said U.S. officials have blocked plans for Maduro’s presidential plane to fly through Puerto Rican airspace on the way to China.

He described the move as an aggression and called for an explanation from the U.S. State Department.

A senior State Department official told CNN that Jaua’s claim was untrue, saying that the Venezuelans have, in fact, been approved to clear U.S. airspace.

In remarks broadcast on state television, Maduro called the situation “a serious offense.”

The Venezuelan president vowed to take action, adding that the United States had also denied visas for several members of his country’s delegation scheduled to attend the U.N. General Assembly in New York.

“If I have to take diplomatic measures against the U.S. government, I will take them to the most drastic level if it is necessary, but I am not going to accept any type of aggression,” he said.

The State Department official also called the visa issue untrue, saying the United States had approved them.

Maduro is scheduled to travel to China on Saturday. Jaua said officials were evaluating alternate routes so that the trip could continue as scheduled.

Maduro accused U.S. officials of being nervous about his country’s growing relationship with China.

“The United States government is not going to stop our trip,” Maduro said.

U.S. officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Officials%3A He%27ll urge Iraqis to stop overflights of Iranian aircraft supporting Syrian government

Kerry flew into Baghdad on Saturday from Amman

BAGHDAD (AP) — U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry says he's made it clear to Iraq that it shouldn't allow Iran to use its airspace to ship weapons and fighters to Syria.

Kerry told reporters Sunday during an unannounced trip to Baghdad that the Iranian overflights were a major point of discussion in his private talks with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. Kerry said he told Maliki that anything that supports President Bashar Assad and his regime was, quote, ""problematic.""

Kerry also said that U.S. lawmakers and the American people are watching what Iraq is doing and ""wondering how it is a partner.""

Kerry flew into Baghdad on Sunday from Amman after accompanying President Obama to Israel, the Palestinian Authority and Jordan.

A senior U.S. official said the sheer number of overflights, which occur ""close to daily,"" as well as overland shipments to Syria through Iraq from Iran was inconsistent with Iranian claims that they are only carrying humanitarian supplies. The official said it was in Iraq's interest to prevent the situation in Syria from deteriorating further, particularly as there are fears that Iranian-backed extremists may gain a foothold in the country.

The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because she was not authorized to publicly preview Kerry's meetings, said there are clear links between al-Qaeda linked extremists operating in Syria and militants who are carrying out terrorist attacks in Iraqi territory with increasing regularity.

Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton secured a pledge from Iraq to inspect the flights last year, but the official said that since then only two aircraft have been checked by Iraqi authorities.

Kerry's visit if the first by a U.S. secretary of State since Clinton went in 2009. During Obama's first term, the Iraq portfolio was largely delegated to Vice President Joe Biden.

His arrival came just three days after the anniversary of the U.S.-led war that began on March 20 with an airstrike on Dora Farms in southern Baghdad in a failed attempt to kill Saddam Hussein."

USA TODAY

Afghan president walks away from proposed peace talks with Taliban

U.S. troops poised to leave Afghanistan in 2014

Obama administration%27s optimism already was loaded with skepticism

Afghan President Hamid Karzai has established a consistent record in one way: He never seems to miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity.

Over the course of the last 12 years, Karzai has proved to be a less than reliable ally. U.S. officials have been regularly confounded by his erratic behavior, as well as his willingness to turn a blind eye to drug trafficking by allies and excuse corruption in his government.

He proved to be his consistently unreliable self again on Wednesday.

Less than 24 hours after pledging to send envoys to Doha, Qatar, for peace talks with the Taliban, Karzai changed course and said he's not having anything to do with the event unless the United States steps away from the process and the Taliban stops its violent attacks on the ground.

Karzai says his beef is that the Taliban, in opening its office in Doha, is using the name Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan and flying the group's white flag, raising concerns that it is acting like an embassy parallel with the Afghan government.

In more than two years of talks with Karzai, the Obama administration has underscored that wars rarely conclude on the battlefield and that negotiating with your enemy — even as distasteful and dishonorable as the Taliban may be — will be necessary to finding any semblance of peace.

As the Taliban announced a willingness to come to a negotiating table, aides to Obama expressed optimism while stressing caution. Senior administration officials said they had no expectation Taliban attacks would ebb anytime soon, and there was skepticism that the Taliban was willing to cut its ties to al-Qaeda or respect minority and women's rights that are now enshrined in the Afghan constitution.

Left unsaid was that managing Karzai's expectations will also be incredibly daunting.

The Afghan president's greatest fault — and the one that could make any chance of constructive peace talks ever happening a pipe dream — is a disconnect with his reality on the ground.

Former U.S. ambassador Karl Eikenberry relayed his concerns in a cable, which was subsequently made public by WikiLeaks, about this disconnect.

Eikenberry wrote with some disbelief in the 2009 cable — which coincided with one of the most violent months of the war — about Karzai nostalgically wanting to return to a ""golden age"" in the U.S.-Afghan relationship that he felt existed at the start of the war.

Nearly four years later, with the U.S. withdrawal in sight, American diplomats in Kabul are certainly doing some hand-wringing as they fail yet again to convince Karzai that time is running out to find an endgame in America's longest war."

And you'll never believe who was behind it!!



GRETCHEN CARLSON (10/28/2013): New mainstream media outrage now over the Benghazi terror attack. But it's certainly not new for you out there, our viewers. Because the wrenching report on 60 Minutes last night was filled with information Fox uncovered months ago. STEVE DOOCY (10/28/2013): I think it's great that mainstream media, finally catching up. CBS did this story on Benghazi, and I see criticism from the left, where they're all, ""you guys are covering a phony scandal"". 60 Minutes doesn't cover phony scandals.

(audience laughter and applause)

Also, CBS should've checked with someone else, because Morgan Jones's story turned out to be totally fake. Including his name, which is not Morgan Jones, but Dylan Davies, which actually sounds even more fake. In fact, in his incident report to his employer, Davies wrote that ""he spent most of that night at his Benghazi beach-side villa"", nowhere near the embassy. Evidently, the guy he hit in the face with the butt of his rifle that night was a cabana boy. And God, I hope it was his rifle!

Now CBS knew Davies had lied to his employer, but believed the heroic version he told them, because their sources led them to believe that Davies' FBI report was ""in sync"" with what he told 60 Minutes.

Or he might have told the FBI that he was the lead singer of 'N Sync, it's not clear. Because later the New York Times checked with the FBI, and Davies' FBI testimony is not what he told 60 Minutes, so ""CBS News quickly checked its own FBI sources ... and learned ... what Mr. Davies had told the FBI differed from what he told us.'""

So, CBS fact-checked the story, but when it turned out to be wrong, they fact-checked it for realz, y'all. (audience laughter)

And, on last night's the 60 Minutes, Lara Logan addressed the controversy head on, at the very top of the last minute of the show.



LARA LOGAN (11/10/2013): We end our broadcast tonight with a correction, on a story we reported October 27th. ... We realized we had been misled, and it was a mistake to include him in our report. For that, we are very sorry. The most important thing to every person at 60 Minutes is the truth. And the truth is, we made a mistake.

You see, as you well know but I will repeat as often as possible, Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State during the Benghazi attacks. I mean, that's her official photo.

Ergo, quid pro quo, amicus brief, she is to blame. And now she's so hungry for power in 2016, that she somehow convinced 60 Minutes to air this false Benghazi apology to discredit their investigation.

And we here at The Colbert Report have now found an eyewitness with startling new details concerning the night of the tragic CBS-Benghazi apology. Jim?

STEPHEN COLBERT: I understand you were a college intern at 60 Minutes.

PONCHO DENEWS: Yes.

STEPHEN COLBERT: And for your own safety, you are using an alias tonight. What is that?

PONCHO DENEWS: Poncho Denews.

STEPHEN COLBERT: Now, Poncho, you were interning the night all hell broke loose at 60 Minutes.

PONCHO DENEWS: Yes, Stephen, I was definitely there that night because I'm an actual human witness.

STEPHEN COLBERT: Tell us what happened, Poncho.

PONCHO DENEWS: Well, I was coming back from getting chewing tobacco for Leslie Stahl, when I heard explosions of shouting.

STEPHEN COLBERT: And what did you do next?

PONCHO DENEWS: I ran towards it. I scaled the 30-foot wall surrounding the newsroom. Once I landed, a shadowy figure ran towards me, so I knocked him out with the butt of my harpoon gun.

STEPHEN COLBERT: And who was that?

PONCHO DENEWS: Turns out it was Morley Safer. But, then I turned around, and I saw... I saw....

STEPHEN COLBERT: Who did you see?

PONCHO DENEWS: It was Hillary Clinton and her band of thugs! She was swinging a bike chain and yelling, ""We're here to kill the story! Who wants to eat some chain?"" (audience laughter and applause) Then she pistol-whipped Morley Safer. Which was cruel, since he was already unconscious.

STEPHEN COLBERT: So it was Hillary Clinton who made CBS apologize.

PONCHO DENEWS: Yes!

STEPHEN COLBERT: I knew it! Anything else?

PONCHO DENEWS: Yes, Stephen, I have one more exclusive. I'm not really 60 Minutes intern Poncho Denews. I'm... (takes off facial hair) Charlie Skinner!

Of Atlantis Cable News channel, as profiled in the HBO documentary The Newsroom! (wild audience laughter and applause) Gotcha!!

STEPHEN COLBERT: What?! Where'd that college intern go??

CHARLIE SKINNER: There never was any intern, Stephen! I did it to prove a point! That as journalists, we are the gatekeepers of truth! We separate right from wrong, fact from fiction, delicates from permanent press! I recall a man who said, ""With great power comes great responsibility."" That man was Spider-Man's uncle. And now... he's dead! The public needs us to be the watchdogs of democracy. We have a responsibility to criticize our leaders without reproach, report national secrets without fear of imprisonment. If we violate this contract, this public trust....

STEPHEN COLBERT: How much longer does this go?

CHARLIE SKINNER: Almost done. Then we will have a puppet press of hearsay and innuendo and speculation, hyperbole, and nonsense! Ding dong! Who is it? It's Domino's. But more importantly, it's the truth!! (wild audience laughter and applause) Delivered hot and crusty! Or your money back! That's a guarantee we make America every night, otherwise the world is just crazy bread.

STEPHEN COLBERT: Technically, crazy bread is Little Caesar's.

CHARLIE SKINNER: It's called poetic license, goddamnit!

STEPHEN COLBERT: You're right, The Newsroom's Charlie Skinner. Now if you'll excuse me, there's something I have to do.

We end our this part of the show with a correction. In our report tonight, a man named Poncho Denews claimed he was a 60 Minutes intern, and we believed him because he had an ID lanyard. (audience laughter)

Following the report, the Washington Post, the New York Times, and the TV Guide all reported that he was actually the actor Sam Waterston, star of The Plastic Dome of Norma Jean. (wild audience laughter) Look it up, look it up.

We checked with our sources at IMDB, and it turns out we made a mistake. We should not have used him in our report. And for that, we're very sorry. The most important thing to everyone here at The Colbert Report is the truth. And the truth is, it's somebody else's fault. We'll be right back."

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Merrill Newman%2C 85%2C has been held in North Korea since October

White House also urged release of Kenneth Bae%2C held for more than a year

Earlier Saturday%2C N. Korea state media claimed Newman apologized for his alleged crimes

The White House is urging North Korea to release Merrill Newman, an 85-year-old U.S. veteran of the Korean War who has been held in North Korea since October.

Given Newman's ""advanced age and health conditions, we urge the DPRK to release Mr. Newman so he may return home and reunite with his family,"" Caitlin Hayden, a spokeswoman for the White House National Security Council, said Saturday, according to multiple media outlets.

The White House also urged North Korean authorities to release Kenneth Bae, an American who has been held in Korea for more than a year, Reuters reported. ""We remain deeply concerned about the welfare of the U.S. citizens held in custody,"" Hayden said in the statement.

Earlier Saturday, North Korea's state media claimed Newman — a retired finance executive — apologized for alleged crimes during the Korean War and for ""hostile acts"" against the state during a recent trip.

North Korean authorities released video showing Newman reading his alleged apology. It was dated Nov. 9 and couldn't be independently confirmed, the Associated Press reported.

Newman was taken off a plane Oct. 26 by North Korean authorities while preparing to leave after a 10-day visit. Newman's son has said his father wanted to return to the country, where he spent three years during the war.

AP reported North Korea has been accused of previously coercing statements from detainees.

In addition, Newman's alleged statement was riddled with stilted English and grammatical errors, such as ""I want not punish me.""

""I have been guilty of a long list of indelible crimes against DPRK government and Korean people,"" Newman purportedly wrote in a four-page statement, adding: ""Please forgive me.""

They were the latest casualties in a 12-year conflict that shows no signs of slowing down despite a drawdown in foreign forces.

The U.S.-led international military coalition says four of its service members were killed in the south, and a military official confirmed all were Americans killed by an ""improvised explosive device.""

Their deaths bring the toll among foreign forces to 132 this year, of which 102 are from the United States. At least 2,146 members of the U.S. military have died in Afghanistan as a result of the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan in late 2001, according to an Associated Press count. They are part of a total of nearly 3,390 coalition forces that have died during the conflict.

They were killed on the eve of the 12th anniversary of the Oct. 7, 2001 invasion, which led to an insurgency that shows no signs of abatement and a war that has become largely forgotten in the United States and among its coalition allies despite continued casualties suffered by their forces on the ground.

Javed Faisal, a spokesman for the governor of Kandahar, confirmed the four Americans were killed in the province by an IED. He had no further details.

NATO said in a statement that the four were killed during an operation in the south alongside Afghan troops, but did not provide any further details or their nationalities. The NATO official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.

IEDs, which include remotely detonated roadside bombs and improvised landmines, are one of the top killers of Afghan and foreign soldiers as well as civilians.

The attack came as Afghan security forces take over the brunt of the fighting after the coalition handed over security responsibilities for the country earlier this summer. This year, an average of least 100 Afghan soldiers and police have died each week, while foreign forces have stepped back from direct fighting and moved into a train and assist role.

The insurgency has tried to take advantage of the withdrawal of foreign forces to regain territory around the country, especially in their eastern and southern strongholds.

The anniversary also coincides with the registration of candidates for next April's presidential elections, the first independent vote organized by Afghanistan without direct foreign assistance. By Sunday, the deadline for registration, at least a dozen people had submitted their candidacies for the top office.

The 2001 invasion targeted al-Qaida and its Taliban allies shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States, which claimed nearly 3,000 lives.

Victory in Afghanistan seemed to come quickly. Kabul fell within weeks, and the hard-line Taliban regime was toppled with few U.S. casualties.

But former President George W. Bush's shift toward war with Iraq left the Western powers with reduced resources on the ground and allowed the Taliban to regroup. By 2006, the Taliban had turned into a serious military threat and President Barack Obama deployed more troops to Afghanistan, and casualties increased sharply.

But the American public grew weary of having its military in a perpetual state of conflict, especially after the withdrawal of American troops from Iraq. That war, which began with a U.S.-led invasion in 2003 to oust Saddam Hussein, cost the lives of nearly 4,500 U.S. troops, more than twice as many as have died in Afghanistan so far.

Obama first withdrew the 30,000 U.S. troops he sent to Afghanistan as part of a surge and has begun drawing down the rest, with all foreign combat forces to leave the country by the end of 2014. There are currently less than 100,000 coalition troops in Afghanistan, with about half from the United States. That number is expected to be halved by February, with U.S. numbers going down to about 31,000."

USA TODAY

Both are key votes in Senate on use-of-force resolution

House Democrats also being briefed

First Senate hearing on Syria resolution will be Tuesday

President Obama's bid to get congressional support to use military force in Syria received a boost Monday as Republican Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham said they have more confidence the White House is developing a better strategy for dealing with Syria.

McCain and Graham are key votes Obama will need to win Senate approval for the United States to launch missile strikes againstSyria in response to an Aug. 21 chemical weapons attack that killed more than 1,400 people.

Obama said Saturday he had concluded the United States should launch an attack in response to the attack, but he said he wants approval first from Congress.

McCain and Graham have jointly expressed concerns that a military strike should be part of a broader strategy in Syria, not simply a random attack to punish the regime.

After meeting with Obama Monday, they both said they believed the White House is developing a strategy that would weaken the regime of President Bashar Assad and boost Syrian opposition forces — though they said Obama has more work to do to explain this plan.

""We still have significant concerns,"" McCain said, ""but we believe there is in formulation a strategy to upgrade the capabilities of the Free Syrian Army and to degrade the capabilities of Bashar Assad. Before this meeting, we had not had that indication.""

McCain of Arizona repeatedly said a congressional vote rejecting the use of military force would be ""catastrophic"" to U.S interests and would destroy the credibility of the nation in the eyes of both allies and adversaries. Graham of South Carolina said, ""If we don't get Syria right, Iran is surely going to take the signals that we don't care about their nuclear program. ... If we lost a vote in Congress dealing with the chemical weapons being used in Syria, what effect would that have on Iran and their nuclear program?""

Both senators criticized the administration for lacking not having a clearer strategy in Syria before now.

In Syria Monday, Assad told a journalist with the French newspaper Le Figaro that any attack risked opening a wider war in the region.

Syria has challenged the United States and France to provide proof to support their allegations that Damascus has used chemical weapons, Assad said, but that the leaders of both countries ""have been incapable of doing that, including before their own peoples.""

McCain and Graham, however, said they had no doubts about Syria's use of chemical weapons. Their meeting Monday was part of a major lobbying push by the White House.

House Democrats were briefed on a conference call by National Security Adviser Susan Rice, Secretary of State John Kerry, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Martin Dempsey.

Kerry said Sunday the administration has more proof Syrian troops used the nerve agent sarin in the Aug. 21 attack.

Tuesday will be another busy day of lobbying for the White House. Obama will meet with chairs and ranking members from key national security committees, including the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, House Foreign Affairs Committee, House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and House Armed Services Committee.

The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will conduct a hearing on the issue Tuesday afternoon in which Hagel, Kerry and Dempsey are likely to testify.

Pollak'],Another Missing Hagel Speech: Keynote Address to the U.S. Middle East Project Jan. 2008,"Former Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE), who awaits a vote this week on his confirmation as Secretary of Defense, had failed to provide the Senate Armed Services Committee with more than a few speeches dating to January 2008. Since then, at least two missing speeches within that timeframe have been identified: one to the Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee, for which a video was eventually found, and the other to Georgetown University, of which no text or recording has been provided.

Now a third speech has surfaced: an address by Hagel to the U.S. Middle East Project (USMEP), which advocates aggressive U.S. pressure in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.

Hagel delivered the keynote address to the Annual Meeting of the International Board of USMEP. Photographs of the event were published on the group’s website, including the one above (with Brent Scowcroft, former adviser to President George H.W. Bush, seated next to Hagel) but no video or text of Hagel’s speech was published.

In 2009, Hagel co-authored a USMEP report that called for U.S. troops to be deployed to Israel and Palestine in the future to patrol the boundaries of the new Palestinian state. The report also indicated that peace could be “imposed” from the outside, and that it should be pursued regardless of “certain domestic constituencies.” Hagel serves on the board of USMEP with a variety of individuals with a strong interest in Middle East diplomacy.

The president of USMEP, Henry Siegman, is known for making radical and inflammatory statements. He attacked Sen. Lindsey Graham for questioning Hagel about the former Senator’s comments on the “Jewish lobby” (Siegman sanitized Hagel’s remark as “Israel lobby”). In January 2010, Siegman wrote: “Israel has crossed the threshold from the Middle East’s only democracy to the only ‘apartheid regime’ in the Western world. Hagel has been alleged of using the same analogy to predict Israel’s future if a peace agreement is not reached."
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/12/24/top-lawmaker-joins-growing-opposition-to-academic-groups-israel-boycott/,2013-12-24 00:00:00,[],"US officials, Ivy League universities slam academic group’s Israel ‘boycott’","An American academic group's ""boycott"" of Israeli institutions is facing mounting opposition from all corners, as prestigious universities as well as U.S. officials say the organization is unfairly singling out Israel while ignoring major human-rights abusers.

Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, was the latest to get involved, firing off a letter to the American Studies Association on Monday.

Engel called it ""another example of the unfair double standard Israel is regularly and unfairly subjected to by organizations such as yours.""

The 5,000-member academic group announced the boycott of Israeli academic institutions earlier this month, in protest of Israel's treatment of Palestinians.

The move immediately drew objections from Jewish advocacy groups. But top American universities, including Harvard and Yale, have also pushed back.

Harvard President Drew Gilpin Faust called it a ""direct threat"" to the ideals universities defend.

""Academic boycotts subvert the academic freedoms and values necessary to the free flow of ideas, which is the lifeblood of the worldwide community of scholars,"" Faust said in a statement. Other universities withdrew their ACA membership.

U.S. Ambassador to Israel Dan Shapiro applauded those universities, and stated Sunday on his Facebook page that the U.S. government ""rejects"" the boycott push.

Engel added his voice in the letter to ASA President Curtis Marez. He noted this is the first time the association has boycotted a country and questioned -- why Israel?

He noted the group ""has chosen to stay silent on China's suppression of independent academic voices critical of the Communist Party, the Venezuelan government's retaliation against opposition-oriented universities, [and] Zimbabwe's denial of foreign academics from countries critical of Robert Mugabe's dictatorial government from assuming academic residencies at the University of Zimbabwe.""

And he questioned whether such venerable Israeli institutions as the Walter Lebach Institute for Jewish-Arab Coexistence Through Education at the Tel Aviv University really ""contribute to the purported Israeli assault on human rights and academic freedoms.""

It's unclear what practical impact the boycott will have. A lengthy explanation from the ACA said Israeli scholars would still be permitted to lecture at member campuses, and ACA members could in many circumstances continue to work with Israeli scholars. The boycott was aimed more at cutting ties between the ASA ""as an association"" and Israeli institutions.

But the association has defended the decision, arguing that Israeli institutions are ""complicit"" in a ""multi-tiered system of oppression"" against the Palestinians. The group noted that all major Israeli universities are governmental organizations, and claimed ""many are directly involved in furnishing the ideological justification and technical means"" for Israeli settlements in Palestinian territory.

The Washington Post's editorial board called the approach ""terrible misguided."" A recent editorial questioned why the group focused its criticism exclusively on Israel.

""Did they give any thought to what's happened lately to freedom in Russia, won at enormous cost in a Cold War that lasted more than four decades?"" the board wrote. ""Have the scholars overlooked the cries for help from Cuban dissidents bravely standing up to the Castro brothers, demanding freedoms -- and suffering beatings and arrest almost every week? Do they condone the decision of a judge in Saudi Arabia who has just sentenced a political activist to 300 lashes and four years in prison for calling for a constitutional monarchy?""

The ACA boycott is part of a broader international campaign against Israeli institutions. It has divided American colleges and universities.

A fraction of the ACA's members ended up voting on the resolution which formalized the boycott, following a similar stance by the Association for Asian American Studies. But the American Association of University Professors took the opposite stance, saying it rejects academic boycotts ""as a matter of principle."""

As midlife sets in, maintaining a healthy weight often becomes harder. Tricks that worked in the past, like cutting down on wine or sugar, no longer seem to work, either. Even slender Samantha Cameron, now 50, has apparently been affected. In her 30s and early 40s, staying in shape was easy, she said this weekend, “but then I hit 43, I just put on three-quarters of a stone. Suddenly you don’t quite fit any of your things and I got really bloated.” At first she tried doing the 5:2 diet – eating normally five days a week, then having just 500 calories on the other two – but “I just couldn’t do it, I literally couldn’t speak in the evening, I had to go to bed at 7pm.” She has recently found a solution: the 5:2 principles, but with 800 calories on the “fast” days, and says she’s “loving it” and “the bloating’s gone”. Alongside three weekly workouts, she says it’s helping to keep her trim: her goal is “to hit my 50s in almost as good shape as I hit my 40s.” If you’re struggling to maintain your weight and fitness post-50, here’s why – and what to do about it: Muscle mass Every decade after the age of 30, we on average lose three to eight per cent of our muscle mass. At first, this might not be noticeable, but by 50 or 60, will make a considerable difference. This is bad news if you want to lose weight, because muscle burns on average three times more calories than fat per day, even at rest. What to do: Incorporate resistance training into your weekly routine to reduce muscle loss. The NHS recommends two sessions of strength training a week, which could include activities as varied as gardening or lifting weights. Don’t underestimate the good that exercise can do: a 2018 study shows that regular exercisers over the age of 55 kept up their muscle mass considerably more than inactive people. Staying active In England, half of 16 to 24-year-olds are doing the recommended amount of weekly exercise, but only one in 10 people aged 65 to 74 are doing so. If injuries have accrued, and your work and social life is less busy than it once was, you may be leading a more sedentary lifestyle than you realise. The role of exercise in weight loss is much-debated, but it can be crucial in maintaining your weight. A famous 2016 study followed participants in American weight loss competition The Biggest Loser during and after filming, and found that most regained a lot of weight after the cameras stopped rolling due to a higher appetite and slower metabolism. However, a follow-up study in 2017 found that the contestants who kept the most weight off were those who had remained committed to a fitness regimen. This was particularly interesting given that more exercise didn’t equal more weight loss during the show, when those who lost the most focused on diet over working out. What to do: Try to stick to the NHS guidelines on exercise, which recommend 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week, or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise, or a mixture of both. Make sure you are doing something appropriate for your body, too. As we get older, high-impact workouts like running may place unwanted stress on your joints, so think about lower impact options like swimming or cycling. Hormones Menopause changes where fat is stored on the body. Higher oestrogen levels in the fertile years cause fat to be stored on your legs, hips and behind, but after oestrogen drops, fat can move to your middle, even if you remain exactly the same weight. This can be an issue, as fat around your trunk is more likely to contribute to Type 2 diabetes, hypertension and heart issues than fat on your hips and legs. Men are affected by hormone changes as they age, too: after the age of 40 they lose roughly one per cent of their testosterone a year. This matters for weight, as testosterone is linked to the amount of muscle you have and where you store fat. What to do: For women, several studies suggest that HRT can help to stop the shift of fat from your bottom half to around your middle as you go through menopause. An Italian study followed two groups of equal weight post-menopausal women for a year, putting half of them on HRT, with the rest going hormone-free. At the end of the year, the HRT group stayed almost the same weight, and hadn’t put on any extra fat around their middles or arms. In the untreated group, things were different: they had put on three and a half pounds, and had increased the amount of fat around their waists and arms. HRT isn’t suitable for everyone, so make sure you consider your options and discuss with your doctor first. In men, hormones are linked to a variety of lifestyle factors, including body fat and waist size, which can increase the amount of oestrogen in your body. Keeping active is also vital for men’s hormones: a 2018 study found that regular cyclists aged 55 to 74 kept their testosterone levels up compared with inactive men. Your sleep is also a partial predictor of your testosterone levels: most of the hormone is released while we doze, so if you’re not getting enough hours in bed, your body has less chance of boosting its stores. Getting enough sleep is key for maintaining your weight for other reasons, too: not getting enough is shown to make you gravitate towards sweet foods, and muscle growth occurs largely while we’re resting at night. More stress For many, juggling looking after children and caring for parents with work can mean life post-50 requires navigating a huge amount of stress. Even if you eat exactly as you did before, stress can cause weight gain. In 2015, American researchers found that after eating a large meal, women who reported more stress in the previous day burned 104 fewer calories than women who weren’t stressed. Stressed women also had higher levels of insulin, which is linked to gaining fat. This may not sound significant, but burning 100 fewer calories a day could lead to a loss of 10lbs of fat over a year. What to do: Reducing stress is often one of the hardest lifestyle changes to make, as you may have little control over the issues at work or home. However, you can change how you react, which can reduce your stress levels even without anything changing in your external environment. Exercise is an incredibly effective way of lowering cortisol levels, as well as burning calories, which could lead to a double effect on your weight. There is also robust evidence that simply slowing your breathing can dramatically reduce stress in both the short and long term, as well as giving a range of other benefits like better sleep. “Slow” counts as anything less than 10 breaths a minute, and six breaths is even better. The NHS recommends inhaling for up to a count of five, then exhaling for the same length of time."

But as with many storms, the residual damage is proving to be distinctly uneven.

Consider the cases of Susan E. Rice and Victoria Nuland, two high-ranking diplomats whose internal roles were put on display when the White House released e-mails this month documenting how the administration drafted its official talking points about the attacks, which killed Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans.

Ms. Rice, the ambassador to the United Nations and the favorite to be President Obama’s next national security adviser, continues to be criticized by Senate Republicans for going on Sunday news programs a few days after the attacks to deliver the talking points, which later proved to be inaccurate. But the e-mails reinforced her lack of involvement in the drafting process.

Ms. Nuland, a former State Department spokeswoman nominated by Mr. Obama to be an assistant secretary of state, was backed by some of the same Republicans, even though the e-mails show she pushed to edit the talking points — a process critics say was calculated to airbrush the White House’s account of the attacks for political reasons."

Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker, the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told ""Fox News Sunday"" that he thinks the president will respond soon with military action.

However, he suggested waiting until Congress returns next week to seek its authorization and that the United States respond “in a surgical way.”

“I hope the president will … do something in a very surgical and proportional way, something that gets their attention,” he said. “At the same time, I hope it's the kind of action that doesn't move us away from the policy we have right now where we want to see the Syrian opposition group taking the lead on the ground.”

Corker’s comments followed a top Obama administration official saying there is ""very little doubt"" Syrian President Bashar Assad and his forces used a chemical weapon on civilians Wednesday near Damascus, killing at least 100 people.

The announcement came as the Syrian government appeared close to allowing United Nations inspectors to visit the site of the reported attack and a U.N. spokesperson saying an inspection team is preparing to conduct an on-site fact-finding mission Monday.

Corker was joined on the show by New York Rep. Eliot Engel, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, who called the alleged civilian attacks last week “horrific"" and urged the U.S. to respond with its NATO allies.

“But we have to move, and we have to move now,” Engel said.

Their comments come after almost a year of lawmakers pressing Obama to make good on his statement about Syria “crossing a red line” by using chemical weapons.

Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel suggested Friday that the Pentagon might move naval forces closer to Syria in preparation for a possible decision by Obama to order military strikes.

However, U.S. defense officials have said the Navy has already sent a fourth warship armed with ballistic missiles into the eastern Mediterranean Sea, with lawmakers saying the best strategy now might by using Cruise missiles fired from off shore.

Rhode Island Democratic Sen. Jack Reed, a member of the chamber’s Armed Services Committee, told CBS’ “Face the Nation” the United States cannot let itself get into a situation in Syria “where this becomes a springboard for a general military option.""

""We have to verify (the chemical attack) was directed by the Assad regime because that will allow us to build an international coalition, which is absolutely necessary to take any more steps in Syria,” he added.

Syrian allies on Sunday also reportedly warned the United States about taking military action. Russia’s foreign ministry warned the U.S. about repeating the “mistakes of the past” and said unilateral military action against Syria will have a “devastating impact” on Middle East stability.

Massoud Jazayeri, Iran’s deputy chief of staff for armed forces, warns the U.S. about crossing a ""red line"" on Syria, saying such action would have ""severe consequences,"" according to Reuters.

The reports of thousands killed or stricken by chemical weapons last week is the latest allegation about such tactics in the Middle East country’s roughly 2-year-long civil war.

The White House has been reluctant to take direct military actions, instead supplying rebel forces with non-lethal aid, weighing military options and trying to garner international support.

The administration official said Sunday that the U.S. intelligence community made the assessment about likely chemical use based on ""the reported number of victims, reported symptoms of those who were killed or injured and witness accounts.""

The official said the White House also thinks Assad and his forces originally denied United Nations investigators immediate access to the site of the reported attack to give the evidence time to degrade. In addition, the White House thinks any inspection now will be too late, the official said.

The administration statement follows a meeting Saturday between President Obama and his National Security Council that concluded with the White House saying the administration was still “gathering facts.”

The official spoke Sunday on the condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to speak publicly.

The reports of thousands killed or stricken by chemical weapons last week is the latest allegation about such tactics in the Middle East country’s roughly 2-year-long civil war.

The White House meeting was attended by at least 15 members of the president’s security council, including Hagel, Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of State John Kerry, but it was unclear who was in the Oval Office. In addition to the president holding the meeting, he spoke this weekend about the international crisis with British Prime Minister David Cameron and French President Francois Hollande.

Syrian state media accused rebels of using chemical arms against government troops in clashes Saturday near Damascus, while Doctors Without Borders said it has tallied 355 deaths from the purported chemical weapons attack on Wednesday.

The international aid group said three hospitals it supports in the eastern Damascus region reported receiving roughly 3,600 patients with ""neurotoxic symptoms"" over less than three hours on Wednesday morning when the attack in the eastern Ghouta area took place. Of those, 355 died.

U.S. confirmation took more than four months after rebels similarly reported chemical attacks in February, though in this instance a U.N. chemical weapons team is already on the ground in Syria. Assad's government, then as now, has denied the claims as baseless.

Lawmakers returning Monday from their summer break are set to begin debate on whether to approve limited US military action in Syria, with a Senate vote possibly coming as early as Wednesday. Obama will blitz US networks on Monday evening before addressing the American people from the Oval Office on Tuesday aiming to lay out the case to deepen US involvement in a two-year-old war that has claimed more than 100,000 lives. President Bashar al-Assad was also to take to the US airwaves to deny he ordered a suspected chemical attack on his people last month, which has shocked the world and galvanized the Obama administration into preparing for its first military foray into the brutal conflict. In a rare interview with a US network, Assad insisted he was not behind the August 21 gas attack on a Damascus suburb, and issued a veiled warning to the American people not to become militarily involved in the rebellion against him that erupted in March 2011. The long-time Syrian leader warned that as his country prepares ""as best we can"" for US military action, there could be a bitter consequences. ""There's no evidence that I used chemical weapons against my own people,"" he reportedly told CBS television, in the interview to be aired Monday. Assad said he ""had a message to the American people that it had not been a good experience for them to get involved in the Middle East in wars and conflicts."" He ""suggested that there would be, among people that are aligned with him, some kind of retaliation if a strike was made,"" veteran CBS correspondent Charlie Rose told CBS. After talks with Arab League leaders in Paris, US Secretary of State John Kerry said: ""All of us agree, not one dissenter, that Assad's deplorable use of chemical weapons... crosses an international global red line."" Kerry, who was dispatched by Obama to shore up support abroad, said a number of Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia, were willing to sign a statement agreed by 12 of the G20 countries last week calling for a ""strong"" reaction to the alleged attack. Asked about Assad's denial, Kerry told journalists traveling with him on his next stop in London that ""the evidence speaks for itself."" ""Today we discussed the possible and necessary measures that can be taken,"" he said earlier, adding Saudi Arabia was among those who had signed on. The stakes are high, with Obama far from guaranteed of winning a green light from Congress, amid American fears of being dragged deeper into the conflict and the risk of dangerous repercussions for allies such as Israel, which on Sunday deployed its Iron Dome missile defense system west of Jerusalem. It remains unclear whether Obama, who was partly elected in 2008 on his promises to end the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, would decide to go it alone if he fails to win congressional approval. While a resolution for a military strike is likely to pass the Senate controlled by Obama's Democrats, according to a Washington Post survey some 224 of the current 433 members of the Republican dominated House were either ""no"" or ""leaning no"" on military action as of Friday. A large number, 184, were undecided, with just 25 backing a strike. A top White House official said Sunday the Obama administration is planning ""for every contingency"" in case of any fallout from US military strikes. ""We have to obviously be very careful and very targeted and very limited in our engagement so we do not get dragged into the middle of this. And then there's obviously risk of reaction and retaliation against our friends,"" White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough said on CNN. He urged hesitant lawmakers to watch graphic videos released over the weekend, said to be of the August attack, showing corpses as well as dying people, including children, writhing in pain and apparently foaming at the mouth and vomiting. The Los Angeles Times reported meanwhile that the Pentagon was preparing for three days of attacks on Syria, longer than originally planned. War planners now aim to unleash a heavy barrage of missile strikes to be followed swiftly by additional attacks on targets that may have been missed or remain standing after the initial launch, the newspaper cited officials as saying. A US defense official told AFP the scale and purpose of the operation against Syria has not changed in recent weeks, although US forces would adjust as needed. ""We will continue to review our targeting and targeting options as the Syrian government adapts over time,"" said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. But Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javed Zarif on Sunday slammed the potential strikes against Syria as ""illegal,"" saying such military action was barred under the United Nations charter. On the ground, Syrian rebels, including the jihadist Al-Nusra Front, were said to have taken control of the historic Christian town of Maalula, north of Damascus. And an Italian journalist and a Belgian national who had both been kidnapped in early April were released and on a plane flying to Italy, the Italian government said."

A senior Defense Department official told CNN on Friday that target lists for possible air strikes have been updated. The planning also included updates on the potential use of cruise missiles, which would not require fighter pilots to enter Syrian airspace.

But the official cautioned the steps were taken ""to give the president a current and comprehensive range of choices"" and that no decisions were made at a national security meeting on Thursday at the White House.

The official said there are certain static targets, like government buildings and military installations, but that forces and equipment of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad ""continue to move"" and thus require flexibility in planning.

A U.N. team is in Syria attempting to investigate the latest claim of chemical weapons use outside Damascus that killed more than 1,300 people, according to the opposition.

Obama told CNN in an interview broadcast on Friday the United States is working with the United Nations to gather information on the alleged attack, but noted that preliminary signs point to a ""big event of grave concern.""

""It is very troublesome,"" he said. ""That starts getting to some core national interests that the United States has, both in terms of us making sure that weapons of mass destruction are not proliferating, as well as needing to protect our allies, our bases in the region.""

Obama said there was an abbreviated time frame for making decisions about Syria.

Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said Friday ""a very quick assessment"" of the allegations is important because if the Assad government did use chemical weapons, ""there may be another attack coming,"" Reuters reported from aboard the military aircraft carrying Hagel to Malaysia.

Hagel told reporters on the plane that the military was responsible for ""positioning our assets to be able to carry out different options,"" but he said that did not necessarily mean forces or assets had been moved, according to Reuters.

Speaking with ""New Day"" anchor Chris Cuomo, Obama defended his administration's decision to not intervene militarily in the conflict so far, but predicted that American focus on the country's strife would be necessary for the fighting to come to an end.

""I think it is fair to say that, as difficult as the problem is, this is something that is going to require America's attention and hopefully the entire international community's attention,"" Obama said.

If the United States affirmed evidence that indicated Syrian government responsibility, the U.S. military options would include targeting al-Assad's capability to deliver chemical weapons, the official added.

A White House spokesman said on Friday that the administration has long maintained that ""all options remain on the table"" regarding Syria. But Obama has previously indicated no plans to place American ""boots on the ground.""

Military planners last conducted a major update of options for Syria in April, in response to bipartisan pressure from members of Congress.

""The plans are constantly being reviewed and tweaked,"" the official said, adding that the latest update represented a more comprehensive review of airstrike target lists.

Sen. John McCain, an advocate for a more forceful U.S. response to the Syrian conflict, has suggested that American air power could take out runways and planes used by al-Assad's forces that he said are ""dominating the battlefields and the towns and the cities.""

He also said the administration could ""supply the right kind of weapons to rebels to establish a 'no fly' zone"" and utilize Patriot missile batteries elsewhere in the region.

So far, Obama has authorized a limited amount of military hardware for the rebels in addition to logistical and humanitarian assistance.

A chief problem has been identifying those rebels the United States would happily deal with vs elements said to be militants, including some with ties to al Qaeda.

""Syria today is not about choosing between two sides but rather about choosing one among many sides,"" Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey wrote this week to a member of Congress.

""It is my belief that the side we choose must be ready to promote their interests and ours when the balance shifts in their favor. Today, they are not,"" he said in the August 19 letter.

Dempsey also warned that even limited military action in Syria could lead to deeper involvement.

Late on Friday, a defense official said the United States had added a Navy destroyer to the eastern Mediterranean fleet.

The USS Ramage arrived to replace the USS Mahan, but the Mahan is going to stay around a bit longer, so temporarily there will be four. The USS Gravelly and USS Barry remain.

These ships are all equipped with the Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles, a long-range subsonic cruise missile used to attack land targets."

But he lies. And he knows that he lies. That’s pathetic.”

Putin has always been a bare-knuckles political brawler with a penchant for saying politically incorrect things about enemies — he once said of Islamist terrorists in Chechnya, for example, “If you are willing to become a radical Islamist and be circumcised, I invite you to Moscow. I will recommend that they perform the operation so that nothing can sprout there again.” Now, however, he’s directly challenging the authority of the United States – and he’s winning. President Obama has always wanted to be perceived as a global leader. Instead, it’s his chief international rival, quasi-dictator Putin, who has seized the reins.

Obama has been left to complain. “Do I hold out hope that Mr. Putin may change his position on some of these issues?” Obama asked in Sweden on Wednesday. “I’m always hopeful, and I will continue to engage him.” Just a few weeks ago, Obama mocked Putin’s posture during their meetings, likening it to a “bored kid in the back of the classroom.”

But it is Obama being schooled. Putin has stated that he would be open to action against Syria if shown proof that Assad ordered the chemical attack there. But on Wednesday, he said of John Kerry, “Of course he lied. And that’s not pretty.”

The G20 summit has been set not around national security issues, but on tax issues and economic recovery. Nonetheless, it will be Putin setting the agenda on his home turf, especially given that the visiting team is led by a floundering quarterback.

USA TODAY

The Toronto City Council on Wednesday urged Mayor Rob Ford to take a leave of absence after he acknowledged buying illegal drugs and said his infamous crack-smoking incident was ""sheer stupidity"" that would not happen again.

""I ask forgiveness, I have apologized, I want to move on, that's all I can say right now,"" Ford said during a bruising debate.

At one point, Councilor Denzil Minnan-Wong, a former Ford ally, asked the 44-year-old mayor point blank if he had purchased illegal drugs in the past two years. After a pause of almost nine seconds, the mayor replied, ""Yes, I have.""

""I understand the embarrassment that I have caused. I am humiliated by it,"" Ford said.

Hours later, an Ontario judge unsealed a 500-page police report revealing that former Ford staffers had told investigators about his use of drugs, alcohol and prostitutes.

The embattled mayor, who took office three years ago, strongly rejected a direct appeal by several council members to step aside, saying he has always carried out his duties and would continue to do so.

""I'm most definitely keeping this job,"" he said. ""I am not leaving here. I'm going to sit here and going to attend every meeting.""

Ford, mayor of Canada's largest city, said he had ""no one else to blame but myself"" for a crack-smoking incident during a drunken stupor caught on video, but that it would never happen again.

""I asked for forgiveness, I have apologized, I want to move on,"" he told the council members. ""That's all I can say right now.""

Nonetheless, the council voted, 37-5, for a non-binding resolution calling on Ford to take a leave.

Councilor Jaye Robinson opened the often heated session by presenting a petition signed by 30 of the 44 City Council members asking the mayor to step down temporarily.

The petition was then formally accepted by the council on a 41 to 2 vote. ""Our city's reputation has been damaged,"" she said, the CBC reports. ""Together we stand to ask you to step aside and take a leave of absence.""

The packed council chamber erupted with applause when Robinson ended her speech, saying, ""Let's get on with city business.""

The petition reads in part:

Toronto is distracted and for good reason. Our city's reputation has been damaged and continues to suffer, and it has become difficult to focus on the pressing and substantive issues facing City Council. Today we stand together to ask that you step aside and take a leave of absence to address your challenges privately, outside of the public eye.

After accepting the letter, the council took up a formal motion by Council member Minnan-Wong, a longtime Ford supporter turned critic, that also called on Ford to apologize for misleading the public and to cooperate with a police investigation.

The mayor, who snacked on slices of apple during the debate, was jovial heading into the council chambers, The Toronto Sunreports. ""We're gonna have some fun today,"" he told reporters.

But the debate frequently turned heated, with people on all sides shouting, prompting Speaker Frances Nunziata to urge council members to ""be civil"" and ""respect each other.""

During one exchange, Minnan-Wong told the council that the mayor, en route to the council chambers, had stepped in front of him in a threatening manner and he demanded that Ford apologize.

In the background, the mayor's brother, Councilor Doug Ford, shouted, ""You're too much, brother.""

Mayor Ford protested, saying, ""I did not threaten him (Minnan-Wong) in any way, shape or form.""

At another point, Ford said he would not speak to police, on advice of his attorney, about their investigation into corruption, drug use and extortion.

Ford, who took office in December 2010, has refused to step aside despite immense political pressure. He says voters should determine his political fate when he is up for re-election in 2014.

The debate by the council, which does not have the power to remove Ford from office, follows months of growing scandal stemming from a report by the U.S. website Gawker and The Toronto Star that Ford had been caught on video smoking what appeared to be crack cocaine.

The mayor initially denied the charge and questioned the existence of the video.

Last week, after Toronto Police Chief Bill Blair announced that investigators had recovered two videos, including the notorious crack cocaine tape, Ford acknowledged his actions, and said that he was drunk.

Police have not released either video, saying they are evidence for use in an extortion case against the mayor's ""close friend"" Alessandro Lisi.

Within days of the police statement, a second video emerged, this one showing a clearly inebriated Ford stumbling around a room, gesticulating angrily. ""I'm gonna kill that (expletive) guy. I'm telling you, it's first-degree murder,"" the visibly agitated mayor says on the video.

Ford later acknowledged his actions on the video, saying he had been ""extremely, extremely inebriated.""

The police report released Wednesday was unsealed by an Ontario Superior Court justice at the request of media organizations. The document was used to get a search warrant in the investigation of Ford and Lisi.

The former staffers ""suspected he was doing a variety of drugs, including lines of cocaine and OxyContin, and drinking at city hall, in public and in his car, as well as spending time with escorts, spewing verbal abuse and assaulting female staff,"" The National Postwrites."

North Korea's nuclear test drew the usual reprimands from world leaders. President Obama promised swift and credible action. We know what this is likely to mean – more sanctions and greater isolation for Pyongyang.

But what if the answer should really be the opposite? What if the best way to change North Korea is more commerce and communication with it rather than less?

If you look at examples of how we deal with other countries, sanctions rarely work. In Cuba, 54 years of sanctions have kept the Castros in power while its citizens have suffered. They remain isolated with the lowest rate of Internet penetration in the entire western hemisphere.

In Iran, unprecedented sanctions have been in place for years, but there is no clear sign that the real powers that be, the Mullahs, are in peril. In Syria, no amount of pressure has had any impact on Bashar al-Assad's brutality.

More from GPS: North Korea dance begins again

Now, if you ask Asian diplomats, they will point to Myanmar as embodying the opposite approach. Asian countries traded with Myanmar, invited it to diplomatic gatherings and, over time, persuaded the military junta to open itself up, both domestically and to the world.

There's a pattern in the last two decades of negotiations with North Korea. First comes a missile test, closely followed by a nuclear test, global sanctions, then some talk of rapprochement and, then, back to square one – more provocations.

All the while, the people of North Korea have suffered. In the 1990s, an estimated 2 million people died in a nationwide famine. North Koreans have almost no contact with the outside world. Less than 10 percent of them even have mobile phones, and those are not allowed to call outside the country. Per capita income is estimated to be somewhere around $1,000 a year, about 1/20 of that in neighboring South Korea. The best path to open up with North Korea might be trade deals, travel programs. We could start with student exchange programs.

About a decade ago, Syracuse University started research collaboration with North Korea’s Kim Chaek University of Technology. The partnership has led to the creation of North Korea's first digital library. Technology from that partnership enabled the New York Philharmonic to broadcast its recent concert in Pyongyang.

We might need more of these partnerships, not fewer. Google's founder, Eric Schmidt, recently visited North Korea, and we may need more such trips by more entrepreneurs like him.

In the very short run, they do give the regime some credibility, but in the long run, capitalism and commerce are the assets of modernity that always wear down dictatorships."

Obama called the Aug. 21 attack a “crime against humanity” that violated international law.

“When dictators commit atrocities, they depend upon the world to look the other way until those horrifying pictures fade from memory,” Obama said. “But these things happened. The facts cannot be denied. The question now is what the United States of America and the international community is prepared to do about it.”

TRANSCRIPT: Obama makes his case to the nation

Advertisement

In his first prime-time address from the White House in more than two years, Obama found himself unexpectedly tasked with a dual challenge: bolstering public support for his decision to launch military strikes against the Assad government while explaining his decision to pursue a diplomatic alternative.

Obama called a new Russian proposal to have Syria turn over its chemical weapons stockpile “encouraging,” but cautioned, “It’s too early to tell whether this offer will succeed, and any agreement must verify that the Assad regime keeps its commitments.”

The almost contradictory messages reflected the unsettled state of affairs in the standoff with Syria over the alleged chemical attack. The White House and U.S. allies worked quickly Tuesday to explore the viability of the proposal made by Russian on Monday.

The Obama administration said it was skeptical that Assad’s government would follow through with the plan. Still, in a meeting with senators on Capitol Hill, Obama asked lawmakers to give him time to sort through the options, and Senate leaders, in a sign of the deep reluctance to endorse the president’s push for another military intervention, readily complied.

But the president’s speech from the East Room was announced before Russia’s plan emerged. While diplomats in Paris, Damascus, Moscow and Washington worked through the details – running into early signs of the difficulty of crafting a workable plan – Obama continued his public relations campaign.

FULL COVERAGE: The debate over Syria

The speech, which aides rewrote on the fly Tuesday, was designed as the keynote of a week of meetings, briefings, speeches and phone calls aimed at lawmakers whose support Obama needs in his pursuit of congressional authorization for a punitive strike against Syria.

With polls showing Americans opposed to a strike by roughly a 2-1 margin, the White House sought to convince lawmakers to buck public opinion and back Obama on a vote some say could determine the future of his presidency and U.S. credibility abroad.

In his speech Tuesday, Obama stressed a strike would be limited – unlike the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan – but he answered some skeptical lawmakers who have wondered if a “pinprick” strike would be worth it.

“Let me make something clear: The United States military doesn’t do pinpricks,” Obama said. “Even a limited strike will send a message to Assad that no other nation can deliver.”

But on Capitol Hill, resistance to military intervention seemed to firm up with the sudden appearance of the Russian alternative.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) indefinitely postponed an initial vote on an authorization resolution approved by the Foreign Relations Committee last week. He said he would be satisfied with a diplomatic solution. “I’m not a blood-and-thunder guy. I’m not for shock and awe,” he said.

Meanwhile, key senators began to draft language that would incorporate the Russian plan, perhaps authorizing force only if Syria refused to allow an outside entity, most likely the United Nations, to secure its chemical weapons stockpile. It could also require a U.N. resolution condemning Syria for using chemical weapons on its own people.

Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), chairman of the Armed Services Committee, emphasized that the resolution was still being crafted. But he said the goal was to eliminate the threat of Syria using chemical weapons by keeping open the possibility of force, “like the Sword of Damocles over Assad.”

“It’s because of the threat of a strike by the president, because of the possibility that Congress would authorize it, that there’s movement at the U.N. So you’ve got to find a way to keep that pressure on. That’s the key to success at the U.N.,” Levin said.

The president told Democrats he needed a number of days to pursue the diplomatic channels. But he “was not overly optimistic,” said Sen. Richard Durbin (D-Ill.), the assistant majority leader.

“What he’s basically asked is for some time to work this out,” Durbin said, a time frame that would delay any action until next week. “I think that’s reasonable. We want this to end well; we want the end of chemical weapons in Syria. And if we can achieve that through the president’s threatened use of military force, that’s a good thing for safety in the world.”

The European Union, wary of military action, warmed to the Russian proposal, as its top diplomat urged quick work on the nettlesome details involving the verification and destruction of the arsenal. Support from the EU, with its 28 member nations, added to the diplomatic momentum behind the idea.

Obama, along with his French and British counterparts, agreed Tuesday to explore the proposal with Russia and China, Syria’s allies. The latter have used their veto power on the U.N. Security Council to block previous moves to punish Assad’s government.

But Obama and his allies almost immediately ran into conflict with Russia, which demanded that the U.S. should forswear any threat to use force as part of a deal. Moscow also insisted that the Security Council should not be asked to implement the program under Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter, which authorizes the use of force, and proposed instead use of a much weaker tool, a “presidential statement.”

Russian officials have been deeply resistant to even weak Security Council resolutions concerning the Syrian civil war, fearing that they could open the way to an international military force.

Skeptical of the plan already, administration officials warned Tuesday that the Russian proposal could disintegrate under such demands before the end of the week.

The plan “has to have consequences if games are played, or if somebody tries to undermine this,” Secretary of State John F. Kerry said during a Google+ Hangout conversation on the subject.

British Prime Minister David Cameron told lawmakers the proposal needed to come before the Security Council as a resolution that includes a timetable, process and consequences if Syria reneges.

“What’s important is to make sure this isn’t some delay tactic, that this isn’t some ruse,” he said.

Kerry said U.S. officials have stressed to the Russians that “this must be done quickly.”

Still, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said he was working with Syria to draft a proposal and planned to deliver it soon to U.N. Secretary-General Ban-ki Moon. And the Syrian government said it was serious about the Russian plan precisely because it could prevent a U.S. military strike.

“We agreed with the Russian initiative, proceeding from the understanding that it must cut the ground from under the feet of the U.S. aggression against our country,” Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moallem said during a meeting with the speaker of Russia’s lower house of parliament, Sergei Naryshkin.

If Obama ends up rejecting the Russian proposal, he could be forced to resume his effort to win congressional authorization for a strike.

On Capitol Hill, the president’s threat to strike Syria continued to draw new opposition, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), whose decision conflicts with the support offered by House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio), who reaffirmed his support for military action.

“I believe it’s important to try to help the president provide a unified front,” Boehner said, even as he made a nod to his own problems rounding up votes. “It’s a very difficult issue for Congress.”

The split between the two top GOP leaders in Congress comes as McConnell, who is running for reelection next year, aligned himself with the tea party wing of the GOP, which has gained influence at the expense of traditional defense hawks. McConnell said he did not believe limited strikes would deter Assad from using chemical weapons.

The two Republicans both raised concerns about the Russian proposal. Boehner said he was skeptical because of the “actors that are involved,” but McConnell said it was “worth exploring.”

“We had anticipated that at the outset, there were going to be some areas of friction, to put it mildly, in getting this thing off the ground,” Obama said at a news conference here with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

Karzai’s office earlier in the day had abruptly canceled ongoing security negotiations with U.S. officials aimed at defining the U.S.-Afghan relationship after American-led foreign forces leave Afghanistan, a move scheduled for the end of next year.

His decision came a day after the Obama administration had announced that representatives of the United States and the Taliban would hold talks in the Persian Gulf nation of Qatar. U.S. officials said the talks were set to begin Thursday.

In a terse statement, the Afghan president’s office said the government would stop participating in the security talks given a “contradiction” between U.S. words and deeds on the peace process.

In a later statement, it added that Afghan officials wouldn’t attend the separate negotiations with the Taliban until they were “fully Afghanized,” and that the opening of a Taliban political office Monday in Doha, the Qatari capital, undermined earlier assurances made by the United States.

The statement didn’t say what those assurances were or how long the suspension would last.

Obama said misunderstandings aren’t surprising given the enormous mistrust between the Afghan government and the Taliban, but that it was still important to explore opportunities for a political reconciliation.

Advertisement

“Not only have the Taliban and the Afghan government been fighting for a long time, they’re fighting as we speak,” he said. “We’re in the middle of a war. And Afghans are still being killed and, by the way, members of the international forces there are still being killed. And that’s not abating as we speak.”

Obama said that as elusive as reconciliation with the Taliban may seem, it’s worth pursuing.

“I think that President Karzai himself recognizes the need for political reconciliation,” he told reporters, adding that it remains to be seen whether the process bears fruit. “That’s a question that only the Afghans can answer.”

He stops short of demanding congressional authorization before military action

Other lawmakers say Congress must authorize action

WASHINGTON — House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, sent a letter to President Obama seeking answers to 14 questions regarding U.S. military intervention in Syria, but the speaker stopped short of seeking a formal authorization vote before the president can engage.

Rather, Boehner contended that the president needs to consult with Congress but make the case to the American people to justify engaging in Syria's civil war. Noting that Obama's self-described ""red line"" against Syria's use of chemical weapons has been crossed, Boehner wrote that Obama should ""provide a clear, unambiguous explanation of how military action – which is a means, not a policy – will secure U.S. objectives and how it fits into your overall policy.""

Among the questions Boehner asked: How the administration determined that the scope of chemical weapons use warrants military action; what the purpose of a strike would be; what it would intend to achieve; if further strikes will be conducted if initial efforts don't change the reality on the ground; and whether the administration may seek more money from Congress to conduct such operations.

Boehner said the administration's outreach has been insufficient to mollify lawmakers' concerns. ""I have conferred with the chairmen of the national security committees who have received initial outreach from senior administration officials, and while the outreach has been appreciated, it is apparent from the questions above that the outreach has, to date, not reached the level of substantive consultation,"" he wrote.

Boehner's letter comes the same day as at least 111 House lawmakers signed a letter by Rep. Scott Rigell, R-Va., calling on Obama to seek a vote of congressional approval before any military action can be taken. The lawmakers contend that to act without their authority violates the Constitution, but the administration contends it is not legally required to seek authorization to act in the immediate national security interest.

Whether the Syria situation meets that standard is a matter of debate in Washington, but Boehner's letter indicated support for the administration's view that it has the constitutional authority for limited military engagement in Syria.

""I am mindful that Syria is one of the few places where the immediate national security interests of the United States so visibly converge with broader U.S. security interests and objectives,"" he wrote."

More than 200,000 people crowded the streets of Berlin — a favorite backdrop for U.S. politicians reaching for history — to hear then-candidate Barack Obama promise to turn the page on the unpopular policies of George W. Bush.

“Germany meets the superstar,” the news magazine Der Spiegel proclaimed on its cover.

As he heads to Europe on Sunday for a visit that will culminate with a sequel to that Berlin speech three days later, Obama has been demoted to mere president.

For many Europeans, Obama’s tenure has been a lesson in lowering expectations. Although he maintains approval ratings on the continent any politician would envy, confidence in his leadership and support for his international agenda have slipped since those heady early days.

“He was the subject of enormous projections that he was never, ever going to be able to live up to. He was the non-Bush. He was the intimation of the America without Bush that people could love again,” said Constanze Stelzenmueller, a transatlantic relations expert at the German Marshall Fund of the United States in Berlin.

“He’s become somewhat demystified.”

Obama’s failure to close the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detention center, his escalation of drone warfare and small steps on global warming are among the reasons the sheen has dulled, polling shows. Another may have been added with the recent revelations that Obama has expanded Bush-era surveillance of phone calls and email. Several European officials have demanded more information. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said she will raise the issue with Obama when the two meet privately.

There are other rifts between the United States and European leaders that the president will try to mend during his visit, which begins Monday with the annual meeting of the Group of 8 industrialized nations, held this year in Northern Ireland.

Obama will explain his decision to arm the rebels in the bloody civil war in Syria, a move hailed by leaders in Britain and France, while others fear being pulled into another war in the Middle East. And Obama is likely to renew his unsuccessful efforts to persuade Merkel to ease up on her demands for austerity measures in other European countries, which he views as hampering the continent’s economic recovery. On Friday, he called Merkel and the leaders of Britain, France and Italy to talk about Syria and Libya, which faces threats from radical Islamists.

This year, his economic offensive comes with a full-scale appeal to his high-wattage popularity — and to history. In Berlin, Obama has chosen a city that became a potent reminder of American ties to Europe. His speech will mark 50 years since President Kennedy, at Schoeneberg Town Hall in West Berlin, affirmed his solidarity with Germans in the face of communism with his declaration, “Ich bin ein Berliner.”

The president is to speak at Brandenburg Gate, an imposing columned monument once cut off from the West by the Berlin Wall. In 1987, President Reagan stood with the gate behind him and demanded that Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev “tear down this wall.”

Once a symbol of Cold War division, the edifice is now a coveted setting for U.S. presidents as a testament to the triumph of democracy. President Clinton spoke there in 1994 after the wall had been torn down and declared: “Berlin ist frei.”

Obama’s own moment at the gate has long been envisioned by his foreign policy advisors. His campaign scouted the site in 2008, but chose another venue after Merkel suggested she was uncomfortable with electioneering at the historic monument.

The incident was not forgotten. In 2011, Merkel needled Obama for not returning to Berlin as president, joking: “I can promise that the Brandenburg Gate will still be there.”

Obama will speak on the east side of the gate, where a plaza will limit the crowd size and the potential for unfavorable comparisons to his mega-rally.

The audience awaiting him Wednesday will undoubtedly be more skeptical. In European countries polled by Pew Research last year, 63% of those surveyed approved of Obama’s international policies, down from 78% in 2009. In Germany, 52% said they had a favorable view of the United States, down from 64% in 2009 — but up from 34% in Bush’s last year in office.

“Those numbers are still pretty good compared to other parts of the world. Really, what it’s all about is he didn’t meet expectations,” said Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Global Attitudes Project.

Still, an overwhelming 87% of Germans said they have “a lot” or “some” confidence in Obama.

In his unabashedly lofty speech five years ago, Obama asked the massive crowd to envision a world without nuclear weapons, a planet Earth healed, without racial or sectarian divisions.

“These are the walls we must tear down,” Obama said. “This is the moment to stand as one.”

In Berlin this week, Obama probably will return to similar themes, referring back to the united front that ended the Cold War and imaging a more harmonious world.

“I think his message is very much going to be that just because the threat is not immediately apparent with a wall and barbed wire, it doesn’t mean that we don’t have work to do together,” said Ben Rhodes, a top White House foreign policy aide.

But Obama’s words may also reflect the toned-down ambitions he has after a term as president. Stelzenmueller noted that Germans — and Europeans as a whole — will expect Obama to address some difficult issues: Syria, trade and U.S. surveillance of foreign phone calls and email.

“Despite the fact that we’re close, we have legitimate disagreements that we need to thrash out or negotiate,” she said. “It’s difficult to make glamorous speeches about that kind of thing.”

The U.S. and South Korea have said the burden is on Pyongyang to pull back on its nuclear ambitions.

Experts say both sides have set out unrealistic demands. The South Korean Foreign Ministry derided the North Korean argument Thursday as “totally incomprehensible” and “illogical.” North Korea, in turn, is extremely unlikely to give up its nuclear bargaining chips before even getting to the table, analysts said.

But even talk of talk has been greeted as a welcome change after weeks of bombastic threats from Pyongyang. Though cautious about predicting what North Korea will do next, some analysts believe that such a change could be a first step toward opening dialogue to defuse tensions on the Korean peninsula.

The North Korean demands, implausible as they are, “could be seen as a step toward Pyongyang backing off the ledge,” said Suzanne DiMaggio, vice president of global policy programs at the Asia Society.

“It could offer an opening for Seoul and Washington to approach North Koreans,” possibly making some kind of contact that falls short of official talks, she said.

Tensions soared after North Korea conducted its third nuclear test in February, spurring a new, stiffer round of U.N. sanctions last month. At the same time, Pyongyang was infuriated by ongoing U.S.-South Korea military drills.

The isolated nation declared an end to a Korean War armistice and vowed nuclear attacks on its foes. Intelligence analysts said North Korea was poised to test as many as five missiles last week.

Yet a week later, both sides were talking about negotiations. Charles K. Armstrong, director of the Center for Korean Research at Columbia University, said he believes that was what North Korea was aiming for all along.

“Making a very strong, even outrageous set of statements, with the intention of negotiation from a position of strength -- that’s pretty consistent with their past behavior,” he said.

The military drills that left North Korea steaming are due to end in a week and a half, which is expected to dial down tensions. A key day in the North Korean calendar -- a holiday marking the birthday of its late founder, Kim Il Sung -- passed Monday, which could allow “posturing” to die down, Armstrong said.

So far, North Korea has not launched the missiles it moved to its east coast, as had been feared last week. Pyongyang may still press ahead with a missile test to shore up support at home before talking to Washington, said Marcus Noland, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.

“The problem is, if you’re [North Korean leader] Kim Jong Un and you are putting your nuclear program on postage stamps and billboards and having mass rallies in Pyongyang chanting that this is the lifeblood of the nation ... if you’ve built all that up, it’s quite hard to back away.”

Advertisement

“He needs some way to declare victory,” Noland said. After carrying out a missile test, North Korea could tell its people “they’ve come begging to talk to us,” and resume negotiations.

DiMaggio said that wouldn’t help bring the U.S. or South Korea to the table, however.

Advertisement

“Seoul and Tokyo would feel more threatened,” she said. “They’d want the U.S. to offer more reassurance that they’re protecting their allies. That would likely include more joint military exercises.”

Another important player is China. Beijing has evidenced growing frustration with North Korea, a situation that has spurred hopes it might put more pressure on its longtime ally. U.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry visited China last week, mentioning Korean tensions among several “very challenging issues” before meeting with President Xi Jinping. What China is doing behind the scenes could prove crucial.

Experts caution that reading North Korea under its new young leader remains difficult. Weeks ago, former basketball star Dennis Rodman returned from the country saying that Kim just wanted President Obama to call him. Soon after, Pyongyang vowed to attack the U.S. and South Korea.

“This still strikes me as a fairly capricious and unpredictable regime,” Noland said.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23405627,,[],Fifa lifts a global ban on Cameroon for government interference,"Last updated on .From the section Football

Fifa has lifted its global ban on Cameroon after a normalisation committee began its work on Monday to run the country's football federation.

It is being headed by former Minister of Education, Sports, Joseph Owona.

Earlier this month, Fifa banned Cameroon for governmental interference into the running of the country's football.

The condition for the lifting of the ban was that the committee was allowed to begin work.

Fifa said in a statement: ""As requested by the Fifa Emergency Committee, the normalisation committee that was appointed on 20 July 2013 was able to take up its duties this Monday... at the Cameroon Football Federation (Fecafoot) headquarters, with Fifa and Confederation of African Football (Caf) observers present.

""The lifting of the suspension means that Fecafoot's clubs, officials and other representatives can immediately resume their activities, which had been interrupted.""

The normalisation committee will be working under the supervision of Fifa's Primo Carvaro and Caf representative Prosper Abega.

Cameroon will now be free to play their crucial 2014 World Cup qualifier away to Libya in September, with the winner advancing to the final play-off round.

Meanwhile, club side Coton Sport will also be allowed to continue their African Champions League campaign - having failed to take part in their opening Group B match this weekend because of the ban.

The move follows a recent visit to meet Fifa president Sepp Blatter by a delegation from Cameroon that included current Sports Minister Adoum Garoua.

The normalisation committee will now act as the electoral body and will revise the statutes of the Cameroon Football Federation (Fecafoot).

It will also organise federation elections to be held by 31 March next year.

Members of the committee will not be eligible for any of the open positions at Fecafoot.

There had been confusion within Cameroon football before the ban with federation elections postponed on several occasions.

When the elections did go ahead, Iya Mohamed was re-elected president despite the fact he is being detained by the authorities in Cameroon.

He is being investigated after being accused of embezzling money at state-owned Cotton Development Company.

Soon after the election results were announced, Fecafoot's elections appeals committee declared them void.

In the aftermath, John Begheni Ndeh announced himself head of the federation and started work with the help of police, which was deemed as political interference by Fifa.

That was, at least in part, a response to Russia’s decision to grant NSA leaker Edward Snowden temporary asylum, a move that left the White House “extremely disappointed.” So what will the fallout be? Are the media’s Cold War comparisons appropriate?

No. This episode will have limited impact on an already toxic bilateral relationship that matters increasingly less around the world.

Obama made the right decision — and more importantly, he did it at the right time. By snubbing Putin when he did, Obama will allow Secretaries of State and Defense John Kerry and Chuck Hagel and their Russian counterparts to work back up from this low-water mark when they meet this week. If he had waited to snub Putin, it would unwind any progress that might come out of the current meetings. Obama clearly understands there is more room for productivity among senior diplomats than between the heads of state, where the relationship has always been icy, and any shortcomings are higher profile.

So the relationship only seems to be getting worse. Despite a very strong first term as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton’s “reset” with Russia is the biggest policy misstep she made. (Benghazi was far more politicized, but it was not her doing.) I’m surprised this failed diplomacy hasn’t gotten more coverage.

But the problem isn’t U.S.-Russia: it’s Russia itself. (That’s in stark contrast with U.S.-China relations, where there are material issues in the bilateral dynamic itself that make the partnership much feebler than the sum of its parts). Today, the situation in Russia makes unpredictable foreign policy decisions increasingly inevitable. Institutions have been undermined by corruption and a centralization of power at the very top. We see massive brain drain and capital flight. On top of that, Russia’s vast energy wealth is now looking like it will be less useful long-term than had been presumed. That’s in part because of the North American energy revolution that looks set to keep expanding supply. Putin’s response to all of this? Rather than opting for reform, he has decided to double down, tightening his control and letting the budget balloon to levels where ever-higher oil prices are needed for it to be balanced. This shortsighted approach can provide greater stability now, but it just exacerbates the worsening prospects for Russia in terms of diplomacy and economic trajectory down the road.

Don’t read too far into Obama’s snub. It doesn’t change the structural dynamics in a bilateral relationship that is slowly worsening, and slowly fading in importance. The real danger? As the domestic situation in Russia worsens, expect the country to lash out. That’s what happens when decisions are made by one increasingly quixotic (and despotic) individual.

President Barack Obama is due to arrive in South Africa on Friday and will speak in Cape Town on Sunday. The protest was linked to a series of ongoing demonstration in the so-called “toilet wars” over sanitation policy in the city. It was not aimed at Obama, but took place against a backdrop of demonstrations and internal battles surrounding Obama’s visit.

Local news sources report that the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu), which is technically a governing partner with the ANC, plans to “disrupt” Obama’s visit to the country by staging demonstrations involving thousands of protestors. Cosatu specifically objects to Obama’s foreign policy, which it describes as imperialist and militaristic. Local Muslim groups are joining the protest, too, with the local Muslim Lawyers Association calling on the government to arrest President Obama on his arrival for war crimes.

Several left-wing academics are vowing to boycott Obama’s a ceremony at the University of Johannesburg in which Obama is to receive an honorary doctorate. The centrist Democratic Alliance, meanwhile, has come under fire for attempting to bestow an award on the President and First Lady Michelle Obama.

Obama’s visit has also affected growing debates around the country’s ailing former president, Nelson Mandela, who is said to be on life support. Mandela’s relatives are engaged in a very public round of infighting over where he should be buried when he dies. There is some speculation that Mandela is being kept on life support until Obama’s visit, though the two are not scheduled to meet. NBC, citing one of Mandela’s daughters, reported Tuesday that Mandela had opened his eyes and smiled when being told of Obama’s imminent arrival in the country, but that report was not confirmed by other sources."

Some questioned the costs and benefits of up to $50 billion in the extra border security, which also will include high-tech surveillance equipment such as manned and unmanned aerial vehicles, radar and seismic devices.

But concerns were overshadowed by the deal's main goal: win votes for an overhaul of U.S. immigration law that will open a pathway to citizenship for up to 11 million undocumented immigrants.

Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid was expected to set a test vote for as early as Monday in a bid to have the deal added to the White House-backed bill in the form of an amendment.

A senior Democratic aide predicted the amendment would get upward of 60 votes in the 100-member chamber, more than enough to clear any procedural roadblocks.

A vote on passage of the bill is expected before the Senate departs at the end of next week for its Fourth of July holiday recess.

Backers are aiming for at least 70 votes on passage to increase pressure on the more resistant Republican-led House of Representatives to give the bill final congressional approval.

Republican John McCain, a member of the ""Gang of Eight"" senators who wrote the bipartisan bill, voiced doubt about the high cost of additional border security.

""I don't know if it's totally well spent,"" he said.

But McCain added, ""I think it's important that we do this to give people confidence that we have border security, so in that respect it's well spent.""

A leading conservative voice embraced the deal.

Republican Senator Marco Rubio, a Cuban-American lawmaker from Florida and another member of the Gang of Eight, said the deal was a ""dramatic improvement in border security"" during an interview on Fox News.

Rubio, touted as a possible 2016 presidential candidate, had hinged his support on improvements in border security. His endorsement is seen as crucial to winning conservative backing for the biggest changes in U.S. immigration law in a generation.

The proposal would double the overall number of U.S. border patrol agents, according to senior Senate Democratic aides.

That would mean assigning 21,000 new officers to the border with Mexico in an attempt to shut down illegal crossings by foreigners.

""I am now confident ... that the Senate will pass a strong, bipartisan immigration reform bill and that it will ultimately reach the desk of the president for his signature,"" Democratic Senator Charles Schumer of New York said.

The immigration bill, which is supported by President Barack Obama, currently calls for adding 3,500 Customs and Border Protection officers by 2017.

Besides doubling the number of border agents, the deal also calls for completing the construction of 700 miles of border fencing or walls, Senate aides said. About 650 miles have been built in one form or another, although some portions will have to be upgraded.

At an estimated price tag of about $40 billion to $50 billon, the amendment would represent a potentially massive investment of federal resources in securing the border at a time when conservatives are complaining about government outlays.

As originally written, the legislation called for about $6 billion in new border security spending.

CRITICS STILL UNHAPPY

Republican Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama mocked the deal even though he has called for tougher border enforcement. He noted that it was drafted after congressional analysts estimated the bill would trim illegal immigration by just 25 percent.

""The bill gets in trouble on the floor and they scurry around to get an amendment to throw 20,000 agents ... somewhere on the border in the future, we promise."" Sessions said, adding that such promises have been made in the past but not honored.

Sessions and other conservatives have pushed for delaying any pathway to citizenship for 11 million people until the government virtually eliminates illegal border crossings.

But the Senate repeatedly has repelled such attempts. On Thursday, it voted 54-43 to kill an amendment by Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the second-ranking Republican, which would have delayed permanent legal status for undocumented immigrants until the government met strict border enforcement goals.

On Tuesday, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the Senate's immigration bill would save the federal government nearly $900 billion over 20 years as illegal immigrants became legal, tax-paying residents.

A Democratic aide said those projected savings gave senators the leeway to craft such an expensive border security amendment.

House Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican who has promised to consider an immigration bill this year, told reporters the CBO deficit-reduction estimates, if ""anywhere close to being accurate, would be a real boon for the country.""

While the legislation authorizes the beefed-up security programs, it would be up to Congress in the future to appropriate the funding.

A Senate aide said the newly legalized residents would not get ""green cards"" allowing permanent resident status until the border security measures were in place.

Gaining permanent resident status would take 10 years under the bill, giving the federal government the time to deploy the added border officers and equipment.

Panetta concluded that the inability of the Obama administration to complete an agreement providing for an American military presence in Iraq after 2011 had deprived the United States of important political leverage in Iraq.

When the United States had troops in Iraq, the former defense secretary explained, the American commander and the ambassador in Baghdad “created a strong force” that could often dissuade the Iraqi prime minister, Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, from making “bad decisions” and “going off a cliff.”

But the withdrawal of the last complement of American forces in December 2011 reduced the ability of the United States to shape events there, he said.

Mr. Panetta’s views are contained in a report by Stuart W. Bowen Jr., the special inspector general for Iraq reconstruction. The post was established by Congress more than eight years ago, and the 171-page assessment on “Learning From Iraq” is its final major report.

Putin gets upper hand by giving Obama way out of military strike for now

White House tries to throw the ball back to Putin, saying he must deliver

Russians and Americans have been duking it out in the Twitter world over who's scoring more points in high-stakes diplomatic wrangling over Syria, U.S. President Barack Obama or Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Samantha Power, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, tweeted Thursday: ""Three days ago there seemed no diplomatic way to hold Assad accountable. Threat of U.S. action finally brought Russia to the table.""

In her tweet, Margarita Simonyan, head of Russia's English-language television network RT, quipped: ""If the Russian proposal on Syria works, Obama, as an honest man, has to give his Nobel Prize to Putin.""

Taking Syria's chemical weapons out of government control and preventing another horrendous attack on civilians is too serious an issue to reduce to political one-upmanship.

But after Putin's bombshell opinion piece in the New York Times in which, among other things, he takes America to task for an ""alarming"" pattern of intervening in the internal conflicts of foreign countries, it's obvious something has shifted.

""It absolutely is a diplomatic win by Putin right now,"" said Fiona Hill, expert on Putin and director of the Center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution.

""If we think about this as judo, which is of course Mr. Putin's favorite sport, this is just one set of moves,"" she said. ""And right now, he's managed to get Obama off the mat, at least, and get the terms set down that play to his advantage.""

Putin stopped Obama's drive for military action against Syria in its tracks this week as Russia's plan to put Syria's chemical weapons under international control pushes the action to the United Nations, just where Putin wants it.

Russia has veto power in the U.N. Security Council, and as Hill noted, it's an ""arena that they're really very skilled at, which is usually blocking other people from getting resolutions or moving forward.""

Putin's op-ed is not going down lightly in Washington. Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez said the piece made him almost want to throw up.

""Mr. Putin's personality has been widely demonized in the Western world, so anything that comes from Mr. Putin will be met not only with skepticism but a lot of people will reject just out of hand anything that Mr. Putin will say,"" said Dmitri Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Center.

""However, in this particular situation, when so many people are confused in the United States, in Europe, including in the political classes of Western countries, the arguments that Putin is making so clearly could be used in the domestic debate,"" he added.

Trenin thinks Putin ""is trying to insert himself and the Russian position into the debate that's now ongoing on Capitol Hill, within the U.S. more broadly, in the European countries. He does not want to leave the field to Westerners alone. He wants to have a voice in that discussion.""

Arguments Putin presents in his op-ed struck a chord with some in Washington, even if they dislike him.

One example: ""Syria is not witnessing a battle for democracy, but an armed conflict between government and opposition in a multi-religious country. There are few champions of democracy in Syria. But there are more than enough Qaeda fighters and extremists of all stripes battling the government.""

Other points, like his swipe at Obama's comment this week trumpeting American ""exceptionalism,"" are bound to irritate some of the Americans Putin is trying to sway.

Sen. James Inhofe, a Republican from Oklahoma, said Thursday that ""Putin was lecturing to the United States, and I could hear (Ronald) Reagan turning over in his grave as this was going on.""

Some Russians claim that Obama ""owes"" Putin for getting him out of a bind. Alexey Pushkov, chairman of the Russian State Duma Foreign Affairs Committee, tweeted tartly: ""Obama should be 'for' Russia's plan with two hands. It gives him a chance not to start a new war, not lose in the Congress, and not become another Bush,"" referring to his predecessor.

Hill said Putin did do Obama a favor.

""For Putin, being the old KGB guy, having someone owe him something is always to his advantage,"" she said.

""But this is more about a win for Russia here. Russia gets an imminent U.S. strike off the table for a while,"" Hill said.

The White House is trying to throw the ball back to Putin, cautioning that his chemical weapons proposal will boomerang if it doesn't work.

Putin ""now owns this. He has fully asserted ownership of it, and he needs to deliver,"" a senior White House official told CNN.

Strobe Talbott, president of the Brookings Institution and former deputy secretary of state in the Clinton administration, tweeted: ""If Kerry-Lavrov meeting exposes Russian proposal as sham, it will strengthen Obama's hand with Congress, assuring what Putin hopes to stop."""

HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) — Zimbabwe's electoral body said Tuesday that 94.5 percent of voters cast a ballot in favor of a new constitution that calls for a strengthening of human rights and a curb on presidential powers after a decade of political and economic turmoil in the southern African nation.

But as the results were announced African and international law organizations expressed outrage at the jailing for a third night of prominent rights lawyer Beatrice Mtetwa on charges that she allegedly obstructed justice.

""Her arrest is not just an attack on her profession but on the people of Zimbabwe who have just voted yes to a new constitution that enshrines fundamental human rights,"" said her lawyer, Thabani Mpofu.

A new constitution was a key demand of regional mediators who forged a shaky and acrimonious coalition between Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe and the former opposition leader, Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai, after the last violent and disputed national polls in 2008.

All main political parties had called for a ""Yes"" vote in the referendum.

Judge Rita Makarau, head of the state electoral commission, said Tuesday that just over 3 million Zimbabweans voted for the draft constitution and 170,489 voted against. Spoiled ballot papers were not factored in to the final results of votes cast by less than 50 percent of those eligible to vote in the referendum.

The 170-page draft constitution has now to be submitted to the Zimbabwe parliament for approval, a procedural formality, before President Mugabe is asked to sign it into law.

The draft limits the future presidential office to two five-year terms, a clause that is not retrospective. Mugabe, 89, who led the nation to independence in 1980, can rule for another two terms if his party wins upcoming five-yearly parliamentary and presidential polls.

The proposed constitution sets up the first Constitutional Court on citizens' grievances and a Peace and Reconciliation Commission to investigate political violence and human rights abuses blamed mainly on Mugabe's ZANU-PF party over the past decade of troubled polling and alleged vote-rigging.

Regional observers of Saturday's referendum said voting was free of violence except for minor scuffles between rival youth groups. The outcome of voting was seen as ""credible"" and reflecting the free will of electors.

But independent local monitoring groups reported that Mugabe party loyalists had taken down the names of voters emerging from some polling stations, a possible ploy used to threaten them in the crucial full scale elections.

Human rights groups say the new constitution does not immediately scrap sweeping media and security laws enforced by state institutions loyal to Mugabe, and that can only be done by a the next elected parliament.

The independent Research and Advocacy Unit said in its latest bulletin that reforms proposed in the new constitution ""will clearly take a much more energetic parliament than the one we have currently"" if they are to be implemented. The group said, ""Constitutions are not the panacea for all ills.""

The continued jailing of rights lawyer Mtetwa highlights how Mugabe's police and judicial system needs thorough reform, said lawyers.

Police brought her to court Tuesday after ignoring a judge's order to release her Monday.

Mtetwa, arrested Sunday while representing four officials of the prime minister's party who were being searched by police, arrived at the Harare magistrate's court in an open-back police truck. She greeted colleagues and activists with a spirited wave but was not allowed to speak to reporters.

Mtetwa's arrest was a ploy to stop her from defending officials of Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change party, her attorney argued in court Tuesday.

State prosecutors objected to bail for Mtetwa and the four MDC officials and court was adjourned to Wednesday.

Mtetwa was abused by the police in ""the high-handed manner in which they treated her by handcuffing her and throwing her into the back of an open truck as if she was a threat to police and national security,"" said her lawyer, Mpofu.

While in custody, police confiscated her mobile phone and went through it in breach of norms of attorney-client confidentiality, he said. He said when locked in a cell two male police officers at around midnight even tried to remove prison-issue blankets from her.

To the charge she shouted at police officers and attempted to prevent them from doing their duty, Mtetwa, in her written testimony, said she told the police she wanted to see their search warrants but was ignored.

""What you are doing is unlawful, unconstitutional and undemocratic,"" she told the officers, Mpofu said.

The police response was to arrest her, he said.

The refusal of police to obey a court order to release Mtetwa showed that Zimbabwe ""is a state that is prepared to act like an outlaw,"" Mpofu told the court.

Obstructing justice carries a maximum penalty of two years in prison.

Mtetwa has represented Tsvangirai and several of his top aides in past cases brought against them. She has also defended human rights defenders and journalists. She holds an array of international awards, including those from the American Bar Association and the main European Bar Human Rights body."

Kerry's visit marked the highest-level U.S. official trip to Egypt since former President Mohamed Morsy's ouster in July. And it came just a day before Morsy is expected to make his first court appearance as he stands trial on charges of inciting violence

After meeting with Foreign Minister Nabil Fahmy, Kerry pushed for reforms as he defended the U.S. decision to suspend hundreds of millions of dollars in assistance.

""It's not a punishment,"" Kerry said. ""It's a reflection of a policy in the United States under our law.""

The move was the culmination of months of debate within the Obama administration about how to respond to the coup that removed Morsy from power.

But on Sunday, Kerry described the aid as ""a very small issue.""

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/08/tpp-trade-agreement_n_4409211.html,2013-12-08 00:00:00,['Senior Reporter'],Obama Faces Backlash Over New Corporate Powers In Secret Trade Deal,"WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration appears to have almost no international support for controversial new trade standards that would grant radical new political powers to corporations, increase the cost of prescription medications and restrict bank regulation, according to two internal memos obtained by The Huffington Post.

The memos, which come from a government involved in the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade negotiations, detail continued disputes in the talks over the deal. The documents reveal broad disagreement over a host of key positions, and general skepticism that an agreement can be reached by year-end. The Obama administration has urged countries to reach a deal by New Year's Day, though there is no technical deadline.

One memo, which was heavily redacted before being provided to HuffPost, was written ahead of a new round of talks in Singapore this week. Read the full text of what HuffPost received here. (Note: Ellipses indicate redacted text. Text in brackets has been added by a third party.) Another document, a chart outlining different country positions on the text, dates from early November, before the round of negotiations in Salt Lake City, Utah. View the chart here. HuffPost was unable to determine which of the 11 non-U.S. nations involved in the talks was responsible for the memo.

""These are not U.S. documents and we have no idea of their authorship or authenticity,"" a spokesman for the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative said. ""Some elements in them are outdated, others totally inaccurate."" The spokesman declined to specify which parts were outdated or inaccurate.

The Obama administration has been leading negotiations on the international trade accord since 2010. The countries involved in the talks include Australia, Brunei, Chile, Canada, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam.

One of the most controversial provisions in the talks includes new corporate empowerment language insisted upon by the U.S. government, which would allow foreign companies to challenge laws or regulations in a privately run international court. Under World Trade Organization treaties, this political power to contest government law is reserved for sovereign nations. The U.S. has endorsed some corporate political powers in prior trade agreements, including the North American Free Trade Agreement, but the scope of what laws can be challenged appears to be much broader in TPP negotiations.

""The United States, as in previous rounds, has shown no flexibility on its proposal, being one of the most significant barriers to closing the chapter, since under the concept of Investment Agreement nearly all significant contracts that can be made between a state and a foreign investor are included,"" the memo reads. ""Only the U.S. and Japan support the proposal.""

Under NAFTA, companies including Exxon Mobil, Dow Chemical and Eli Lilly have attempted to overrule Canadian regulations on offshore oil drilling, fracking, pesticides, drug patents and other issues. Companies could challenge an even broader array of rules under the TPP language.

New standards concerning access to key medicines appear to be equally problematic for many nations. The Obama administration is insisting on mandating new intellectual property rules in the treaty that would grant pharmaceutical companies long-term monopolies on new medications. As a result, companies can charge high prices without regard to competition from generic providers. The result, public health experts have warned, would be higher prices around the world, and lack of access to life-saving drugs in poor countries. Nearly every intellectual property issue in the November chart is opposed by a broad majority of the 12 nations. The December memo describes 119 ""outstanding issues"" that remain unresolved between the nations on intellectual property matters. The deal would obligate nations to develop many standards similar to those in the United States, where domestic prescription drug prices are much higher than costs in other nations.

Also according to the December memo, the U.S. has reintroduced a proposal that would hamper government health services from negotiating lower drug prices with pharmaceutical companies. The proposal appears to have been universally rejected earlier in the talks, according to the memo.

Australia and New Zealand have medical boards that allow the government to reject expensive new drugs for the public health system, or negotiate lower prices with drug companies that own patents on them. If a new drug does not offer sufficient benefits over existing generic drugs, the boards can reject spending taxpayer money on the new medicines. They can also refuse to pay high prices for new drugs. The Obama administration has been pushing to ban these activities by national boards, which would lock in big profits for U.S. drug companies. Obamacare sought to mimic the behavior of these boards to lower domestic health care costs by granting new flexibilities to U.S. state agencies for determining drug prices.

The U.S. is also facing major resistance on bank regulation standards. The Obama administration is seeking to curtail the use of ""capital controls"" by foreign governments. These can include an extremely broad variety of financial tools, from restricting lending in overheated markets to denying mass international outflows of currency during a financial panic. The loss of these tools would dramatically limit the ability of governments to prevent and stem banking crises.

""The positions are still paralyzed,"" the December memo reads, referring to the Financial Services Chapter. ""The United States shows zero flexibility.""

Previously leaked TPP documents have sparked alarm among global health experts, Internet freedom activists, environmentalists and organized labor, but are adamantly supported by American corporations and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The Obama administration has deemed negotiations to be classified information -- banning members of Congress from discussing the American negotiating position with the press or the public. Congressional staffers have been restricted from viewing the documents.

This story has been updated with a comment from the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, and to specify that prescription drug flexibilities under Obamacare are provided to state boards."

Archibold', 'Eric Schmitt']",U.S. Stepped In to Halt Mexican General’s Rise,"The devastating death toll has Mr. Peña Nieto, 46, a former governor, promising to move his country’s fight against organized crime in a different direction, focusing more on reducing violence than on detaining drug kingpins. But he has so far offered only vague details of his security plans, focusing instead on social and economic programs.

While Mr. Peña Nieto portrays himself as the leader of a new generation of reformers, he is also a scion of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which ruled Mexico for more than 70 years through a combination of corruption and coercion until it lost power in 2000. During its time in power, the party was known more for keeping the United States at arm’s length while attempting to strike deals with drug traffickers, rather than combating them head on.

Mr. Peña Nieto’s election has brought the PRI back to power, and since so many of those serving in his cabinet have one foot in the past, foreign policy experts who specialize in Mexico say it is not clear where the new government is headed.

“It could go either way,” said Eric L. Olson of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, speaking of future cooperation between Mexico and the United States. “Part of me says, ‘Let’s not assume it’s all going to go south.’ And there are things that are happening that give me hope. But the longer it goes without some clarity, the more doubts creep in.”

Those doubts have also crept to Capitol Hill. Senator Patrick J. Leahy, a Democrat from Vermont who sits on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said he was withholding nearly $230 million in security assistance to Mexico through the so-called Merida Initiative amid concerns about whether the fight against organized crime is doing more harm than good.

“Congress has been asked for a significant new investment, but it’s not clear what the Mexican government’s plans are,” Mr. Leahy said. “It’s premature to sign off on more of the same.”

General García Ochoa, 61, whose background is at once exemplary and enigmatic, personifies that quandary. On paper, he is a model officer. He earned two advanced degrees from Mexico’s most prestigious military academies, and founded the elite National Center for Counter-Narcotics Intelligence. He has been a student and an instructor in American military training programs. He has written three books, including one on the military’s role in the drug fight."

Story highlights A report says Honduran officials have ceded control of prisons to inmates In one prison, the division between prisoners and guards is known as ""the line of death"" Investigators describe large bazaars with food, household goods for sale Honduran President Porfirio Lobo sends troops into one prison after clashes erupt

(CNN) —

They hand out food, issue fines, punish offenders and have their own set of keys.

It sounds like a guard’s job. But in prisons throughout Honduras, a new report says, it’s the inmates who are in charge.

“Internal control of the prisons has been ceded into the hands of the prisoners themselves,” the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights said in a report released last week, claiming the situation has spread through all 24 of the nation’s prisons and is one of the most serious problems the country faces.

The Honduran government doesn’t deny it.

As he ordered troops into one prison after clashes erupted there on Saturday, President Porfirio Lobo called it an “unacceptable situation” and acknowledged that a “reign of crime from within” plagues the country’s prison system.

At a meeting on Monday, he said, government security officials will present proposals to end the criminal reign.

In the meantime, prisoners are reportedly running facilities throughout the country. And last week’s report from the Organization of American States’ commission details how they do it.

’The line of death’

In a massive prison in the world’s murder capital, a painted yellow mark on the ground separates the inmates from the guards.

They call the line in the prison in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, “the line of death,” according to the human rights report.

“The prison guards know that they must not cross into the yard … without the authorization of the inmates, while the inmates refuse to leave the external perimeter in police custody,” the report says.

There are two padlocks on the prison gate, the report says. The guards lock the outside, and the inmates lock the inside.

The situation is simple, one prison official told investigators.

Authorities, the official said, “have no power to change anything.”

In one cell, decorations and wood-paneled walls

Inside one cell in another prison, investigators from the human rights commission said they saw a sight that stood out from the typically squalid conditions: varnished, wood-paneled walls.

The inmate had a private toilet, a large bed, a remote-controlled air conditioning unit and his own TV.

Why? He was what’s known as a “coordinator” – a key figure in the prison hierarchy.

According to the report, his responsibilities include: applying disciplinary punishment; setting the prices inmates pay to live in cells; distributing and setting food prices; and resolving conflicts that emerge during daily prison life.

“Above all,” the report says, “the ‘coordinators’ serve as spokesmen or liaisons with the prison authorities, and are really privileged prisoners who exercise a degree of decision-making power within the prisons, often sharing the benefits with the prison authorities.”

Prison marketplaces

Inside many of the nation’s prisons, inmates buy and sell food, clothes and household items in unregulated marketplaces, the report says.

The system has serious consequences, the report argues, including promoting corruption and allowing illicit goods to enter the facility.

In San Pedro Sula, for example, the prison yard houses a large bazaar.

According to the report, there are “barbers’ shops, cafeterias, bakeries, sales of fruit and food of all kinds, sales of medications and cloth, tailoring workshops, a cobbler’s shop, a leather workshop, carpentry, a cabinetmaker’s workshop, crafts, manufacture of mirrors, billiard tables, games tables and many soft drink dispensing machines.”

A necessary evil?

Throughout the human rights investigators’ trip to Honduras, officials described self-government in the prisons as a “necessary evil,” the report says.

“This system, as was observed, is accepted by the prison authorities as the only viable way of maintaining order and stability between them and the prison populations, and the ‘coordinators’ are considered collaborators and even allies of the authorities.

But authorities have also acknowledged that the widespread prisoner control of facilities has played a major role in contributing to corruption in the prison system.

A year after deadly prison fire, questions remain

The human rights report’s revelations come more than a year after a deadly prison fire in Honduras cast a global spotlight on prison conditions there.

At the time, analysts said prison overcrowding likely contributed to the massive death toll of the February 2012 fire in Comayagua, Honduras, which claimed more than 360 lives. It’s a problem groups like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have condemned.

Overcrowding remains rampant, the report says, with outdated facilities housing far more inmates than they were designed to hold.

The report lists “the lack of appropriate, safe physical installations, deplorable health and hygiene conditions, failure to provide adequate food and drinking water and the lack of adequate medical care” as significant concerns.

The report notes that “grave deficiencies…led to the death of the victims of the fire,” including overcrowding, fire hazards and no signs for evacuation routes.

And 18 months after the blaze, the government still hasn’t given a clear explanation of what happened, the report says.

“One of the hypotheses that the commission ask to be studied was the possible presence of criminal hands in the tragedy … and really we see that there has not been up to now an investigation that has reached results proportionate to the duty of the state to investigate,” said Rodrigo Escobar Gil, a prisoner rights rapporteur for the commission.

In one prison, shots ring out and troops take over

After 15 people were injured and three people were killed during clashes at a National Penitentiary prison in Tamara, Honduras, on Saturday, Honduras’ president said he was sending in troops to take over.

In a written statement, his office said that the government has taken steps to disarm prisoners and instituted other security measures at prisons nationwide. But they haven’t been able to stop the “criminal reign” within prisons, the statement.

Last week’s report lists a series of recommendations for the Honduran government. Among them: reducing overcrowding, improving safety and taking back control from prisoners.

Honduran officials have said they accept the human rights commission’s report and are pledging to reform the prison system.

“The panorama that the commission has exposed is the absolute truth,” said Jose Augusto Avila, coordinator of the country’s Penitentiary System Transition Commission. “We cannot deny it.”

Editor’s Note: Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, whom The Washington Post calls “the most famous rabbi in America,” is the author of the soon-to-be-published “Kosher Lust: Love is Not the Answer.” Follow him on Twitter @rabbiShmuley and on Facebook.

(CNN) —

Twenty-five years ago, nearly to the day, I arrived at Oxford University with my wife of six months to become the first rabbi in residence in decades. I had just turned 22. My mandate was simple: Deepen Jewish identity among the Jewish students and cultivate values-based leadership among the students at large.

What I never expected to be my mission, but what eventually became central to everything I did, was defending Israel against ferocious and unjust assault.

I quickly discovered that universities in general, and elite universities in particular, are breeding grounds for anti-Israel bias. We beat back many attempts over 11 years to slander Israel as an expansionist, neo-colonialist power and succeeded in portraying the true nature of the Middle East’s only democracy. We hosted six Israeli prime ministers and countless other eloquent defenders of the Jewish state.

But since I returned to the United States, the situation among academics has only become worse.

Shmuley Boteach

Just after Pink Floyd’s Roger Waters compared Israel to Nazi Germany, we have the American Studies Association, comprising about 5,000 academics, voting to boycott Israeli academic institutions. The group is refusing all collaborations with universities, although not individual scholars.

The reason, members say, is Israel’s human rights abuses against Palestinians and the occupation.

Opposing view: Boycott a sting to Israeli apartheid

The ASA has not boycotted any other country in a similar way. Not, say, China, which regularly jails political dissidents for lengthy sentences and commits them to near-slave labor without any judicial process. Liu Xiaobo, who won the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize, is serving an 11-year sentence on fraudulent subversion charges. His wife, Liu Xia, has been held incommunicado under house arrest for three years even though she has never been charged.

So why would Israel, a thriving liberal democracy that guarantees the right of due process to all of its citizens, including minorities, be singled out?

If you argue that the reason is Israel’s “occupation” of Arab lands, the American Studies Association is surely aware of China’s brutal occupation of Tibet since 1950. China faces no existential threat. It does not have terrorists blowing up schools and buses and does not have a neighbor building a nuclear bomb threatening to annihilate it. Israel, by contrast, has all of these things.

Israel has been under the threat of extermination by its Arab neighbors for six decades, has lost countless citizens to terrorism and has a nuclear-inclined Iran threatening to wipe it off the map. Surely a group of scholars would understand the unique security situation facing a nation that has suffered a genocide of 6 million people just 70 years ago.

So why Israel?

That’s your reason? One has to start somewhere and that somewhere just happens to be, yet again, the Jews? Shmuley Boteach

According to an article in the New York Post, ASA President Curtis Marez said that his group singled out Israel, knowing that many of Israel’s neighbors have worse human rights abuses, because “one has to start somewhere.”

At Oxford, I had the privilege of hosting and debating some of the world’s leading intellectuals. Never before have I read a more inane quote from a man claiming to be a scholar.

That’s your reason? One has to start somewhere and that somewhere just happens to be, yet again, the Jews?

If it’s a matter of choosing a place to start, you could draw straws or perhaps throw dice or pull names from a hat. So, a group of academics just decided it was time to boycott some country and decided, arbitrarily, that Israel was as good as any?

This isn’t even a case of anti-Semitism so much as buffoonery, not a case of prejudice so much as stupidity.

Let’s state the real facts.

Israel is the Middle East’s only democracy, guaranteeing a free press and the right to worship, as well as the rights of women and homosexuals. Although the Arab nations that surround Israel commit unspeakable human rights violations every day, Israel struggles under existential threat to balance its security needs with the freedoms it cherishes.

The 1995 interim agreement says, “Israel and [the Palestinians] will ensure that their respective educational systems contribute to the peace between the Israeli and Palestinian peoples.” Yet Palestinian schools teach hatred of Israel. A U.S. government report finds that 84% of the references to Israelis in Palestinian textbooks are negative.

Palestinian universities promote extremism. In 2007, the Washington Institute reported in an article called “Teaching Terror” that university campuses are full of Hamas propaganda. Israel has roadblocks and builds fences solely because it got tired of seeing its citizens blown to smithereens.

Calling for an academic boycott of Israel for the steps it takes to defend itself is akin to calling for an academic boycott of Britain and the United States during World War II. And, mind you, Israel has never even come close to indiscriminately bombing civilian population centers the way the allies did in that war. Israel takes great care to protect the lives of innocent civilians even as it fights genocidal terror organizations Hamas and Hezbollah.

We Americans who cherish freedom, democracy and liberty should be ashamed that a group of our nation’s “scholars” have so viciously maligned a most humane nation.

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad.

Story highlights The move comes less than a week after legislation was introduced in the U.S. Senate U.S., others believe Iran is attempting to build a bomb through uranium enrichment Tehran says its nuclear intentions are peaceful

(CNN) —

Iranian lawmakers have drafted a bill that would force the government to enrich uranium up to 60% if new sanctions are imposed, state media reported Wednesday.

The move comes less than a week after bipartisan legislation was introduced in the U.S. Senate that would authorize new economic sanctions on Iran if it breaches an interim agreement to limit its nuclear program or fails to strike a final accord terminating those ambitions.

“If the bill is approved, the government will be obliged to complete nuclear infrastructure at Fordo and Natanz (facilities) if sanctions (against Iran) are ratcheted up, new sanctions are imposed, the country’s nuclear rights are violated and the Islamic Republic of Iran’s peaceful nuclear rights are ignored by members of P5+1,” state-run Press TV reported lawmaker Seyyed Mehdi Mousavinejad said. The so-called P5+1 is the United States, Britain, China, Russia, France and Germany.

The draft bill was signed by 100 legislators, Press TV said.

A six-month agreement struck in November among the United States, other world powers and Iran calls for Tehran to start limiting its nuclear activities in return for a relaxation of sanctions that have crippled its economy.

Talks are under way on a permanent agreement, and the outcome is uncertain.

The Senate proposal emerged despite Obama administration appeals for Congress to defer pursuing new sanctions with diplomatic efforts ongoing.

The White House said new sanctions would undermine those delicate efforts on the global stage and President Barack Obama would veto the legislation if Congress were to approve it now.

The proposal would give Obama more than a year to engage in further diplomacy before any new sanctions would kick in against Iran’s oil exports and other key areas of its economy.

Sanctions would hit sooner if Iran cheats on the interim deal or fails to reach a final accord.

The Obama administration has said the centerpiece of its policy is for Iran to not achieve a nuclear weapon.

The United States and other western powers believe Iran is attempting to build a bomb through uranium enrichment. But Tehran says its nuclear intentions are peaceful.

The waiver will make it easier for some undocumented spouses to remain here until reforms pass

Another change directs officers to focus on arresting%2C deporting immigrants with criminal backgrounds

Third change allows young illegals brought here as children to apply to live%2C work here temporarily

SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. — Hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants in the United States will have an easier time gaining legal status because of a policy change from President Barack Obama's administration.

The change takes effect March 4 and is aimed at undocumented immigrants married to U.S. citizens, such as Xochitl Hernandez, 33, who came to the U.S. illegally 14 years ago and now lives in this Phoenix suburb.

Soon, Hernandez and other undocumented immigrants married to U.S. citizens will be able to apply for a special waiver instead of having to leave the country and face tough penalties before obtaining their legal papers through a U.S. citizen spouse.

""This is really good news for me,"" said Hernandez, who has two daughters who are U.S. citizens, one with a severe physical disability. ""I no longer will have to worry about going outside the country and being separated from my babies.""

It is one of several major immigration-policy changes from the Obama administration in the past two years. The changes are intended to provide protection from deportation to undocumented immigrants with clean records and long ties to this country until Congress passes permanent immigration reforms.

The change also could have long-term political implications. Immigrant advocates have hailed the measure, and it could help boost Obama's popularity with the growing numbers of Latino and Asian voters as Congress gears up to address the long-simmering issue of immigration reform later this year.

However, some say the waiver change could make it harder for the president to negotiate a compromise with conservative Republicans, who view it as an end-run around Congress and a form of amnesty for illegal immigrants.

The Obama administration announced the waiver change in January 2012 and finalized it earlier this month.

Critics of the change are concerned that allowing undocumented immigrants to apply for waivers within the U.S. could invite marriage fraud and weaken long-standing penalties intended to discourage illegal immigration.

Under the change, undocumented immigrants married to U.S. citizens will be able to apply for a special provisional waiver from within the United States to avoid a 10-year ban from coming back to the U.S. as punishment for having lived here illegally for more than a year.

The 10-year ban was put into place as part of a 1996 law intended to discourage illegal immigration.

Hernandez and her husband, Richard Hernandez, 37, met at a restaurant where they worked as cooks. He is a U.S. citizen born in this country.

They married nine years ago. As the spouse of a U.S. citizen, Xochitl Hernandez is eligible to apply for legal permanent residency, known as a green card. But because she entered the U.S. illegally, she is first required to return to Mexico, her home country, to go through the interview process at the U.S. Consulate in Juarez.

But leaving the United States would have triggered the 10-year penalty.

Hernandez thinks she has a good shot at qualifying for a waiver because her two daughters, Karyne, 8, and Alexa, 3, both were born in this country, making them citizens.

To receive the waiver, Hernandez will have to prove that her separation would cause extreme hardship to a U.S. citizen family member.

Hernandez said her oldest daughter was born with a turned-in foot that limits her ability to walk and requires special care. Hernandez said she has to drive her daughter to and from school as well as to weekly therapy sessions and regular medical appointments.

In the past, Hernandez would have had to apply for the waiver in Mexico.

But her lawyer, Delia Salvatierra, told her that it could have taken up to a year for the waiver to be approved. And if the waiver were denied, Hernandez would have had to wait 10 years before re-entering the U.S. legally.

Until now, she figured she was better off remaining in the U.S. illegally than being separated from her family for a year or longer.

Under the new policy, Hernandez still will have to prove the 10-year ban would cause extreme hardship to her daughter. But now she will be able to apply for the waiver without having to leave the U.S.

If the waiver is approved, Hernandez would be able to return to Mexico with the waiver to go through the green-card interview process in Juarez.

Instead of a year or longer, she likely will have to wait less than two weeks to receive her green card, allowing her to return to the United States legally as a permanent resident, her lawyer said.

Focusing on families

Obama administration officials say the main goal is to prevent the long separation of families as undocumented immigrants try to legalize their status through a U.S. citizen spouse or parent.

""This new process facilitates the legal immigration process and reduces long periods of separation between U.S. citizens and their immediate relatives,"" Alejandro Mayorkas, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services director, said in a statement.

Department of Homeland Security officials have no estimate of how many undocumented immigrants may benefit from the change in the waiver policy.

But Muzaffar Chishti, director of the Migration Policy Institute's office at New York University, said hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants will more easily be able to become permanent residents as a result of the policy change.

The nonprofit research center in the District of Columbia proposed the change before the Obama administration implemented it.

""It's a big deal in many ways,"" Chishti said. ""It does open up the possibility for people to apply for the waivers who may have been reluctant to in the past"" because they didn't want to be separated from their families.

Critics say the waiver change shields undocumented immigrants from the penalties Congress put in place 17 years ago to discourage illegal immigration and punish illegal immigrants who have lived in the U.S. for more than a year. Even if they were denied, undocumented immigrants still would likely avoid the 10-year ban because they won't have to leave the country to apply.

What's more, Department of Homeland Security officials say they don't plan to go after undocumented immigrants denied waivers.

""It's allowing people to avoid this penalty,"" said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies for the Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington-based group that favors increased immigration enforcement and reducing overall immigration.

Vaughan said she also thinks the waiver change could lead to more marriage fraud because it will be easier for undocumented immigrants who marry U.S. citizens to avoid the 10-year ban.

She also is concerned that the government, under pressure to process an increase in waiver applications, will give less scrutiny to undocumented immigrants applying for green cards through U.S. citizen spouses.

""I think there is pretty high likelihood they are going to be rubber-stamped,"" she said.

The future of reform

The waiver change is one of three Obama administration immigration-policy changes to make it easier for certain undocumented immigrants to remain in the United States until Congress passes permanent reforms, Chishti said.

Another change directs Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers to focus on arresting and deporting illegal immigrants with criminal backgrounds over those with clean records and long ties here.

The third change is the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which allows young undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children to apply to live in this country and work temporarily without the threat of deportation. As of Dec. 16, more than 367,903 young undocumented immigrants have applied for deferred action since the government began accepting applications Aug. 15.

Chishti said the waiver change ultimately could help Democrats in the 2016 presidential election by making it easier for undocumented immigrants married to U.S. citizens to get permanent residence.

That could result in an increase in the number of Latino and Asian voters because permanent residents married to U.S. citizens are eligible to apply for naturalization after three years, Chishti said.

He pointed out that Latinos and Asians voted overwhelmingly for Obama in the November election.

""This (waiver change) has much more of a political payoff"" than the other policy changes, he said.

Chishti said Obama's re-election has motivated Republican leaders in Congress to pass immigration reforms that include a legalization program to avoid turning Latino voters into ""permanent Democrats.""

However, Vaughan of the Center for Immigration Studies thinks the waiver change could backfire by making it harder for Obama to negotiate an immigration-reform deal with Republicans, especially in the House, where immigration reform faces more of an uphill battle than in the Senate.

""Every time he abuses his authority, he is making House Republicans less open to working with him,"" Vaughan said. ""I think that is kind of poisoning the atmosphere for a compromise approach. He is burning bridges.""

Meanwhile, Hernandez is busy preparing her paperwork so she can apply for the waiver in March, and after that, her green card.

""I feel very happy because I can see the time coming when I will have my papers in hand,"" she said.

On Wednesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Iran has continued to develop its nuclear program, even after the election of Hassan Rouhani, whom he has labeled a “wolf in sheep’s clothing.”

“The president of Iran is trying to present a new image to the West, but advances in the nuclear program continue,” Netanyahu said during a visit to proposed new military bases in the Negev desert. “He tells us no threats will help. But the truth is that the only thing in the last 20 years that has helped stop Iran’s nuclear program were pressures and the explicit threats of military action.”

On Tuesday, Rouhani, in his first news conference since his inauguration Sunday, said Iran would not respond to threats. The new Iranian president said Iran was prepared to enter serious nuclear talks with the West, including with the United States, but would not respond to pressure tactics.

Rouhani, a former chief nuclear negotiator for Tehran, took some pointed shots at Israel’s influence in Washington without mentioning Israel specifically.

“Unfortunately, the war-mongering lobby in the U.S. is opposed to constructive [talks] and only protects the interests of the foreign regime, and often receives orders from that regime,” Rouhani told reporters in Tehran on Tuesday. “The interests of the lobby and the foreign regime have been imposed on the American lawmakers. We see that they even ignore U.S. interests.”

The change in Iran’s leadership has been a major source of concern in Israel.

Believed to be the Middle East’s only nuclear-armed power, Israel has long threatened to take military action to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear bomb. But Netanyahu had toned down the rhetoric over the past six months.

But Rouhani’s election seems to have reinvigorated Israel’s campaign to rally international focus on Iran by threatening to take unilateral miliary action.

On Tuesday, an unnamed senior Israeli official told Israel Radio that Netanyahu’s government was losing faith in the Obama administration’s promise to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. The official cited America’s cautious approach to dealing with Syria’s alleged use of chemical weapons and said Israel cannot bank on U.S. assurances.

The official added that Israel was still capable of launching a military operation against Iran without U.S. operational support, although he acknowledged it would be less effective than a U.S. strike.

At the same time, the former head of Israel Defense Forces intelligence -- who has previously spoken out against a unilateral Israeli strike -- said Wednesday that U.S. resistance to an Israeli attack may be softening.

Amos Yadlin, director of the Institute for National Security Studies, a Tel Aviv think tank, told Army Radio on Wednesday that he detected a “different music” from Washington on the matter. If in 2012 the U.S. maintained “the brightest red light” on an Israeli strike, now it hasn’t perhaps changed to green, “but it’s definitely yellow.”

U.S. officials have not publicly signaled any change in their opposition to an Israeli strike, which many fear could prompt a regional war.

Netanyahu and others have voiced concern that Rouhani’s restrained image — a stark contrast from the provocative style of his predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad — could result in a lessening of international pressure on Iran.

“Instead of leaders easy for the world to hate, now there are leaders wearing three-piece suits and a Hermes tie,” former Israeli Gen. Yoav Galant told Israel Radio on Tuesday. “But [they are] still extreme beneath a refined exterior.”

Christiane Amanpour interviews Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on AC360, tonight 8 p.m. ET

(CNN) —

Iran is prepared to engage in nuclear talks and nuclear weapons have no place in his country’s security, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said Tuesday.

In a speech at the U.N. General Assembly, he said that Iran would be willing to “engage immediately in time-bound and result-oriented talks to build mutual confidence and removal of mutual uncertainties.”

“Nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction have no place in Iran’s security and defense doctrine, and contradict our fundamental religious and ethical convictions,” Rouhani said.

He decried international sanctions against Iran.

“Sanctions, beyond any and all rhetoric, cause belligerence, war-mongering and human suffering,” he said.

“Iran seeks to resolve problems, not to create them,” Rouhani said, pushing for the “rejection of violence and extremism.”

Alongside fears facing the world, there are “new hopes,” he said. “The hope of universal acceptance and the elite all across the globe of yes to peace and no to war. And the hope of preference of dialogue over conflict, and moderation over extremism.”

Striking a conciliatory tone, Rouhani said that Iran “does not seek to increase tensions with the United States.”

Rouhani said he listened carefully to U.S. President Barack Obama’s speech and hoped that the United States “will refrain from following the short-sighted interests of warmongering pressure groups” so that the two nations “can arrive at a framework to manage our differences.”

Earlier Tuesday, two senior administration officials said that Obama and Rouhani wouldn’t be shaking hands or meet on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly.

Such an encounter proved too complicated for Iran back home, the officials told reporters.

Both presidents spoke on the first day of the annual gathering of world leaders in New York. Obama made clear in his morning remarks that the United States was committed to preventing Iran from developing a nuclear weapon.

“We will not tolerate the development or use of weapons of mass destruction,” he said.

At the same time, Obama welcomed what he called positive signals from Iran that it was ready to negotiate with the international community on how it can develop a peaceful use of nuclear power without creating any weapons.

“We are not seeking regime change, and we respect the right of the Iranian people to access peaceful nuclear energy,” Obama said. “Instead, we insist that the Iranian government meet its responsibilities under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and U.N. Security Council resolutions.”

He noted that Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued a fatwa against the development of nuclear weapons, and Rouhani “just recently reiterated that the Islamic Republic will never develop a nuclear weapon.”

“These statements made by our respective governments should offer the basis for a meaningful agreement,” Obama said, adding that “to succeed, conciliatory words will have to be matched by actions that are transparent and verifiable.”

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu welcomed those comments, but said that his country “will not be fooled by half-measures that merely provide a smokescreen for Iran’s continual pursuit of nuclear weapons.”

“Iran thinks that soothing words and token actions will enable it to continue on its path to the bomb. Like North Korea before it, Iran will try to remove sanctions by offering cosmetic concessions, while preserving its ability to rapidly build a nuclear weapon at a time of its choosing,” Netanyahu said.

Secretary of State John Kerry will join his Iranian counterpart, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, at a Thursday meeting of the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, plus Germany. Discussions will surround restarting talks on Iran’s nuclear program.

One European Union official expressed optimism over the chance for concrete progress.

“In terms of whether we’re on the verge of a breakthrough, I would put it like this: I was struck as I said by the energy and determination the foreign minister demonstrated to me,” said Catherine Ashton, high representative for foreign affairs and security policy of the European Union.

But no one is expecting an overnight solution to Iran’s alleged effort to build a nuclear weapon, an effort Tehran has so far denied, insisting its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes.

“The roadblocks may prove to be too great, but I firmly believe the diplomatic path must be tested,” Obama said.

Iran president brings ‘charm offensive’ to U.N.

Syria a point of contention

Iran’s recent overtures signaling cooperation, though, likely stop short at the topics of Palestine and Syria. Iran is Syria’s closest ally in the region.

In his speech Tuesday, Rouhani blasted what he described as the “structural violence” against Palestinians. While he never mentioned U.S. ally Israel by name, the intention of his comments was clear.

“Palestine is under occupation; the basic rights of the Palestinians are tragically violated, and they are deprived of the right of return and access to their homes, birthplace and homeland,” he said. “Apartheid as a concept can hardly describe the crimes and the institutionalized aggression against the innocent Palestinian people.”

On Syria, he said that the common objective of the international community regarding that country “should be a quick end of the killing of the innocent.”

“We defend peace based on democracy and the ballot box everywhere, including in Syria, Bahrain and other countries in the region, and believe that there are no violent solutions to world crises,” Rouhani said.

“While condemning any use of chemical weapons, we welcome Syria’s acceptance of the Chemical Weapons Convention,” he said, stressing that extremists’ access to chemical weapons was the “greatest danger to the region.”

Syria is under U.S.-led pressure to give up its chemical weapons arsenal in the aftermath of the August 21 attack on suburban Damascus that Washington and its allies blame on the al-Assad regime.

Obama said Tuesday that Syria’s use of chemical weapons tested the relevance of the United Nations in the modern world, and he rejected contentions by the al-Assad regime and its main ally, Russia, that rebel forces were responsible for the attack.

“It is an insult to human reason – and to the legitimacy of this institution – to suggest that anyone other than the regime carried out this attack,” Obama said.

Russia has blocked U.S. efforts to secure a strong Security Council resolution authorizing possible military force if Syria fails to comply with international regulations on turning over its chemical stockpiles. Obama argued Tuesday that such a resolution was vital.

“There must be a strong Security Council resolution to verify that the Assad regime is keeping its commitments, and there must be consequences if they fail to do so,” he said. “If we cannot agree even on this, then it will show that the U.N. is incapable of enforcing the most basic of international laws. On the other hand, if we succeed, it will send a powerful message that the use of chemical weapons has no place in the 21st century, and that this body means what it says.”

At the same time, Obama announced an additional $340 million in U.S. aid “to meet humanitarian needs in Syria and surrounding countries,” referring to war refugees and other victims. The additional money increases the total U.S. commitment in humanitarian aid to $1.3 billion.

But Farah Atassi, activist with the opposition Syrian National Coalition, said Obama did not go far enough.

“The president did not address the core issue behind the Syrian crisis, which is holding the Assad regime accountable” – including for its use of conventional weapons, she said in a CNN interview. More than 100,000 people have died in the conflict, the vast majority from conventional weapons, according to U.N. figures.

Obama is letting Syria’s ally Russia lead, she said. “We don’t trust the Russians.”

“We want the U.S. to step forward and take the leadership right now to push for Assad to step down and allow for a transitional government from the opposition.”

Emphasizing that the opposition has not asked for “boots on the ground,” Atassi said U.S. military action should remain “on the table.” And, she said, the rebels are looking to Washington for help empowering moderate elements of the opposition.

“We are not terrorists,” she said.

Militant groups make up part of the Syrian opposition.

In his remarks to open the General Assembly on Tuesday, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called for the Syrian government to “fully and quickly” honor its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention, which calls for turning over control of its stockpiles.

Ban also appealed to all sides to stop supplying any weapons to all parties in the Syrian civil war while urging both the Syrian government and the opposition to respect international humanitarian law.

Russia and Iran, as well as Hezbollah in Lebanon, are providing military backing to the al-Assad regime while the United States and some European allies have started supplying light arms to rebel fighters.

Meanwhile, U.N. weapons inspectors will be back in Syria on Wednesday to assess at least six claims of chemical weapons use in Syria by the regime or rebels, a spokesman for Ban said Tuesday.

Al-Assad hinted at potential trouble for inspectors coming into Syria, saying other countries may order terrorists to attack them.

“Those militants might want to stop (the) experts’ arrival. We know that those terrorists are under the control of some countries,” he said in an interview Sunday with Chinese television. “And those countries may encourage the terrorists to stop experts from arrival, so that they could accuse the Syrian government for violating the agreement.”

Despite al-Assad’s veiled threat, positive progress has been made on the Syrian chemical weapons deal brokered by the United States and Russia in Geneva. Over the weekend, the United States said it was pleasantly surprised by the extent of Syria’s initial declaration of its chemical weapons stockpile reported to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.

The United States is pushing for a U.N. Security Council resolution this week in New York to enforce the Geneva deal.

Brazil outrage over U.S. surveillance

Obama faced criticism Tuesday from Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff, who used her U.N. speech to call allegations of U.S. surveillance of her country “totally unacceptable.”

Rousseff referred to classified leaks by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden that made public how the U.S. government had access to phone and Internet records, including foreign information.

She said the U.S. surveillance intercepted private details of Brazilian citizens and businesses, along with “communications by Brazilian diplomatic representation offices, including the permanent mission of Brazil with the United Nations and even the very presidency of the republic of Brazil.”

“Meddling in such a manner in the life and affairs of other countries is a breach of international law and such is an affrontment to the principles that should otherwise govern relations among countries, especially among friendly nations,” she said, adding Brazil would propose U.N. action intended to prevent the manipulation of cyberspace as “a weapon of war.”

Because of the surveillance controversy, Rousseff postponed a state visit to Washington that had been planned for next month. The White House said the postponement was a joint decision.

But only Jimmy Kimmel brought in a sign language expert to translate exactly what Jantjie was saying to the crowds.

Justin Maurer -- who has signed for some of “Jimmy Kimmel Live’s” concerts, including Hanson -- stood onstage next to Kimmel and watched clips of Jantjie doing his thing and attempted to relate what was actually being said. Sure enough, it had no relation to the words that were coming out of the speakers’ mouths.

“I support basic salutations here salutations,” Mauer translated while watching a clip of Mandela’s great-granddaughter Phumla Mandela. “Inside joining in this week’s cigarette inside to prove and on and on. To support, I would please to say from me to you. Talking to you so far.”

Mauer explained to Kimmel: “It’s complete gibberish.”

“In your opinion, does this guy know sign language at all?” Kimmel asked.

“No, not at all,” Mauer said.

Jantjie has subsequently defended himself, telling the Johannesburg newspaper the Star that he suffers from schizophrenia and started hearing voices and hallucinating while on stage. It was because of those hallucinations, he said, that he made the nonsense gestures.

WHEN asked to explain why he was running for a seat in the Australian Senate while holed up in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London, Julian Assange quoted Plato: “One of the penalties for refusing to participate in politics is that you end up being governed by your inferiors.”

Plato was “a bit of a fascist,” he said, but had a point.

Imagine the chagrin Mr. Assange must feel now, given that not only did he fail to win a place in the Senate in the recent election, but he was less successful than Ricky Muir from the Motoring Enthusiasts Party. Mr. Muir, who won just 0.5 percent of the vote, is most famous for having posted a video on YouTube of himself having a kangaroo feces fight with friends.

Mr. Assange, who was born and raised in Australia, has radically redefined publishing and provoked an unprecedented global debate about state secrets by subverting established practices and common wisdoms.

It seems odd, then, that his bid for political power, carried out in his absence by the WikiLeaks Party, was drowned by the greatest and most conventional of clichés: power corrupts. His campaign was saddled with the usual backbiting, arguing, dysfunction and even leaks."

USA TODAY

From White House spokesman Jay Carney:

""President Obama and the First Lady will go to South Africa next week to pay their respects to the memory of Nelson Mandela and to participate in memorial events. We'll have further updates on timing and logistics as they become available.""

Officials have held off on a detailed announcement as travel plans, logistics, and security are worked out; services for Mandela will be part of a mourning period in South Africa that will last about 10 days.

The South African government has scheduled the state funeral for Dec. 15, a week from Sunday. There is also a memorial service scheduled for Dec. 10, which is Tuesday.

Carney did not say whether Obama would attend the memorial, the burial, or both.

In the meantime, Obama has directed that American flags be lowered to half-staff through Monday in honor of the freedom fighter who died Thursday at age 95.

In a proclamation honoring Mandela, Obama wrote that ""the United States has lost a close friend, South Africa has lost an incomparable liberator, and the world has lost an inspiration for freedom, justice, and human dignity -- Nelson Mandela is no longer with us, he belongs to the ages.""

Mandela ""transformed South Africa -- and moved the entire world,"" Obama wrote. ""His journey from a prisoner to a president embodied the promise that human beings -- and countries -- can change for the better.""

The resolution said: ""While we mourn his loss, we will forever honor Nelson Mandela's memory. He left behind a South Africa that is free.""

The White House also announced that Obama phoned current South African President Jacob Zuma to express the nation's condolences.

Said a White House statement:

""The president conveyed how profoundly Mandela's extraordinary example of moral courage, kindness, and humility influenced his own life, as well as those of millions around the world.

""President Obama reaffirmed that the strong and historic partnership between the United States and South Africa will continue to draw strength from Mandela's legacy as we work together to promote equality, reconciliation and human dignity, and to build a more just and prosperous world."""

National Security Agency leaker Snowden has been in Russia since Sunday

He could be seeking political asylum in Ecuador

U.S. wants Russia to extradite him

MOSCOW — NSA leaker Edward Snowden remained in hiding Wednesday though a hint of his escape plans emerged when the Ecuadorean Embassy asked the United States why it should not grant him political asylum.

Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport was full of media looking for Snowden, the subject of an extradition request by the United States on a charge of espionage.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said Snowden has been in the airport since his arrival from Hong Kong on Sunday. He said Snowden is in a transit area of the airport that is not technically Russian soil, so Russia cannot honor the U.S. extradition request.

The government of Ecuador said Wednesday it is considering granting asylum to Snowden and has asked the United States to submit any objections in writing.

Snowden's request will be ""reviewed responsibly,"" said Efrain Baus, the deputy chief of mission at Ecuador's Embassy in Washington. ""The government of Ecuador has requested that the U.S. submit its position regarding this applicant in writing so that it can be taken into consideration as part of our thorough review process.""

Before leaving Hong Kong, Snowden was given ""a refugee document of passage"" by Ecuadorean diplomats, according to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is coordinating assistance for Snowden from the Ecuadorean Embassy in London. Assange himself is hiding in the embassy to avoid extradition to Sweden for questioning on rape accusations against him.

In a statement posted to the embassy website, Baus said Ecuador receives many asylum requests each year and the legal basis for each request ""must be rigorously established"" in accordance with the Ecuadorean constitution, the international legal framework and human rights.

RIA Novosti, a Russian news agency, reported that Snowden had booked two tickets for flights from Moscow to Havana on June 24 and 25 but did not board either flight. If he has not been able to extend his transit visa — assuming he has one and that it is valid for three days — it may be about to expire.

It is not clear what his legal travel status would be if his three-day transit visa granted by Russia expired. The United States has revoked his passport and wants Russia to honor an extradition request.

Former ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton said Putin's claim that Snowden did not technically cross into Russia is preposterous. Bolton, who served under President George W. Bush, said Snowden entered Russia as soon as his plane crossed Russian airspace.

""Russia could've pulled him off the plane when he arrived,"" Bolton told Fox News.

He said the only reason Russia is allowing him to remain is so it can gain full access to the computer records Snowden says he stole from his former contractor job for the National Security Agency, records he says detail secret NSA surveillance programs and their targets. Snowden claims he stole the records because the programs are illegal and improper.

The White House says the programs scoured phone calls and websites searching for patterns that would lead to communication among terrorists. It says that the programs are legal and overseen by the courts and Congress and that they have successfully disrupted terrorist plots.

""Cancelling Snowden's passport and bullying intermediary countries may keep Snowden permanently in Russia. Not the brightest bunch at State,"" WikiLeaks said on its Twitter feed late Tuesday.

A letter from President Obama to Russian President Vladimir Putin, conveyed by Donilon, “is written in a constructive tone and has a number of proposals promoting bilateral dialogue and cooperation,” the Russian leader’s foreign policy adviser, Yuri Ushakov, told reporters after the Kremlin get-together.

Ushakov said the White House is sending “positive signals” to Moscow, though he noted that Obama has not moved to tamp down the “Russophobia” in other parts of the American government, by which he meant Congress.

Donilon’s visit occurred after a weekend in which the United States and Russia each released lists of officials from the other country who were being barred from visits. The U.S. list, in compliance with the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act, targets 18 people deemed to be human rights violators. They are also subject to financial sanctions. The White House opposed the Magnitsky measure, but it was passed overwhelmingly by Congress.

The Russian list, released a day later, names officials associated with the Guantanamo prison camp and “enhanced interrogation,” as well as prosecutors and judges who have dealt with criminal cases involving several Russians.

Publicly naming people who are barred from entering a country is highly unusual; the Russians have called it provocative. The release of the lists follows a year of unraveling relations between the two countries, which began as Putin reassumed the presidency last spring. Russia has resisted the United States position on Syria, criticized American support for advocacy groups here, expelled USAID and accused Washington of trying to foment rebellion in the streets.

Passage of the Magnitsky law in December led to a Russian ban on American adoptions of Russian children.

Jay Carney, the White House spokesman, said Donilon went to Moscow to discuss a “full range” of issues, including Syria, trade and nuclear non-proliferation. Russia has already been notably critical of North Korean threats against South Korea and the United States.

“We understand we have differences, and we are very clear and transparent and candid about those differences and we engage with Russian officials on those differences,” Carney said. “But we also have areas where we can cooperate in ways that are useful and in the interest of both Russia and the United States.”

“As for us, we shall follow these positive signals,” Ushakov said.

Monday’s talks included, besides Putin, Ushakov and Donilon: U.S. Ambassador Michael McFaul; Rose Gottemoeller, assistant secretary of state for arms control; James Miller, under secretary of defense for policy; Nikolai Patrushev, secretary of the Russian Security Council; Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov; Deputy Defense Minister Anatoly Antonov; and officials from the Russian Federal Security Service and the Foreign Intelligence Service.

Earlier Monday, Donilon met with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. Lavrov afterward told the Itar-Tass news agency that Donilon had reiterated comments made last week by Secretary of State John F. Kerry when he met with him, acknowledging that there were “irritants” in relations between the two countries and pledging to try to ameliorate them.

“Let’s see,” Lavrov said. “We’ll judge by deeds and not by words.”

Venezuela’s offer of asylum for NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden got a thumbs up from key members of the Russian parliament Saturday, even as the Kremlin and Foreign Ministry kept a studious silence.

“Sanctuary for Snowden in Venezuela would be the best decision,” Alexei Pushkov, head of the foreign affairs committee of Russia’s lower house of parliament, tweeted Saturday.

Pushkov, who reliably reflects the government’s position on international issues, voiced what appears to be a growing official desire to see Snowden leave after 13 days holed up in transit limbo at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo Airport. He wrote of Snowden, “He can’t live at Sheremetyevo.”

Another parliamentary deputy and member of Pushkov’s committee, Alexander Babakov, told the Russian News Service on Saturday that he thinks the offer of asylum Friday from Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro was Snowden’s best recourse.

“Given that Snowden’s U.S. passport was revoked and that he has no particular alternative, the proposal, especially coming from the mouth of the head of state, is sure to be accepted,” he said.

Pushkov also argued that asylum would not cost Venezuela because the country is already in an acute conflict with the United States. “It can’t get worse,” he wrote.

The central question, though, is how Snowden might get to Venezuela. Until now, Russia has been saying he cannot fly out without proper documents, following the revocation of his U.S. passport. On Saturday, a lieutenant colonel in Russia’s FSB reserve, Anatoly Yermolin, told the radio station Ekho Moskvy that Russia could grant Snowden status as a “stateless person,” and that would allow him to leave without further complications.

But a more difficult question is: by what route? Direct commercial flights from Moscow to Havana cross European airspace, and after the refusal of France, Italy and Spain to allow an overflight Tuesday by Bolivian President Evo Morales, that route would seem to be problematic for Snowden. He might have to rely on a private plane, following a roundabout course, if he were to reach Caracas.

Maduro said he was offering asylum so that the former National Security Agency contractor could live “free of imperial North American persecution.” v

Venezuela is the first country to offer sanctuary to Snowden. On Saturday, Morales said that Bolivia is also willing to give him asylum.

The 30-year-old computer whiz has reportedly requested asylum from more than 20 countries.

The American announcement came on the same day that Chinese state news media said that China sent jets aloft and that they identified two American surveillance planes and 10 Japanese aircraft in the air defense zone the country declared last weekend.

Although there was no indication that China’s air force showed any hostile intent, the move raised tensions. The Chinese had also sent jets on patrol into the contested airspace the day before, but Xinhua, the state-run news agency, indicated that the planes on Friday were scrambled specifically to respond to foreign jets in the area.

Earlier in the week, the United States sent unarmed B-52s into the area, and they proceeded unimpeded. China then appeared to back down somewhat from its initial declaration that planes must file advance flight plans or face possible military action.

The administration’s decision on Friday underscored the delicate position President Obama finds himself in, drawn into a geopolitical dispute that will test how far he is willing to go to contain China’s rising regional ambitions.

China’s move thrust the United States into the middle of the already prickly territorial clash between Beijing and Tokyo, a position the administration had avoided for months even while reiterating that the mutual defense treaty with Japan covers the islands. After the Chinese declaration last weekend, American officials feared that, if left unchallenged, the Chinese action would lead to ever greater claims elsewhere in the Pacific region.

But with planes flying so fast and in such proximity, the administration’s worries grew that an accident or an unintended confrontation could spiral out of control. A midair collision between a Chinese fighter jet and an American spy plane off the coast of China in 2001 killed the fighter pilot and forced the spy plane to make an emergency landing on Hainan Island, setting off a diplomatic episode until Beijing released the American crew and sent the plane back, broken into parts."

On Thursday, upon hearing of the former South African president's death, Gingrich put up a post on Facebook, expressing his condolences.

""President Nelson Mandela was one of the greatest leaders of our lifetime,"" he wrote. ""When he visited the Congress I was deeply impressed with the charisma and the calmness with which he could dominate a room. It was as if the rest of us grew smaller and he grew stronger and more dominant the longer the meeting continued.""

Gingrich's statement, however, was met with backlash from many of his followers.

""Newt, I was rooting for you to win the primaries and become the next president; please tell me your joking!! Mandela was a commie murderer!!"" read one comment that was popular with other users.

""You're forgetting Mandela's extreme racism! There are YouTubes of Mandela singing songs about murdering the white man. I spit on his grave....,"" read another.

When asked about the criticism in an interview on CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday, Gingrich replied, ""I was very surprised by it. [My wife] Callista posted my statement on her Facebook page and was amazed at some of the intensity -- some of whom came back three, four and five times repeating how angry they were.""

In response, on Saturday, Gingrich put out a new statement and video to his supporters, challenging critics to put themselves in Mandela's shoes.

""I was surprised by the hostility and vehemence of some of the people who reacted to me saying a kind word about a unique historic figure,"" he said. ""So let me say to those conservatives who don’t want to honor Nelson Mandela, what would you have done?""

Responding to conservatives who dismiss Mandela as a communist, Gingrich added, ""Actually Mandela was raised in a Methodist school, was a devout Christian, turned to communism in desperation only after South Africa was taken over by an extraordinarily racist government determined to eliminate all rights for blacks.""

As Ta-Nehisi Coates at the Atlantic pointed out, Gingrich's support for Mandela is not new or an attempt to rewrite history.

""Newt Gingrich was among a cadre of conservatives who opposed the mainstream conservative stance on Apartheid and ultimately helped override Reagan's unconscionable veto of sanctions,"" he wrote, adding, ""When Gingrich compliments Mandela on his presidency he doesn't do so within the context of alleged African pathologies, but within the context of countries throughout the world. It's a textbook lessons in 'How not to be racist,' which is to say it is a textbook lesson in how to talk about Nelson Mandela as though he were a human being.""

Watch Gingrich's video:

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) also encountered a fair amount of vitriol last week when he honored Mandela in a Facebook post, writing, ""Nelson Mandela will live in history as an inspiration for defenders of liberty around the globe… Because of his epic fight against injustice, an entire nation is now free.”

When CNN host Candy Crowley asked Gingrich if he believed his and Cruz's critics were fellow conservatives, the former House speaker said they were people who bought into ""a rationale that defined everybody who was in any way in rebellion against the established system in the third world as anti-American."""

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

http://news.yahoo.com/central-america-struggles-unite-obama-trip-180853537.html,,[],Central America struggles to unite for Obama trip,"SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) — President Barack Obama on Friday addressed a Central American region that continues to be plagued by violence, drug trafficking, corruption and poverty, despite the success of a seven-year trade agreement with the United States.

Central America's problems have directly impacted the U.S., as thousands from the region migrate north each year along increasingly deadly smuggling routes.

In a press conference late Friday with Costa Rican President Laura Chinchilla, Obama said only a comprehensive approach will work to solve the region's problems, including stronger economies, better institutions, education and youth centers that give young people a sense of opportunity.

""Problems like narco-trafficking arise when a country is vulnerable because of poverty and institutions not working for people,"" he said. ""The stronger the economy and institutions for individuals seeking legitimate careers, the less powerful these narco-trafficking operations are going to be.""

Obama went on to a closed meeting with the eight-nation Central American Integration System, known by its Spanish initials SICA, which was formed to discuss regional issues.

He said he looked forward to the regional cooperation. But national rivalries that have often blocked cooperation.

Guatemala and Belize maintain a border dispute. Honduras and El Salvador are fighting over the use of the waters and shores of the Gulf of Fonseca, and a conflict between Nicaragua and Costa Rica has been escalating over the San Juan River border. On top of that, Panama, Costa Rica and Nicaragua often feel excluded because Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras get the bulk of U.S. security aid, said Eric Olson, associate director of the Latin American program at the Wilson Center think tank in Washington.

""SICA has tried to build itself as the place where all these countries can come together and that can be the distribution point for that aid,"" Olson said. ""But I think the rivalry between these governments gets in the way.""

Still, the Central American presidents have come manned to talk about security, an issue they see as directly related to drug consumption in the United States. Some Central American countries have the highest murder rates in the world, with Honduras often called the world's most dangerous country. Leaders here say they want the U.S. to take more responsibility in the fight against drug cartels.

""We need the decided support of the U.S. to attack our common enemy, drug trafficking,"" Honduran President Porfirio Lobo said Thursday. ""Unfortunately, Honduras and the countries of the region bear the dead of a war that we didn't start and that we repudiate. It's time to renew our mutual political cooperation.""

The White House doesn't plan to launch any new initiatives with this trip, said Ricardo Zuniga, the lead official for Latin America policy on the U.S. National Security Council. Rather, it wants to talk about better coordination and use of the aid that is already going to the region.

""Besides the United States expressing its deep worry over the deterioration of the region, there isn't much more to expect,"" said Cynthia Arnson, director of the Latin American program at the Wilson Center.

Since 2008, the United States has allocated $496 million in security cooperation to Central America, Zuniga said, and that number isn't expected to increase substantially.

The White House asked for $162 million for the fight against drug trafficking in its 2014 budget through the Central America Regional Security Initiative. That's $26 million more than what was allocated in 2012.

By comparison, Washington has allocated $1.9 billion to Mexico since 2008 for the fight against drug trafficking through the Merida Initiative.

Even on security issues, the countries have difficulty uniting.

""There is no effective cooperation because there is no trust,"" said Ignacio de Lucas, coordinator of the Network of Prosecutors against Organized Crime, an initiative of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime that brings together 10 prosecutors from Mexico to Colombia. ""Sometimes big projects arise, for example creating a database to cooperate with Interpol, but what information will go there? Without trust there will not be useful information.""

The more relevant forum to discuss drug trafficking in the region will be the June general assembly of the Organization of American States, said Guatemalan Foreign Minister Luis Carrera Castro.

Aside from security concerns, Central American presidents also have agreed to prioritize economic issues in their meeting with Obama.

The SICA member governments, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Belize, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and the Dominican Republic, want to enhance the trade agreement they've had since 2006 with the United States, said Muni Figueres, Costa Rican Ambassador to the U.S.

Under the CAFTA-DR agreement, U.S. exports to the region have risen to $30 billion in 2012, up 25 percent from 2010 and 80 percent from 2005, according to her embassy's figures.

One of the specific goals for the Obama meeting is a commitment from the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative to actively participate in a commission tracking the performance of the trade agreement, Figueres said.

""The challenge now is how to facilitate trade to flow better and how to translate the agreement into more jobs and investment,"" she added."

WASHINGTON, Aug 4 (Reuters) - A senior Democratic senator said on Sunday that the U.S.-Russia relationship had become ""poisonous"" and urged President Barack Obama to consider moving next month's Group of 20 summit away from the Russian city of St. Petersburg.

Charles Schumer, the U.S. Senate's third ranking Democrat and a close Obama ally, accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of trying to antagonize the United States by granting American fugitive Edward Snowden asylum for one year.

""President Putin is behaving like a schoolyard bully,"" Schumer said on the CBS television talk show ""Face the Nation."" ""In my experience, I've learned unless you stand up to that bully, they ask for more and more and more.""

He said Obama should cancel plans to meet Putin in Moscow for a bilateral summit next month that was expected take place during the U.S. president's trip to Russia for the G20 gathering.

Schumer said he also would call on Obama to ""urge our allies, if it were possible,"" to try to move the G20 summit from St. Petersburg to another country.

The White House has left unclear whether Obama would stop in Moscow after Russia granted asylum to Snowden, a former intelligence contractor wanted in the United States for leaking details of government surveillance programs.

Schumer said that because of the Snowden matter, ""the relationship between the United States and Russia ... is more poisonous than at any time since the Cold War.""

Also speaking on CBS, Republican Congressman Paul Ryan said he agreed with Schumer that there should be consequences for Russia's actions.

Ryan, a former vice presidential candidate and influential voice within his party, accused the Obama administration of appeasement with its policy, known as the ""reset,"" begun in 2009, of trying to improve U.S.-Russia relations.

General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the ABC program ""This Week"" that Russia's actions were disappointing. (Reporting by Caren Bohan; Editing by Bill Trott)"

(CNN) —

For some Republicans, 2016 is 1992: Hating Hillary Clinton is chic again. Only more so, since the former secretary of state is also the partner of and potential successor to the last two Democratic presidents—Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.

Some of us believe, with good reasons, that the Republicans are “mad-dogging” Hillary Clinton with the Benghazi hearing to damage not only her presidential prospects, but also to damage President Obama’s credibility.

JUSTIN LAROSE/CNN Donna Brazile

Polls show Obama is trusted more than his Washington opponents, especially on the economy. So, to defeat his economic agenda and substitute their own, which has already lost on logic, they’ve decided to undermine Obama’s credibility and authority.

The Benghazi hearing, which House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, orchestrated and planned for months, is a classic “killing two birds with one stone” scenario for Republicans. Or maybe three: They see an opportunity to smear Obama, sabotage Clinton and fundraise like giddy televangelists.

Benghazi hearing chairman Darrell Issa, R-California, said Clinton is not a target of his committee. That doesn’t seem to jibe with statements by GOP Sens. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, among others. And further contradicting Issa’s protestation, the National Republican Congressional Committee was boasting that its Clinton/Benghazi fundraising page was the most successful in its history.

Benghazi is a rather unseemly subject to turn into a political weapon. It’s one thing to try to drag the former secretary of state through the mud. But the Republicans are trying to drag her through blood – blood that’s tainted with partisan politics. The Republicans cut the funding for embassy security by $128 million in 2011 and $331 million in 2012. Clinton warned that doing so would be “detrimental to national security.” Republicans scoffed then, scream now.

Obama called the Benghazi hearing a circus. He’s right. It’s not a transparent, due process hearing. Democrats have complained they were excluded from much of the investigations, weren’t allowed to call witnesses or to look at documents.

As Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Maryland and ranking member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, said Wednesday after the White House’s release of approximately 100 pages of e-mails relating to the attacks in Benghazi: “These documents undercut the reckless accusations by Republicans that the White House scrubbed the Benghazi talking points for political reasons and in fact show just the opposite—that the primary goal was to protect the FBI’s ongoing criminal investigation and our nation’s intelligence operations.”

Chaffetz: Obama has explaining to do on Benghazi

A transparent, due-process hearing would call the witnesses who would testify that the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli mistakenly believed Katibat Ansar al-Sharia in Benghazi had claimed credit for the attack. The group didn’t make the claim and later denied any role. But that was an on-the-ground, in-the-moment embassy mistake. (While no friend of the United States, the Benghazi al-Sharia organization has not, so far, been implicated in terrorist activity.)

It came from mistaken identity: There were two distinct and unrelated Ansar al-Sharia militant groups in Libya. Even Fox News interviewed an expert, J. Peter Pham of the Atlantic Council, who said these groups have no formal affiliation with each other. They are grass-roots up organizations, whereas al Qaeda organizes from the top down.

It is suspected that the Ansar al-Sharia in Derna was involved in the attack in Benghazi that killed four Americans. Its leader is a former prisoner at Guantanamo who was released under the Bush administration and deported to Libya for jail. Gadhafi later released him.

In a transparent hearing we would learn that the Republicans’ chief witness, Deputy Chief of Mission Gregory Hicks, was likely, even today, in error about which Ansar al-Sharia was involved. It is the difference between a local militant militia group and professional terrorists.

Hicks clearly was referring to the Benghazi al Sharia when he testified about his concern that Ambassador Chris Stevens was taken to the hospital that the Benghazi group then guarded. But, this week the same hospital was bombed; the rival al-Shaira group in Derna, with al Qaeda links, is a reasonable suspect.

Getting the facts right matters. Getting the truth matters. Posturing for propaganda points not only misleads us, it endangers us. For whatever the Benghazi hearings are about, they’re not about learning the lessons from this tragedy and improving securities at American embassies and other facilities overseas.

They are, in fact, a partisan campaign fundraiser for the Republican Party, and not a fact-finding inquiry to help the State Department and military correct their mistakes.

Karl Rove’s American Crossroads super PAC has already taken on Hillary Clinton, spending megabucks on a 2016 attack ad that savages her judgments. Some Republicans, to their credit, can’t stomach any more from their fellow Republicans.

Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, a Republican, appeared on CBS’ “Face the Nation” and said he would have handled Benghazi just as Obama handled it. He added a flat, “No” that he did not think Hillary Clinton would be involved in any kind of a cover-up.

Bill Kristol, conservative editor and commentator, told Fox News Sunday, “I wish the Republicans would just be quiet for a while and that the partisan Republican groups that are fundraising off this would be quiet … for a while … and let’s find out what really happened.”

Amen.

Robert Baleshot dead 16 Afghan civilians before turning himself in Bales pleaded guilty in June, sparing him the prospect of a death sentence

(CNN) —

On Friday, a military jury decided U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Robert Bales will get life in prison without parole for killing 16 Afghan villagers.

Yet victims left behind – some bearing physical scars, others with emotional ones from seeing their kin indiscriminately, brutally gunned down – say that, with that sentence, they don’t feel they got justice.

Friday’s decision was not entirely unexpected. In June Bales’ pleaded guilty to more than 30 criminal charges, including 16 premeditated murder counts, spared himself from the prospect of a death sentence. He also pleaded guilty to charges related to illicit steroid and alcohol use.

But it still remained up to a jury of four officers and two enlisted personnel to decide whether Bales should be eligible for parole.

They decided Friday he is not, according to Lt. Col. Gary Dangerfield with Joint Base Lewis-McChord. That means the 39-year-old will spend the rest of his life in a military prison.

That’s not punishment enough for Haji Wazir. Now 40, Wazir was inside his home in the Panjwai district of Afghanistan’s southern Kandahar province in the pre-dawn hours of March 11, 2012, when Bales barged in.

What followed was a nightmare, ending with bloodied, limp and in some instances scorched bodies.

“We wanted this murderer to be executed, but we didn’t get our wish,” Wazir said through an interpreter Friday from the Washington state U.S. Army base where the sentence was handed down.

The sentence was not just, he added, before appealing to the U.S public to put themselves in his shoes.

“I’m asking the average American right here: If somebody jumps into your house in the middle of the night and kills 11 members of your family and tries to burn them, what punishment would you be passing on that person?”

Wazir and his family weren’t the only ones torn on that horrific morning some 18 months ago.

Bales slipped away from Camp Belambay, the remote outpost where he was stationed, and into one village, where he began shooting at civilians. After that, he returned to the base, reloaded and went out again to target another village.

He left a trail of blood and gore in both villages, with nine children among the dead. Witnesses claimed that the U.S. soldier dragged some bodies of his victims’ outside and set them ablaze.

The horror ended when Bales returned, once again, to Camp Belambay and turned himself in.

In the subsequent hours and days, some spoke highly about Bales, such as attorney Emma Scanlan who described him as a “devoted husband, father and dedicated member of the armed service.”

Yet in Afghanistan and around the world, the massacre quickly spurred outrage.

The Taliban vowed to retaliate “by killing and beheading Americans anywhere in the country.” Afghan President Hamid Karzai suggested, after meeting with villagers who’d seen the carnage and wanted Bales to be tried there to “heal our broken hearts,” that the incident had put U.S.-Afghan relations at a breaking point.

“It is by all means the end of the rope here,” Karzai said then. “The end of the rope that nobody can afford such luxuries anymore.”

Bales was identified as the culprit days later and eventually put in solitary confinement at the U.S. military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.

The military announced last December that Bales faced a court-martial.

The Army soldier spoke at this week’s sentencing, calling what he’d done “an act of cowardice.”

“I hid behind a mask of Bravado,” Bales said, according to a tweet from court from Drew Mikkelsen of CNN Seattle affiliate KING. Also admitting he’d taken steroids and drank sporadically, the soldier apologized to his victims.

“I am responsible,” he said.

Because of him, some in Afghanistan are still suffering the consequences.

Haji Mohammad Naim saw Bales come into his southwest Afghanistan home around 2 a.m. and kill women there, as well as some of his children. Bullets struck him in the neck and the face.

That incident and others in which U.S. soldiers have killed civilians – including another of Naim’s sons, in a separate incident, he says – have disgraced American forces in the eyes of many Afghans. Children in his village used to run toward U.S. troops, Naim said; now, they “run away and try to hide.”

If America is to improve its image, there must be accountability, he said. And if Washington wants to help rebuild Afghanistan, “try to send the right people, not maniacs and psychos like (Bales).”

Still, even if the U.S. governments acts differently, some pain and suffering can’t be undone.

Recalling tears shed by Bales’ mother during the legal proceedings, Naim said, “But at least she can go and visit him.

“What about us?” he asked rhetorically. “Our family members are actually 6 feet under, and there’s no way that we can visit them at all.

“They’re gone.”

“I’m not aware of any doubt that exists,” White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters. “I think that maybe if you take Bashar al-Assad seriously on these matters, you might have some doubt, but there’s no evidence to suggest that he has any credibility when it come to his statements about the use of chemical weapons in Syria.”

Assad’s government has the rocket capability employed in the attack, Carney said. The Syrian government used chemical weapons earlier in the civil war, he said, and was engaged in an assault against the targeted suburbs of Damascus prior to last Wednesday’s attack.

“We see no evidence of any alternative scenario,” Carney said.

Obama’s top spokesman insisted the president has not yet made a decision about how to respond to last week’s attack, which rebels say killed hundreds of people.

Obama continued his round of phone calls to world leaders, speaking to Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper about their shared opposition to the use of chemical weapons. Obama has spoken in recent days to leaders in Britain, France and Australia.

Vice President Joseph Biden and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel were also speaking with their foreign counterparts.

U.S. forces are ready to strike if Obama gives the order, Hagel told the BBC on Tuesday.

Carney declined to explain what the president meant when he said last week that an attack by one country on another without a United Nations mandate would raise “questions in terms of whether international law supports it.”

But he suggested that the other criteria the president stated in an interview last week with CNN – “clear evidence that can be presented” – has practically been met.

“The intelligence community is working on an assessment, and we will have conclusions that can be provided to the public available this week,” Carney said. “But I think it’s important to note that it is clear already that chemical weapons were used on a large scale, undeniable, and that the Assad regime is the only possible force that could have deployed them.”

“There has to be a response to that clear violation of international norms,” he said.

DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — A Syrian state-run newspaper on Sunday called President Obama's decision to seek congressional approval before taking military action against Syria ""the start of the historic American retreat.""

The gloating tone in the front-page article in the Al-Thawra daily followed Obama's unexpected announcement on Saturday that he would ask Congress to support a strike punishing the President Bashar Assad's regime for the alleged use of chemical weapons. The decision marked a stark turnabout for the White House, which had appeared on the verge of ordering U.S. forces to launch a missile attack against Syria.

""Whether the Congress lights the red or green light for an aggression, and whether the prospects of war have been enhanced or faded, President Obama has announced yesterday, by prevaricating or hinting, the start of the historic American retreat,"" Al-Thawra said.

The U.S. Navy moved warships over the past week into the eastern Mediterranean as the Obama administration considered its options.

Tens of thousands of U.S. troops were stationed in the Philippines after it was liberated from Japanese occupation after World War II. The giant bases that harbored U.S. sailors and airmen, Subic Bay Naval Station and Clark Air Force Base, were shuttered by the end of 1992. A constitution written shortly after the Americans were pushed out now forbids any permanent foreign military presence in the islands that were once a U.S. colony.

Under a 2002 agreement between the United States and the Philippines, several hundred U.S. counter-terrorism troops have been in the country to train Philippine soldiers for operations to contain Al Qaeda-allied insurgents plaguing the southern island of Mindanao. The Visiting Forces Agreement limits the troops’ number and length of stay.

“The Philippines will shortly enter into consultations and negotiations with the United States on a possible framework agreement that would implement our agreed policy of increased rotational presence,” Defense Minister Voltaire Gazmin and Foreign Minister Albert del Rosario announced in a letter released to news media in the region Thursday.

Del Rosario told reporters at a Manila news conference that he hoped the talks would begin as soon as possible to work out the “modalities and parameters” necessary to beef up the U.S. presence in the country.

The Philippines, like other U.S.-allied Asian nations, has been confronted in recent years by an increasingly aggressive China that has laid claim to disputed islands and resources in the East and South China seas. Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Brunei, Vietnam and Malaysia also are engaged in tense standoffs with Beijing over natural assets in the region.

Gazmin said the increased U.S. presence was desired “for the protection of our West Philippine Sea,” the name Filipinos use for the South China Sea waters surrounding disputed islands, fishing grounds and rich oil and natural gas deposits.

Philippine ships last year were forced to back off from their traditional fishing area at Scarborough Shoal after Chinese sailors erected a barricade to block entrance to the disputed waters.

The Associated Press in Manila reported Thursday that it had seen confidential Philippine military surveillance reports that 61 Chinese vessels had been sighted over a six-day period last month off the disputed Spratly Islands. China since 1995 has also occupied the Mischief Reef, which Manila also claims, and it has converted it to a base for Chinese patrol vessels.

Philippine President Benigno Aquino III made clear last month that the expanded deployments would remain temporary and that the visitors would have to operate from existing Philippine national bases and not reopen or rebuild their own.

The Philippines was a U.S. colony from 1898 until it was granted partial autonomy in 1935. It was occupied by Japan during World War II, and its sovereignty was recognized by the United States in 1946.

It was unclear from the announcements how soon the two sides might sit down to hammer out an agreement to expand the number of U.S. forces in the Philippines, nor were any target figures mentioned. But the Philippines’ desire for more protection from an ascendant China dovetails with the United States’ plans for a “pivot to Asia,” in which it hopes to relocate defense resources from Europe and the Middle East to enhance its clout in the region.

http://news.yahoo.com/russia-rejects-us-demand-snowdens-extradition-092352868.html,,[],Russia rejects US demand for Snowden's extradition,"MOSCOW (AP) — Russia's foreign minister bluntly rejected U.S. demands to extradite National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden, saying Tuesday that Snowden hasn't crossed the Russian border.

Sergey Lavrov insisted that Russia has nothing to do with Snowden or his travel plans. Lavrov wouldn't say where Snowden is, but he lashed out angrily at Washington for demanding his extradition and warning of negative consequences if Moscow fails to comply. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has urged Moscow to ""do the right thing"" and turn over Snowden.

""We consider the attempts to accuse Russia of violating U.S. laws and even some sort of conspiracy, which on top of all that are accompanied by threats, as absolutely ungrounded and unacceptable,"" Lavrov said. ""There are no legal grounds for such conduct by U.S. officials.""

The defiant tone underlined the Kremlin's readiness to challenge Washington at a time when U.S.-Russian relations are strained over Syria and a Russian ban on adoptions by Americans.

U.S. and Ecuadorean officials said they believed Snowden was still in Russia. He fled there Sunday from Hong Kong, where he had been hiding out since his disclosure of the broad scope of two highly classified U.S. counterterror surveillance programs. The programs collect vast amounts of Americans' phone records and worldwide online data in the name of national security.

Kerry said Tuesday that although the United States does not have an extradition treaty with Russia, he called on Moscow to comply with common law practices between countries where fugitives are concerned.

""I would simply appeal for calm and reasonableness. We would hope that Russia would not side with someone who is 'a fugitive' from justice,' "" Kerry said at a news conference in Saudi Arabia.

Lavrov claimed that the Russian government found out about Snowden's flight from Hong Kong only from news reports.

""We have no relation to Mr. Snowden, his relations with American justice or his travels around the world,"" Lavrov said. ""He chooses his route himself, and we have learned about it from the media.""

Story continues

Snowden booked a seat on a Havana-bound flight from Moscow on Monday en route to Venezuela and then possible asylum in Ecuador, but he didn't board the plane. Russian news media have reported that he has remained in a transit zone of Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport, but journalists there haven't seen him.

A representative of WikiLeaks has been traveling with Snowden, and the organization is believed to be assisting him in arranging asylum. The organization's founder, Julian Assange, said Monday that Snowden was only passing through Russia and had applied for asylum in Ecuador, Iceland and possibly other countries.

A high-ranking Ecuadorean official told The Associated Press that Russia and Ecuador were discussing where Snowden could go, saying the process could take days. He also said Ecuador's ambassador to Moscow had not seen or spoken to Snowden. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the case publicly.

Ecuador's foreign minister, Ricardo Patino, hailed Snowden on Monday as ""a man attempting to bring light and transparency to facts that affect everyone's fundamental liberties.""

He described the decision on whether to grant Snowden asylum as a choice between ""betraying the citizens of the world or betraying certain powerful elites in a specific country.""

State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell said the U.S. had made demands to ""a series of governments,"" including Ecuador, that Snowden be barred from any international travel other than to be returned to the U.S. The U.S. has revoked Snowden's passport.

""We're following all the appropriate legal channels and working with various other countries to make sure that the rule of law is observed,"" President Barack Obama told reporters.

Some experts said it was likely that Russian spy agencies were questioning Snowden on what he knows about U.S. electronic espionage against Moscow.

""If Russian special services hadn't shown interest in Snowden, they would have been utterly unprofessional,"" Igor Korotchenko, a former colonel in Russia's top military command turned security analyst, said on state Rossiya 24 television.

The Kremlin has previously said Russia would be ready to consider Snowden's request for asylum.

The state ITAR-Tass news agency cited unidentified sources as saying that Snowden hasn't applied for a Russian entry visa and can't cross the border without it. It said that he has remained in the transit zone of the Sheremetyevo airport.

Legally, an arriving air passenger ""crosses the border"" after clearing immigration checks.

The Interfax news agency, which has close contacts with Russian security agencies, quoted an unidentified ""well-informed source"" in Moscow as saying Tuesday that Snowden could be detained for a check of his papers if he crosses the Russian border. The report could reflect that authorities are searching for a pretext to keep Snowden in Russia.

Snowden is a former CIA employee who later was hired as a contractor for the NSA. In that job, he gained access to documents that he gave to newspapers the Guardian and The Washington Post to expose what he contends are privacy violations by an authoritarian government.

Snowden also told the South China Morning Post newspaper in Hong Kong that ""the NSA does all kinds of things like hack Chinese cellphone companies to steal all of your SMS data."" He is believed to have more than 200 additional sensitive documents in laptops he is carrying.

Some observers said in addition to the sensitive data, Snowden's revelations have provided the Kremlin with propaganda arguments to counter the U.S. criticism of Russia's crackdown on opposition and civil activists under President Vladimir Putin.

""They would use Snowden to demonstrate that the U.S. government doesn't sympathize with the ideals of freedom of information, conceals key information from the public and stands ready to open criminal proceedings against those who oppose it,"" Konstantin Remchukov, the editor of independent daily Nezavisimaya Gazeta, said on Ekho Moskvy radio.

Putin has accused the U.S. State Department of instigating protests in Moscow against his re-election for a third term in March and has taken an anti-American posture that plays well with his core support base of industrial workers and state employees."

(CNN) – The new era in America's war on terror - described by President Barack Obama in a major address Thursday - worries some Republicans, who say the phase-down could leave the country vulnerable to still-persistent threats from abroad.

In his remarks, Obama insisted the fight against terrorists must shift to reflect current threat levels, which he described as having evolved since the attacks of September 11, 2001. The global ""war on terror,"" launched in the aftermath of those attacks, must end, ""like all wars,"" the president maintained.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

""I think this is the most significant foreign policy address ever given by this president,"" said Rep. Michael McCaul, the Republican chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee. ""At the same time I found many parts to it disturbing for many reasons.""

Chief among his concerns was Obama's call for a return to what McCaul described as a ""pre-9/11 mentality,"" a mindset the Republican argued could lead to a dangerous level of unpreparedness as threats emerge from sources other than al Qaeda.

""I couldn't disagree with him more on that,"" McCaul said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union.""

In his remarks Thursday, Obama described al Qaeda as ""on the path to defeat"" in its longstanding bases of Afghanistan and Pakistan, but warned the terror group's affiliates in other countries still posed lethal threats to Americans.

But those groups, Obama said, are ""less capable"" than the larger al Qaeda, and are focused more on operating in the countries where they're based, rather than planning an attack on the American homeland.

Attacks on America are still being planned, the president warned, and ""our nation is still threatened by terrorists."" Yet the current threat has vastly changed in the decade-plus since the war on terror began, he said.

""We have to recognize that the scale of this threat closely resembles the types of attacks we faced before 9/11,"" the president said.

McCaul said Sunday the intelligence he's seen as chairman of the homeland security panel suggests a more serious danger than Obama described.

""I think the rhetoric sort of defies the reality in terms of the threat level that we've all been briefed on,"" he said. ""I mean, the narrative is sort of that, you know, al Qaeda is on the run, they're defeated, let's claim victory, war's over. And then let's go back to a pre-9/11 mentality.""

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, argued a scaled-down war footing could send the wrong message to potential enemies.

""What do you think the Iranians are thinking? At the end of the day, this is the most tone-deaf president I ever could imagine, making such a speech at a time when our homeland is trying to be attacked literally every day,"" Graham said on ""Fox News Sunday.""

""I've never been more worried about our national security as I am right now. This speech did not help,"" Graham added.

""I see a big difference between the president saying a war is at an end and whether or not you've won the war,"" Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Oklahoma, added on CBS ""Face the Nation."" ""We can claim it's at an end but this war is going to continue and we have tremendous threats throughout that are building, not declining, building.""

In his address Thursday, Obama noted the difficulty in balancing Americans' freedoms during wartime, a task Sen. Dick Durbin argued Sunday would be made easier as the country's terror stance shifts.

""You find in a warlike atmosphere that you end up compromising some basic values and basic freedoms and liberties,"" Durbin, D-Illinois, said on ""Fox News Sunday"" in his defense of Obama's speech. ""That's what the president reminded us. I'm not going to take lightly the terrorism threat against the United States. But if we're constantly thinking of this in the context of war, we stand a very real risk of doing things which compromise our values and freedoms.""

Another Obama ally, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, said on CBS the shift away from war that Obama advocated Thursday was a suitable reflection of how threats have changed in the past decade.

""I think the president did a very, very smart pivot realizing we're not going to let up on terrorists but at the same time we're going meet the changes in the world,” he said."
http://news.yahoo.com/us-taliban-start-talks-ending-afghan-war-170247308.html,,[],"US, Taliban to start talks on ending Afghan war","KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — The Taliban and the U.S. said Tuesday they will hold talks on finding a political solution to ending nearly 12 years of war in Afghanistan, as the international coalition formally handed over control of the country's security to the Afghan army and police.

The Taliban met a key U.S. demand by pledging not to use Afghanistan as a base to threaten other countries, although the Americans said they must also denounce al-Qaida.

But President Barack Obama cautioned that the process won't be quick or easy. He described the opening of a Taliban political office in the Gulf nation of Qatar as an ""important first step toward reconciliation"" between the Islamic militants and the government of Afghanistan, and predicted there will be bumps along the way.

Obama, who was attending the G-8 summit in Northern Ireland, praised Afghan President Hamid Karzai for taking a courageous step by sending representatives to discuss peace with the Taliban.

""It's good news. We're very pleased with what has taken place,"" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said in Washington. British Prime Minister David Cameron, whose country has the second-largest contingent of troops in Afghanistan after the U.S., called opening the office ""the right thing to do.""

As the handover occurred, four U.S. troops were killed Tuesday at or near Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan, U.S. defense officials said. The officials said the four were killed by indirect fire, likely a mortar or rocket, but they had no other details. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to provide details on the deaths.

Officials with the Obama administration said the office in the Qatari capital of Doha was the first step toward the ultimate U.S.-Afghan goal of a full Taliban renunciation of links with al-Qaida, the reason why America invaded the country on Oct. 7, 2001, shortly after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks against the United States.

Story continues

The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the record, said U.S. representatives will begin formal meetings with the Taliban in Qatar in a few days.

The top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, said the only way to end the war was through a political solution.

""My perspective has always been that this war is going to have to end with political reconciliation, and so I frankly would be supportive of any positive movement in terms of reconciliation, particularly an Afghan-led and an Afghan-owned process that would bring reconciliation between the Afghan people and the Taliban in the context of the Afghan constitution,"" he said.

Dunford added that he was no longer responsible for the security of the country now that Afghan forces had taken the lead.

""Last week I was responsible for security here in Afghanistan,"" he said, adding that now it was Karzai's job. ""It's not just a statement of intent — it's a statement of fact.""

The transition to Afghan-led security means U.S. and other foreign combat troops will not be directly carrying the fight to the insurgency, but will advise and back up as needed with air support and medical evacuations.

The handover paves the way for the departure of coalition forces — currently numbering about 100,000 troops from 48 countries, including 66,000 Americans. By the end of the year, the NATO force will be halved. At the end of 2014, all combat troops will have left and will replaced, if approved by the Afghan government, by a much smaller force that will only train and advise.

Obama has not yet said how many soldiers he will leave in Afghanistan along with NATO forces, but it is thought that it would be about 9,000 U.S. troops and about 6,000 from its allies.

It is uncertain if the Afghan forces are good enough to fight the insurgents. The force numbered less than 40,000 six years ago and has grown to about 352,000 today.

In some of the most restive parts of the country, it may still take a ""few months"" to hand over security completely to the Afghans, Dunford said.

The transition comes at a time when violence is at levels matching the worst in 12 years, further fueling some Afghans' concerns that their forces aren't ready.

The decision to open the Taliban office was a reversal of months of failed efforts to start peace talks while the militants intensified a campaign targeting urban centers and government installations.

Experts warned that it would be a mistake to expect too much.

""The keys are to keep expectations low, to remember that a compromise is unlikely because no one can say what it would consist of,"" said Michael O'Hanlon of the Brookings Institution. He added that in his opinion, the Taliban wrongly ""expect to win the war once NATO is largely gone come 2015.""

""All that said, it's a potentially useful step if we don't confuse ourselves or wind up in polarizing debates within the coalition,"" O'Hanlon said.

In Doha, Ali Bin Fahad Al-Hajri, the assistant to the foreign minister of Qatar, said the Emir of the Gulf state had given the go-ahead for the office to open.

""Negotiations are the only way for peace in Afghanistan,"" Al-Hajri said.

The Taliban emerged from the Pakistani-trained mujahedeen, or holy warriors, who battled the Soviet Union's occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s with secret backing by the CIA. Civil war broke out when the pro-Soviet Afghan government collapsed following the departure of Moscow's troops. The U.S. took an arms-length position of neutrality as rival warlords shelled Kabul into ruins.

By 1994, the Taliban had evolved into a united military and political force and in 1996, the group took control of Afghanistan. Led by Mullah Mohammed Omar, the Afghan Taliban sheltered Osama bin Laden in the years leading up to the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001, but the group was toppled shortly after the U.S. and allied invasion one month later.

The U.S.-led invasion leveraged the firepower of factions, such as the Northern Alliance, who had held out against the Taliban after it seized power in 1996. CIA and U.S. special operations support for anti-Taliban forces enabled the U.S. to oust the Islamists by December 2001 without committing large numbers of U.S. ground troops, and the group appeared to have been defeated as a military threat.

However, by 2005, the Taliban was beginning to make a comeback, showing signs of improved training and equipment, while using territory inside Pakistan as a sanctuary.

On Monday, Taliban spokesman Mohammad Naim said the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, as the Taliban were known when they ruled the country, was willing to use all legal means to end what they called the occupation of Afghanistan. But he did not say they would immediately stop fighting.

""The jihad continues to end the occupation and establish an Islamic emirate. To achieve this goal, we will follow every legitimate means,"" he said. ""The emirate of the Taliban, with its military effort, has a strategic goal related to the future of Afghanistan. The movement is not intending to harm any other parties and will not allow anybody to use Afghan territory to threaten other countries.""

The Obama administration officials said the U.S. and Taliban representatives will hold bilateral meetings. Karzai's High Peace Council is expected to follow up with its own talks with the Taliban a few days later.

But in making their announcement in Doha, the Taliban did not specifically mention talks with Karzai or his representatives.

""We don't recognize the Afghan government and the government of Karzai. The talks will be with the Americans only in Doha under the patronage of Qatar,"" he said. ""We represent the people of Afghanistan. We don't represent the Karzai government.""

The administration officials acknowledged the process will be ""complex, long and messy"" because of the ongoing level of distrust between the parties.

The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the record, vowed to continue to push the Taliban further, saying that the Taliban ultimately must also break ties with al-Qaida, end violence and accept Afghanistan's constitution — including protections for women and minorities.

They said the U.S. had long demanded that the Taliban make a statement distancing the group from international terrorism, but had said that they did not expect them to break ties with al-Qaida immediately. That would be one of the outcomes of the negotiating process, they added.

The U.S. will hold its first formal meetings with the Taliban in Doha within a few days, senior officials said, with the expectation that it will be followed up days later by a meeting between representatives of the Taliban and the High Peace Council. The first meeting will focus on an exchange of agendas and consultations on next steps.

Naim did not give a schedule for talks.

The Taliban office is in one of the diplomatic areas in Doha. Its sign reads: ""The Political Bureau of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan in Doha.""

Despite Karzai's stated hope that the process will move almost immediately to Afghanistan, U.S. officials do not expect that to be possible in the near future.

The Taliban have for years refused to speak to the government or the High Peace Council, set up by Karzai three years ago, because they considered them to be U.S. ""puppets."" Taliban representatives have instead talked to American and other Western officials in Doha and other places, mostly in Europe.

Officials said Obama was personally involved in working with Karzai to enable the opening of the office, and that Kerry had also played a major role. Obama briefed other leaders at the summit meeting, which included the countries of Britain, Russia, Germany, Japan, Canada, France and Italy.

James Dobbins, the U.S. special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, was scheduled to leave Washington on Tuesday to visit Turkey, Qatar, Afghanistan and Pakistan, focusing primarily on ""reconciliation efforts,"" according to State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki.

USA TODAY

Deal capped a series of events that seemed unlikely at beginning of year

Israel%2C Persian Gulf nations remain skeptical

Obama warns%2C %22we will turn off the relief%2C and ratchet up the pressure%22 if Iran doesn%27t meet commitments.

With the historic announcement out of Geneva on Saturday that Iran has agreed to curb its nuclear program in exchange for an easing of sanctions, President Obama scored one of the most unlikely — and potentially most meaningful — foreign policy victories of his time in office.

The capture of Osama bin Laden by Navy SEALs was thrilling and brought some closure to many Americans' collective grief over the Sept. 11 attacks, but the al-Qaeda leader posed a limited threat to American security after escaping Tora Bora, Afghanistan, in 2001.

By ending the Iraq War in his first term, Obama followed through on closing out an unpopular war and fulfilling a 2008 campaign pledge, but the endgame was inevitable and expected.

Just six months ago, it was close to fantasy for even some of the most optimistic Iran watchers that Tehran would be willing to come to the negotiation table with world powers, let alone the country it once deemed the ""Great Satan.""

This unlikely diplomatic route started with an exchange of letters between Obama and Iran's new president, Hassan Rouhani, this summer, followed with a telephone call between the two leaders earlier this year, and culminated with the agreement that was nailed down in the middle of the night in Geneva. (The White House also confirmed after the agreement was reached that senior administration officials secretly met on several occasions with Iranian officials in recent months.)

In his brief comments to Americans late Saturday to announce the interim agreement, Obama made clear that this was ""just a first step"" but an ""important first step.""

""Today, that diplomacy opened up a new path toward a world that is more secure — a future in which we can verify that Iran's nuclear program is peaceful, and that it cannot build a nuclear weapon,"" Obama said.

It's also remarkable that the Obama administration appears to have gotten most of the concessions they were seeking from Iran going into the Geneva talks. That's evidence, the White House notes, that demonstrates that years of sanctions Obama and Congress pressed on Tehran did the trick.

The concessions by Iran are meaningful. As the president noted, Iran has committed to halting certain levels of enrichment, and and cannot use its next-generation centrifuges — which are used for enriching uranium. Iran has agreed to halt work at its plutonium reactor and new inspections will be made of Iran's nuclear facilities, so the international community can make certain that Iran is keeping up their end of the bargain.

In return, the U.S. and international partners will provide ""limited, temporary, targeted, and reversible relief to Iran."" The Obama administration said on Saturday following Obama's announcement that the sanctions relief amounts to $6 billion to $7 billion — significant but hardly giving up the farm.

.

Going into this weekend's talks, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle — not to mention Israel and many Arab allies — have expressed an enormous amount of skepticism. After the deal was brokered, White House officials immediately began a round of calls to lawmakers and aides on Capitol Hill to try to begin easing concerns about the interim agreement and warn that Congress enacting new sanctions would derail the agreement.

The White House stresses that Obama is entering the deal with his eyes wide open.

""The U.S. and other P5+1 nations won't impose any new sanctions during the interim agreement, but the broader architecture of sanctions remains in place and we will continue to enforce them vigorously,"" he said Saturday night .

""And if Iran does not fully meet its commitments during this six-month phase, we will turn off the relief, and ratchet up the pressure,"" Obama warned.

But if Iran plays ball and honors their commitment, the deal could point the way out of years of isolation for Tehran and make a complicated part of the world safer.

""Now, we must use the months ahead to pursue a lasting and comprehensive settlement that would resolve an issue that has threatened our security — and the security of our allies — for decades,"" Obama said. ""It won't be easy. Huge challenges remain ahead.""

And if this interim deal leads to a comprehensive solution and a definitive endgame, the pay off to American — and international — security will be huge."

Fifth annual U.S.-China Strategic Economic Dialogue now underway

Cyber hacking, theft of intellectual property, tariff wars high on agenda

Analysts: U.S.-China mutually dependent, cannot afford conflict

Thorny issues of unbalanced trade, cyber security and intellectual property rights stand stark in the spotlight at this year's U.S.-China Strategic Economic Dialogue now underway in Washington, D.C.

Top officials from both sides, including co-chairs U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and China's State Councilor Yang Jiechi, have expressed tempered optimism for ""a new chapter"" in bilateral ties -- despite recent stumbles.

The U.S. has slammed China on unfair subsidies on solar panels and the theft of secrets owned by U.S. technology companies. China has returned its own complaints -- most recently after NSA leak Edward Snowden alleged Washington has been hacking Chinese computers.

Yet leaders of both the U.S. and China -- the world's two largest economies -- know their nations are mutually dependent, especially on economy and foreign policy. Should either party try to distance itself from the other, the result would be mutually detrimental, analysts say.

""For the United States, the biggest issue is market access to China and making sure American companies have a level playing field,"" says Fred Neumann, HSBC Co-head of Asian Economics and Managing Director in Hong Kong.

In March, the U.S. Commerce Department attempted to balance the field on the issue of solar panels. Washington slapped tariffs on Chinese-made panels in response to alleged subsidies by Beijing. Under the ruling, Chinese panels were hit with tariffs from 2.9% to 4.7%, echoing similar spats between China and Europe over solar panels and European wines

The biggest technological thorn in U.S.-China ties is ""the respect for intellectual property created by U.S. firms"" -- and lack thereof, says Chris Bronk, IT Policy Fellow at Rice University's James A. Baker Institute.

This includes ""everything from pirated movies and software to R&D and corporate strategy documents"" because ""losses will cut into the capacity for additional development if the return on investment is insufficient.""

In June, the U.S. Department of Justice charged one of China's biggest wind turbine makers, Sinovel, with stealing source codes from a U.S. competitor and manufacturing new machines. American Superconductor Corporation claims Sinovel's theft resulted in $800 million in losses.

The United States loses some $300 billion each year mostly because of Chinese intellectual property theft, said former U.S. ambassador to China John Huntsman to CNN in June.

In addition to IP theft, U.S.-China cyber security issues have come to the fore in the past month after NSA leak Edward Snowden alleged U.S. intelligence agents have been hacking hundreds of Chinese computers since at least 2009.

China claimed Snowden's revelations would ""test developing Sino-US ties"" and exacerbate an already ""soured relationship"" on cybersecurity. Snowden's assertions, on top of alleged Chinese hacking of U.S. firms, depict a clear degree of mutual mistrust. The majority of headlines in China since then have referenced ""strain,"" ""tension,"" and even ""anger"" between the U.S. and China.

The potential and ease for cyber attacks between the U.S. and China will continue to grow, says Andy Mok, managing director of Beijing-based Red Pagoda and former technology researcher for RAND Corporation.

""When every physical object has an IP address ... the return on malicious behavior becomes much higher. So on both sides -- China and the U.S. -- the targets are increasingly attractive.""

National electrical grids and transportation networks are some of the most attractive marks in each country, adds Mok.

""That said, the sky is not falling and I don't believe we are weeks or months away from a cyberwar with China that will leave the U.S. power grid in tatters and the whole country sitting in the dark for months or years.""

The chances of direct conflict are low, agree analysts. Economic, military, and technological disparity between the U.S. and China is too great. China is not ready for a clash to occur. And the U.S. -- still on the mend from the 2008 financial crisis -- is unlikely to instigate a conflict with China because of its own fiscal binds to China.

Sentiment from top officials appeared to underline this. U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew told CNN's Fareed Zakaria China's pace toward market-oriented reforms ""will probably be slower than we would like"" but expects reforms to clearly proceed.

Chinese Vice-Premier Wang Yang penned a positive editorial in the Washington Post hoping the U.S. and China would ""forge a more cooperative relationship.

He noted that 70% of U.S. companies operating in China made a profit in 2012, the 1,500 McDonalds in China have outperformed outlets elsewhere in the world and a flight between the U.S. and China now takes off once every 24 minutes."

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

He Has Previously Served As The Post'S National Editor"", 'Chief White House Correspondent', 'Deputy Assistant Managing Editor For Foreign News', 'As A Correspondent In Latin America']",Obama and Netanyahu show unusual solidarity,"President Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed an unusual degree of solidarity Wednesday on a set of shared national security concerns that have divided them in the past, signaling either a turn in their vital, if volatile, relationship or a cool tactical display of diplomatic theater.

The leaders’ joint appearance concluded a tone-setting first day of Obama’s first presidential trip to Israel, a visit celebrated with military ceremony, children’s serenades and a rare personal chemistry with a hard-line Israeli leader with whom Obama has often bickered publicly.

In particular, Obama and Netanyahu, appearing at an evening news conference, reached what seemed to be a consensus regarding Iran’s uranium-enrichment program.

Iran denies that the program is designed to develop a nuclear weapon, despite mounting evidence to the contrary. Netanyahu and Obama, who advocates a diplomatic solution to the matter, have disagreed over how much time remains before a military strike against Iran is necessary to slow down the program.

Obama said recently that he thinks Iran is a year from achieving a nuclear-weapons capability, a timeline that has differed from Israeli assessments. On Wednesday, Netanyahu moved closer to Obama’s timeline — and even softened his certainty about Iran’s intent — to allow more space for diplomacy.

“I think that there’s a misunderstanding about time,” Netanyahu said. “If Iran decides to go for a nuclear weapon — that is, to actually manufacture the weapon — then it will take them about a year.”

Obama, in turn, reiterated his support for Israel’s right to self-defense. He pledged to seek additional funding for the Iron Dome system, which he saw when he swung by an anti-missile battery after his arrival at Ben Gurion International Airport.

The system, which shot down hundreds of Gaza-fired rockets in November, will receive $200 million in U.S. funding this fiscal year. Obama said he and Netanyahu will begin talks to extend the U.S.-Israeli military aid agreement beyond its current 2017 expiration.

“Israel’s security needs are truly unique, as I’ve seen myself,” Obama said. “And flying in today, I saw again how Israel’s security can be measured in mere miles and minutes.”

The warm display by Obama and Netanyahu comes against the backdrop of a rapidly changing Middle East, shifting politically and culturally through war, protest and elections.

It is too soon to tell whether the two leaders have overcome past differences, which have played out in venues as public as the Oval Office. But the signs of a stronger U.S.-Israel relationship may put new pressure on Iran’s leaders, who Obama said Wednesday must be convinced that it is not in their interest to pursue a nuclear weapon.

Obama’s visit to the prime minister’s official residence featured a surprising levity between two men whose public posture together has more often than not been dour, angry and hectoring.

Upon arrival at Netanyahu’s residence, Obama invited the prime minister’s wife, Sara Netanyahu, to stand between the two for a photo. “A rose between the thorns,” Obama joked.

He and Netanyahu, appearing relaxed and jovial, chatted while Obama signed a guest book. The prime minister complained about how hard it was to form a government in Israel’s multi-party system, telling Obama, “You have only one party” to compete with.

“The grass is always greener, my friend,” the president replied.

When Obama later teased Netanyahu during the news conference that his “handsome sons” got their looks from their mother, a grinning Netanyahu responded, “I could say the same thing about your daughters.”

And as Israeli television captured the president’s arrival live, a shot of Obama removing his suit jacket to stroll along the tarmac captured Netanyahu doing the same moments later, a strutting camaraderie not seen previously from the two leaders.

Obama is packing a lot into his three-day trip to Israel and the occupied West Bank, where he is scheduled to meet Thursday morning with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Prime Minister Salam Fayyad.

The trip, on which he is accompanied by his new secretary of state, John F. Kerry, is a mission of remedial diplomacy after a difficult first term with the United States’ closest Middle Eastern ally and a deeply disillusioned set of Palestinian leaders.

Obama’s early demand that Netanyahu cease settlement construction in the West Bank and East Jerusalem — areas, along with Gaza, that Palestinians consider part of their future state — created a rift that became a bitter campaign issue in last year’s U.S. election.

In his 2009 address to the Islamic world in Cairo, Obama said he would not accept the “legitimacy” of continued Israeli settlement construction in the occupied territories, activity that many legal experts say violates international law.

His decision not to stop in Israel after that speech — he instead visited the Buchenwald concentration camp in Germany to highlight Jewish suffering during the Holocaust — raised concern among many Israelis that Obama did not understand their nation’s biblical roots.

Immediately on arrival Wednesday, Obama began to address those lingering concerns, which stirred resentment even among the slice of the Israeli electorate that supports the creation of a Palestinian state.

As he spoke from the airport tarmac, Obama began with a simple “Shalom,” the common Hebrew salutation, which, literally translated, means “peace.” He then set out to repair the impression he made during his first term.

“More than 3,000 years ago, the Jewish people prayed here, tended the land here, prayed to God here,” Obama said at the welcome ceremony. “And after centuries of exile and persecution, unparalleled in the history of man, the founding of the Jewish state of Israel was a rebirth, a redemption unlike any in history.”

In addition to the Iranian nuclear program, Obama and Netanyahu said they agree on the dangers posed by the widening civil war in Syria.

Obama defended his policy toward Syria — where an estimated 70,000 people have been killed — citing the international sanctions he has helped organize against President Bashar al-Assad’s government.

But he also said that the use of chemical weapons by Syria’s government, which Syrian rebels alleged occurred on Tuesday, would be a “game-changer” prompting a more direct, if unspecified, U.S. response.

Netanyahu’s hard-line Likud party lost seats in the January elections, and he now heads a governing coalition more moderate and secular than his last.

Whether that will translate into a new peace process is unclear, as Israelis focus on the domestic issues around which much of the election was fought.

Obama said he will speak Thursday about how to revive direct Israeli-Palestinian negotiations with Abbas — and, later that evening, to young Israelis in a speech at the Jerusalem International Convention Center.

Direct talks between the two parties have been dormant, except for a brief period in the fall of 2010, for more than four years.

But Obama received a boost Wednesday from Netanyahu, who in the past has endorsed the creation of a Palestinian state with so many caveats that Palestinian leaders have dismissed the notion as a ploy.

In his opening statement, Netanyahu said, “Israel remains fully committed to peace and to the solution of two states for two peoples.” It was one of his strongest public comments in favor of a Palestinian state.

Obama acknowledged that he is not bringing new ideas for how to begin those talks, saying that he “purposely did not come here with some big announcement that did not necessarily meet the realities on the ground.”

“I’m absolutely sure that there are a host of things that I could have done that would have been more deft and would have created better optics,” Obama said of his first-term efforts. “But ultimately, this is a really hard problem.”"

Most trucks carrying both NATO supplies and commercial goods to neighboring Afghanistan stopped three days ago when supporters of Pakistani politician and cricket star Imran Khan began their protest in northwest Pakistan, said Himayat Shah, head of a transportation association.

Police intervened Monday to stop the protesters from halting trucks. But transportation companies did not yet feel comfortable enough to resume their shipments, said Shah, who is based in the southern port city of Karachi where the shipments originate.

""We are afraid of the protesters because in Peshawar and Dera Ghazi Khan protesters broke the seals on the cargo containers and manhandled drivers,"" Shah said.

There are around 1,500 loaded trucks waiting to resume their journey, said another transportation official based in Karachi, Naseer Khan.

The road blocked by Khan's supporters, in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, leads to one of two routes used to ship NATO supplies to Afghanistan.

Companies have also mostly stopped sending trucks to the second crossing in southwest Baluchistan province, Shah said. Officials will review the situation on Wednesday and decide whether to let the trucks move, he said.

Imran Khan's Tehreek-e-Insaf party, which controls the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government, pledged on Saturday to block NATO shipments until the U.S. ends drone attacks targeting Islamic militants in northwest Pakistan. Protesters stopped trucks and roughed up drivers on Sunday on the outskirts of Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, before the police stepped in.

Covert CIA drone strikes in Pakistan have long been a sensitive subject, with officials regularly criticizing them in public as a violation of the country's sovereignty. The issue is more complicated, however, since the government is known to have supported at least some of the attacks in the past.

The federal government has also criticized drone strikes but has indicated it has no interest in blocking the NATO supply route, which could spark a crisis with the U.S. and other NATO countries. The police actions Monday indicated that the federal government had intervened to stop the NATO blockade.

The land routes through Pakistan have been key to getting supplies to NATO troops in Afghanistan. They now increasingly are being used to ship equipment out of Afghanistan as the U.S. seeks to withdraw most of its combat troops from the country by the end of 2014.

The routes have been closed in the past. The Pakistani government blocked the routes for seven months following U.S. airstrikes that accidentally killed two dozen soldiers on the Afghan border in November 2011. Pakistan finally reopened the routes after the U.S. apologized.

Also Tuesday, militants freed seven teachers who were kidnapped last week in the northwest Khyber tribal area while working on a polio vaccination campaign, said local government official Shabir Ahmed Khan. The teachers were released after tribal elders held discussions with the militants, Khan said.

Militants have killed more than a dozen polio workers and police protecting them over the last year in Pakistan, one of only three countries where the virus is still endemic. They claim the workers are spies and the vaccination is meant to make Muslim children sterile."

Maj. Gen. Michael J. Carey, who was removed this year as commander of the 20th Air Force, which maintains and operates the nation’s intercontinental ballistic missiles, is accused of drinking heavily, insulting his guests and other behavior “unbecoming of an officer and gentleman” during a four-day visit to Moscow in July, according to the inquiry. It was first reported by The Associated Press and The Washington Post.

After drinking for hours in bars, with people including someone identified in the report as “cigar shop lady,” General Carey was slurring his speech and stumbling through Red Square, “pouting and sulking.” The report said he tried to force a bar band to let him play with them.

The inquiry comes at a time when a large number of senior military officers have been investigated, penalized or fired over sexual improprieties, sexual violence, financial mismanagement or poor judgment."

Secretary of State John Kerry called India's national security adviser on Wednesday to personally express ""regret"" for the incident, in an indication that U.S. officials were scrambling to contain the furor

But U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, who represents Manhattan, blasted the ""misinformation and factual inaccuracy"" surrounding the case. He claimed the ""inflammatory atmosphere"" that has developed is ""unfounded,"" while cataloguing the litany of alleged offenses committed by the Indian diplomat in question.

Devyani Khobragade stands accused of lying on a visa application about how much she paid her housekeeper, an Indian national. Prosecutors say the maid received $3 per hour for her work.

""One wonders why there is so much outrage about the alleged treatment of the Indian national accused of perpetrating these acts, but precious little outrage about the alleged treatment of the Indian victim and her spouse?"" Bharara said in his lengthy and detailed statement.

""The question then may be asked: Is it for U.S. prosecutors to look the other way, ignore the law and the civil rights of victims (again, here an Indian national), or is it the responsibility of the diplomats and consular officers and their government to make sure the law is observed?""

The case, since Khobragade's arrest last week in New York, has turned into an international incident. Indian officials claim the consular official's treatment was heavy-handed, complaining that she was strip-searched and claiming she was thrown in a cell with drug addicts. They've retaliated on several fronts, including by dragging away security barriers from outside the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi.

India's foreign minister has demanded that the U.S. drop federal charges against her.

U.S. officials acknowledge Khobragade was strip-searched, but described it as standard procedure. Bharara further clarified that this was done in a private setting by a female officer. Bharara also disputed many of the claims about her treatment. He said she was, among other things, given coffee and offered food while detained.

Bharara said Khobragade, who has pleaded not guilty, wasn't handcuffed, restrained or arrested in front of her children.

Further, he said, she's alleged to have treated the housekeeper ""illegally in numerous ways,"" paying her ""far below"" minimum wage and having her work far more than the amount of time contracted. Further, he said she was alleged to have created a second contract that was concealed from the U.S. government. Plus he said the victim's family had to be brought to the United States amid an attempt in India to ""silence her.""

External Affairs Minister Salman Khurshid told reporters on Thursday that Khobragade should never have been arrested, and that the housekeeper should have been arrested instead.

Khurshid said he would speak to Kerry later Thursday.

""This is an extremely distressing and hurtful incident that needs to be addressed,"" he said.

Earlier Thursday, an official in India's External Affairs Ministry told the Associated Press that Khobragade claimed to Indian authorities in July that the maid had disappeared and was trying to blackmail her. According to the official, the housekeeper said she would not report Khobragade if she agreed to pay her more money and change her visa status to allow her to work elsewhere in the U.S.

Khobragade filed a complaint with New York police and New Delhi police, the official said. It was not clear what action was taken in the U.S., but New Delhi police issued a warrant for the maid's arrest if she returned to India.

News that Khobragade was strip-searched has chilled U.S.-Indian relations, and Kerry called India's national security adviser on Wednesday to express his regret over what happened. India has revoked privileges for U.S. diplomats in protest.

Khobragade, who was India's deputy consul general in New York, would face a maximum sentence of 10 years for visa fraud and five years for making a false declaration if convicted.

She has said she has full diplomatic immunity. The Department of State disputes that, saying hers is more limited to acts performed in the exercise of consular functions. Her work status late Wednesday was unclear.

Indian Consulate spokesman Venkatasamy Perumal said Khobragade was transferred Tuesday to India's U.N. mission, but he declined to comment further, and requests for comment to the U.N. mission's first secretary were not immediately returned.

In an email published in Indian media on Wednesday, Khobragade said she was treated like a common criminal.

""I broke down many times as the indignities of repeated handcuffing, stripping and cavity searches, swabbing, in a holdup with common criminals and drug addicts were all being imposed upon me despite my incessant assertions of immunity,"" she wrote.

Khobragade was arrested by the Department of State's diplomatic security team and then handed over to U.S. marshals in New York. She was later released after posting $250,000 bail.

White House spokesman Jay Carney said ""this isolated episode is not indicative of the close and mutually respectful ties"" that the U.S. and India share.

India retaliated against U.S. diplomats with measures that include revoking diplomat ID cards that brought certain privileges, demanding to know the salaries paid to Indian staff in U.S. Embassy households and withdrawing import licenses that allowed the commissary at the U.S. Embassy to import alcohol and food.

On Wednesday, dozens of people protested outside the U.S. Embassy, saying Khobragade's treatment was an insult to Indian women.

He writes a monthly column for The Post.

The United States has generally been a great force for the promotion of democracy around the world. But no one should be surprised that President Obama winked at last week’s military coup in Egypt. American support for democracy has never been consistent. The United States backed many “friendly” dictators throughout the 20th century and even toppled democratically elected governments or winked at coups against them — as Eisenhower did in the case of Mossadegh in Iran and Arbenz in Guatemala, and as Nixon did in the case of Allende in Chile.

Obama, however, probably did not see himself as an upholder of this particular tradition when he entered the White House (though his advisers like to compare him to Eisenhower). At the start of his presidency, Obama apologized to the Iranian people for the overthrow of Mossa­degh. In “The Audacity of Hope,” he criticized previous administrations for viewing “nationalist movements, ethnic struggles, reform efforts” as threatening and for letting such fears outweigh “our professed commitment to freedom and democracy.” He noted, too, how “the removal of democratically elected leaders in countries like Iran” had produced “seismic repercussions that haunt us to this day.”

American embarrassment about past acquiescence to dictatorships and military coups is widespread. It is a major theme of high school history textbooks and college courses on foreign policy. In recent decades, leaders of both parties have tried to push U.S. policy in a different direction. Under Ronald Reagan, the United States lent support to democratic movements that toppled “friendly” dictatorships in the Philippines, Korea, Haiti and elsewhere (though not in the Middle East). The Clinton administration worked to hold the new democracies in Eastern and Central Europe to high democratic standards. The George W. Bush administration tried, albeit unevenly, to reshape American relations with the dictatorships of the Arab world, particularly Egypt. Across the ideological spectrum, one of the big lessons of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks was that dictatorships helped breed terrorism and that the best cure would be an Arab political opening. Obama embraced that opening when it came and thus cautiously embraced the broad post-Cold War consensus. 1 of 86 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Tom Toles goes global View Photos A collection of cartoons about international news. Caption A collection of Tom Toles cartoons about international news. Wait 1 second to continue.

Yet how quickly that consensus has crumbled in the face of its first difficult test — the election of the Muslim Brotherhood and Mohamed Morsi in Egypt. And yes, that was a very difficult test. Morsi was not only an incompetent ruler but also in many ways an undemocratic one. He imposed restrictions on the media and excluded the opposition from important constitutional decisions. He ruled not so much as a dictator but as a majoritarian, which often amounted to the same thing. With a majority in parliament and a large national following, and with no experience whatsoever in the give-and-take of democratic governance, Morsi failed in the elementary task of creating a system of compromise, inclusiveness, and checks and balances. He was the opposite of a Mandela. He also failed as a manager of the national economy, unwilling to make an agreement with the International Monetary Fund and to carry out difficult but necessary economic reforms.

For his incompetence, he deserved to be voted out of office at the next election. For his majoritarian and undemocratic practices, he deserved to be placed under sustained domestic and international pressure, especially by the United States, the leading provider of aid to Egypt. He deserved to have the United States not only suspend its bilateral aid to Egypt but also block any IMF agreement until he entered into a meaningful, substantive dialogue with his political opponents, including on amending the flawed constitution he rammed through in December as well as electoral law. He ought to have been ostracized and isolated by the international democratic community. Morsi is certainly not the only democratically elected leader to have acted undemocratically in recent years, and these are the kinds of actions the United States and other democracies have generally taken in response. And all this would have been a great deal more pressure than Hosni Mubarak ever faced except in the final two weeks of his 30-year rule.

But was a military coup the best answer? The good news is that a bad leader is gone. Yet that is where the good news ends. People talk cheerfully about starting over in building an Egyptian democracy. But the slate is hardly clean, and the obstacles to Egyptian democracy are greater than they were before the coup.

The military, having effectively deposed two Egyptian leaders in 2½ years, has firmly established itself as the only real power in the country. Mohamed ElBaradei and other secular leaders are happy to have been vaulted into positions of apparent power, but one wonders how real or long-lasting their influence will be. Live by the sword, die by the sword: If the military can depose one democratically elected government, it can depose another. What happens when Egyptian “people power” returns to confront the next government, as it surely will? Once again the military will have the choice of intervening or not. Its decision is likely to have a lot to do with how the military feels about that government. So who will wield the real power when the next crisis comes?

And the next crises are entirely predictable. The economic problems that Morsi inherited and failed to solve require significant sacrifices by average Egyptians, who have already sacrificed much. Such reforms would be difficult to implement even in a calm political climate, and the post-coup climate will be anything but calm. At least some portion of the millions who voted for Morsi have probably come to two conclusions: first, that democracy is a sham; and, second, that what matters in Egypt is who has the guns. Some followers of the Muslim Brotherhood may well decide that violence is their best and only recourse. And the military will in turn impose more-severe limitations on civil liberties to combat the violence, employing — along with the police — their traditional brutal methods. They may even attempt to prevent the Brotherhood from fielding candidates in the next election. After all, having deposed one Muslim Brotherhood government, the military may not think it wise to let another, possibly angrier Brotherhood government get elected six months from now. What will the secular liberal civilians now allied with the military do as these threats to personal liberties and democratic processes metastasize? On Thursday, as the military was arresting dozens of Muslim Brotherhood leaders, ElBaradei said he would be the first “to shout loud and clearly if I see any sign of regression in terms of democracy.” One wonders when he will choose to see it, and what will happen to him if he ever does start shouting.

Egypt is not starting over. It has taken a large step backward. And the Obama administration bears much blame. It put little or no meaningful pressure on Mubarak to make even minor political reforms that might have been enough to prevent the anti-regime outburst that exploded at the end of 2010. Then it put little or no tangible pressure on Morsi to end his undemocratic practices, which might have forestalled the most recent crisis.

It has become fashionable in today’s “post-American world” milieu to argue that the United States had no ability to shape events in Egypt. This is absurd. The United States is far from being all-powerful, but neither is it powerless. Americans provide $1.5 billion a year in assistance to Egypt, $1.3 billion of which goes to the Egyptian military. It has leverage over the decisions of the IMF and influence with other international donors on whom Egypt’s economy depends. The U.S. ambassador to Egypt wields so much potential influence that Egyptians obsess daily over whom she is meeting, and they concoct wild conspiracies based on trivial events. The assumption in Egypt, as in much of the Arab world, is that nothing happens unless the United States wills it. The problem is not that the United States has no power but that the Obama administration has been either insufficiently interested or too cautious and afraid to use what power the United States has.

It has also become fashionable once again to argue that Muslim Arabs are incapable of democracy — this after so many millions of them came out to vote in Egypt, only to see Western democracies do little or nothing when the product of their votes was overthrown. Had the United States showed similar indifference in the Philippines and South Korea, I suppose wise heads would still be telling us that Asians, too, have no vocation for democracy.

So now that the military coup has occurred, how do we avoid the “seismic repercussions”? Any answer must begin with a complete suspension of all aid to Egypt, especially military aid, until there is a new democratic government, freely elected with the full participation of all parties and groups in Egypt, including the Muslim Brotherhood. The Obama administration then needs to work closely with other nations and the IMF to ensure that no loans or other forms of economic aid are provided to Egypt until democratic governance is restored. This approach runs contrary to the Obama administration’s instincts, which until now have been to work cooperatively with whoever holds power in Egypt and to avoid overt forms of pressure.

It is past time to get out of this rut of failure. Better to learn from our history than to repeat it. It will be sad if some future American president has to apologize to Egyptians for what Barack Obama did, and did not do, in 2013."

Both are key votes in Senate on use-of-force resolution

House Democrats also being briefed

First Senate hearing on Syria resolution will be Tuesday

President Obama's bid to get congressional support to use military force in Syria received a boost Monday as Republican Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham said they have more confidence the White House is developing a better strategy for dealing with Syria.

McCain and Graham are key votes Obama will need to win Senate approval for the United States to launch missile strikes againstSyria in response to an Aug. 21 chemical weapons attack that killed more than 1,400 people.

Obama said Saturday he had concluded the United States should launch an attack in response to the attack, but he said he wants approval first from Congress.

McCain and Graham have jointly expressed concerns that a military strike should be part of a broader strategy in Syria, not simply a random attack to punish the regime.

After meeting with Obama Monday, they both said they believed the White House is developing a strategy that would weaken the regime of President Bashar Assad and boost Syrian opposition forces — though they said Obama has more work to do to explain this plan.

""We still have significant concerns,"" McCain said, ""but we believe there is in formulation a strategy to upgrade the capabilities of the Free Syrian Army and to degrade the capabilities of Bashar Assad. Before this meeting, we had not had that indication.""

McCain of Arizona repeatedly said a congressional vote rejecting the use of military force would be ""catastrophic"" to U.S interests and would destroy the credibility of the nation in the eyes of both allies and adversaries. Graham of South Carolina said, ""If we don't get Syria right, Iran is surely going to take the signals that we don't care about their nuclear program. ... If we lost a vote in Congress dealing with the chemical weapons being used in Syria, what effect would that have on Iran and their nuclear program?""

Both senators criticized the administration for lacking not having a clearer strategy in Syria before now.

In Syria Monday, Assad told a journalist with the French newspaper Le Figaro that any attack risked opening a wider war in the region.

Syria has challenged the United States and France to provide proof to support their allegations that Damascus has used chemical weapons, Assad said, but that the leaders of both countries ""have been incapable of doing that, including before their own peoples.""

McCain and Graham, however, said they had no doubts about Syria's use of chemical weapons. Their meeting Monday was part of a major lobbying push by the White House.

House Democrats were briefed on a conference call by National Security Adviser Susan Rice, Secretary of State John Kerry, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Martin Dempsey.

Kerry said Sunday the administration has more proof Syrian troops used the nerve agent sarin in the Aug. 21 attack.

Tuesday will be another busy day of lobbying for the White House. Obama will meet with chairs and ranking members from key national security committees, including the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, House Foreign Affairs Committee, House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and House Armed Services Committee.

The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will conduct a hearing on the issue Tuesday afternoon in which Hagel, Kerry and Dempsey are likely to testify.

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/YouTubeDENVER—The mummified body of the leader of a New Age sect discovered by law enforcement last week near Crestone, Colorado, had been placed in a shrine and appeared to be missing its eyes, arrest affidavits reveal.When investigators arrived Wednesday, the remains had “...what appears to be glitter type makeup on around the eyes,” according to Corporal Steve Hanson of the Saguache County Sheriff Office.The documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, also describe the body—believed to be that of 45-year-old Amy Carlson, known to her followers as “Mother God”—as being adorned with Christmas tree lights. The group in question, “Love Has Won,” (LHW) has previously been described by both followers and law enforcement as a “cult.”Sheriff’s deputies found the body in the LHW headquarters in rural Saguache county just before midnight on Wednesday. Saguache County Sheriff Dan Warwick said in an interview on Monday that the body was “cared for,” and that the eyes were missing because of decomposition.Carlson’s son, Cole, told The Daily Beast that he had been expecting his mother’s death for quite some time.Decayed Corpse of ‘Cult’ Leader Found in Colorado HQ“It’s not a great thing, but hopefully this brings an end to the Love Has Won debacle,” he said in an interview Monday. “I hope the damage stops now.”“My problem is that the cult didn’t get her help,” Carlson’s sister, Chelsea Renninger, added, “They let her die.”The Saguache County Sheriff’s office was responding to a tip from a man named Miguel Lamboy, a suspected member of the group, when it visited the headquarters Wednesday. According to an affidavit, Lamboy told them “...it was obvious that Ms.Carlson was dead because her eyes were missing. Mr. Lamboy stated that the body appeared to be mummified with Ms. Carlson’s teeth exposed through the lips.”Lamboy also said he believed the mummified remains had been brought to Colorado from California.Saguache County Coroner Tom Perrin told The Daily Beast on Monday that he had not been able to officially identify the corpse via fingerprints because it is so badly decomposed. But he added that he was working to use dental records to get an identification, and estimated that the person had been dead since sometime in March.Perrin said in an email that he has not ruled out foul play, but “that he will not know for sure until the autopsy has been completed.”Perrin described the scene where Carlson’s body was found as “very decorated with murals on the walls and Christmas lights all around,” adding that he suspected Carlson was ingesting colloidal silver.Sure enough, Cole said he last spoke to his mother via Skype, and that at the time, she told him she had cancer and was eating one grilled cheese a day, but that he suspected something worse.“I know she was taking huge amounts of colloidal silver,” Cole told The Daily Beast. He added that his mother told him they were selling the silver as a cure for coronavirus under a business known as Gaia’s Whole Healing Essentials, LLC, but that the FDA made them stop.When they visited the Love Has Won HQ, a mobile home, late Wednesday, deputies with the Saguache County Sheriff’s office also found two children, ages 13 and 2, fast asleep. The Saguache County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the 13-year-old has been placed with social services. According to the arrest record, the two-year-old belongs to Lamboy, who could not immediately be reached for comment.Seven members of the “cult” were taken into custody on various charges, including child abuse and abuse of a corpse. No one has been charged in connection with Carlson’s death.When Lamboy alerted law enforcement to Carlson’s body, he told them that her name was “Lia.” But former LHW member Andrew Profaci told The Daily Beast that Carlson had at least half a dozen different names; he also suggested she may have had some kind of relationship with Lamboy.“She used that name early on before I joined the team, but she was still using it when her and Miguel were together,” said Profaci.“She never used the name ‘Amy.’ If you called her Amy you were dissing her. You were saying she’s not Mother God. Amy Carlson as far as she was concerned was nobody.”Love Has Won has not publicly announced that Carlson has died, and instead have used their own language to describe her passing. On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active. The group has a “Daily Energy Update” in which members discuss what they refer to as “divine decrees” and now share old videos of Carlson. On Wednesday afternoon, the jailed alleged sect members will have their first day in Saguache County court. Ryan Kramer, John Robertson, Jason Castillo, Obdulia Franco Gonzalez, Christopher Royer, and Sarah Raymone were each being held on two counts of child abuse and one count of tampering with a deceased human body.A seventh defendant, Karin Raymond, was being held on two counts of child abuse, one count of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of false imprisonment. At one point, Lamboy told investigators upon discovering the body, he was not allowed to leave the LHW headquarters with his son.Sheriff Warwick said that the seven defendants have public defenders from Colorado’s 12th Judicial District assigned to them. The attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.For his part, Warwick said he had never had any trouble with the group before. “They’ve always been very polite,” he said. “There have been no criminal issues.”Family members who say they have lost relatives to LHW are watching with interest, hopeful that law enforcement had intervened in a drama they could not control.“I’m sad. Largely, she was still my mom,” said Carlson’s son Cole.Still, he added, “It’s super weird to tell people, ‘My mom thinks she’s a God.’”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Special for USA TODAY

Mohammed Morsi%2C the country%27s first democratically elected leader%2C was arrested by the military

Mansour will serve as president until elections are held at an undetermined date

Mansour helped draft the presidential elections laws that saw Morsi elected in 2012

CAIRO — A big question circulating in Egypt today: Who is Adly Mansour?

The answer: a little-known constitutional judge appointed years ago by ousted former president Hosni Mubarak who has now been drafted to serve as Egypt's interim president.

Another big question: Will Mansour be a puppet for the military leadership that put him in power?

Mansour was sworn in Thursday after deposed president Mohamed Morsi, Egypt's first democratically elected leader, was ousted and placed under arrest by the military.

Mansour assumed the job under a transitional plan that appointed the head of the country's High Constitutional Court as interim president.

Mansour became head of the court June 30 after the former chief judge retired. The judge will serve in the post of president until elections are held, a date undetermined so far.

Now, the spotlight is shining on a man about whom little is known.

""Yesterday was the first time I heard his name,"" said Marwa Farid, 30, a democratic activist. ""I'm hopeful he'll be inclusive of all members of society after what we've been through over the past year.""

Mansour, 67, was born in Cairo and graduated from Cairo University with a law degree in 1967. He had been deputy chief justice since 1992.

Mohammed Hamed El Gamal, former head of the State Council, a judicial body that gives legal advice to the government, described Mansour as a ""fair man"" committed only to the ""constitution and the law"" in an interview with al Shabab, part of the Egyptian news organization Al-Ahram.

Mansour helped draft the presidential election laws that saw Morsi elected in 2012, according to Al-Ahram.

On Thursday, Mansour praised the recent street demonstrations that led to the ouster of Morsi, saying, ""I offer my greetings to the revolutionary people of Egypt.""

Some analysts expect Mansour to be a figurehead for the military, which will retain power over the government.

""The military is just going to be pulling the strings,"" said Shashank Joshi, research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London. ""That means the international community has to push very hard to make sure the constitution drafting process is inclusive and fair and credible and doesn't try to exclude Islamists from the process.""

Other analysts weren't so sure the military wants to weigh back into politics, which provoked public outrage when it ruled after ousting Mubarak and until Morsi's election a year ago.

Military leaders ""know what a thankless task it is,"" said Firas Abi Ali, a Middle East and North Africa analyst at IHS in London. ""I think the military is doing its best not to present itself as governing directly but to put forward a civilian face. The objective is not to present this as a military takeover of power.""

However, he added, the military has always been influential in Egypt. ""If you look at the structure of public services, you find retired military men in all sorts of positions, so they have a lot of influence over bureaucracy,"" he said.

Activist Gigi Ibrahim, who has fought to achieve the revolution's goals since the uprising against Hosni Mubarak in 2011, said it is too soon to judge the interim president.

""If he will fulfill the people's and revolution's demands and what we agreed on — this road map that was set — that's great, but I know this won't happen easily,"" said Ibrahim, who belongs to the Revolutionary Socialists group in Egypt.

""There needs to be a lot of pressure, with people continuously protesting to ensure these demands are fulfilled, and they're not going to happen on their own,"" she added. ""Whether (Mansour) will fulfill the demands of the people or not is what will determine whether he is a good president or a bad one.""

Congressional approval could prove difficult, as conservatives and liberal Democrats have expressed uneasiness with a military campaign.

About 200 members of Congress from both parties had signed letters demanding that the president seek congressional approval before pursuing any military action.

After Obama finished outlining his intentions in the White House Rose Garden, Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, the ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a statement that he was “very pleased that the president has listened to the suggestion we and many others have made to bring this authorization to Congress.”

DOCUMENT: U.S. chemical weapons intel

Corker, who has spoken in support of a military strike, said it was now “imperative that he immediately begins using every ounce of his energy to make his case to the American people.”

“We are glad the president is seeking authorization for any military action in Syria in response to serious, substantive questions being raised,” House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) said in a statement. “ In consultation with the president, we expect the House to consider a measure the week of September 9th. This provides the president time to make his case to Congress and the American people.”

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) signaled his support for Obama’s decision, saying in a statement that “the president’s role as commander-in-chief is always strengthened when he enjoys the expressed support of the Congress.”

Congress is on an extended summer break and is not scheduled to return to Washington until the second week of September. Earlier Saturday, the Senate’s No. 2 Republican, Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, said in a statement, “Before any military action is taken in Syria, the president should call Congress back into session and ask for a vote on the authorization to use force.”

Obama administration officials plan to brief the full membership of Congress this weekend, the first such expanded briefing for lawmakers since the Aug. 21 chemical weapons attack blamed on the Syrian government that killed 1,400 people, including at least 426 children.

Senate Republicans and Democrats will have separate conference calls Saturday afternoon with senior officials, including Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, Secretary of State John F. Kerry, National Security Advisor Susan Rice, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, and Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Pentagon’s Joint Chiefs of Staff.

A spokesman for Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said the Senate minority leader requested the call for Senate Republicans, saying that it was “important for the whole conference to have the opportunity to communicate directly with the administration on this important issue.”

Members of the House have also been invited to an in-person briefing on Sunday at the Capitol, which congressional sources also said came at the request of the House leadership. It is unclear how many members of the House would return to Washington for the briefing.

So far, only the congressional leadership and members of committees with jurisdiction over national security have participated in administration briefings.

On Thursday, 26 members of Congress took part in a more than 90-minute call with White House officials. Members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and Armed Services Committee were briefed on Friday.

Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.), one of the strongest congressional voices demanding an authorization vote, quickly posted on his Twitter account: “Thank you, Mr. President.” He later added that it was “unfortunate” he had to thank the president “for following the Constitution and the law.”

Story highlights Al Qaeda affiliate in Yemen confirms death of a key leader Peter Bergen says it amounts to a concession that the group is in deep trouble Militants in Yemen were riding high in 2011, but drone campaign has set them back, he says Bergen: Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is struggling to survive

Editor’s Note: Peter Bergen is CNN’s national security analyst, a director at the New America Foundation and the author of “Manhunt: The Ten-Year Search for bin Laden – From 9/11 to Abbottabad.” Jennifer Rowland is a program associate at the New America Foundation.

(CNN) —

On Wednesday, al Qaeda’s virulent Yemeni affiliate which is known as al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) confirmed the death of the group’s deputy leader and co-founder, Saeed al-Shihri, in a video message posted to jihadist websites.

It was a confirmation of what was long suspected: that Shihri was killed in a U.S. drone strike several months ago. And it also amounted to a concession that the al Qaeda affiliate is under an enormous amount of pressure.

In the past three years more than 30 al Qaeda leaders and other senior operatives in Yemen have been killed by U.S. drone strikes, according to a count by the New America Foundation.

Tim Hetherington for CNN Peter Bergen

The militants killed by those drone strikes included Anwar al-Awlaki, the fiery Yemeni-American preacher who served as a key ideologue for the group and has been an inspiration for a wide range of militants living in the West, including the Tsarnaev brothers who are accused of bombing the Boston Marathon in April.

Not all of the drone strikes in Yemen have found their targets. New America Foundation’s review of reliable media reporting of those strikes found that somewhere between 38 and 71 of the casualties were civilians, which included Awlaki’s 16-year-old son.

A Yemeni tribal leader close to AQAP says the drone strikes have sown mistrust within the group, where there is “a feeling that the Americans have infiltrated its ranks, especially with the killing of several of its leaders.”

Al-Shihri, a Saudi who spent six years at the Guantanamo Bay detention facility, was first reported killed in January. The Yemeni government quickly confirmed Shihri’s death, but until now AQAP had denied it.

AQAP’s video message confirming Shihri’s death was delivered by Ibrahim al-Rubaish, another Saudi who was also formerly held at Guantanamo Bay.

In the 11½-minute video, which we have reviewed, Rubaish gushes about Shihri’s devotion to al Qaeda’s cause. Rubaish says Shihri was “searching for martyrdom,” trumpeting his combat against U.S. forces in Afghanistan where he suffered serious injuries to his hands and legs, and lost an eye.

Shihri was released from Guantanamo in November 2007, and entered a Saudi rehabilitation program and was then released. Rubaish says Shihri subsequently planned an attack on the U.S. Embassy in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, which killed 10 Yemeni policemen and civilians.

But Shihri grew complacent. “Lax security measures during his telephone calls enabled the enemy to identify and kill him,” Rubaish declared in his eulogy.

Shihri’s death in the U.S. drone strike is part of larger story of AQAP decline over the past two years. In 2011, AQAP had gained significant territory in Yemen as it exploited the popular uprising against longtime Yemeni president Ali Abdullah Saleh. Its core membership grew from approximately 300 members in 2009 to around 1,000 three years later, according to Gregory Johnsen, the author of the authoritative book “The Last Refuge: Yemen, al-Qaeda, and America’s War in Arabia”.

But the jihadist group lost all of these gains within about a year. An offensive by the Yemeni army that was supported by U.S. intelligence last year pushed AQAP out of the central Yemeni province of Abyan, forcing AQAP’s fighters to flee to the remote desert province of Hadramaut.

The group has since been reduced to carrying out much smaller attacks; nothing compared to the massive suicide bombing it was able to conduct in the heart of the Yemeni capital in May 2012, which killed upwards of 100 soldiers as they rehearsed for a military parade.

And despite its focus on attacking U.S. targets, AQAP has not tried to attack one since its October 2010 attempt to plant bombs hidden in printer cartridges on cargo planes destined for the United States. (Last year AQAP plotted to send an operative with explosives in his underwear aboard a plane bound for the United States, but that operative was actually secretly working for the British and Saudi intelligence services, so the plot was never a real threat.)

Despite all the losses AQAP has suffered its capable chief bomb maker, Ibrahim al-Asiri, remains at large. Al-Asiri was the brains behind AQAP’s failed “underwear bomb” attempt to bring down a Detroit-bound U.S. airliner on Christmas Day 2009.

AQAP’s overall leader, Nasser al-Wuhayshi also remains at large, Wuhayshi is AQAP’s founder and his continued survival is surely important for the organization.

AQAP could regenerate, particularly if Yemen sees more upheaval, but for now, the group is on the run from the Yemeni army and U.S. drone strikes, fearful of spies in its midst, is unable to launch large-scale attacks, and boasts a dwindling cadre of leaders. AQAP, in short, is struggling to survive.

Shane spoke to ""Democracy Now"" host Amy Goodman about the article, which tracked the decision-making process behind the Obama administration's move to kill Awlaki in Yemen. Judging from the sourcing, Shane and two other Times reporters largely crafted their narrative from government officials -- a feature of the story that irked the paper's critics. Among them were Guardian blogger Glenn Greenwald, who called the piece ""standard government stenography,"" and writer Marcy Wheeler, who said it was ""irresponsibly credulous.""

Goodman also read Shane a statement by the ACLU and the Center For Constitutional Rights:

""This is the latest in a series of one-sided, selective disclosures that prevent meaningful public debate and legal or even political accountability for the government's killing program, including its use against citizens. Government officials have made serious allegations against Anwar al-Awlaki, but allegations are not evidence, and the whole point of the Constitution's due process clause is that a court must distinguish between the two.""

In response, Shane said that the Times was not defending the administration.

""I think that press release is a little, perhaps, imaginative in suggesting that the story was defending the administration,"" he said. ""In actual fact, the White House wouldn't talk to us either on or off the record, and we got the information that we could, you know, where we could get it. You know, as the story says, it raises questions about the claims of the administration that this targeted killing program has been precise and very careful in who it targets and who it kills.""

""Democracy Now"" also spoke to Jesselyn Raddack, a government whistleblower who has been strongly critical of the Obama administration.

""The New York Times, here again, gives a platform to the government to justify why it killed three U.S. citizens without charge, counsel or judicial review,"" she said. ""And while Scott just talked about how the article is committed to transparency and neutrality, the article actually picks up a storyline only recently floated by the government, that Awlaki was operational rather than a mere propagandist ... So I feel like The New York Times has been carrying the government's water in picking up its argument and, again, trying to make the case ex post facto that it was OK to kill Awlaki because he was somehow operational.""

On Sunday, Bobby Barbara, a LHW member, did a Facebook live proclaiming, “She has not passed away. She ascended. Her essence left her body.”She went on to describe a horrific death “...like Lou Gehrig’s Parkinsons, where her whole body was paralyzed but her brain was fully functioning.”After being reached on Facebook, Barbara declined to comment, saying “Does it matter? You’re not going to tell the truth anyway.” A person reached at a phone number previously listed on a now-defunct Love Has Won website suggested the group had been “dissolved” and declined to comment for this story.Carlson’s family says they do not believe much of what LHW claims regarding her death. “To find out that she was dead for that long without finding out she was dead is concerning,” said Renninger.The last time they heard from Carlson was in January when another sister, Tara Flores, spoke with her on the phone, she told The Daily Beast.“She said she was in a lot of pain and that she was at peace,” Flores said. After that, the family texted with Carlson, but they said they could never be sure that the person on the other end was her.The Love Has Won website went offline over the weekend, but their Facebook page remains active.

http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/02/07/iran-airs-images-allegedly-extracted-from-us-drone/,2013-02-07 00:00:00,[],Iran releases footage allegedly extracted from US drone,"Iran says it has broadcast footage on state TV allegedly extracted from a CIA drone captured in 2011 after it entered Iranian airspace near the Afghan-Iran border.

The video aired late Wednesday on Iranian shows an aerial view of an airport and a city, said to be a U.S. drone base and Kandahar, Afghanistan. The TV also showed images purported to be the Sentinel landing at a base in eastern Iran but it was unclear if that footage meant to depict the moment of the drone's seizure.

The TV also showed images purported to be the Sentinel landing at a base in eastern Iran.

""""We aren't able to confirm the authenticity of the video,"" a spokesman from the Department of Defense told Fox News.

""As you know, we don't provide details regarding matters of intelligence.""

Iran has long claimed it managed to reverse-engineer the RQ-170 Sentinel, seized in December 2011 after it entered Iranian airspace from its eastern border with Afghanistan, and that it's capable of launching its own production line for the unmanned aircraft.

After initially saying only that a drone had been lost near the Afghan-Iran border, American officials eventually confirmed the Sentinel had been monitoring Iran's military and nuclear facilities. Washington asked for it back but Iran refused, and instead released photos of Iranian officials studying the aircraft.

In another part of the video, the chief of the Revolutionary Guard's airspace division, Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, said that only after capturing the drone, Iran realized it ""belongs to the CIA.""

""We were able to definitively access the data of the drone, once we brought it down,"" said Hajizadeh.

He described the Sentinel's capture as a huge scoop for Iran, saying that at the time, Tehran did not rule out a possible punitive U.S. airstrike over the drone.

In addition, the TV also showed images of an Iranian helicopter transporting the drone, as well as its disassembled parts being carried on a trailer.

In November, Iran claimed that the U.S. drone had violated its airspace. The Pentagon said the aircraft, which came under fire but was not hit, was over international waters.

In an attempt to embarrass Washington, Iran has also claimed to have captured several American drones, most recently in December, when Tehran said it seized a Boeing-designed ScanEagle drone — a less sophisticated aircraft — after it entered Iranian airspace over the Persian Gulf.

U.S. officials said there was no evidence that the latest claims were true.

Also Thursday, the semi-official Fars news agency published photos reportedly depicting a domestic production line of ScanEagle drones. The photos show several drones in a workshop.

Iran has said before that it's making ScanEagle copies and putting them into service, but has not offered proof for those claims.

Fars also quoted deputy defense minister, Mohammad Eslami, as saying that Iran has also established a ""production line for the drones in foreign countries."" He did not elaborate, and it was not clear if he was referring to Syria or Lebanon's Hezbollah group, Iran's top regional allies.

The drone capture has further escalated tensions between the U.S. and Iran, which is under international sanctions over its suspect nuclear program.

The U.S and its allies believe Iran is pursuing a nuclear weapon. Iran has repeatedly denied the charge, claiming its nuclear activities are for peaceful purposes only, such as power generation and cancer treatment.

The latest Sentinel footage came as the U.S. tightened sanctions to pressure the Iranian government to limit its nuclear program and restrictions on institutions that Washington says are stifling political dissent and censoring speech.

Among the expanded measures announced Monday by the Treasury Department is a move to deny Iran access to revenue garnered from its oil exports. Under the latest sanctions, Iran would only be able to use revenue from its oil sales in a country that purchased its crude -- now mostly big Asian economies such as China and India -- which would significantly limit its access to the money.

Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Thursday rejected proposals for direct talks with United States over its nuclear program, marking the first reaction to the proposals for the one-on-one talks.

Iran and six world powers, including the U.S., are scheduled to resume nuclear negotiations later this month.

Previously']",Obama presses Syria case to the public in White House address,"President Obama said Tuesday that he would seize one last diplomatic opening to avoid a military strike on Syria, while trying to convince a skeptical United States that it must retaliate against the Middle Eastern nation’s alleged use of chemical weapons if the effort fails.

In a nationally televised prime-time address from the East Room of the White House, Obama cautiously embraced a Russian proposal that the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad give up its stockpile of chemical weapons, signaling that he would drop his call for an assault on the regime if Assad complies.

But with little guarantee that diplomacy would prevail, Obama spent the bulk of his 17-minute speech trying to directly address the concerns that have moved public opinion and Congress against him over the past week.

The president argued that a military response is in the national interest, although he conceded that Syria poses no direct threat to the United States. Obama said that not responding to Assad’s alleged use of chemical weapons in an Aug. 21 attack that killed more than 1,400 outside Damascus would allow him to use them again and would embolden other regimes hostile to the United States, including Iran.

At the same time, Obama made an emotional appeal to Americans’ basic sense of right and wrong, invoking the use of gas in World War I and the Holocaust in arguing that the United States has the “exceptional” responsibility to use its military power to punish nations that use weapons of mass destruction. Obama went so far as to urge Americans to watch graphic videos of the aftermath of the attack in Syria.

“What kind of world will we live in if the United States of America sees a dictator brazenly violate international law with poison gas and we choose to look the other way?” Obama said. “Our ideals and principles, as well as our national security, are at stake in Syria, along with our leadership of a world where we seek to ensure that the worst weapons will never be used.”

(Read the transcript of President Obama’s speech.)

The speech was an unusual plea from a president who had risked his and his nation’s credibility on whether he could get Congress to support him, even as he has put off the possibility of a military strike for the moment and has maintained that as commander in chief he doesn’t need congressional approval to launch one in any case.

As it became clear this week that lawmakers probably would oppose the use of force, perhaps overwhelmingly, the Russian proposal offered Obama a potential way out. At his request, Congress has postponed votes on whether to authorize a strike.

The address Tuesday followed an extraordinary, fast-moving and unpredictable two days in American politics and international diplomacy.

Obama began the week planning to make a clear-cut case for attacking the Assad regime. But on Monday morning, an offhand remark by Secretary of State John F. Kerry prompted the Russians to propose that Syria, an ally, surrender its chemical weapons to avoid strikes.

That set off a flurry of negotiations by American, European, Russian and United Nations officials in search of a diplomatic deal. The talks gained steam on Tuesday when the Assad government said it was open to the proposal, for the first time acknowledging that it possesses chemical weapons, and agreed to sign an international pact banning their use.

But by late afternoon, momentum behind a diplomatic solution was beginning to wane. Western and Russian diplomats clashed over whether the United Nations would authorize military action to degrade Syria’s chemical weapons programs if a diplomatic agreement were violated.

Western diplomats insisted that the threat of strikes was a critical ingredient that would ensure Syrian compliance. But Russian officials said that a diplomatic route would work only if the United States and its allies renounced the use of force.

And experts questioned whether it would be possible to transfer stockpiles of chemical weapons to an international monitor amid a civil war that has killed more than 100,000 people.

Still, Obama said Tuesday night that he wants to give the process more time, and he dispatched Kerry to meetings in Europe to work out the details of a potential U.N. agreement.

The president said he turned to Congress for authorization because he thinks that any action would be stronger if backed by lawmakers, especially after more than a decade of war.

Obama’s speech did not immediately appear to change minds on Capitol Hill. A number of Democratic senators expressed support afterward for his diplomatic approach, while remaining wary of military action. Most Senate Republicans who were on the fence remained unconvinced.

“I don’t think the case for military action has been made,” said Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa). But, he added, “the Russian proposal to force Assad to turn over chemical weapons to international monitors presents a possible alternative.”

Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said they regret that Obama “did not speak more forcefully” about providing military assistance to moderate opposition groups in Syria and for not laying out “a clearer plan to test the seriousness” of the Russian proposal.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) argued that the administration’s threat of force has already yielded benefits.

“The president using the credible threat of American military action to bring diplomatic solutions back to the table demonstrates the strength of his leadership and his willingness to exhaust every remedy before the use of force,” she said.

Obama had previously taken his argument to Capitol Hill to lobby lawmakers, saying that he would pursue the diplomatic option but that the United States must be prepared to strike if it failed.

Lawmakers emerging from the meetings agreed that the diplomatic route should be given a chance.

House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio), one of the few members of either party in the House who backs a military strike, said he suspects the new proposal is a stalling tactic.

“Clearly, diplomacy is always a better outcome than military action,” he said. But, he added, “I’m somewhat skeptical of those that are involved in the diplomatic discussion today. . . . I’m skeptical of it because of the actors that are involved — simple as that.”

Lawmakers predicted that it could take until next week, or longer, before a decision is made in Congress.

“I don’t think we need to rush out right now with our hair on fire,” said Sen. Bob Corker (Tenn.), the ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. “Our best course of action is to pause.”

Obama’s address came after his administration has struggled to sell his case to the public and Congress, offering muddled messages about the reasons for intervention and the nature of a potential attack.

The president and aides have alternatively argued that a strike would constitute a significant intervention that could help undermine Assad’s stance in the Syrian civil war, and that it would be an extremely limited intervention that would leave Assad in power. Obama has made clear that he will not put U.S. troops on the ground.

About a year ago, he set a “red line” against the use of chemical weapons. When he concluded that the Syrian regime had launched a sarin attack, he prepared to unilaterally order strikes — only to change his mind and seek congressional support.

National security experts said it made sense for Obama to delay action given that his hand may be strengthened even if the diplomatic solution fails.

“It gets him out of his disastrous political mess,” said Rosa Brooks, a former defense official in the Obama administration and Georgetown professor. Obama will be able to say he made every effort to avoid a military conflict, making it “a lot easier for him to make the case for force.”

But others said that even a deal would have downsides.

“You can be seduced into thinking you’re working the problem,” said Jon Alterman, a former State Department official now at the Center for Strategic & International Studies.” The problem is the broader consequences of a longer-term insurgency in Syria which attracts jihadis, brings in neighboring countries and destabilizes the region.”

Rebel commanders disagree on the level of coordination they expect with the U.S. and its allies, and made it clear they hope the United States will do more than launch the limited strikes President Obama has proposed to deter Assad from using chemical weapons. The rebels have been disappointed by America’s reluctance to get involved more deeply in the conflict.

The issue is now before Congress. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed an amended resolution Wednesday approving military action to change the battlefield momentum in Syria away from the government.

But many members of Congress, particularly in the House, have expressed deep skepticism about military involvement.

If the U.S. strikes, rebels said Thursday, they will be ready to take advantage, particularly around Damascus, the capital, where they say insurgents are infiltrating in preparation to attack.

“We are ready once the first rocket is launched,” said Col. Qassim Saad Eddine, spokesman for the Supreme Military Council, which oversees the U.S.-backed Free Syrian Army. “We will attack the military sites, not just in one province, but all over Syria.”

Saad Eddine said Free Syrian Army chief of staff Gen. Salim Idriss and the rebel command have been told they would receive some notice of a U.S. attack, perhaps a few hours in advance, but have not coordinated targets with U.S. or allied military personnel.

“The targets are already known,” he said, referring to Syrian military and command installations.

But one opposition commander, Col. Abduljabbar Akidi, who heads the Free Syrian Army contingent in northern Syria’s Aleppo province, said by Skype that coordination on potential targets is already underway in joint operation rooms in Turkey and Jordan with “supporting countries,” including the United States.

“If they strike the regime with a crippling hit, we will finish them off,” Akidi said.

The Obama administration has long expressed concern about Al Qaeda-linked militants being a major force in the rebel movement, and several members of Congress have cited that concern in expressing doubts about U.S. military involvement.

A key question is whether rebel coordination would involve only the Free Syrian Army or extend to other factions in the fragmented opposition. In practice, disparate rebel brigades often unify in battle.

Some insurgents distrustful of the West worry that U.S military planners might try to attack Al Qaeda-linked rebel factions under the cover of an assault on Assad’s forces.

Nonetheless, after having been outgunned for more than two years, the rebels are clearly relishing the prospect of having U.S. firepower on their side. Commanders say they want to be in position to pounce, especially in Damascus, the seat of Assad’s power, which is expected to be the focus of any U.S. bombardment.

“We are going to be ready to take advantage of the areas after a strike,” said Abu Jamal, nickname for a commander with the Farouq Brigade, one of the largest insurgent groups.

In preparation for a possible U.S. attack, said one rebel spokesman, insurgents outside Damascus were sending fighters into the capital with light weapons to prepare to seize government buildings. Some are said to be stockpiling weapons for an offensive.

“All sides are working together to take Damascus if the American strikes are truthful, and if they are targeted at the regime,” said Abu Harith, nickname for a spokesman with the Ansar al Islam brigade in Damascus, one of the largest groups in the capital.

Assad’s forces have been fighting hard to clear Damascus’ suburbs of rebel forces. The Obama administration accuses government forces of launching chemical weapons attacks in suburbs Aug. 21.

The rebels are not the only ones making preparations. Syrian officials have also had time to get ready.

The opposition has reported that the Syrian military has been moving missiles, aircraft and other assets from exposed bases to less vulnerable sites. Witnesses say they have seen Syrian soldiers crowding into schools and other facilities in Damascus.

To be effective, the opposition says, U.S. strikes must hit key targets such as the Mezzeh military air base in the capital or the army’s 155th Brigade compound near Damascus, reported site of Scud missile launches.

Abu Jamal of the Farouq Brigade said there were indications that the government was sending in tanks, other armored vehicles and artillery from embattled Homs province to bolster the defense of Damascus.

Rebels are hoping for a surge in arms supplies before any U.S. strike, but the evidence so far is mixed. In southern Syria, one commander has reported an increased number of arms, including antitank weapons, arriving via neighboring Jordan. But there has yet to be any uptick in materiel from Turkey, said a commander in the north.

It was not clear whether there is any connection between the prospect of U.S. strikes and the reported defection to Turkey this week of a former Syrian general and ex-defense minister, Ali Habib Mahmoud, a member of Assad’s Alawite sect no longer considered a key player in the government or its defense apparatus.

(CNN) —

There have been Christians in the Middle East since the time of, well, Christ.

Now that two millennium-long history could be in danger.

Islamist thugs have attacked dozens of churches across Egypt in the past few days, burning many of them down.

Tim Hetherington for CNN Peter Bergen

The attacks seemed to be protests against the brutal military government crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood that killed many hundreds of Egyptian Islamists over the past week.

Pope Tawadros II, the leader of Egypt’s Christian Copts, met publicly with top military officers as they announced the coup that removed President Mohamed Morsy and his Muslim Brotherhood government from power in early July.

Christians, who make up 10% of the population, and other minorities had complained that a new constitution that had been passed by the Morsy government infringed on their rights.

For some Islamist militants, now it’s payback time. According to one report, 52 churches across Egypt were attacked in 24 hours last week. The Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights has counted at least 30 churches attacked, along with other Christian facilities.

After Morsy was removed from power, a mob armed with axes hacked a Christian businessman to death near Luxor in southern Egypt and then continued their rampage in the village of Nagaa Hassan, burning dozens of Christian homes and killing three other Christians.

Today there are more than 10 million Christians in the Middle East and they make up an estimated 5% of the Middle East’s population.

A century ago they made up an estimated 20%.

Much of this fall can be attributed to factors such as emigration and the high birth rates of many Arab Muslims, but some of it is also attributable to the increasing marginalization and targeting of Christians; a worrying trend being seen not just in Egypt but also in other Arab countries.

Take Syria. Many Syrian Christians have tacitly supported the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, which draws much of its strength from the small Shia Alawite sect and therefore has historically favored and protected Syria’s other religious minorities.

As a result, the jihadists who have come to dominate a significant portion of the Syrian rebel movement have supplemented their war against the government with attacks that target Christians. On June 27, a suicide bombing in a Christian area of Damascus killed at least four people.

Al Qaeda-affiliated rebels are suspected of killing an Italian priest who had spent most of his life rehabilitating a monastery north of the Syrian capital of Damascus and who disappeared last month. The Rev. Paolo Dall’Oglio had reportedly been trying to secure the release of several hostages in the custody of an al Qaeda-aligned group.

Meanwhile, in March in Benghazi, Libya, where a militant attack on a U.S. government complex left four Americans dead in September 2012, around 60 Christians were rounded up by extremists and handed over to the government on suspicion of immigrating from Egypt illegally. The militants tortured several of their captives, killing one of them.

That bout of vigilantism followed the arrest in February of four Christians accused of proselytizing to Muslim Libyans.

The consequence of such attacks and harassment has been an exodus of Christians from the region.

Residents of northeastern Syria, where Christians have historically been concentrated, estimate that one-third of the Christians there have fled the country during the past two years.

Similarly in Iraq, since the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003, the Christian Iraqi population may have dropped by as much as 50%, according to a CIA assessment.

And despite making up only about 3% of the Iraqi population, Christians accounted for half the Iraqis who fled the country in 2010, about 200,000 people.

Egypt’s religious tensions have a longer history than the recent clashes between Muslim Brotherhood supporters and Christians. Although then-President Hosni Mubarak kept a tight lid on the country’s Islamist extremists, clashes between Muslims and Christians erupted sporadically throughout the ‘90s.

But since Mubarak’s fall, extremist violence against Christians has picked up in Egypt. In early October 2011, Egypt saw its worst instance of sectarian violence in 60 years, when two-dozen Christians died in clashes with the military.

As a result of these kinds of attacks, by one estimate, around 100,000 Christians left Egypt in 2011.

This kind of homogenization has happened before in the Middle East, which boasted a sizable Jewish population in the ‘50s. But with the creation of the state of Israel and the rise of Arab nationalism and then Islamism, the region has become more hostile to non-Muslims.

Around World War II there were 100,000 Jews in Egypt, a community that had existed in Egypt since the time of the pharaohs.

Now, there are a handful of synagogues operating in Cairo. They are heavily guarded and generally empty as they cater only to the few dozen elderly Jews who are still left in Egypt.

One can only hope that this is not to be the fate of the Christians of the Middle East.

The brigade, known as the Rakkasans, has again and again been at the vanguard of the American war effort in some of the toughest parts of Afghanistan and Iraq over the years, and some of its soldiers and officers have had as many as six combat tours. Most returned home this month to their base at Fort Campbell, Ky. But on this last deployment, they were ordered to ride along while the Afghan forces drive and try to find their own way to take on security responsibilities that will allow a final American withdrawal from the war.

“With regards to our brigade, that’s how this war is going to end,” said Col. R. J. Lillibridge, the Third Brigade’s commander, who has deployed five times since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. “It’s not going to be some huge battle. It’s going to end quietly.”

Colonel Lillibridge has adopted a mantra. He uses it to explain why he no longer gives helicopter rides to Afghan officers when they go on leave, why he refuses to give his counterparts fuel when they run out, and why he stands by as their leaders plan and lead missions that appear, at least on the surface, somewhat dubious. “We can’t care more than the Afghans do,” he said.

That philosophy was on display the morning the Americans accompanied the Afghans to search two villages in a remote part of eastern Afghanistan."

She Joined The Paper In']",Kerry warns Russia against selling high-performance missiles to Syria,"Secretary of State John F. Kerry on Thursday cautioned Russia against selling advanced ­surface-to-air missiles to Syrian government forces, as U.S. officials warned that the delivery of the arms would threaten Israel and undercut efforts to reach a political agreement.

“We’ve made it crystal clear that we prefer that Russia would not supply them assistance,” Kerry said during a news conference with Italy’s new top diplomat. “That is on record. That has not changed.”

Kerry declined to directly denounce the reported agreement between Russia and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, but his warning to Moscow was unmistakable.

The United States has long said that the proliferation of surface-to-air missiles “is potentially destabilizing with respect to the state of Israel,” Kerry said. “We have made it very clear historically that that is a concern of the United States.”

Russia has long supplied Assad’s forces, but the potential sale of antiaircraft weapons reported Thursday by the Wall Street Journal threatens to undermine the agreement that Kerry won in Moscow this week to press jointly for peace talks between Assad and his U.S.-backed opponents.

Moscow has previously sparred with Western governments over sales of helicopter and tank parts to the embattled Assad regime. But the S-300 missiles, if delivered, would represent a huge leap in Syria’s ability to defend against Israeli airstrikes and any effort to impose a no-fly zone in support of anti-Assad rebels.

The S-300 system, considered one of the most potent air-defense systems in use, can track as many as 100 incoming aircraft or missiles at once, and engage up to a dozen, at long range.

“It would be a game-changer,” a senior Western diplomat said of the reported decision to offer the missiles to Assad. The diplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because details of the reported offer remain classified, speculated that Moscow could be seeking leverage ahead of talks on a possible political settlement to the Syrian crisis.

Russia was heavily criticized in 2007 when it signed a deal to sell S-300 batteries to Iran for $800 million. Russian officials eventually terminated the contract, citing new U.N. resolutions banning the export of advanced missile systems to Tehran.

“After discussions with us, they did decide not to provide the missiles to the Iranians,” recalled Dennis Ross, who was a senior Middle East adviser to the Obama administration in 2010, when Russia halted the missile sale to Iran. “If they proceed now, it hardly signals that they are prepared to walk away from Assad.”

Kerry has declined to draw a comparison between the military aid provided by Moscow to the Syrian government and what has, until now, been the U.S. choice to send only humanitarian and nonmilitary assistance to the rebel forces. President Obama is considering whether to reverse that decision and provide arms to the rebels, as some Arab states are doing.

Kerry met earlier Thursday with the foreign minister of Jordan, which is staggering under the weight of more than 500,000 Syrian refugees. Kerry said that about $43 million of a new $100 million U.S. aid package pledged for Syrian refugees will go to Jordan.

“Jordan feels the impact of what is happening more than any other country,” he said.

Jordanian Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh said the refugees account for 10 percent of Jordan’s population, and the figure is expected to at least double this year.

Judeh was headed next to Moscow to discuss a potential Syrian transitional government.

“It has to be a transitional period that results in a political solution that includes all the segments of Syrian society, no exclusion whatsoever,” Judeh said, while preserving “Syria’s territorial integrity and unity.”

Jordan is expected to play a key role in marshaling Arab support for Middle East talks. Jordan was the second Arab state to make peace with Israel, after Egypt.

“There have been many failed attempts, false starts, and there were attempts that resulted in limited success, perhaps, and we should build on all that,” Judeh said in Rome, where he and Kerry arranged their second meeting in as many weeks. Kerry met Wednesday with Israeli Justice Minister Tzipi Livni, who is her government’s chief peace negotiator.

“This is why it’s important to look at the history and share our thoughts and our ideas and our approaches with each other, so that we can try and bring the parties back to the negotiating table, perhaps in a different way and more effective way this time,” Judeh said.

The Obama administration has set no deadline for Kerry’s effort to draw Israel and the Palestinians to the table and has revealed few details of what he is urging each side to consider once talks begin.

Kerry has said that he wants to move quickly. Events in the tumultuous Middle East, or spoilers on either side, have doomed past negotiations.

“Each day that goes by in the Middle East always brings the ability for someone, somehow, to create events that always threaten the ability of the process to continue smoothly,” Kerry said.

Israel’s detention of an important Muslim leader Wednesday for questioning sparked anger among Palestinians, who accused Israel of human rights violations.

Judeh called on both sides to avoid provocations.

(CNN) —

All Americans who presented themselves at the United Nations camp in Bor, South Sudan, were evacuated safely Sunday amid deadly violence in the country, the State Department said. A State Department official said about 15 Americans were flown out.

U.S. personnel are working to confirm that no other U.S. citizens remain in Bor in need of evacuation, a State Department official said.

“This morning, the United States – in coordination with the United Nations and in consultation with the South Sudanese government – safely evacuated American citizens from Bor, South Sudan,” State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement. “U.S. citizens and citizens from our partner nations were flown from Bor to Juba on U.N. and U.S. civilian helicopters. The United States and the United Nations, which has the lead for securing Bor airport in South Sudan, took steps to ensure fighting factions were aware these flights were a humanitarian mission.”

“The U.S. government is doing everything possible to ensure the safety and security of United States citizens in South Sudan. We are working with our allies around the world to connect with and evacuate U.S. citizens as quickly and safely as possible,” Psaki said.

The United Nations moved noncritical staff out of South Sudan’s capital, Juba, across the border into Uganda on Sunday, as the violence spread inside the world’s newest country.

U.N. civilian staff were moved from a compound in the flashpoint town of Bor to Juba on Saturday, the same day a U.S. mission to airlift Americans out was aborted when the aircraft came under fire.

U.S. President Barack Obama said in a letter to congressional leaders Sunday that 46 U.S. service members took part in the mission, and he noted he “may take further action to support the security of U.S. citizens, personnel and property, including our Embassy, in South Sudan.”

Four U.S. troops were wounded in the attack in Bor and were expected to be moved to the U.S. military hospital at Landstuhl, Germany, a senior U.S. official told CNN earlier Sunday.

One of the injured “went through some pretty serious surgery” after being taken to Nairobi, Kenya, for wounds from the gunshots fired at the aircraft. All four have been able to speak to their families.

Thousands displaced

Hundreds of people have been killed in a week of fighting, which has spread from Juba to oil fields farther north.

South Sudanese President Salva Kiir blamed soldiers loyal to his former vice president, Riek Machar, for starting the violence.

Up to 40,000 civilians have taken refuge in United Nations bases in the country, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Sunday.

“There are many more thousands of people who are very much in fear and vulnerable, and at this time, the priority of the United Nations is to (protect) the lives of civilians,” Ban told a news conference in the Philippines.

The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimates some 62,000 people have been displaced in total, with five of South Sudan’s ten states affected by the violence.

The U.N. has said some 20 people were killed during an attack Thursday by about 2,000 armed youths on a U.N. peacekeeping base in Jonglei state. Two Indian peacekeepers were also killed.

After the attack, the assailants fled with arms, ammunition and other supplies, the U.N. said.

’We will not be intimidated’

In a statement Sunday, the U.N. said it had made the decision to relocate noncritical staff from Juba to Entebbe, Uganda, as “a precautionary measure to reduce pressures on its limited resources,” while still providing assistance and shelter to more than 20,000 civilians who have gathered at its compounds in the capital.

The U.N. Mission in South Sudan is planning to reinforce its military presence in Bor and Pariang, the organization said. Plans are also under way to relocate all noncritical staff from the U.N. compound near Bentiu in Unity state, and reinforcements will also be sent in.

“We are not abandoning South Sudan. We are here to stay, and will carry on in our collective resolve to work with and for the people of South Sudan,” U.N. envoy Hilde F. Johnson said in the statement. “To anyone who wants to threaten us, attack us or put obstacles in our way, our message remains loud and clear: we will not be intimidated.”

Ban said the U.N. would “transfer our assets from other peacekeeping missions,” such as the one in the Democratic Republic of Congo and other areas, to the troubled country.

“We also seeking support from other key countries who can provide the necessary assets,” he said. “We are in shortage of capacity. When the United Nations compound was overrun by 2,000 armed elements, we were having difficulties.”

Echoing calls from Western governments, Ban urged an end to the violence and called on Kiir and Machar “to come to the table and find a political way out of this crisis.”

“They are responsible to the people of South Sudan to end the crisis and find the political means of addressing their differences,” he said.

Ban said he had dispatched a special representative to Juba to work with the U.N. envoy in the city. Washington is also sending an envoy.

Tensions have been high in South Sudan since July, when Kiir dismissed Machar and the rest of the Cabinet. The move inflamed tensions between Kiir’s Dinka community and Machar’s Nuer community.

South Sudan formally split from Sudan in 2011 after a referendum, following decades of conflict. Numerous armed groups remain active in the oil-rich country.

Newser

A jarring report out of North Korea claims that Kim Jong Un's former girlfriend was executed by a firing squad last week.

Chosun Ilbo,an English language newspaper in South Korea, said unnamed sources in China told it that Hyon Song Wol (of ""Excellent Horse-Like Lady"" fame) was arrested on Aug. 17 along with about a dozen others; Hyon was a singer, and a number of the others were members of the Unhasu Orchestra.

They were accused of making a sex tape and selling it and were shot three days later for violating the country's pornography laws. A source said some allegedly had Bibles in their possession, and all were treated as political dissidents.

The report has not been independently verified by other media outlets. Chosun Ilbo is one of Seoul's main daily newspapers.

NEWSER:Cory Booker 'weird' about sexuality, opponent says

Chosun Ilbo said it is unclear if Kim's wife had anything to do with the deaths; before becoming the spouse of the ""dear leader"" she was also in that same orchestra. Kim had reportedly known Hyon for about 10 years, and their relationship ended at the orders of Kim Jong Il, though rumors have persisted that the two were having an affair.

New York magazine said that while it's difficult to verify reports like these, the fact that it's one of South Korea's main daily papers reporting it lends it a sliver of believability.

More harsh treatment in North Korea: A comedian was recently pulled from the stage and sent to a coal mine.

A resettlement plan under discussion in Washington and other capitals is aimed at relieving pressure on Middle Eastern countries straining to support 1.6 million refugees, as well as assisting hard-hit Syrian families.

The State Department is “ready to consider the idea,” an official from the department said, if the administration receives a formal request from the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees, which is the usual procedure.

The United States usually accepts about half the refugees that the U.N. agency proposes for resettlement. California has historically taken the largest share, but Illinois, Florida, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia are also popular destinations.

U.N. refugee officials, diplomats and nongovernmental relief groups plan to discuss possible resettlement schemes at a high-level meeting this week in Geneva. Germany already has committed to taking 5,000 people.

“It was probably inevitable that in this crisis, with these overwhelming numbers, governments would start moving in this direction,” said Lavinia Limon, chief executive officer of the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, a Virginia-based advocacy and service group. “But there will be resistance.”

The Obama administration supports rebels trying to oust Syrian President Bashar Assad, but is wary of deeper involvement in Syria.

The issue is politically sensitive on several levels.

Congress strongly resisted accepting Iraqi refugees, including interpreters who had worked with U.S. forces, after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion. Most lawmakers share White House caution about getting more engaged in Syria and may have little appetite for a major influx.

But Susan Rice, President Obama’s new national security advisor, and Samantha Power, Obama’s nominee for U.S. ambassador to the U.N., both have been strong advocates for refugees. They may make the White House more receptive to at least a partial opening.

Homeland security officials require careful vetting of refugees, with multiple interviews and background checks before they are allowed to enter the country. Under normal circumstances, the screening process can take a year or longer.

U.S. officials are likely to be extra careful with Syrian refugees. As Islamic militants take a more prominent role in the rebel forces, officials worry about fighters with Al Qaeda ties trying to enter the country. Two resettled Iraqis were convicted of trying to send arms to Al Qaeda from their home in Bowling Green, Ky.

The refugee dilemma is more acute for countries that lie on Syria’s borders.

Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon, which have absorbed the bulk of the refugees, worry that a resettlement plan could actually widen the flood if Syrians see a chance for a better life in North America, Europe or Australia.

Jordan and Lebanon each have taken in about 500,000 refugees and Turkey has more than 375,000, according to the U.N. refugee agency. It predicts that the total number of refugees will double to 3.2 million by the end of the year.

Turkey already has demanded that the West take some its refugees, even proposing an airlift to fly them abroad. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has faced angry protests against his government for giving refuge to so many Syrians, declared last month, “We are the first victims of the Syrian situation.”

Some Middle Eastern officials worry they may get stuck housing and feeding refugees for months or years while the West does the vetting, leading to an even longer logjam and more domestic political turmoil.

“Their view is that unless this involves big numbers, it’s not worth doing,” said a European official, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the subject. “You need to be talking about tens of thousands of people.”

Western officials try to discourage poor foreigners who are seeking a more comfortable life or business opportunities in the West. They say resettlement is only for those who can’t go home, and seek to dispel notions that an easy life awaits.

According to a State Department publication aimed at refugees, “Cars are not provided.... Most Americans value self-reliance and hard work. They expect newcomers to find jobs as soon as possible and to take care of themselves and their families.”

Advertisement

Another sensitive issue is who qualifies for resettlement. Western countries often prefer intact, well-educated families with familiar religious backgrounds.

But experts say 80% of the Syrian refugees are women and children, many with war-related injuries or psychological problems that could hamper finding work or going to school.

Kirk Johnson, founder of the List Project, which has pushed for Iraqi resettlement, said it may be difficult to sell Syrian resettlement to Congress. He said it would require an advocacy effort and sympathetic lawmakers, “and I don’t seen either of those necessary ingredients.”

Yet most refugee advocates predict that Americans will ultimately help the Syrians.

“Americans have a long tradition of welcoming refugees,” said Daryl Grisgraber, a Washington-based Middle East specialist at Refugees International, which provides advocacy and services for refugees. “They’ll respond here, too.”

Ideally, the White House seeks intelligence that links the attack directly to Assad or someone in his inner circle to rule out the possibility that a rogue element of the military decided to use chemical weapons without Assad's authorization. Another possibility that officials would hope to rule out: that stocks had fallen out of the government's control and were deployed by rebels in a callous and calculated attempt to draw the West into the war.

(CNN) —

President Barack Obama will speak to the nation Tuesday, trying to build public support for a military strike against Syria.

His request to Congress to endorse action reaches the House and Senate at an extraordinarily difficult moment. Vote counts suggest that the president might not win the support he is seeking.

Democrats and Republicans are uncertain about backing the president. The public remains skeptical as well. According to one NBC poll, only 42% of the public endorsed using military force against Syria. After Afghanistan and Iraq, the nation is weary of war. The bar has been raised for further intervention.

Larry Levanti Julian Zelizer

Although presidential speeches rarely are able to fundamentally reshape public opinion, Obama must give his strongest effort if he does not want to end up in an embarrassing situation for his administration and one that could undercut the military effort that he is proposing.

If Obama is going to deliver a speech that matters, he must answer some basic questions about the Syrian intervention:

Why are we entering this conflict?

For many Americans, the arguments behind American intervention in Syria remain murky. This is not just about Syria being a confusing and complex situation, but also has to do with a general uncertainty about the objectives of American foreign policy in 2013.

In each era of foreign policy, policymakers have put forth strong ideological arguments that framed public policy about war and peace. Each period had substantial numbers of dissenters, but at least there was something concrete to argue about. During the 1930s and early 1940s, the fight against fascism was the driving force behind decisions about intervention. “Yesterday, December 7, 1941 – a date which will live in infamy – the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan,” President Franklin D. Roosevelt explained the next day, when asking Congress for a declaration of war.

From the mid-1940s through the late 1980s, the fight against communism was the focal point of policy. Since that time, the objectives of American foreign policy have been less clear. When President Truman asked for congressional support to use military power in Korea in July 1950, he said that the conflict in Korea “has made it clear, beyond all doubt, that the international Communist movement is willing to use armed invasion, to conquer independent nations.”

In the early 1990s, policymakers turned their attention to rogue states such as Iraq that were said to pose dangers to the stability of key regions. After 9/11, attention turned to international terrorist networks like al Qaeda.

On September 20, 2001, President Bush told the nation, “The enemy of America is not our many Muslim friends. It is not our many Arab friends. Our enemy is a radical network of terrorists and every government that supports them.”

The larger framework surrounding the Syrian intervention is less clear. The administration has offered a number of arguments as to why the United States needs to intervene, from the message it would send to Iran about nuclear weapons, to the urgency of responding to gross violations of human rights. The president must offer a compelling reason why a situation such as this deserves national resources. If humanitarian interventions are to become a new norm, the president should make the case and offer a set of coherent principles for future conflicts.

What is the justification for this intervention and is it based on sound intelligence?

One of the main sources of public cynicism about American foreign policy comes from the fact that presidents have often used incorrect information or purposely flawed data to justify military operations that result in huge human and financial costs. American history is filled with such examples.

The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution in 1964, which provided President Lyndon Johnson the blanket authority he needed to expand America’s presence in Vietnam and the region, was based on spurious data about alleged attacks on U.S. Navy destroyers by the North Vietnamese. Congress gave Johnson wide-ranging authority to conduct military operations. It was “like grandma’s nightshirt, it covered everything,” he later said.

President George W. Bush’s request to Congress for the authorization to use force in Iraq in 2003 was justified through incorrect intelligence about the presence of weapons of mass destruction and untrue reports of connections between Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden.

Obama, who ran his 2008 campaign based on criticism of all the problems with Bush’s war, needs to demonstrate to the public that he has made a decision based on the soundest of evidence.

The revelations about the National Security Agency have already raised public skepticism about the discrepancy between what Obama says in public and what he does behind the scenes. Without revealing sensitive information to the public, it is important that the president make a convincing case that the intelligence behind this decision is sound, that it has been examined and cross-examined, that the Syrian government did use chemical weapons and that the Syrians do pose a substantial threat to the region.

He needs to explain why chemical weapons pose a threat that deserves a military strike as opposed to other weapons or mechanisms of mass destruction. Why act here, but not with regard to other atrocities or risks? The nation cannot afford another war based on false premises.

What is the mission?

Presidents have gone into many wars without a clear sense of what they hope to achieve. Once troops are sent into a war or even after the Air Force is sent in to strike targets, conflicts can take unpredictable turns and escalate quickly. If the administration doesn’t articulate a clear sense of what it hopes to accomplish at the outset, it allows for open-ended possibilities for escalation.

When President George H.W. Bush went to war with Iraq in 1990, the confusion over the objectives led to great frustration when Americans saw that Hussein remained in power after the celebrations of U.S. victory had taken place. Bush’s son’s war in Iraq proved even more frustrating, as there was growing awareness that the administration was entering into a much broader mission of nation-building than many Americans had anticipated.

When the new government that emerged from the rubble in Iraq remained unstable and the U.S. seemed to be pouring endless resources into the country, many Americans were left with a sense that the operation had not been worthwhile.

Obama can’t afford to make the the mistake of leaving his objectives ill-defined. It is possible that quick and targeted airstrikes will destroy the chemical weapons capacity of the Syrians, though that would still leave in place a dictator whom the president has characterized as inhumane and brutal. It is also possible that airstrikes would result in retaliation that would trigger a bigger conflict, which would in turn create greater pressure for regime change.

The president did the right thing by engaging Congress in this decision rather than trying to circumvent the legislative branch. But in this case, with the memories of Iraq looming large, he won’t have luck just asking for blind support.

In his speech, the president must answer these questions in simple and direct terms. This would do a great deal to build confidence in the operation, and to build a foundation for longer term support of this intervention should it be needed.

http://news.yahoo.com/iran-nuclear-talks-said-down-fine-print-stage-204200490.html,,[],Iran nuclear talks said down to fine print stage,"GENEVA (AP) — Talks between Iran and six world powers seeking to curb Tehran's nuclear program bogged down early Sunday despite the personal intervention by Secretary of State John Kerry and other foreign ministers whose presence had raised hopes for a breakthrough.

Diplomats refused to spell out details of the talks, which dragged on past midnight into a fifth day. But both sides suggested negotiations focused on detailed wording that could be key in shaping an agreement that both sides could live with.

Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi described the talks as being in ""their 11th hour,"" with most issues resolved but an agreement still elusive.

""We have agreed to 98 percent of the draft ... but the remaining 2 percent is very important to us,"" he told reporters.

While he did not specify what was missing, Araghchi said Iran would never accept an agreement that did not in some way acknowledge his country's right to enrich uranium — a key international concern because enrichment can create both reactor fuel and the fissile core of warheads.

The goal is to hammer out an agreement to freeze Iran's nuclear program for six months, while offering the Iranians limited relief from crippling economic sanctions. If the interim deal holds, the parties would negotiate final-stage agreements to ensure Iran does not build nuclear weapons.

Only then would the most crippling sanctions on Iranian oil sales and financial transactions be rolled back.

""There are narrow gaps, but they are important gaps,"" British Foreign Secretary William Hague said about the drafting process, without offering specifics.

An agreement would cap nearly a decade of inconclusive international efforts to halt Iran's expanding nuclear program. Iran insists its program is for peaceful purposes and not aimed at building nuclear weapons.

A deal would build on the momentum of the historic dialogue opened during September's annual U.N. gathering, which included a 15-minute phone conversation between President Barack Obama and Iran's new president, Hassan Rouhani, after three decades of U.S.-Iranian estrangement.

Story continues

For the U.S. and its five partners, the chief concern is uranium enrichment.

Since it was revealed in 2003, Iran's enrichment program has grown from a few dozen enriching centrifuges to more than 18,000 installed and over 10,000 operating. From uranium ore obtained from South Africa in the 1980s and some locally mined ore, the machines have produced tons of low-enriched uranium, which can be turned into weapons grade material.

Iran also has stockpiled almost 200 kilograms (440 pounds) of higher-enriched uranium in a form that can be converted in six to nine weeks to fissile warhead material — almost twice as fast as the low-enriched uranium. Its supply is nearly enough for one bomb.

While saying they are ready for compromise, the Iranians are mindful of criticism from hard-liners back home who oppose dealings with the United States.

Statements on Saturday by senior Iranian negotiators appeared to be an attempt to defuse domestic opposition to a deal that skeptics see as surrendering their country's nuclear sovereignty.

""I assure Iranians enrichment will never stop,"" Iran's state TV quoted Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif as saying. ""Iran opposes any demands restricting its rights.'""

The Iranians also are holding out for maximum relief from economic sanctions. The United States and its partners want to relax sanctions in small, incremental steps during the six months of an interim agreement but not remove them entirely pending a final-stage deal.

Issues were believed to include the level of sanctions relief and the future of a plutonium reactor under construction at Arak that the six powers want closed. Plutonium can also be used to make nuclear weapons.

With the talks already running two days over schedule, it was unclear whether the negotiations would continue Sunday. Kerry's spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, said he still planned to travel to London on Sunday for meetings on other Middle East issues.

Kerry and his counterparts from Russia, Britain, France, China and Germany joined the Geneva talks after Zarif and top European Union diplomat Catherine Ashton reported progress on enrichment and other issues Friday.

Their participation raised speculation that an agreement was close — an interpretation that the foreign ministers themselves sought to discourage.

""We're not here because things are necessarily finished,"" Britain's Hague told reporters. ""We're here because they're difficult, and they remain difficult.""

The U.S. administration has not confirmed details of what concessions on economic sanctions it might offer. But a member of Congress and legislative aides have said the White House was considering releasing about $3 billion to $5 billion in Iranian funds frozen in foreign banks.

Another $3 billion to $5 billion in revenues could come from sales of petrochemicals and from the revival of the auto industry through supplies of car parts. The aides and the member of Congress demanded anonymity because they weren't authorized to divulge the estimate publicly.

A senior U.S. official told reporters last week that Iran is losing $5 billion a month in lost oil sales alone and $120 billion in total from all sanctions since their imposition, although he did not give a time frame. The official demanded anonymity in keeping with rules established by the U.S. administration.

The U.S. administration is keen to keep rollbacks limited to placate influential members of U.S. Congress who argue that pressure has brought Iran to the negotiating table and cannot be relaxed until Tehran offers significant concessions.

Today was a very eventful day for President Obama in Israel. He visited Gaza albeit with rockets being launched into Israel from Gaza. He then gave a major speech in Jerusalem to an auditorium filled with cheering university students where he provided encouragement and tough love to both the Israelis and Palestinians. After that speech, the President was awarded the Israeli’s Presidential Distinction Award, the highest civilian award in Israel and the first sitting President to receive one.

As he was getting this most distinguished award, both CNN and MSNBC covered the event live. This should have been a patriotic moment for the country. In accepting the award the President even said he accepted it on behalf of the American people. Fox News was not covering this event. I was compelled to tweet on this as follows in real time.

Prez Obama getting Israel's Presidential Medal of Distinction. CNN & MSNBC carries it live. Fox News NOT. How unpatriotic! — Egberto Willies (@EgbertoWillies) March 21, 2013

Tonight however Rachel Maddow coverage of this snub was epic.

After that big speech that was so well received by that huge Israeli audience in Jerusalem, President Obama was honored at a state dinner. He was awarded the Israeli Medal Of Distinction which is the highest honor a civilian can receive in Israel. He is the first sitting President to ever receive this award. Israeli President Simon Peres said to President Obama quote “The people of Israel are particularly move by your unforgettable contribution to their security”. He called President Obama, Dear Barack. So that was what was happening live in Israel. CNN and MSNBC are carrying it live showing the President of the United States receiving this medal at this big state dinner in a foreign country… Fox News channel however is pretending like it is not happening. They’re talking about repealing Obamacare…. We are all watching as the Israeli president is saying to President Obama, “I know that you would not stop striving for a better world. What was running on Fox News instead was a commercial for their new special on President Obama as an enemy of Israel… COMMERCIAL: Obama: The State Of Israel will have no greater friend than the United States. Narrator: But with a friend like Obama are Israel’s enemies gaining strength. Sean gets expert insight on a special Hannity. That is what Fox News was telling its audience of American Conservatives instead of showing this, happening in Israel. in real life, in the actual world at that very moment, They report, you decide.

Fox News is a clear and present danger to America. They are no different than the propaganda engine used by dictators and the Oligarchy in the third world. It is the same tactic used to demonize Hugo Chavez and other leaders that are attempting to bring real democracy and access to success for the masses and middle class.

Fox News is mostly responsible for much of the gridlock, bad policies, citizen misinformation, and the driver of citizens that vote against their own interest. While the remainder of the mainstream media is not as blatant in their servitude of the American Plutocracy, they also have blood on their hands.

Twenty-eight activists and two journalists face up to seven years in jail over a protest against offshore drilling in the Arctic in which some members of the environmental group tried to scale a Russian oil rig.

""It would be great if this misunderstanding could be resolved and the protesters can be home with their families in time for Christmas. We live in hope,"" McCartney wrote on his website.

He said Putin, whom he met when he first performed in Moscow in 2003, had not replied to the Oct. 14 letter, although he said Russia's ambassador to London responded by saying the group's plight was not properly represented by the media.

""Vladimir, millions of people in dozens of countries would be hugely grateful if you were to intervene to bring about an end to this affair,"" McCartney wrote in the letter.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said he only heard of the letter from media reports but had not received it, according to the state-run Itar-Tass news agency.

The Prirazlomnaya oil rig which the Greenpeace activists tried to scale on Sept. 18 is owned by state energy giant Gazprom and is at the heart of a Kremlin drive to tap the Arctic's natural resources and expand Russia's economy.

Quoting from the Beatles' song ""Back in the USSR"", which he composed 45 years ago, McCartney wrote: ""That song had one of my favourite Beatles lines in it: 'Been away so long I hardly knew the place, gee it's good to be back home'.""

""Could you make that come true for the Greenpeace prisoners?"" he asked.

Investigators charged the 30 with hooliganism, to replace original charges of piracy, which carry a 15-year jail term. Greenpeace says piracy charges have not been formally dropped and that the 30 are now effectively charged with both.

The Netherlands, where Greenpeace has its main headquarters, has asked an international tribunal to order the release of the group from pre-trial detention.

McCartney has previously expressed support for the Pussy Riot protest group which performed a ""punk prayer"" in a Moscow cathedral last year against Putin's ties with the Russian Orthodox Church.

Appeals for leniency failed to help them escape a two-year jail sentence.

Critics accuse Putin of using the courts to persecute his opponents, a charge the Kremlin denies."

It is the first time since the founding of the People’s Republic of China that an official who has held such high office has been the focus of a formal corruption investigation, and in pressing his antigraft crusade to new levels, Mr. Xi has broken a longstanding taboo. Mr. Zhou was once a member of the Communist Party’s top rung of power, the Politburo Standing Committee, and even retired members of that body have always been spared such scrutiny.

The principal allegations against Mr. Zhou emerged from investigations over the past year into accusations of abuse of power and corruption by officials and oil company executives associated with him. Those inquiries have already encircled his son, Zhou Bin, and other family members, the sources said.

Mr. Xi and other leaders agreed by early December to put the elder Mr. Zhou directly under formal investigation by the party’s commission for rooting out corruption and abuses of power, the sources said. They said a senior official went to Mr. Zhou’s home in central Beijing to inform him about the inquiry, and Mr. Zhou and his wife, Jia Xiaoye, have since been held under constant guard."

USA TODAY

Six world powers reached an agreement with Iran on its disputed nuclear program

Iran agreed to limit nuclear activities in return for relief of up to %247 billion in sanctions

Kerry promoted the interim Iran agreement on Sunday talk shows

A final nuclear deal with Iran is ""not a question of trust,"" Secretary of State John Kerry said Sunday, but of verification that the Iranians are giving up on the prospect of nuclear weapons.

Kerry spoke as the negotiators who crafted a six-month deal with Iran over the weekend exulted while Israel, Persian Gulf states and members of Congress criticized the accord for giving Iran too much.

Kerry hit Sunday morning talk shows across the dial Sunday, telling audiences that without verification, there can be no real deal. Appearing on CNN's State of the Union, Kerry said, ""Verification is the key,"" adding that the United States enters into more negotiations with Iran ""with eyes absolutely wide open. We have no illusions.""

Said Kerry: ""We're trying to set up a process by which we can verify, know what we're doing, restraining the program while we negotiate the comprehensive deal.""

Six world powers reached an interim agreement late Saturday night with Iran on its disputed nuclear program after four days of talks in Geneva.

In the six-month interim deal, Iran agreed to limit nuclear activities in return for relief of up to $7 billion in sanctions that have hurt its economy.

""Israel and the United States absolutely share the same goal here,"" Kerry said on ABC's This Week. ""There is no daylight between us with respect to what we want to achieve, at this point. We both want to make it certain Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. And Iran cannot be in a place where they can break out and suddenly get that nuclear weapon.""

In Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denounced the agreement, calling it ""a historic mistake.""

""Today the world became a much more dangerous place because the most dangerous regime in the world made a significant step in obtaining the most dangerous weapons in the world,"" Netanyahu said.

President Obama called Netanyahu Sunday afternoon and reassured him the United States would keep Israel up to date with developments. ""Consistent with our commitment to consult closely with our Israeli friends, the President told the Prime Minister that he wants the United States and Israel to begin consultations immediately regarding our efforts to negotiate a comprehensive solution,"" a White House announcement on the call said.

Both Kerry and Obama have called on Congress to forgo additional sanctions on Iran, saying they could kill the interim agreement — but some lawmakers have indicated they will push forward anyway, expressing skepticism about Iran's trustworthiness.

One prominent Democrat — Sen. Charles Schumer of New York — said the deal ""does not seem proportional"" because ""Iran simply freezes its nuclear capabilities while we reduce the sanctions.""

The ""disproportionality"" of the deal ""makes it more likely that Democrats and Republicans will join together and pass additional sanctions when we return in December,"" Schumer said.

Obama, however, can veto any additional sanctions if they pass Congress.

Republicans like Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina have also criticized the agreement.

Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said the agreement should be given a chance to work, saying that ""the initial six-month framework gives us a chance to test Iranian intentions before reaching a more comprehensive agreement to prevent a nuclear Iran.""

Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., issued a brief statement: ""It is a choice between a pause or imminent war. I choose a verifiable pause.""

Over in the House, Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said the interim agreement should have forced Iran to give up nuclear enrichment now. He called the agreement ""disappointing"" during an appearance on CNN.

""I do think sanctions should always be hanging there, because that's what brought Iran to the table in the first place,"" Engel said. ""And I don't think you make them bargain a good faith by going squishy.""

Rep. Ed Royce, R-Calif., the committee chairman, denounced the agreement, telling CNN's State of the Union that Iran is ""a state sponsor of terrorism trying to get a bomb.""

Iran says its enrichment program is designed to generate energy for peaceful domestic purposes."
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/03/opinion/america-mustnt-be-naive-about-iran.html,2013-10-03 00:00:00,['Vali R. Nasr'],America Mustn’t Be Naïve About Iran - The New York Times,"Iran’s diplomatic flexibility is serious, but should not be mistaken for willingness to surrender.

Iran does not see itself as vanquished. Its political system is still the most steadfast and resilient in the region. It is reveling in a newfound stability on the back of a surprisingly smooth presidential election. There were no street protests in Tehran this year, like those that paralyzed Tehran in 2009, Cairo in 2011 and Istanbul earlier this year. Indeed, Mr. Rouhani’s government, by freeing political prisoners and potentially relaxing controls on the press and social media, is showing its confidence.

Arab anger notwithstanding, there is agreement across the region that Iranian support for Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad, has been effective. That consensus buttresses Iran’s claim to regional power and influence. Syria has showed Iran to be the only regional actor capable of successfully running a war in another country — and one with which it does not share a border. Iran has given the Assad regime money and weapons, deployed fighters in Syria and created a regional alliance with the Shiite government in Iraq and its proxy militia Hezbollah in Lebanon to help Mr. Assad. The West thinks of Russia as Mr. Assad’s vital ally, but it is Iran that holds the cards to his survival.

Hope that Turkey and America’s Arab allies would form an alliance that would isolate Iran has not come to pass. Those allies have been divided over what to do with Egypt, and now Syria. Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey are bickering over whom to support in Syria. Saudi support for Egypt’s generals, who ousted the democratically elected Islamist president Mohamed Morsi in July, has alienated Turkey, which supported Mr. Morsi and his Muslim Brotherhood, now outlawed. For decades the Persian Gulf monarchies bought the support of the Muslim Brotherhood. Now the Islamists and the gulf rulers are competing for support of the Sunni Arab world. This gives Iran a strategic opportunity to exploit its role as a regional power broker.

Iran’s main nemesis, however, remains the United States. America’s withdrawals from Iraq and Afghanistan, and its strategic “pivot” toward Asia, have been welcome news in Tehran. American standing in the region has taken a toll with the Obama administration’s decision not to enforce its own red line against Syria’s use of chemical weapons. That created an opening for Iran’s chief ally, Russia, to play a critical role at the United Nations as a diplomatic broker.

Meanwhile, after Mr. Obama’s historic (though brief) phone conversation with Mr. Rouhani, pressure from Israel led Mr. Obama to reiterate, after meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, that he would not rule out the use of force to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran. Mr. Netanyahu went before the United Nations to call Mr. Rouhani “a wolf in sheep’s clothing.”"

The U.S. and South Korea have said the burden is on Pyongyang to pull back on its nuclear ambitions.

Experts say both sides have set out unrealistic demands. The South Korean Foreign Ministry derided the North Korean argument Thursday as “totally incomprehensible” and “illogical.” North Korea, in turn, is extremely unlikely to give up its nuclear bargaining chips before even getting to the table, analysts said.

But even talk of talk has been greeted as a welcome change after weeks of bombastic threats from Pyongyang. Though cautious about predicting what North Korea will do next, some analysts believe that such a change could be a first step toward opening dialogue to defuse tensions on the Korean peninsula.

The North Korean demands, implausible as they are, “could be seen as a step toward Pyongyang backing off the ledge,” said Suzanne DiMaggio, vice president of global policy programs at the Asia Society.

“It could offer an opening for Seoul and Washington to approach North Koreans,” possibly making some kind of contact that falls short of official talks, she said.

Tensions soared after North Korea conducted its third nuclear test in February, spurring a new, stiffer round of U.N. sanctions last month. At the same time, Pyongyang was infuriated by ongoing U.S.-South Korea military drills.

The isolated nation declared an end to a Korean War armistice and vowed nuclear attacks on its foes. Intelligence analysts said North Korea was poised to test as many as five missiles last week.

Yet a week later, both sides were talking about negotiations. Charles K. Armstrong, director of the Center for Korean Research at Columbia University, said he believes that was what North Korea was aiming for all along.

“Making a very strong, even outrageous set of statements, with the intention of negotiation from a position of strength -- that’s pretty consistent with their past behavior,” he said.

The military drills that left North Korea steaming are due to end in a week and a half, which is expected to dial down tensions. A key day in the North Korean calendar -- a holiday marking the birthday of its late founder, Kim Il Sung -- passed Monday, which could allow “posturing” to die down, Armstrong said.

So far, North Korea has not launched the missiles it moved to its east coast, as had been feared last week. Pyongyang may still press ahead with a missile test to shore up support at home before talking to Washington, said Marcus Noland, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.

“The problem is, if you’re [North Korean leader] Kim Jong Un and you are putting your nuclear program on postage stamps and billboards and having mass rallies in Pyongyang chanting that this is the lifeblood of the nation ... if you’ve built all that up, it’s quite hard to back away.”

“He needs some way to declare victory,” Noland said. After carrying out a missile test, North Korea could tell its people “they’ve come begging to talk to us,” and resume negotiations.

DiMaggio said that wouldn’t help bring the U.S. or South Korea to the table, however.

“Seoul and Tokyo would feel more threatened,” she said. “They’d want the U.S. to offer more reassurance that they’re protecting their allies. That would likely include more joint military exercises.”

Another important player is China. Beijing has evidenced growing frustration with North Korea, a situation that has spurred hopes it might put more pressure on its longtime ally. U.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry visited China last week, mentioning Korean tensions among several “very challenging issues” before meeting with President Xi Jinping. What China is doing behind the scenes could prove crucial.

Experts caution that reading North Korea under its new young leader remains difficult. Weeks ago, former basketball star Dennis Rodman returned from the country saying that Kim just wanted President Obama to call him. Soon after, Pyongyang vowed to attack the U.S. and South Korea.

“This still strikes me as a fairly capricious and unpredictable regime,” Noland said.

That yet another one exists, and that like others one of their top priorities is defeating not-conservative-enough Karl Rove and demanding a more radical conservatism of their conservatives, is not too surprising. That they seem to be in opposition to uberconservative Grover Norquist is a bit more surprising, but I suppose Norquist has gone out of favor now that people in the movement have started to suspect him of secret Muslimizm.

The list of people who participate in these ""Groundswell"" strategizing sessions, however, has a definite B-grade flavor to it.



One of the influential conservatives guiding the group is Virginia ""Ginni"" Thomas, a columnist for the Daily Caller and a tea party consultant and lobbyist. Other Groundswell members include John Bolton, the former UN ambassador; Frank Gaffney, the president of the Center for Security Policy; Ken Blackwell and Jerry Boykin of the Family Research Council; Tom Fitton, the president of Judicial Watch; Gayle Trotter, a fellow at the Independent Women's Forum; Catherine Engelbrecht and Anita MonCrief of True the Vote; Allen West, the former GOP House member; Sue Myrick, also a former House GOPer; Diana Banister of the influential Shirley and Banister PR firm; and Max Pappas, a top aide to Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas).

At its weekly meetings, the group aims to strengthen the right's messaging by crafting Twitter hashtags; plotting strategy on in-the-headlines issues such as voter ID, immigration reform, and the sequester; promoting politically useful scandals; and developing ""action items.""

Groundswell members saw immigration as a life-or-death issue. ""If we lose on immigration,"" the post-meeting memo noted, ""we lose on every other issue. […]"" The group also reviewed how best to oppose the confirmation of Tom Perez, Obama's nominee for labor secretary. Groundsweller's claimed that Perez, then a senior Justice Department official, supported ""Muslim Brotherhood organizations and Shariah."" (One Groundswell memo maintained that Perez ""is extremely antagonistic toward whites."") A third agenda item that Wednesday morning was beating back the effort to end the Boy Scouts of America's ban on gay scouts. […] The post-meeting memo suggested Twitter hashtags to push: #CantTrustObama, #PoliticsOverPublicSafety, #SequesterLies.

The Groundswellers feel that they too often lose the political narrative to their progressive rivals. One memo that circulated among members declared, ""We must reclaim the language and put 'a face' on our messages; tell stories. Write articles on 4th grade level!""

Oh, well if you've got John Bolton, the Family Research Council and Allen West thinking up your strategy, I'm sure nothing can go wrong with that. Also featured prominently are various Breitbart apparatchiks, so you know it's top-notch stuff.Oh God, stop, you're killing me. #HashtagBasedStrategizingA troupe of Rove-hating conservatives who spend their days talking about Sharia conspiracies. I'm beginning to see why this group is secret: I think it's so they don't get teased. Also, members literally seem to get something called ""brownie points"" for putting out the group's message, which in any other context would probably be humiliating for all involved. Not them, though!Some of you have almost managed 3rd grade level, so don't lose hope. Practice! You'll get there eventually.

There's one place I have to disagree with David Corn's reporting on this story. He refers to some of the persons involved as ""journalists,"" citing Breitbart ""News"" participants and others. I don't think you can claim that; the Breitbart group does not do ""journalism,"" they do something … else. Their namesake made the brand on pushing falsified ""pimp tape""-style stories to gullible peers. While it would indeed be alarming if ""journalists"" were coordinating strategies with the likes of Ginni Thomas, Frank Gaffney (snicker), John Bolton (cackle) and Allen Freaking West (it hurts, stop, I need a moment!), none of the columnists, ""researchers"" or Fox News hangers-on named in the story really pass as ""journalists"" in the conventional sense of the term. They might claim otherwise, but that doesn't make it true, and we really shouldn't just accept such claims at face value.

The Breitbarters seem to play a substantive role in the group, which gives you an indication of the caliber of minds at work here, and is probably one force behind the group's apparent routine of thinking up good-sounding storylines first, then bothering with the ""evidence"" later. I am not thinking there is much to fear from this particular peanut gallery, but it might be interesting in the future to watch their promotion of certain themes and how they collect their ""brownie points"" for reinforcing each other's messages. Hell, we can give them ""brownie points"" ourselves, right? Ten points to Slytherin, guys, but come up with a really good hashtag and I'll make it 15. #MelonSizedCalves?

Speakers compare immigration debate to civil rights battles

GOP leaders have rejected Senate plan that includes pathway to citizenship

Rallies also target 2 other House leaders

SPRINGFIELD, Ohio -- Hundreds of supporters of immigration reform rallied here Saturday to urge House Speaker John Boehner to push for a broad path to citizenship.

Religious leaders, union officials, legal advocates, residents and busloads of out-of-town supporters gathered in a parking lot downtown and later marched to City Hall, where the West Chester Township congressman has a local office.

""We're here to ensure that pathway to citizenship is part of a bill that emerges and gets voted on quickly,"" the Rev. Troy Jackson, director of Ohio Prophetic Voices, told the crowd.

""We don't want to be on the wrong side of history. We know looking back to the civil rights era there were a lot of people sitting on their hands and we say 'shame on them – we must act,'"" said Jeff Cook, a professor of Bible and urban ministry from Cedarville University, who also spoke.

The rally drew a diverse crowd, both locally and from out of town.

""As a nation of immigrants, I think there should be a path for citizenship,"" said Derek Alvarado, a Springfield resident and middle-school teacher.

Also in the crowd, listening to the speakers was Ester Arteaga, 44, of Louisville, who came on one of six buses of supporters.

A U.S. citizen naturalized from Guatemala two years ago, she said she was here to ease the path for others who want to live peacefully and work in America.

A receptionist for an immigration lawyer, Arteaga, her husband and two sons all sought citizenship at the same time. It took nine years.

""We came here for a better life for our kids,"" she said. ""We're so happy to be citizens and we want others to have it.""

She worries for less fortunate family members.

Her husband's brother, a former accountant, lives in Oklahoma; undocumented, he works in a furniture factory.

""Immigration reform is the right thing to do – workers should be able to come out of the shadows and not be exploited,"" said Bill Dudley, director of strategic campaigns for the UFCW.

At a press briefing two days ago, Boehner said his colleagues want immigration reform, too.

""House Republicans are committed to fixing a broken immigration system,"" he said. ""We're working on a common-sense, step-by-step approach to ensure that the American people have confidence that we're addressing these issues openly and honestly. Our focus is on getting the policy right, so we fix our immigration system once and for all, and help our economy grow.""

The rally outside Boehner's office was one of three events scheduled for this weekend. Other rallies were set to target House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., and Chief Deputy Whip Peter Roskam, R-Ill.

Boehner and other GOP leaders have rejected a Senate-passed immigration bill that includes a pathway to citizenship for the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S. Instead, the House Judiciary Committee is preparing to advance a series of narrowly focused bills related to border security and other immigration issues.

This week, a House subcommittee debated a proposal that would offer a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children but would not do the same for their parents who knowingly broke the law."

Obama's speech comes after a slew of television interviews on the situation.

Watch Obama's speech above at 9 p.m., and scroll down for the latest developments on Syria.

Below, more from the AP:

WASHINGTON — In the run-up to a prime-time televised speech, President Barack Obama blended the threat of a military strike with the hope of a diplomatic solution Tuesday as he worked to rid Syria of an illicit stockpile of fearsome chemical weapons.

Secretary of State John Kerry set a hurry-up trip to Geneva for talks Thursday with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, and the United Nations Security Council first scheduled, and then scrapped, a private meeting on steps to defuse a looming crisis.

Despite expressing skepticism about the outcome of the diplomacy, officials said, Obama and close Senate allies reaffirmed their decision for a pause in attempts to win congressional backing for a strike against President Bashar Assad's government.

And while a presidential statement to that effect was possible in Obama's nationwide speech, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel pointedly told a congressional hearing it was not time to let the threat lapse. ""For this diplomatic option to have a chance at succeeding, the threat of a U.S. military action, the credible, real threat of U.S. military action, must continue,"" he declared.

At the same hearing, Kerry said any diplomacy ""cannot be a process of delay. This cannot be a process of avoidance.""

He later added that any agreement must include binding consequences if Syria fails to comply, and lawmakers moved to rewrite pending legislation along the same lines.

Obama himself ""wasn't overly optimistic about"" prospects for a solution at the U.N., said Sen. Richard Durbin of Illinois, the second-ranking Democrat, after his party's rank and file met privately for lunch in the Capitol with the president. He quoted Obama as saying that even if a credible plan could be worked out, it could be difficult to push through the U.N. Security Council. And, indeed, Russian President Vladimir Putin said such a U.N. effort could work only if ""the American side and those who support the USA in this sense reject the use of force.""

The president readied his speech against an unpredictable chain of events stemming from a chemical weapons attack in the Damascus suburbs on Aug. 21 that the Obama administration swiftly blamed on Assad's government.

U.S. officials say more than 1,400 died in the episode, including at least 400 children, and other victims suffered uncontrollable twitching, foaming at the mouth and other symptoms typical of exposure to chemical weapons banned by international treaty. Other casualty estimates are lower, and Assad has said the attack was launched by rebels who have been fighting to drive him from power in a civil war that has so far claimed the lives of more than 100,000 civilians.

Assad's patron, Russia, has blocked U.S. attempts to rally the Security Council behind a military strike. But Monday, after a remark by Kerry, it spoke favorably about requiring Syria to surrender control of its chemical weapons, and the Syrian foreign minister did likewise.

The foreign minister, Walid al-Moallem, said Tuesday that his government was ready to turn over its chemical weapons stockpile in line with Russia's proposal in order ""to thwart U.S. aggression."" He also said Syria was prepared to sign an international chemical convention it has long rejected – a step it can take on its own at any time without U.S. or U.N. supervision.

Syria has long refused to provide an accounting of the size of its stockpile, rarely referring in public to its existence. According to an unclassified estimate by the French government, it includes more than 1,000 tons of ""chemical agents and precursor chemicals,"" including sulfur mustard, VX and sarin gas.

Obama has said frequently he has the authority as commander in chief to order a military strike against Assad regardless of any vote in Congress, and he has consistently declined to say whether he would do so if lawmakers refuse to approve the legislation he is seeking.

The response in Congress to support such a strike has been lukewarm at best – as underscored during the day when liberal Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., and conservative Rep. Mick Mulvaney, R-S.C., both announced their opposition.

Markey, who was elected to the seat that Kerry vacated when he joined the Cabinet, said the legislation under consideration was too broad, ""the effects of a strike are too unpredictable, and ... I believe we must give diplomatic measures that could avoid military action a chance to work.""

Said Mulvaney: ""While I am concerned about taking no action, it strikes me that international law cannot be upheld via unilateral attack by the United States.""

And Rep. James Langevin, a Rhode Island Democrat who sits on committees dealing both with military and intelligence matters, said he feared that ""Iran and Russia could cause serious damage"" to the United States if they retaliated with a cyberattack.

Yet Maryland Rep. Steny Hoyer, the second-ranking Democrat in the House, said, ""It would be inimical to our country's standing if we do not show a willingness to act in the face of the use of chemical weapons and to act in a limited way to address that use alone.""

Hours before Obama's speech from the White House's East Room, Hoyer added, "" I don't think there's any doubt that failure to do so would weaken our country, create a more dangerous international environment and to some degree undermine the president of the United States.""

Earlier, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell became the first congressional leader to come out against legislation giving the president authority for limited strikes. ""There are just too many unanswered questions about our long-term strategy in Syria,"" he said.

By contrast, Speaker John Boehner of Ohio and Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia, the top two Republicans in the House, have endorsed Obama's request.

Given the uncertainty of diplomatic maneuvering, no vote is expected for several days, if then.

""If something can be done diplomatically, I'm totally satisfied with that. I'm not a blood and thunder guy. I'm not for shock and awe,"" said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid in a reference to the massive display of firepower that opened the war in Iraq nearly a decade ago.

Still, there was ample skepticism in Congress about the United Nations as well as Russia's true intentions, as well as Syria's willingness to be bound by international agreements.

""There is an overwhelming view it would be preferable if international law and the family of nations could strip Syria of the chemical weapons,"" said Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. ""And there's a large view we should let that process play out for a little while.""

Said Boehner: ""Clearly, diplomacy is always a better outcome than military action. But I will say that I'm somewhat skeptical of those that are involved in the diplomatic discussions today.""

The first substantive peace talks in years between Israel and the Palestinians began Monday evening in Washington.

The first substantive peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians in years will begin in Washington after Israeli leaders agreed to release 104 Palestinian prisoners.

The first substantive peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians in years will begin in Washington after Israeli leaders agreed to release 104 Palestinian prisoners.

The first substantive peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians in years will begin Monday evening in Washington, the Obama administration announced, after Israeli leaders agreed Sunday to release 104 Palestinian prisoners.

State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the preliminary talks will be led by Israeli Justice Minister Tzipi Livni and chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat. The talks, which will continue Tuesday, are expected to address the framework for full negotiations to follow — the talks about talks that had preceded past attempts at a deal.

The release of Palestinian prisoners was one of the major roadblocks to the peace talks.

Calling the prisoner decision “painful for the entire nation,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu won the approval of his divided cabinet earlier Sunday to release the Palestinian inmates, many convicted of killing Israelis, to help restart peace talks brokered by U.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry.

The list of prisoners who may be released in coming days includes militants who threw firebombs, in one case at a bus carrying children; stabbed and shot civilians, including women, elderly Jews and suspected Palestinian collaborators; and ambushed and killed border guards, police officers, security agents and soldiers. All of them have been in prison for at least two decades; some were serving life sentences.

The Israeli public views these prisoners as terrorists who have blood on their hands. Palestinians see them as freedom fighters struggling to reclaim their homeland and oust the occupiers. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and his leadership refused to return to the negotiating table without their release.

Regardless of whether it is a grudging gesture of goodwill, diplomatic blackmail or something in between, Netanyahu’s move is a major concession to Kerry and the Palestinians.

In a sign of Israeli divisions over the prisoner release, the vote among Netanyahu’s cabinet ministers was 13 to 7, with two abstentions.

In a parallel move, the cabinet also approved Netanyahu’s call for a national referendum that would allow voters to approve or reject any peace deal he makes.

Israeli officials said the prisoners will be released in four stages over the next nine months, with the first release to take place soon after the initial talks in Washington.

Erekat called it “a step toward peace” and said, “I hope that we can use this opportunity that the U.S. has provided for us to resume negotiations,” according to the Associated Press.

More prisoners would be freed as negotiations continue, though Netanyahu warned that “every Palestinian provocation will result in halting of the prisoner-

release process.”

The Israeli prime minister called the prisoners he was about to release “depraved people, even if most of them have been in prison for over 20 years.”

This is not the first time that Netanyahu has struck such a deal. In 2011, the Israeli government traded about 1,000 Palestinian and Arab Israeli prisoners for the release of Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier abducted by Hamas militants near the Kerem Shalom crossing into the Gaza Strip in 2006. He had been held for five years.

In an “open letter to Israeli citizens” published Saturday night, Netanyahu explained, “This is an incomparably difficult decision, it is painful for the bereaved families and it is painful for the entire nation and it is also very painful for me.”

Kerry, who has made several visits to the region since taking office in February to nudge the Israelis and Palestinians closer to negotiations, said last week that the possibility of finally resolving a conflict that has spanned more than 60 years is the“granddaddy” of international diplomacy.

On Thursday, Kerry chaired a special session of the U.N. General Assembly, during which he praised Israeli and Palestinian leaders for their “courageous decision to try to return to final-status talks.”

State Department officials who briefed reporters on his effort last week said the goal is intensive talks over about nine months. The agreement would set West Bank borders and include promises about Israel’s security once it no longer occupies the West Bank.

Although most polls show that a majority of Israelis support the peace process, releasing prisoners is unpopular across the political spectrum.

“From time to time, prime ministers are called on to make decisions that go against public opinion — when the matter is important for the country,” Netanyahu said in the open letter. He added: “It seems to me that it is very important for the State of Israel to enter into a diplomatic process.”

The prime minister said dramatic change in the region — in Egypt, Syria and Iran — create not only challenges but also “considerable opportunities for us” to strike a deal with the Palestinians.

Netanyahu stressed that although he agreed to release prisoners — and to do so only after talks begin — he rejected a Palestinian demand for a freeze on new construction in the Jewish settlements in the West Bank.

According to Israeli media, Netanyahu told Kerry that over the next nine months, as many as 1,000 new units may be approved for construction in West Bank and East Jerusalem settlements.

Netanyahu was silent on a third Palestinian demand — that negotiations about borders for a future Palestinian state begin with the pre-1967 armistice lines.

Qadura Fares, president of the Palestinian Prisoners’ Society, welcomed the prisoner release as “the right decision for negotiations.”

“It will only help to create an atmosphere of calm. It shows that the state of Israel really does want peace,” he said.

Fares warned, however, that the prisoners must be released to their homes — that a prisoner who hails from Ramallah in the West Bank, for example, not be expelled to the Gaza Strip.

The prisoners have been held since before the signing of the 1993 Oslo Accords, which created interim and limited self-

government for the Palestinians and called for the Israeli military’s withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Israel pulled out of Gaza in 2005.

Because the prisoners’ crimes date to the 1980s and 1990s, in an era before suicide bombing became a widespread Palestinian tactic, the attackers used molotov cocktails, knives, guns and grenades. Many of the attackers were members of Abbas’s Fatah party, and many of their targets were Israeli soldiers.

The Israeli government has not provided details on who would be released and when. But according to Israeli media, Israeli victims groups and Palestinian activists, the list of prisoners to be freed might include Jumaa Adem and Mahmoud Kharbish, who threw a firebomb into a bus in the Jordan Valley in 1988, killing Rachel Weiss and her three children, as well as David Dolorosa, the Israeli soldier who tried to save them.

As Netanyahu and his cabinet debated the release for more than six hours, a few hundred protesters, including relatives of those killed by the Palestinian prisoners, gathered outside the prime minister’s office during the vote and waved signs illustrated with bloody palm prints.

Economy Minister Naftali Bennett, the third most powerful politician in Netanyahu’s government, briefly joined the protest and said he is against the release.

“Terrorists should be eliminated, not freed,” he said, according to the Yedioth Ahronoth news Web site.

Bennett called Netanyahu’s move “a mark of disgrace” and tore into the Palestinian leadership. Anyone “who demands the release of people who murdered and burned children and women is not worthy of being called a ‘partner,’ ” he said.

Other members of Bennett’s Jewish Home party stood beside him and said the release was a sign of weakness, not strength, and was done to appease Washington, which they said would never stoop to releasing terrorists.

“We need to act just like the United States. They have no pity for terrorists. But we are asked to be empathetic,” Meir Indor, leader of the Almagor Terror Victims Association, said in an interview. “The Americans shouldn’t ask us to do what they wouldn’t do themselves.”

Yoni Chetboun, a member of parliament from Bennett’s party who was at the protest, told the Jerusalem Post, “A government that ignores its values so quickly just to enter negotiations will not think twice before uprooting settlements.”

What to do about the 360,000 people living in some 150 Jewish settlements in the West Bank is one of the core issues facing negotiators.

Members of Netanyahu’s party also voiced opposition. “I’m disappointed by the stance of our American allies and the West who adopt this twisted idea and see releasing murderers as something that promotes peace, and building a kindergarten as destroying peace,” Deputy Foreign Minister Zeev Elkin said in a statement.

Elkin was referring to U.S. and European opposition to further construction — of schools and houses — in settlements in the West Bank.

Snowden revealed his identity in a Guardian piece published on Sunday. After approaching the media with bombshell revelations about the NSA's secret programs, he left the United States for Hong Kong and holed himself up in a hotel room for three weeks.

The Washington Post reported that a guest by the name of Edward Snowden had been staying at the Mira Hotel, but checked out Monday. It is unclear whether Snowden is still in Hong Kong.

Hong Kong-based correspondents have been trying to hunt him down, staking out a number of hotels that matched the description Snowden gave to the Guardian. The Guardian's Ewen MacAskill reported that ""media scrums"" were forming at hotels in the city, while USA Today described the search as a ""media manhunt.""

Snowden told the Guardian that he chose Hong Kong as a refuge for its ""spirited commitment to free speech and the right of political dissent."" In an interview with the Associated Press, The Guardian's Glenn Greenwald said that Snowden fled to Hong Kong because he ""doesn't really trust the judicial system in the United States to give him a fair trial."" The revelation, however, has sparked speculation about whether his choice was a wise one.

The current treaty between Hong Kong and the U.S. guarantees extradition unless China believes that doing so would hurt ""defense, foreign affairs or essential public interest or policy"" — an exception that some experts say is rare. The New York Times reported Monday that the government is ""seen as likely to extradite"" Snowden if the U.S. requests it to do so, while New York magazine's Joe Coscarelli predicted that China will do what is necessary to avoid a ""diplomatic crisis.""

The New Yorker's Evan Osnos also questioned Snowden's choice, writing that ""going to Hong Kong out of devotion to free speech is a bit like going to Tibet out of a devotion to Buddhism; the people love it, though they live under authorities who intervene when they choose.""

Other experts imagined some scenarios where Snowden might be granted asylum. The Global Post's Benjamin Carlson also reported that Hong Kong is currently changing its procedure for reviewing applications for asylum, which might work in Snowden's favor if asylum seekers are allowed to stay in the city until a new procedure is put in place.

Ironically, a full-page ad in Monday's New York Times touted ""the Hong Kong advantage"" when it comes to business opportunities in the city. ABC News editor Jon Williams tweeted a picture, writing, ""Ed Snowden hoping so."""
http://news.yahoo.com/obamas-syria-caution-shows-washington-uncertainty-170637867.html,,[],Obama's Syria caution shows Washington uncertainty,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama said Friday that any use of chemical weapons by Syria would be a ""game changer,"" but he cautioned that the United States needs more evidence that President Bashar Assad has used the deadly agents against his people.

""We cannot stand by and permit the systematic use of weapons like chemical weapons on civilian populations,"" Obama said in his first comments since the White House disclosed that U.S. intelligence indicates Syria probably has used chemical weapons.

However, the president said more evidence of such use was still needed, including when and how the deadly agents might have been used. He said the U.S., along with the United Nations, would seek to ""gather evidence on the ground"" in Syria to solidify intelligence assessments.

""This adds increased urgency to what already is a significant security and humanitarian problem in the region,"" he said from the Oval Office, where he was meeting with Jordan's King Abdullah II.

The White House said on Thursday that the Syrian government probably had used chemical weapons, most likely the agent sarin, in the two-year civil war that has killed more than 70,000 people and displaced hundreds of thousands more.

Obama's cautious response reflects a lack of agreement in Washington over aggressive military intervention. However, lawmakers in both parties also have expressed concern that inaction could embolden not only Assad but such countries as North Korea and Iran as well.

Obama has declared that the Assad government's use of chemical weapons would cross a ""red line"" for a major military response.

""For the Syrian government to utilize chemical weapons on its people crosses a line that will change my calculus and how the United States approaches these issues,"" the president said.

Emerging from a closed-door briefing with Secretary of State John Kerry on Capitol Hill, House Republicans and Democrats expressed uncertainty about the appropriate next step as the Obama administration considers limited military options.

Story continues

No lawmaker pressed for military invasion by the U.S., after more than 10 years of war in Iraq and Afghanistan.

""It is such a muddled picture,"" said Rep. Hal Rogers, R-Ky., chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. ""I think probably we should be asking the U.N. to be involved. I think perhaps that's in the making.""

Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger of Maryland, the senior Democrat on the House intelligence committee, was among many lawmakers who called for a cautious approach to Syria even as they acknowledged the seriousness of the situation.

""We want to do everything we can to avoid putting boots on the ground,"" he told reporters. The U.S. should work with other countries to stabilize Syria and ensure its chemical weapons are kept out of the hands of terrorist groups, he said.

""I don't think that we, just as the United States, want to go in to another war,"" Ruppersberger said.

Obama's vow that Syria's use of chemical weapons would elicit a strong response and the administration's latest caution could raise questions about Obama's definition of a ""red line."" The U.S. credibility and international authority are on the line in the administration's handling of Syria, and the message it sends to Assad and other nations.

""There's no question that when the United States takes a position that this crosses a line that our failure to respond has implications,"" said Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. ""I think the president was saying the use of chemical weapons is a game changer. I think most people agree with that. So that if we in fact determine that chemical weapons were used, I think the expectation is that we and the coalition and others take some action.""

Rep. John Mica, R-Fla., wondered whether the red line is ""turning into a pink line.""

In Syria, officials rejected the U.S. intelligence assessment and denied that it had used chemical weapons.

Pressed on the response, State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell said: ""If the regime has nothing to hide they should let the U.N. investigators in immediately so we can get to the bottom of this.""

The White House faces a limited choice of military options to help the rebels oust Assad.

Arming the rebels would run into several problems. For one, a military group fighting alongside them has pledged allegiance to al-Qaida. Also, establishing a no-fly zone poses a significant challenge, as Syria possesses an air defense system far more robust than the U.S. and its allies overwhelmed in Libya two years ago.

The next move on Syria was high on the agenda for Obama's meeting Friday with King Abdullah, as the U.S. ally has struggled with the influx of hundreds of thousands of refugees escaping the Syrian violence.

""I think it's important for the administration to look for ways to up the military pressure on Assad,"" said Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., chairman of the Armed Services Committee.

One of the most powerful of the rebel groups in Syria is Jabhat al-Nusra, which recently declared its affiliation with al-Qaida. Last December, the State Department designated the group a terrorist organization, and the administration's opposition to directly arming the Syrian opposition stems from concerns about the weapons ending up in the hands of Islamic extremists.

Arming the rebels, said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., is a ""lot harder that it was before.""

""We've gotten to the point now where the opposition has been affected by the radicals,"" Graham said in an interview. ""Right weapons in right hands is the goal. The second war is coming. I think we can arm the right people with the right weapons. There's a risk there, but the risk of letting this go and chemical weapons falling into radical Islamists' hands is the greatest risk.""

Several lawmakers, including Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., have called for the U.S. to create a narrow, safe zone inside Syria, along its border with Turkey.

Either a safe zone or a no-fly zone would require neutralizing Syria's air defenses. According to a report by the Institute for the Study of War, Syria's largely Soviet-era air defense system includes as many as 300 mobile surface-to-air missile systems and defense systems, and more than 600 static missile launchers and sites.

The U.S. has taken only minimal military steps so far, limiting U.S. assistance to nonlethal aid, including military-style equipment such as body armor and night vision goggles.

The U.S. has deployed about 200 troops to Jordan to assist that country's military, and participated in NATO's placement of Patriot missile batteries in Turkey near the border to protect against an attack from Syria.

But a much more complicated sell was the tough message he delivered in a bold speech on Thursday afternoon, saying that Israel’s future as a Jewish and democratic state was threatened by settlement building and other activities in the Palestinian territories, and calling young people to pressure politicians to advance the peace process. As the words began to sink in, some Israelis wondered if they would be followed by more pressure from Washington.

Individual Israelis and analysts alike said Mr. Obama had hit all the right notes in his internationally televised address and throughout his first visit as president. He cracked jokes, quoted the Talmud and revered Israeli figures, pledged America’s unwavering emotional and financial support while asserting Israel’s right to defend itself, and, perhaps most important, echoed the Israeli narrative of the conflict with the Palestinians.

Joint military exercises had been scheduled for next month

Obama deplores violence in Egypt%2C but does not suspend all aid

Situation in Cairo is complex%2C Obama says

President Obama has canceled U.S.-Egyptian military exercises and suggested that aid cuts could be coming if Egypt's military government does not stop its bloody crackdown on protesters and move quickly to new elections.

He told reporters Thursday that his government ""strongly condemns"" the violence in Egypt. At the same time, however, he said continued U.S. ""engagement"" with the interim government in Cairo will help it transition back to democracy.

""But while we want to sustain our relationship with Egypt, our traditional cooperation cannot continue as usual when civilians are being killed in the streets and rights are being rolled back,"" Obama said from his vacation home at Martha's Vineyard. The death toll now is at least 600.

Some lawmakers and policy analysts are urging the Obama administration to cut off aid to Egypt now.

""While President Obama condemns the violence in Egypt, his administration continues to send billions of taxpayer dollars to help pay for it,"" said Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky, a potential Republican presidential candidate in 2016.

The president did not describe the military's removal of President Mohammed Morsi last month as ""a coup,"" a declaration that would require ending U.S. aid to Egypt that adds up to about $1.3 billion a year.

Obama spoke a day after Egypt's interim government used force to clear encampments created by backers of Morsi. The action triggered violent clashes throughout the country, as the government has declared a nationwide state of emergency and a nighttime curfew.

Calling Morsi's removal an obvious coup, Paul said: ""Mr. President, stop skirting the issue, follow the law, and cancel all foreign aid to Egypt.""

Isobel Coleman, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said a suspension of military aid is long overdue and may the only real leverage the Obama administration has over Egypt.

Obama's cancellation of military exercises is only ""an incremental step that's really too little, too late at this point,"" Coleman said.

The United States and Egypt had joint military maneuvers known as ""Bright Star"" scheduled for mid-September. Obama said they cannot go on given the violence that has claimed so many lives and injured thousands more.

Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said he spoke with his Egyptian counterpart about the canceled maneuvers, and added that ""the United States has made it clear that the Egyptian government must refrain from violence, respect freedom of assembly and move toward an inclusive political transition.""

Obama, who met with his national security team on Thursday, said he has asked aides to assess ""further steps we may take"" if Egypt's interim government does not honor pledges to conduct new elections as soon as possible and restore a democratic government.

""Let me say that the Egyptian people deserve better than what we've seen over the last several days,"" Obama said. ""And, to the Egyptian people, let me say the cycle of violence and escalation needs to stop.""

The State Department, meanwhile, sent out a travel advisory urging tourists to avoid Egypt and to leave the country if they are already there.

The two sides in Egypt are offering vastly different estimates of the death toll. The government says more than 600 have died in the violence; the Muslim Brotherhood, the organization that includes Morsi, puts the death count at more than 2,500.

In his brief remarks to reporters, Obama made clear he does not want to cut ties to Egypt, saying its relationship with the United States ""goes back decades."" The U.S. has long seen Egypt as a bulwark of stability in the Middle East, and treasures its peace treaty with Israel, he said.

Obama applauded the desire of the Egyptian people for freedom and democracy and said he has long known that change would not come ""quickly or easily.

The U.S. also appreciates ""the complexity"" of the current situation in Egypt, he said.

The Morsi government, while democratically elected, ""was not inclusive and did not respect the views of all Egyptians,"" Obama said, noting that millions of citizens supported his removal.

While the interim military government promised a restoration of democracy, Obama said that it has now taken ""a more dangerous path"" that includes ""arbitrary arrests, a broad crackdown on Mr. Morsi's associations and supporters, and now, tragically, violence that's taken the lives of hundreds of people and wounded thousands more.""

In the past, Bright Star military exercises involving the U.S. and Egypt have been held every two years, though the 2011 exercises were canceled because of that year's removal of President Hosni Mubarak.

Bright Star exercises began in 1980, a product of the Camp David Peace Accords. The last time it was held, in 2009, some 5,000 U.S. troops took part, along with military units from Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Jordan, Kuwait, Pakistan, Turkey and Great Britain.

Members of both the interim government and Morsi supporters have accused the Obama administration of supporting the other side, but Obama said the United States isn't taking any side.

""We want a peaceful, democratic, prosperous Egypt,"" Obama said. ""That's our interest. But to achieve that, the Egyptians are going to have to do the work.""

After his speech, Obama played golf at Mink Meadows Golf Club. He is scheduled to return from his week-long vacation on Martha's Vineyard on Sunday.

This report seems to confirm fears that Obama has approached foreign policy in ways similar to those followed by Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Baines Johnson during the Vietnam War. Like JFK, Obama had a brain trust through whom all decisions were “funneled.” And like LBJ, decisions were then made (or not made) based on how they would impact the political climate at home.

According to the report, during Obama’s first term:

The president had a truly disturbing habit of funneling major foreign policy decisions through a small cabal of relatively inexperienced White House advisors whose turf was strictly politics. Their primary concern was how any given action in Afghanistan or the Middle East would play on the nightly news, or which talking point it would give Republicans.

Because this tact was followed, promises of a 2014 troop draw-down have been promulgated to appease Americans who are tired of war. Yet the reality is that an undetermined number of troops, special forces, drones, and operators will remain in Afghanistan long after 2014.

In saying one thing but doing another, the Obama administration has told the American people exactly what they want to hear, just as LBJ did from 1963 until the TET Offensive in January 1968. And because of this, the war in Afghanistan will still be there for the next administration to end, just as LBJ left Vietnam for Richard Nixon to deal with.

As the report says, what is perceived as foreign policy prowess on Obama’s part is really not so much “about accomplishments in Afghanistan or the Middle East” as it is “with how U.S. actions in that region have been reshaped to accommodate partisan political concerns.”"

Kerry arrived in Beijing on Saturday in hopes of turning the Chinese government’s obvious frustration with North Korea’s nuclear program into decisive action.

Kerry’s debut trip to East Asia as secretary has been shadowed by ominous threats from North Korea of nuclear attacks against the U.S. mainland and Washington’s allies in the region.

The Chinese have been unusually vocal in their condemnation of their old communist ally, with many prominent scholars saying it is time to cut the ties forged by Mao Tse-tung back in the Cold War era.

Touching down in Seoul on Friday afternoon, Kerry met with South Korea’s new president, Park Geun-hye, and Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se. Despite some tough talk directed at North Korea, the tone was more conciliatory than in recent weeks, with Kerry and the South Koreans suggesting there was an opening for the government in Pyongyang to return to negotiations over its nuclear program.

“The real goal should not be reinforcing the fact that we will defend our allies, which we will, but it should be emphasizing for everybody the possibilities of peace, the possibilities of reunification, the possibilities of a very different future for the people of the Republic of Korea and ultimately North Korea,” Kerry said, referring to South Korea by its official name.

As Kerry spoke, U.S. and South Korean intelligence were reporting that North Korea had moved as many as five missiles into launch position on its east coast. The most worrisome of them is a new medium-range missile known as the Musudan, which could potentially reach Guam and U.S. bases in Japan.

North Korea’s Kim Jong Un, the world’s youngest head of state at age 30, is hosting festivities this weekend for the April 15 birthday of his grandfather, Kim Il Sung, the nation’s founder. Analysts believe that the missile tests could be timed for the birthday, which is a major public holiday in North Korea.

“It is a huge mistake for him to choose to do that [a missile test] because it would further isolate his country and further isolate his people, who are frankly desperate for food, not missiles,” Kerry said in Seoul.

After weeks of joint military exercises by the U.S. and South Korea, including mock bombing by B-52s and stealth aircraft, there has been an effort to mute the drumbeats of war.

South Korea’s Park was quoted by her aides Friday as saying she was willing to “listen to what North Korea thinks.” Earlier this week, she suggested talks to salvage a jointly run industrial park in Kaesong, just north of the demilitarized zone, which had been a showpiece of inter-Korean cooperation before the North pulled all its workers. Yun, the foreign minister, also said South Korea was open to resuming humanitarian aid to its chronically famished neighbor.

Previous North Korea crises exposed rifts between the United States and South Korea, particularly during the George W. Bush administration, but this time the alliance is holding strong, foreign policy analysts say.

“We are pretty much in agreement about how to deal with them,” said Han Sung-joo, a former South Korean ambassador to Washington. “Together we have a strong defense, but if North Korea shows a change of attitude, both the United States and the Republic of Korea are willing to talk to them.”

The Chinese also have also moved measurably closer to the U.S., South Korea and Japan in condemning North Korea’s belligerence. A poll in Saturday’s Global Times, a Communist Party newspaper, said that 33.9% of Chinese living near the Korean border were afraid of war breaking out. State media has shown images of schoolchildren participating in air raid drills.

But U.S. policymakers want China to be more proactive in using its considerable economic leverage against Pyongyang. North Korea receives most of its fuel oil and consumer goods from China, and trading companies linked to the Pyongyang leadership keep funds in Chinese banks.

Like South Korea, China has a new leader, Xi Jinping, the general-secretary of the Communist Party who was elevated to the presidency last month. Assessing his views of Pyongyang will be a key element of Kerry’s brief visit here.

""It's not a punishment,"" Kerry said. ""It's a reflection of a policy in the United States under our law.""

The move was the culmination of months of debate within the Obama administration about how to respond to the coup that removed Morsy from power.

(Photo by Nikki Kahn/The Washington Post via Getty Images)

Rebel fighters have expressed disdain for US President Barack Obama after he backed away from striking over alleged chemical weapons attacks, saying the world does not care about Syria.

Leaders of two rebel brigades in the northern city of Aleppo, speaking to AFP after agreeing to join forces, also accused Russia and the regime of Bashar al-Assad of conspiring to buy time for the Syrian president to press his campaign against those seeking to overthrow him.

They were speaking as the United States and Russia hammered out a deal, based on proposals by Moscow, to eliminate Syria's chemical weapons by mid-2014 and leaving the door open to sanctions if Damascus fails to comply.

""America told the world it would bomb Syria and then, when the time came, it got scared,"" said Abdelqaderi Asasheh, operations chief of the Liwa al-Tawhid brigade in Aleppo.

The battalion's commander, Abdulaziz Salameh, was even more scathing about the United States.

While accusing Russia and Syria of ""devising a perfect plan to put a stop to an attack by the West,"" he said ""Obama has shown himself not to be a man of honour, without anything to say.""

He added with bravado that ""we don't need the attack. We don't need anyone. We count on the help of God, and he will guide us to final victory.""

However, he said that while ""we can't expect anything from the United States, but if they finally decide to attack we will take advantage of the situation and launch an offensive against the regime's military bases and against the airport in order to take control of Aleppo.""

Abu Tawfiqa, a commander of the Liwa al-Fatah brigade, said ""we don't want an attack, but if it happens the United States will find a very powerful ally on the ground.""

The two brigades held a ceremony on Friday at a former military academy north of Aleppo to mark the agreement to unite their forces, which they claim number 13,000 across the country.

Abu Feras, spokesman for Al-Tawhid, said ""the international community doesn't care what happens to Syria. If it really did it would have intervened a long time ago.""

""The United States and Russia are playing with Syria; we mean absolutely nothing to them. The same is true of the United Nations, which accuses the regime of crimes against humanity and keeps talking and talking, as if that would solve anything. They have been talking for 30 months and done absolutely nothing.""

A man standing nearby, interjected: ""Obama is a liar. He won't keep his word. He said he would attack if Assad used chemical weapons against the civilian population. What more does he need to intervene and put an end to this slaughter.""

Hassan al-Mara, a former school teacher turned fighter, agreed with the man.

""You are right, the West has let us down again. America and Europe have shown that their threats were no more than cheap propaganda.""

Aleppo, once the commercial capital of the country, had been relatively untouched by the Syria conflict which has killed more than 110,000 people since it flared in March 2011.

In summer 2012, rebels seized key districts of the city, and the army has been struggling to recapture them ever since. Hundreds of civilians have been killed in the fighting and relentless regime bombing.

The handover of the base in Wardak province’s Nerkh district to Afghan commandos and army troops removes another source of recent heightened tension between Washington and Kabul.

It came a week after the United States officially — and belatedly — ceded control of its main military prison to Afghanistan following Karzai’s repeated demands. U.S. and Afghan officials had originally agreed to the prison handover last September.

Wardak residents and officials had accused U.S. commandos and their Afghan allies of operating outside the national government’s authority and of torturing, kidnapping and summarily executing Nerkh locals suspected of militancy.

U.S. officials, including the top commander in Afghanistan, Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., have rejected those allegations and had ignored an original deadline set by Karzai for pulling the elite forces from the province. But in the face of mounting public anger and Karzai’s sharp comments, they later agreed to a gradual handover of security responsibility for Wardak to Afghans.

The strategically important and insurgent-plagued province lies some 18 miles to the west of Kabul.

“As we pledged, our forces have transitioned Nerkh District to Afghan National Security Forces and they have now assumed full responsibility for security in this key district,” Dunford said in a statement.

“The rest of Wardak will continue to transition over time as Afghan forces continue to grow in capability and capacity,” the statement said.

Two weeks ago, the government-funded Ulema Council, Afghanistan’s top religious body, warned that the American “infidels” would be treated as invaders if they failed to heed Karzai’s demands.

The pullout of the U.S. commandos coincides with the start of spring, traditionally the beginning of the fighting season in Afghanistan.

The Afghan Defense Ministry said that despite the U.S. elite forces’ departure from Nerkh, the national forces stationed there will rely on U.S. air support when needed.

“We will make the request for air power from them for bombing non-residential areas where the insurgents show up,” the ministry’s chief spokesman, Zaher Azimi, said."

(CNN) —

Explosive new allegations surfaced about embattled Toronto Mayor Rob Ford in court documents released Wednesday – the same day the city council voted to ask him to take a leave of absence.

The court report, more than 500 pages long, alleges a pattern of drug use, and erratic and sometimes abusive behavior by the mayor. A judge ordered the report’s release late last month.

The documents include police interviews with former staff members, information obtained from surveillance crews and cameras, and even an examination of the mayor’s garbage.

The documents were used by Canadian police to get a search warrant for Alexander Lisi, Ford’s friend and occasional driver, whom police accuse of marijuana possession and trafficking.

Several staffers said they were asked to buy alcohol for the mayor. One incident described by a former staffer alleged that Ford, while driving, stopped the vehicle, guzzled some vodka, and drove on.

Chris Fickel, who worked as a special assistant to Ford, said the mayor would ask him to perform odd jobs at his house. Fickel said he would be called “to change light bulbs in the front lawn, change batteries in his children’s toys, buying cartons of cigarettes, bleach, laundry detergent and diet Coke for the mayor’s wife.”

One staffer told police the mayor was inebriated on St. Patrick’s Day in 2012 and got into a physical altercation with two staff members. He alleges the mayor was verbally abusive and inappropriate with a female staff member.

Another staffer said the same night, he saw a woman who may have been an escort or prostitute in the mayor’s office.

Ford’s former press secretary George Christopoulos also said women often came to the mayor’s office, “and told staffers that they have smoked a joint with the mayor on the street outside of the bar. These women were told by the mayor that they could have a job.” Christopoulos would then have to interview these women and try to talk them out of a job.

None of the allegations against Ford has been proven, and he faces no criminal charges.

Ford vows to stay on the job

Despite the Toronto City Council’s motion, the mayor of Canada’s largest city insists he will stay on the job.

Wednesday’s vote is largely symbolic – it does not have the power to force Ford from his post.

The tense council meeting came more than a week after Ford admitted smoking crack cocaine.

Days after that admission, a new video showed a ranting, swearing Ford threatening to kill someone.

Toronto mayor’s rant caught on video

During Wednesday’s meeting, Ford made a further confession to the council.

He said he has purchased illegal drugs within the past two years, while he was in office.

Despite his escalating troubles, Ford insists he has been a good mayor and that voters will decide during next year’s election whether to keep him.

“I have made a mistake. I am human,” he said. “I apologize. I want to move on.”

Ford said that he is being subjected to a “public flogging” and that the experience has been the most humiliating thing in his life, maybe the worst week in his life next to his father’s death.

Despite the admission of drug use and of heavy drinking, Ford flatly denied that he is addicted to alcohol or drugs.

“The reason I drank or did drugs was not because of stress, it was out of sheer stupidity,” he said. “That’s all it was.”

Ford’s brother, Councilor Doug Ford, and other family members have defended the embattled mayor.

On Wednesday, Doug Ford appeared on CNN and blamed the scandal on politics.

“Rob does not come into work drunk,” he told CNN. “He said he’s tried illicit drugs under a drunken stupor.”

“And he’s not doing drugs. And he’s not drinking. So he’s moving in the right direction, in my opinion, but the public flogging, never seen anything like it. This man has apologized profusely. He’s asked for forgiveness, and the rest is sheer politics down here.”

The blacklisting of the airline, Kam Air, is said to have started early this month and was first reported by The Wall Street Journal on Friday. The article quoted American military officials as saying the ban on American military contracts was based on information that the airline had carried “bulk quantities” of opium out of the country as well as within it.

Kam Air officials deny the accusation, and the Afghan government says it has no knowledge of such activities. President Hamid Karzai’s spokesman, Aimal Faizi, demanded that the American military hand over any evidence it had so that the government could act on the charges.

“We have to get to the bottom of this in order to take action,” Mr. Faizi said. “We need evidence and proofs in this regard. We cannot make inquiries based on a newspaper article.”"

Two car bombs targeting Christians killed at least 38 people in southern Baghdad on Christmas.

In Afghanistan, two rounds of “indirect fire” hit the U.S. Embassy compound in Kabul, but no one was hurt.

The incidents highlight the security challenges with which both Iraq and Afghanistan are grappling.

Both countries have had a heavy U.S. military presence until recently.

The departure of U.S. forces from Iraq has done little to curb the near-daily cycle of violence. In Afghanistan, U.S. and Afghan officials are working on an important security pact to outline the future of American troops in Afghanistan.

18 dead in Christmas Day attacks near Iraq churches

Iraq attacks

In Iraq, a car bomb exploded outside a church in southern Baghdad just as worshipers were leaving a Christmas Day service, killing many. In another attack Wednesday, a car bomb went off at an outdoor market where many Christians shop, police said.

Altogether, at least 38 people were killed and some 70 others were wounded, the Interior Ministry said. The bomb outside the church killed 27 and wounded 56. The market attack left 11 dead and 14 wounded.

The U.S. Embassy in Baghdad condemned the attacks – in the Dora area of Baghdad – targeting “Christians celebrating Christmas.”

“The Christian community in Iraq has suffered deliberate and senseless targeting by terrorists for many years, as have many other innocent Iraqis. The United States abhors all such attacks and is committed to its partnership with the Government of Iraq to combat the scourge of terrorism,” according to a statement released by the embassy.

Iraq has experienced an uptick in sectarian violence this year as tensions simmer between the disaffected minority Sunni community and the Shiites, who dominate the government.

The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom notes that many people in small religious minority communities in Iraq, including Christians, have fled the country over the last decade and those that remain are “particularly vulnerable,” facing “discrimination, marginalization, and neglect.”

Sectarian warfare, especially between Sunnis and Shiites, raged during the Iraq War. Half or more of the pre-2003 Iraqi Christian community is thought to have left Iraq, the commission said in its 2013 annual report.

In 2003, there were thought to be 800,000 to 1.4 million Chaldean Catholics, Assyrian Orthodox, Assyrian Church of the East members, Syriac Catholics and Orthodox, Armenian Catholics and Orthodox, Protestants and evangelicals in the country, the group said.

Now, according to community leaders, the estimated number of Christians stands at around 500,000, the report said.

Afghanistan attack

Two rounds of “indirect fire” hit the U.S. Embassy compound in Kabul, the embassy said. No one was injured.

“At approximately 6:40 local time in Kabul, approximately two rounds of indirect fire impacted the U.S. Embassy compound. All Americans are accounted for and no injuries were sustained,” the embassy said in a statement Wednesday. “The Embassy continues to investigate the attack.”

The embassy did not elaborate on what kind of rounds were fired, or where in the compound they landed.

A claim of responsibility was posted on the Taliban’s official website. The group said it fired missiles at the U.S. Embassy and the main base of NATO, which leads the military coalition known as the International Security Assistance Force.

The incident comes at a pivotal time in U.S.-Afghan relations. The two countries are working on an important security pact. The deal will lay out the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan after 2014 when the NATO-led force of some 80,000 troops is scheduled to leave.

This month, U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel was in Afghanistan and said the security pact will be agreed upon despite a failure so far to forge a deal.

http://news.yahoo.com/early-vote-count-iran-gives-rowhani-wide-lead-013630646.html,,[],Early vote count in Iran gives Rowhani wide lead,"TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iran's reformist-backed presidential candidate surged to a wide lead in early vote counting Saturday, a top official said, suggesting a flurry of late support could have swayed a race that once appeared solidly in the hands of Tehran's ruling clerics.

The strong margin for former nuclear negotiator Hasan Rowhani may be enough to give him an outright victory and avoid a two-person runoff next Friday.

Rowhani had just over 50 percent of the nearly 17 million votes tallied, the Interior Ministry reported, well ahead of Tehran Mayor Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf with about 15.3 percent. Conservative Mohsen Rezaei was third with about 12.6 percent.

Minister Mostafa Mohammad Najjar said the final result would be announced by late Saturday. Iran has more than 50 million eligible voters, and turnout in Friday's election was believed to be high.

Many reform-minded Iranians who have faced years of crackdowns looked to Rowhani's rising fortunes as a chance to claw back a bit of ground.

While Iran's presidential elections offer a window into the political pecking orders and security grip inside the country — particularly since the chaos from a disputed outcome in 2009 — they lack the drama of truly high stakes as the country's ruling clerics and their military guardians remain the ultimate powers.

Election officials began the ballot count after voters waited on line for hours in wilting heat at some polling stations in downtown Tehran and other cities, while others cast ballots across the vast country from desert outposts to Gulf seaports and nomad pastures. Voting was extended by five hours to meet demand, but also as possible political stagecraft to showcase the participation.

The apparent strong turnout — estimated at 75 percent by the hardline newspaper Kayhan — suggested liberals and others abandoned a planned boycott as the election was transformed into a showdown across the Islamic Republic's political divide.

On one side were hard-liners looking to cement their control behind candidates such as Jalili, who says he is ""100 percent"" against detente with Iran's foes, or Qalibaf.

Story continues

Opposing them were reformists and others rallying behind the ""purple wave"" campaign of Rowhani, the lone relative moderate left in the race.

The Interior Ministry said Rowhani had 8,439,530 million votes from the 16,716,937 counted so far. Qalibaf trailed with than 2,560,383, and Rezaei had 2,101,330. The other three candidates were further back.

Officials did not say in which parts of the country the ballots were counted. Counts tend to come in first from provincial towns, and Rowhani is thought to be particularly strong in the capital, giving him the prospect of surging further ahead later in the day.

But even if the last-moment surge around Rowhani brings him to the presidency, it would be more of a limited victory than a deep shake-up. Iran's establishment — a tight alliance of the ruling clerics and the ultra-powerful Revolutionary Guard — still holds all the effective power and sets the agenda on all major decisions such as Iran's nuclear program and its dealings with the West.

Security forces also are in firm control after waves of arrests and relentless pressures since the last presidential election in 2009, which unleashed massive protests over claims the outcome was rigged to keep the combative Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in power for a second and final term. He is barred from seeking a third consecutive run.

The greater comfort level by the theocracy and Revolutionary Guard sets a different tone this time. Opposition groups appear too intimidated and fragmented to revive street demonstrations, and even a win by Rowhani — the only cleric in the race — would not likely be perceived as a threat to the ruling structure.

Rowhani led the influential Supreme National Security Council and was given the highly sensitive nuclear envoy role in 2003, a year after Iran's 20-year-old atomic program was revealed.

""Rowhani is not an outsider and any gains by him do not mean the system is weak or that there are serious cracks,"" said Rasool Nafisi, an Iranian affairs analyst at Strayer University in Virginia. ""The ruling system has made sure that no one on the ballot is going to shake things up.""

Yet a Rowhani victory would not be entirely without significance either. It would make room for more moderate voices in Iranian political dialogue and display their resilience. It also would bring onto the world stage an Iranian president who has publicly endorsed more outreach rather than bombast toward the West.

The last campaign events for Rowhani carried chants that had been bottled up for years.

Some supporters called for the release of political prisoners including opposition leaders Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mahdi Karroubi, both candidates in 2009 and now under house arrest. ""Long live reforms,"" some cried at Rowhani's last rally. The rally was awash in purple banners and scarves — the campaign's signature hue in a nod to the single-color identity of Mousavi's now-crushed Green Movement.

""My mother and I both voted for Rowhani,"" said Saeed Joorabchi, a university student in geography, after casting ballots at a mosque in west Tehran.

In the Persian Gulf city of Bandar Abbas, local journalist Ali Reza Khorshidzadeh said many polling stations had significant lines and many voters appeared to back Rowhani.

Just a week ago, Rowhani was seen as overshadowed by candidates with far deeper ties to the current power structure: Jalili and Qalibaf, who was boosted by a reputation as a steady hand for Iran's sanctions-wracked economy.

Then a moderate rival of Rowhani bowed out of the presidential race to consolidate the pro-reform camp. That opened the way for high-profile endorsements including his political mentor, former President Akbar Heshmi Rafsanjani, who won admiration from opposition forces for denouncing the postelection crackdowns in 2009. This, too, may have led to Rafsanjani's being blackballed from the ballot this year by Iran's election overseers, which allowed just eight candidates among more than 680 hopefuls.

Iran has no credible political polling to serve as harder metrics for the street buzz around candidates, who need more than 50 percent of the vote to seal victory and avoid a runoff. Journalists face limits on reporting such as requiring permission to travel around the country. Iran does not allow outside election observers.

Yet it's clear that fervor remains strong for Rowhani's rivals as well.

Qalibaf is riding on his image as a capable fiscal manager who can deal with the deepening problems of Iran's economy and sinking currency.

Jalili draws support from hard-line factions such as the Revolutionary Guard's paramilitary corps, the Basij. His reputation is further enhanced by a battlefield injury that cost him the lower part of his right leg during Iran's 1980-88 war with Saddam Hussein's Iraq, which at the time was backed by the United States.

""We should resist the West,"" said Tehran taxi driver Hasan Ghasemi, who supported Jalili.

Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has not publicly endorsed a successor for Ahmadinejad following their falling out over the president's attempts to challenge Khamenei's near-absolute powers.

Ahmadinejad leaves office weakened and outcast by his political battles with Khamenei — yet another sign of where real power rests in Iran. The election overseers also rejected Ahmadinejad's protege Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei in apparent payback. The usually talkative Ahmadinejad gave only a brief statement to reporters as he voted and refused to discuss the election.

Khamenei remained mum on his own choice even as he cast his ballot. He added that his children don't know whom he backs.

Instead, he blasted the U.S. for its repeated criticism of Iran's clampdowns on the opposition and the rejection of Rafsanjani and other moderates from the ballot.

""Recently I have heard that a U.S. security official has said they do not accept this election,"" Khamenei was quoted by state TV after casting his vote. ""OK, the hell with you.""

Iran's state media hailed the apparently high turnout as a boost for the Islamic Republic's political system.

""A great political epic has shocked the world,"" read a front-page headline in the hardline daily Kayhan Saturday. Khamenei had called for a ""political epic"" on June 14, saying a high turnout would protect Iran against its enemies.

By many measures, this election is far removed from the backdrop four years ago.

Iran's security networks have consolidated near-blanket control, ranging from swift crackdowns on any public dissent to cyberpolice blocking opposition Internet websites and social media. Hackers calling themselves the Iranian Cyber Army disrupted at least a half dozen reform-oriented websites, including one run by well-known political cartoonist Nikahang Kosar.

Prominent reformist politician Mostafa Tajzadeh, who was jailed after the 2009 disputed election, voted from his cell in Tehran's Evin Prison, the semiofficial ISNA news agency reported.

The economy, too, is under far more pressures than in 2009.

Western sanctions over Iran's nuclear program have shrunk vital oil sales and are leaving the country isolated from international banking systems. New U.S. measures taking effect July 1 further target Iran's currency, the rial, which has lost half its foreign exchange value in the past year, driving prices of food and consumer goods sharply higher.

Outside Iran, votes were casts by the country's huge diaspora including Dubai, London and points across the United States.

""I hope we take a step toward democracy,"" said Behza Khajavi, a 29-year-old doctoral candidate in physics from Boca Raton, Florida, as he voted in Tampa for Rowhani.

In Paris, a 25-year-old Iranian student, Sohrab Labib, voted at his nation's consulate while a small group of protesters gathered across the street.

""It's our country. It's our future,"" he said. ""In any case, even a little change could influence our future.""

Jeffrey']",Can Obama Save Turkey From a Syrian Quagmire? - The New York Times,"Turkey’s government believes that unless the balance of power in Syria is tilted in favor of the rebels now, the Syrian conflict will turn into an interminable sectarian civil war that pulls Hatay Province, and with it the rest of Turkey, into turmoil.

Only Washington can change the equation. Following the May 16 summit meeting between Mr. Obama and Mr. Erdogan, two options seem to be on the table.

The infusion of American power, by arming the rebels or enforcing a no-fly zone, would change the military and regional dynamic and help unite the often squabbling “Friends of Syria” behind American leadership. Only direct American military engagement will rally the disparate parties that want to act against Mr. Assad into unified action.

The wars in Kuwait and Bosnia are cases in point in proving the value of American leadership. It would tilt the balance of power in favor of the rebels and provide diplomatic cover for Turkey as it faces the wrath of Iran and Russia. By presenting Moscow with a counter-incentive, threatening to act alone if Moscow does not use its influence to bring an end to the conflict, the United States could demonstrate that it is serious about engagement. This would also lighten the pressure on Turkey, which is hesitant to take further steps in Syria without at least tacit Russian consent. Russia is Turkey’s historic nemesis and the only country in the region with an economy and military larger than Turkey’s. The Turks fear the Russians and will not confront them alone.

If convincing the Russians proves impossible, Washington should consider creating a buffer zone in northern Syria along the Turkish border to protect rebel-captured areas. A buffer zone, protected by American airpower and an international coalition, would endow the rebels with a staging ground from which to launch operations against Mr. Assad and it would also help Turkey push the conflict back into Syria by transferring rebels and their headquarters into the buffer zones on Syrian territory rather than offering sanctuary to militants on Turkish soil. (There would most likely be regional support for such a policy, including from Jordan, which would also benefit from a buffer zone inside southern Syria.)

More decisive American engagement would simultaneously end doubts about the United States’ commitment to Syria and save Turkey from being pulled further into a conflict that threatens to squander its progress toward resolving the Kurdish conflict and undermine its impressive economic achievements."

The new steps came a day after the administration issued sanctions against a top aide of Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and more than 50 other Iranian officials for what it called their efforts to repress dissent and free speech in Iran, where presidential elections are scheduled in two weeks.

Under the increasingly strict sanctions on Iran, the United States freezes any American assets of blacklisted companies and individuals and bans them from doing business with any American companies or citizens. In addition, companies and individuals in other countries who help Iran evade sanctions can be cut off from the American financial system and face other restrictions.

“We are committed to intensifying the pressure against Iran, not only by adopting new sanctions, but also by actively enforcing our sanctions and preventing sanctions evasion,” David S. Cohen, the Treasury Department under secretary whose office oversees the sanctions effort, said in a statement. “Today’s actions take aim at revenues from Iran’s petrochemical sector, as well as deceptive schemes Iran has employed in an effort to evade sanctions on its oil sales and its airlines.”"

Follow Him On Twitter']",Five leadership lessons on Syria and military power for Commander-in-Chief Obama,"President Obama's Saturday speech on Syria (where he decided not to decide) offers at least five fine examples of how not to employ military power.

Consulting with Congress is, of course, exactly the right step to take before committing both U.S. armed forces and the American people to ventures overseas. But, how the president got to this point is a lesson in lousy leadership.

Lesson #1: Surprise is Still a Principle of War. If the president's priority was really to punish Assad with shock and awe, he went about it all wrong. The regime has had plenty of time to get ready--disperse assets; marshal its allies; deploy human shields; and decide how it will respond or preempt US action.

Lesson #2. Red Lines Only Work When They Are Red. The whole idea of a red line is prevent bad behavior by declaring if the line is crossed there will be swift and decisive action.

[pullquote]

More On This...

If President Obama was really serious about holding Assad accountable he should have consulted Congress before he issued a red line--not after.

In all likelihood he didn't because there was a good chance they would have said--no--and well they might.

Intervening in civil wars; getting conclusive evidence about what is going on the ground; and defining clear, achievable, realistic military objectives for punitive strikes is really hard--and the White House had no good answers for addressing any of these issues.

What happens to Obama's next red line, if Congress rejects this one?

Or will Congress have to rubber stamp a stupid red line to preserve the president's credibility? Wouldn't that just encourage Obama to make more reckless red lines in the future?

Did the White House think about any of these questions before it stated making declarations?

Lesson #3. A Shot Across the Bow Only Works if the Enemy Thinks You Are Serious About Sinking Their Ship. President Obama has already declared he won't intervene in the civil war, so any strikes will be little more than a nuisance to a regime that plans to fight to the bitter end.

Lesson #4. Victory Has a Thousand Fathers, Defeat is an Orphan. President George W. Bush had a Congressional authorization for a use of force in Iraq, a UN resolution, popular support for military interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan, and support of a broad international coalition. That mattered little when the wars did not go well.

All the legitimacy in the world will mean nothing--if military action does not turn out well. The president doesn't have a solid game plane for Syria, a resolution from Congress is not a ""get out of jail free card.""

Lesson #5. Think Before You Act. In terms of salvaging the president's shattered credibility as a foreign policy leader turning to Congress won't help.

A wise president would have built a coalition of support before the crisis--not waited for the crisis--then tried to build a coalition. And, failing that, then make it seem like military action is all up to Congress--and the president is just a bystander.

From Obama's perspective, turning to Congress now may seem like a brilliant move. If Congress votes no, he has shown he has empathy with the international community--and he is still a good guy. If Congress votes yes--and it all turns out badly--he will say we are all in this together.

But from the standpoint of acting like the world's leader this may be the nadir of American power.

The reality is that every decision on how to employ the armed forces has turned out badly for Obama.

He ran away from Iraq--the violence there is worse now than when he came into office.

He wants to go to ""zero"" in Afghanistan. The Taliban can't wait for that.

He led from behind in Libya and that failure became a front page story after Benghazi.

Moscow mocks him.

Beijing ignores him.

All these acts as president show Obama has not learned his lessons very well. The Saturday speech just makes his shortfalls as commander-in-chief even more glaringly apparent."

Shane spoke to ""Democracy Now"" host Amy Goodman about the article, which tracked the decision-making process behind the Obama administration's move to kill Awlaki in Yemen. Judging from the sourcing, Shane and two other Times reporters largely crafted their narrative from government officials -- a feature of the story that irked the paper's critics. Among them were Guardian blogger Glenn Greenwald, who called the piece ""standard government stenography,"" and writer Marcy Wheeler, who said it was ""irresponsibly credulous.""

Goodman also read Shane a statement by the ACLU and the Center For Constitutional Rights:

""This is the latest in a series of one-sided, selective disclosures that prevent meaningful public debate and legal or even political accountability for the government's killing program, including its use against citizens. Government officials have made serious allegations against Anwar al-Awlaki, but allegations are not evidence, and the whole point of the Constitution's due process clause is that a court must distinguish between the two.""

In response, Shane said that the Times was not defending the administration.

""I think that press release is a little, perhaps, imaginative in suggesting that the story was defending the administration,"" he said. ""In actual fact, the White House wouldn't talk to us either on or off the record, and we got the information that we could, you know, where we could get it. You know, as the story says, it raises questions about the claims of the administration that this targeted killing program has been precise and very careful in who it targets and who it kills.""

""Democracy Now"" also spoke to Jesselyn Raddack, a government whistleblower who has been strongly critical of the Obama administration.

""The New York Times, here again, gives a platform to the government to justify why it killed three U.S. citizens without charge, counsel or judicial review,"" she said. ""And while Scott just talked about how the article is committed to transparency and neutrality, the article actually picks up a storyline only recently floated by the government, that Awlaki was operational rather than a mere propagandist ... So I feel like The New York Times has been carrying the government's water in picking up its argument and, again, trying to make the case ex post facto that it was OK to kill Awlaki because he was somehow operational.""

E-mails reveal administration officials were behind the crafting of a false narrative on Benghazi

State Department was driving force behind revisions%2C analyst says

Lawmaker wants to know why truth didn%27t come out right away

Dozens of e-mails released by the White House reveal that Obama administration officials were behind the crafting of a false narrative about the attack in Benghazi, Libya. The communications raise questions about who called the shots and why, say an analyst and a lawmaker involved in the investigation.

According to the documents, officials at the State Department, CIA and White House national security staff heavily revised a CIA memo to remove all references to Islamist extremists known to have participated in the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Libya.

The revisions also removed the CIA's claims that the agency had issued repeated warnings to the State Department about the threat of al-Qaeda-linked militants in Benghazi.

Among the unknowns:

•Why were the revisions made?

•Why did Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton testify before Congress that the edits were a product of the intelligence community when State officials had made many of the requests for alterations?

•Why did the White House say it made no substantive edits when the e-mails show officials there helped lead the process for changes?

•Where did the story come from that the attack grew from a protest against an anti-Islam video? The video was mentioned once in 100 pages of e-mails, but it was a central theme of Obama's and Clinton's description of the event.

""It's widely accepted as fact now that what the White House was spewing was demonstrably false,"" says Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, who is on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. ""I think there was clarity in the beginning, but it became obscured by fiction over the course of time.""

President Obama acknowledged during a news conference Thursday that ""there's been intense discussion in Congress lately about the attacks in Benghazi."" He said he is intent on doing everything in the government's power to prevent a similar tragedy, and he is increasing security and military presence at high risk diplomatic posts. Congress should ""come together"" to provide needed funding, he said.

The e-mails from Sept. 14-15 show that the State Department was ""the key driving force for the revisions,"" says Thomas Joscelyn, an analyst with the Foundation for the Defense of Democracy in Washington.

The White House has since acknowledged what the CIA stated from the beginning: The Benghazi attack was a planned terrorist attack.

Chaffetz says many more documents need to be released to explain why the truth didn't come out right away.

Major revisions to the CIA memo were requested by Victoria Nuland, then-spokeswoman for the State Department, who said changes were needed to ""resolve all my issues or those of my building leadership."" The e-mails do not state what leaders she referred to.

Protests to the video ""came to be the central focal point"" of the administration's explanation of how the attack happened, Chaffetz says, but no such protest happened outside the consulate.

Chaffetz says it's ""a mystery that only the White House can clarify.""

Susan Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, used the final version of the CIA memo when she went on talk shows Sept. 16 and blamed the attack that killed U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three others on the protests.

Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, ranking Democrat on the oversight committee, said the e-mails show that State Department and other administration officials altered the memo ""to protect the FBI's ongoing criminal investigation and our nation's intelligence operations.""

He accused Republicans of making ""reckless accusations"" that the White House scrubbed the talking points for political reasons.

Yet another question is why then-CIA chief David Petraeus, who expressed displeasure with the final talking points, did not act more forcefully to prevent the watered down version of his memo from being presented to lawmakers and the public.

""As CIA director, he has an ability to shape the narrative, and if he thinks the narrative is incorrect, he has a duty to speak up,"" Joscelyn said.

Though White House spokesman Jay Carney has insisted the White House made almost no changes to the original memo, the e-mails show that Tommy Vietor, then-spokesman for the White House's national security adviser, wanted State Department concerns about the memo to be addressed.

Members of Congress ""all think it was premeditated based on inaccurate assumptions or briefings. ... We need to brief members/press and correct the record,""Vietor wrote in an e-mail Sept. 14.

Nuland said in e-mails that the CIA memo's references to previous terrorist activity near the consulate and in the region could be construed by Congress as evidence that the State Department ignored the safety of its staff in Benghazi.

The CIA retorted in the e-mails that the FBI ""did not have major concerns"" with the memo's findings. Evidence for its conclusions that the attack was preplanned by an al-Qaeda-linked terrorist group came from the claims of terror group Ansar al-Sharia and witness accounts forwarded by the CIA station chief in Tripoli.

Even top State officials had acknowledged that fact before the process to edit it out began, Chaffetz said.

Chaffetz said one e-mail, which was sent the day after the attack by Beth Jones, State's acting assistant secretary for Near Eastern Affairs, to several high ranking State Department officials, described how she corrected the Libyan ambassador to the United States for suggesting the Benghazi attack may have been perpetrated by loyalists to ousted Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.

Jones wrote to her supervisors, Chaffetz says, that the al-Qaeda-linked Libyan group Ansar al-Sharia was behind the attack."

%27We don%27t take sides%2C%27 Obama says on Egypt

President should form cohesive policy for region%2C critics say

U.S. cancels exercises with Egyptian military

The Obama administration needs to revamp its entire Middle East strategy of remaining impartial in conflicts in Egypt and elsewhere because it risks giving anti-American radicals an opening to take over, analysts said.

""We don't take sides with any particular party or political figure,"" President Obama said Thursday in his first statement on a crackdown by Egyptian police on anti-government protests that left more than 500 supporters of ousted president Mohammed Morsi dead.

Obama canceled exercises with the Egyptian military and encouraged the country's leaders to restore the democratic process, protect peaceful demonstrators and refrain from victimizing minorities.

Obama's message boils down to ""we're just sitting by and watching,"" said Michael Doran, who served as a deputy assistant secretary of Defense and a senior director at the National Security Council under President George W. Bush.

Instead, Obama should jump into the Middle East fray and deal with regional issues that threaten U.S. interests and allies, Doran said.

Rather than focus on peace between Israel and the Palestinians, he should pull together allies in Europe and Persian Gulf states such as Qatar and Saudi Arabia that have propped up the Egyptian economy with multiple billion-dollar cash infusions to formulate a cohesive policy for the region, Doran said.

That means making U.S. aid to Egypt's military and Gulf support to Egypt's general fund conditional on Egyptian leaders adopting a clear path to democracy. To get Gulf states to agree, Obama has to address their concerns in Syria, Iraq and Iran, places where Shiite Muslim forces are warring with Sunni Muslims and where U.S. policy is also lacking, Doran said.

""We have to have a regional strategy that's well run,"" Doran said. ""We're not going to get strategic accommodations with our major partners if we don't have a regionwide approach.""

Obama's foreign policy priorities were perhaps best described June 30 by his then-national security adviser, Tom Donilon, who told CNN that the administration determined ""that we were over-invested in our military efforts in South Asia and in the Middle East"" compared with Asia as whole and set about to reorient its attention elsewhere.

Thursday, Obama pledged to work with Egyptians ""who support a future of stability that rests on a foundation of justice and peace and dignity,"" but he offered no proposals for achieving that goal.

Tamara Wittes, who as deputy assistant secretary of State from 2009 to 2012 coordinated U.S. democracy policy in the Middle East, said the United States should start by encouraging the Egyptian government to immediately take concrete steps toward an inclusive political system and show its sincerity by holding accountable those responsible for Wednesday's killings.

That means ""allowing people who believe they've been treated outside the rule of law to press their cases,"" Wittes said.

Those in power should try again to reach out and compromise with willing opponents among the Muslim Brotherhood or its followers, she said.

Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said the canceled maneuvers are a strong message to Egypt's rulers.

""The United States has made it clear that the Egyptian government must refrain from violence, respect freedom of assembly and move toward an inclusive political transition,"" he said.

Egypt's leaders have demonstrated indifference to U.S. exhortations about democracy and justice. Elliott Abrams, a former deputy assistant to Bush on Middle East issues, said that attitude solidified when the Obama administration failed ""to call a coup a coup"" when a freely elected president, Morsi, was deposed July 3.

That convinced the generals that ""we need them a lot more than they need us"" and that the U.S. president is willing to ignore U.S. law to remain on good terms with them, Abrams said.

The United States has to accept it has very little influence in Egypt and cutting off aid will not cause Egypt's army ""to snap to attention,"" Abrams said.

Instead, the rationale should be ""we're doing this for us, so we have a foreign policy we can sell, that stands up to our moral standards,"" Abrams said. ""You can't turn to an army that just killed 500 mostly unarmed people and say here's your next aid package."""

Last week, Mr. Greenwald concluded a deal with the eBay founder Pierre Omidyar to build a new media platform that aims in part to publicize other revelations from the data Mr. Greenwald now possesses.

The damage to core American relationships continues to mount. Last month, President Dilma Rousseff of Brazil postponed a state visit to the United States after Brazilian news media reports — fed by material from Mr. Greenwald — that the N.S.A. had intercepted messages from Ms. Rousseff, her aides and the state oil company, Petrobras. Recently, the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel, which has said it has a stack of Snowden documents, suggested that United States intelligence had gained access to communications to and from President Felipe Calderón of Mexico while he was still in office.

Secretary of State John Kerry had barely landed in France on Monday when the newspaper Le Monde disclosed what it said was the mass surveillance of French citizens, as well as spying on French diplomats. Furious, the French summoned the United States ambassador, Charles H. Rivkin, and Mr. Hollande expressed “extreme reprobation” for the reported collection of 70 million digital communications from Dec. 10, 2012, to Jan. 8, 2013.

In a statement published online, James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, disputed some aspects of Le Monde’s reporting, calling it misleading and inaccurate in unspecified ways.

He did not address another report by Le Monde that monitoring by the United States had extended to “French diplomatic interests” at the United Nations and in Washington. Information garnered by the N.S.A. played a significant part in a United Nations vote on June 9, 2010, in favor of sanctions against Iran, Le Monde said.

Two senior administration officials — from the State Department and the National Security Council — had arrived in Berlin only hours before the German government disclosed on Wednesday that it had received unspecified information that Ms. Merkel’s cellphone was under surveillance.

Just as hopes emerge for new Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, the official Facebook page of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas’ Fatah political party is lauding a convicted terrorist for killing 61 “Zionists” in a series of attacks.

The two sides' perceptions of Abdallah Barghouti, the bomb-making mastermind behind the infamous 2001 Sbarro attack and at least four other suicide bombings, is as good a measure as any for how far apart they are. Arrested in 2003, Barghouti is serving 67 life terms in solitary confinement in an Israeli prison. But to the party that rules the West Bank, Barghouti is a hero.

""The brave prisoner, Abdallah Barghouti, who has the longest [prison] sentence in the history of the Palestinian cause,"" reads the Facebook page, first reported on by Palestinian Media Watch.

Through its social media presence, Fatah glorifies five of the suicide bombings Barghouti organized between 2000 and 2003, including the attack at a Sbarro restaurant in Jerusalem that killed 15 people on Aug. 9, 2001.

[pullquote]

The bombings were “self-sacrificing activity” and “martyrdom-seeking operations,” according to the Facebook page.

James Phillips, a Middle East analyst at the Heritage Foundation, said he found the posting to be “extremely troubling” ahead of possible peace talks.

“It’s extremely troubling that Fatah, which is purportedly committed to peace with Israel, continues to not only laud past terrorists, but to incite future terrorist attacks at the same time it’s supposedly negotiating the possibility of talks,” Phillips told FoxNews.com. “This just underscores the questionable commitment to genuine peace by Palestinian organizations that some say are ready for peace.”

The posting, Phillips said, is “one more instance” of confusing, sometimes conflicting messages emanating from Palestine.

“It’s another example of Palestinian leaders saying one thing in English that they know Westerners want to hear and another thing in Arabic to their own followers to continue terrorism against Israel,” he continued.

Officials at the Anti-Defamation League said they could not confirm the Facebook page's connection to Fatah, but said the organization has embraced terrorists and anti-semitism before.

“It is disturbing that some elements within the Fatah organization continue to venerate terrorists and acts of terror against Israeli civilians,"" said Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League. ""We hope that through the peace process the United States will make it clear that, as part of any settlement, Palestinian incitement to terrorism must end.”

Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced Monday that he’ll fast-track legislation allowing him to put any peace deal with the Palestinians to a national referendum. Netanyahu made the remarks three days after U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said progress had been made toward a resumption of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, which were stalled for five years.

Kerry has invited Israeli and Palestinian negotiators to Washington for preliminary talks, though wide gaps remain on the framework of the actual negotiations. Netanyahu said Monday that a referendum is necessary to prevent a rift in Israeli society, particularly among hard-liners in his party and coalition government.

Polls have suggested a majority of Israelis support the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel, but many groups are vehemently opposed, including those among Israel's West Bank settlers.

""Any agreement that is not approved by the people is not worthy of being signed,"" Netanyahu said in an announcement from Israel's parliament. On an issue as fateful as a peace deal, ""it is desirable that it be presented to every single citizen to decide,"" he said.

Also on Monday, Abbas reiterated that he would also put any peace deal to a referendum. Speaking to the Jordanian daily Al Rai, Abbas warned that ""all options are open"" if Kerry's efforts fail — an apparent attempt to pressure Israel to accept the Palestinian terms for a resumption of talks.

Palestinian officials have said key issues still need to be ironed out before the actual talks can begin, including a freeze on construction in Israeli settlements. They also want Netanyahu to accept Israel’s pre-1967 war lines and to release dozens of longtime Palestinian prisoners.

Netanyahu has so far refused to start border talks from 1967 lines and has also rejected a settlement freeze.

Phillips said he expects any agreement Israel theoretically signs with Palestine is likely to be “torpedoed” by Hamas within days. He said Kerry would be better served to focus his attention on other pressing U.S. foreign affairs matters, including the ongoing crisis in Egypt, the Syrian civil war and the looming confrontation with Iran regarding its nuclear program.

“It’s just not in the cards as long as Hamas has a stranglehold on Gaza,” Phillips said of peace in the region.

Yemeni officials says al-Qaeda’s branch in the country is focusing on expanding its presence in a remote eastern province that is the ancestral homeland of Osama bin Laden.

Al-Qaeda’s branch in Yemen is focusing on expanding its presence in a remote eastern province that is the ancestral homeland of Osama bin Laden, even as the group remains the target of U.S. drone strikes and Yemeni military assaults, according to Yemeni officials.

Last year, a U.S.-backed Yemeni military offensive drove the militants from the southern province of Abyan, which the fighters had seized during the Arab Spring revolt in the country and controlled for more than a year as they sought to create an Islamic emirate from which to attack the Yemeni government and Western targets.

But in recent months, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP, as the affiliate is known, has bolstered its presence in Hadramaut, the country’s largest province. Hadramaut — which some scholars say roughly translates as “Death is among us” — abuts Saudi Arabia, a key U.S. ally.

“After the ousting of al-Qaeda from Abyan and the fleeing of the armed militants to different areas, it seems that al-Qaeda has shifted its attention toward Hadramaut,” said Ali Alsarari, a political adviser to Yemen’s prime minister, Mohammed Basindwa. “They control some areas and are trying to do what they did in Abyan.”

AQAP’s ambition of creating a new haven in Yemen was underscored this week as the Yemeni government announced that it had foiled a plot by the group to seize Mukalla, the capital of Hadramaut and a vital seaport, and to destroy an oil pipeline and gas facilities. It was the first time, officials said, that AQAP had tried to take over Mukalla.

“It surprised us that they would try to seize the city,” said Rajeh Badi, a spokesman for Basindwa.

The group’s new boldness comes as its ties to al-Qaeda’s central branch in Pakistan and its profile in jihadist circles are growing. AQAP leader Nasir al-Wuhayshi, once bin Laden’s personal secretary, is the terrorist network’s No. 2 leader, after Ayman al-Zawahiri, according to analysts.

The interception last week of a discussion between the two al-Qaeda leaders of a potential attack on Western targets prompted the closure of 19 U.S. embassies and consulates in the Middle East and Africa, as well as a global travel alert. The State Department this week evacuated non-emergency personnel from its embassy in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa. Although the port and pipeline raids were thwarted, U.S. officials said they remain on alert because they think the plot might have been part of a broader plan.

“It’s possible that the plot has been delayed, but the concern remains that AQAP has something in the works,” said a U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.

Drone campaign

The Obama administration considers AQAP among the greatest threats to the United States. The group sent parcel bombs on flights into the United States in 2010 and orchestrated a foiled plot to bomb an airliner over Detroit on Christmas Day 2009. In response, the administration unleashed a campaign of drone strikes across southern and eastern Yemen that has killed AQAP militants but also bred anger and fostered sympathy for the group among many Yemenis.

In light of the growing criticism, the administration had cut back on drone attacks this year. Recently, however, the pace has intensified. On Thursday, two U.S. drone strikes killed nine suspected militants, the Associated Press quoted Yemeni military officials as saying. They were the sixth and seventh such attacks in less than two weeks. Since July 27, drone attacks have killed 31 suspected militants, according to an AP count of the dead based on details provided by Yemeni security officials.

Over the past year, Hadramaut has been a target of airstrikes. From mid-May to December last year, there were seven U.S. drone strikes in the province — about 17 percent of the total such raids in Yemen in 2012, according to the Long War Journal, a Web site that monitors drone attacks. Before May 2012, there were no strikes in Hadramaut. Last week, a strike in the province killed five alleged AQAP militants, according to the Web site.

Portions of Hadramaut have been AQAP bastions for several years, but what is new is the group’s effort to make the province its main stronghold, said Alsarari and other Yemeni officials. Hadramaut, which covers a third of Yemen, is one of the poorest and most geographically inhospitable regions in the Arabian Peninsula, and the highly conservative tribal society there practices a strict form of Islam. Such conditions help AQAP win recruits and sympathy.

Moreover, bin Laden’s clan hails from a region of Hadramaut where clan and tribal loyalties trump national identity, allowing greater protection and shelter for AQAP fighters. The province’s proximity to Saudi Arabia also allows for free flows of militants: AQAP was formed from the merger of al-Qaeda’s Yemeni and Saudi branches in January 2009.

Saleh’s shadow

Yemeni officials insist that AQAP’s takeover of Abyan will not be replicated in Hadramaut, saying that the political and military climate is different now. In 2011, Islamist militants linked to AQAP took advantage of the country’s political turmoil amid the populist uprising and seized control of large swaths of the south, especially Abyan.

The ease of that takeover prompted critics of then-

President Ali Abdullah Saleh to accuse him of purposely losing territory as a tactic to convince the United States, neighboring countries and other allies that instability would result if he stepped down. Saleh’s government had a mixed record on combating extremist groups, sometimes aligning with them to gain power or leverage aid from the West.

After Saleh left office last year under pressure from the United States and neighboring Arab countries, his handpicked successor, Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, launched a major U.S.-backed offensive against the militants and pushed them out of Abyan. Many of the fighters scattered across several provinces, including Hadramaut, while others launched a shadowy insurgency, striking Yemeni military, security and government targets.

Today, Yemeni military officials say they are engaged in a tit-for-tat guerrilla conflict. “As a Yemeni proverb says, ‘One day for you and the other against you,’ ” said Brig. Gen. Ali Saeed Obaid, deputy chief of the general staff in the Defense Ministry. Cooperation with the United States, he added, is closer than ever, and the U.S. drones are a key tool for the Yemeni military.

Last week, Hadi visited the White House to discuss the U.S.-Yemeni efforts to combat the militants, as well as other bilateral issues. But even as the counterterrorism relationship deepens, Alsarari said, his government is concerned about AQAP receiving support “from some of the figures in the former regime” as the group extends its reach in Hadramaut.

Saleh remains in Sanaa, and his loyalists control significant ministries in the coalition government. His critics say he is still a political force, meddling in governmental affairs and fomenting instability. The relationship between Saleh and Hadi is growing tense, Alsarari said. But he added that the fight against AQAP will not be affected.

“The government is now committed for real to fight terrorism,” Alsarari said. “Unlike the former regime, the government now does not see that it has to build any form of relationship with al-

Qaeda to use it to fight any other sides.”

In the final moments before the five-day registration period expired, Rafsanjani and Mashaei arrived via separate entrances at the Interior Ministry, where all would-be candidates were required to sign up by 6 p.m. Saturday.

Their cinematic entrance prompted cheers from rival groups of supporters who had gathered outside. Scuffles then erupted between the two groups, and order was not restored until police responded.

Ahmadinejad accompanied Mashaei, and the longtime friends held their hands aloft in a show of mutual support. Mashaei thanked the departing president, barred by law from seeking a third four-year term, for encouraging him to run.

Despite the theatrics, neither of the two candidates is guaranteed a place on the June 14 ballot. The Guardian Council, composed of senior clerics and jurists, vets candidates to determine who is qualified to run based on a series of criteria.

Also among the those registering Saturday was Saeed Jalili, Iran’s top nuclear negotiator, who is seen as a hard-liner close to supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Other loyalists seeking the presidency include former Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati and Tehran’s mayor, Mohammed Baqer Qalibaf.

More than 400 other would-be candidates filed to run, but most are unknown and destined to be disqualified. Fewer than half a dozen candidates are expected to appear on the ballot.

Still, the presence of either Rafsanjani or Mashaei could significantly heighten interest in the election among a population now more focused on paying bills and finding work than on voting, a sentiment clearly evident in interviews here.

“I feel powerless to change anything,” said Mohammad, a chemical engineer and onetime political activist who now drives a taxi. He asked that only his first name be used to avoid problems with authorities. “I have to think of earning a living.”

Iran for weeks has seen speculation and intrigue about the prospective candidacies of Rafsanjani and Mashaei. Both had maintained suspense about their plans until Saturday. Neither is seen as popular with the conservative ruling Shiite Muslim clerical establishment led by Khamenei, who has the last word on policy issues in Iran.

Mashaei has been vilified in hard-line circles as the leader of a “deviant” current that seeks to undermine clerical authority. He has also been accused of exercising excessive influence on Ahmadinejad. Some critics have even likened Mashaei to Rasputin, the Russian mystic who a century ago developed a powerful hold over the family of the last Russian czar.

Apart from their close political associations, Ahmadinejad and Mashaei are also in-laws; the president’s son is married to his aide’s daughter. The two have known each other for 28 years, Ahmadinejad said Saturday.

Rafsanjani, 78, who served as president from 1989 to 1997, has been viewed as a possible voice of reform against the hard-line clerical establishment. He is generally seen as a moderate, despite crackdowns against intellectuals and dissidents during his presidency.

The June vote is the first since the disputed 2009 balloting, when Ahmadinejad was reelected amid allegations of vote-rigging that triggered street protests considered the nation’s most serious unrest since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Authorities launched a systematic crackdown against the so-called Green Movement.

USA TODAY Sports

Rachel Washburn spent three seasons with Eagles before entering military career

She recently concluded second tour in Afghanistan

Washburn scheduled to be honored Sunday by Eagles

As a Philadelphia Eagles cheerleader, Rachel Washburn toted pom-poms. As an Army intelligence officer with a special ops combat unit in Afghanistan, she carried an assault rifle and pistol. She was a pioneer on a special mission to relate to local women in ways that would be culturally inappropriate for male troops — including helping deliver an Afghan baby in a snowstorm.

Washburn, 25, who recently returned from her second tour in Afghanistan, was honored Sunday night as a ""Hometown Hero"" by the Eagles at their home game against the Chicago Bears.

Cheerleader turned soldier? Did that turn heads when she was in military training or living in a mud hut with Green Berets in a village in Afghanistan?

""Initially, it was kind of a novelty to people I met if they ever found out,"" Washburn said Thursday in a phone interview from Savannah, Ga., where she was on the first day of her post-deployment leave.

""It's kind of a bit of a shock. You don't expect those two things to go hand in hand with one person.""

She didn't join the Army on a whim. During her three seasons with the Eagles, Washburn was an Army ROTC student and history major at Drexel University in Philadelphia. Her father was an Army helicopter pilot and an Air Force fighter pilot. She figures she moved 17 or 18 times growing up, but she calls Philadelphia home even though she just attended college there.

""I am so proud of Rachel and all of her extraordinary accomplishments. She has tremendous courage and has made an amazing impact on the lives of others,"" said Barbara Zaun, Eagles director of cheerleading.

During Washburn's freshman year at Drexel in 2006, she had a friend who was a basketball cheerleader with the Philadelphia 76ers. Washburn loved dancing and thought that would be a ""cool experience."" With her fondness for football, she tried out for the Eagles squad in the spring of her freshman year.

""I knew it was kind of a long shot with all those beautiful, talented women that try out every year,"" she said. ""I just thought, why not? Go big or go home.""

She made the team and cheered for the Eagles from 2007 to 2009. In 2008, she went on a military goodwill tour with the cheerleaders to Iraq and Kuwait. In her case, it also was a military internship.

""ROTC is a very canned version of what the military is going to be. So getting to actually talk to people who are in the military and doing their jobs day in and day out … was very eye-opening,"" she said. ""It was kind of what re-lit the fire and my passion for the military.""

After graduation, she was commissioned a 2nd lieutenant in the Army (she's now a 1st lieutenant stationed in Fort Stewart, Ga.). She went through paratrooper training, but her role was military intelligence.

Prior to her first eight-month tour in Afghanistan in 2011-12, she became part of a new ""Cultural Support Team"" program to attach women to special ops units to relate to Afghan women.

""I was always seen as somebody they could relate to and not this American imposter who brings my values to that country,"" said Washburn, who wore a head scarf when amongst the Afghans.

""We kind of noticed that women everywhere share certain similarities. They obviously care about their home, their children. Women everywhere love pretty things. So if we wore a pretty head scarf, it would be like an icebreaker.""

Near the end of her first deployment, on the day her unit was supposed to leave a village, a snowstorm hit. She and her partner learned a local woman had gone into labor. Her husband was unable to get her to a midwife. The husband did not want male troops to see her.

Washburn and her partner took the woman in a military vehicle to their unit's mud hut. On an Army radio, a special ops medic helped them deliver the baby.

""Everything was successful,"" Washburn said. ""Her husband gave us a little trinket. He was so grateful to have a boy.""

Washburn returned from her second tour in Afghanistan on Nov. 17. In those nine months, she had a different role as a platoon leader of an Army intelligence unit.

She and other women who participated in the Army program in Afghanistan have considered a book. Some kept journals. One is a writer. ""We were the first to ever do anything like that. We bonded so much,"" said Washburn.

According to Washburn, her military awards and decorations include the Bronze Star Medal, Army Commendation Medal, Combat Action Badge, Airborne Badge and Air Assault Badge.

Washburn said she has about a year left in the Army, but she is considering signing on for a few more years. ""There are some opportunities that are enticing me.""

There are issues surrounding women in the military, including opportunities for advancement and sexual harassment

""My eyes have been opened to those issues,"" said Washburn. ""Considering the communities that I have been working in, those issues exist, and I think they're ever present in the media these days with all the changes that the military is pursuing as far as gender equality.

""But with the program that I did in my first deployment, we were part of that change, and nothing motivates me more than being an example of what motivated females can be in the military. I just hope the military continues to progress and that skilled individuals are afforded the opportunities available to them.""

Washburn and the other woman assigned with her the Cultural Support Team with their unit in Afghanistan lived in a mud hut with the males.

The two women had a separate living area. ""It was a pretty big hut,"" said Washburn. ""So we had our own female quarters, which was nice.""

It would be incorrect to say Washburn traded her white cheerleader boots for combat boots. The Eagles cheerleaders wear uniforms designed by Vera Wang. But for dancing purposes they wear designer Gant sneakers.

""I like to think it's because we were more athletic and did more complicated routines,"" said Washburn.

She added that cheerleaders – like women in the military – should not be labeled with stereotypes.

""The woman I met in cheerleading were all incredibly intelligent, ambitious women,"" she said."

About 70%25 of South Koreans say the government should develop a nuclear bomb

The U.S. guarantees to defend South Korea if attacked

North Korea may soon be able to strike the U.S. homeland

Increasing tensions on the Korean Peninsula over North Korea's nuclear ambitions and provocations are pushing more South Koreans to raise the once unthinkable: developing their own nuclear deterrent, analysts said Monday.

South Korean lawmaker Chung Mong Joon of the governing Saenuri, or New Frontier Party, indicated that the South may have to look into a nuclear deterrent given that North Korea is acting like ""a gangster.""

The South Korean newspaper Joong Ang Ilbo suggested in an editorial that the U.S. ""nuclear umbrella"" may not be enough. Although the South is a signatory to the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons treaty, which means the country cannot legally develop nuclear weapons, the newspaper says the North's threats mean new defenses must be considered.

""Nuclear weapons can be stopped only with nuclear weapons, as in the mutual assured destruction that prevented a nuclear conflict during the Cold War,"" it said.

Bruce Klingner, former deputy chief for Korea in the CIA's Directorate of Intelligence under President Bill Clinton, says a nuclear South is a ""non-starter.""

A nuclear-armed South Korea could cause Japan, a U.S. ally that has tense relations with South Korea, to go nuclear, too, creating unnecessary instability in the northeast Asia region, Klingner said. Besides, he said, South Korea since the end of the Korean War in 1953 has had the same assurances that the United States would defend it that Western Europe has had since the end of World War II.

""We are bound to defend South Korea by all means necessary,"" Klingner said. ""You can question whether any individual president would trade New York for London or Los Angeles for Seoul, but the guarantee is that we would do so.""

Tokyo member of parliament Shintaro Ishihara of the Japan Restoration Party has said Japan should have nuclear bombs to counter China and North Korea. Though its constitution restricts Japan's ability to possess certain weaponry, recently elected Prime Minister Shinzo Abe supports revising the document to allow for more military defenses.

Over the weekend, North Korea canceled an armistice agreement that has been in place nearly all of the 60 years since the end of the Korean War. It said it would cut ties such as a telephone ""hotline"" between the North and South that can be used in times of crisis.

This comes a week after the North threatened a pre-emptive nuclear strike on the USA and all-out war with the South over stricter sanctions passed last week by the United Nations Security Council to punish North Korea for its third test of a nuclear weapon in February and missile tests.

Heightened tensions continue this week as U.S. and South Korean forces engage in a joint military exercise. North Korea's military is holding drills of its own near the line that demarcates North from South. Both sets of exercises are an annual event.

When such a large grouping of military forces are in close proximity to each other, ""there's an increased opportunity for a clash,"" Klingner said.

Despite his belief that a nuclear South is a bad idea, Klingner agreed that North Korea's steady progress toward developing a deliverable nuclear weapon is causing South Korean attitudes to harden.

About 70% of South Koreans say their country should develop its own nuclear deterrent, according to several polls. Several columnists and conservative politicians are questioning whether they can count on the United States to risk a nuclear attack if it comes to the South's defense in a nuclear contest, he said.

Bruce Bechtol, a former China and Korea analyst at the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency who teaches at Angelo State University in Texas, said South Koreans are probably right about one thing: Even in the case of a North Korean nuclear attack on the South, the United States would be unlikely to respond with in kind, Bechtol said.

South Korea is under the U.S. nuclear umbrella, but the best response to an attack would probably be with conventional weapons, Bechtol said.

""If we're fighting a war with North Korea, the end state of that war would be a unified country with a capital in Seoul,"" Bechtol said. ""If we used nuclear weapons, we'd be creating a mess that the South Koreans would have to deal with. ... My guess would be that the (South Korean) government themselves would want us to use nuclear weapons as a last option.""

South Koreans pushing for their own nuclear capability ""are anticipating the day when North Korea can hit the continental United States with nuclear weapons,"" says Richard Bush, who served as an East Asia specialist in the National Intelligence Council under Clinton.

They're asking, ""Is the United States willing to sacrifice San Francisco if deterrence fails?"" Bush said. ""This is the same logic that led Great Britain, France, China and Israel to want their own deterrent.""

The South's conservative new president, Park Geun Hye, has not advocated following the nuclear path, but she promised to respond ""exponentially"" to any North Korean attack. South Koreans were unhappy with her predecessor's restraint in 2010, when North Korea sank a South Korean patrol ship, then shelled the South's Yeonpyeong Island, killing four people.

Park's promise to deliver a non-proportional response to future provocations from the North is a departure from past practice and could result in war because the North's reaction is impossible to predict, Klingner said.

""If you respond, you are unsure how your opponent will respond,"" he said. ""Will he call it even or will he then raise the stakes?"""
